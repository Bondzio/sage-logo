<p>This study tested the “city air” hypothesis, which posits that the social constraints prevalent in rural life are weaker in metropolitan areas, freeing metropolitan residents from pressure to suppress their pursuit of individual goals. To do so, we replicated Yamagishi et al.’s vignette study of pen choice. In the first study using a web-based survey of 821 respondents from all prefectures in Japan, choice of a unique color pen was the highest among respondents from metropolitan areas, while respondents from non-urban prefectures were less willing to choose the unique pen. The second study with 1,398 respondents from Tokyo and rural Japan confirmed the findings.</p>

<p>The medieval saying “Stadtluft macht frei” or “City air brings freedom” epitomizes the spirit of equality and freedom enjoyed by urban as opposed to rural dwellers. Freedom from the social constraints pervasive in traditional rural communities is generally considered a pre-condition for the development of individualistic values and behaviors, captured by the concept of Gesellschaft as compared to Gemeinschaft. More recently, culturally oriented psychologists have argued that freedom from various forms of social constraints, which characterizes metropolitan living, has promoted the view of the self as an internally driven rather than externally constrained agent. Using this theoretical framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111415407">Kashima et al. (2004)</xref> compared residents of urban and rural areas in both Australia and Japan and found that metropolitan residents are indeed less collective in their self-conceptions than residents of rural cities. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111415407">Matsumoto, Willingham, and Olide (2009)</xref> found that individuals from less urban countries were more likely to mask their emotional expressions than those from urbanized countries.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022022111415407">
<title>The City Air Hypothesis</title>
<p>In the social ecology of traditional rural living, individuals who deviate from community norms are likely to be identified and reprimanded or ostracized by fellow community members. As a result, rural dwellers are constrained more strongly by expectations from community members than individuals living in urban settings where individual behavior is monitored and constrained to a lesser degree. Such differences in social ecology can be observed not only between cultures but also between various niches within each culture—such as between metropolitan and rural communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111415407">Kashima et al., 2004</xref>), social classes (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111415407">Snibbe &amp; Markus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111415407">Stephens, Markus, &amp; Townsend, 2007</xref>), and professionals and manual laborers. In this study, we examine the psychological implications of metropolitan and rural life. Since more opportunities for alternative jobs and personal relations are available in metropolitan rather than rural areas, metropolitan city dwellers are expected to be less concerned about the social implications of their behavior.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022022111415407">
<title>Preference for Uniqueness</title>
<p>In order to test the city air hypothesis, we sought to replicate the scenario version of the pen choice study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi, Hashimoto, &amp; Schug, 2008</xref>), based on a study originally conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111415407">Kim and Markus (1999</xref>; Study 3). We focused on this task because behavior in the pen choice task is known to be sensitive to cues of monitoring by others, the lack of which is the most critical feature of the city air hypothesis. In the original study by Kim and Markus, experimenters asked travelers at an international airport to fill out a short questionnaire. As a token of their appreciation, they offered the travelers a choice of one of five pens to take home with them. The pens came in two external colors, in which the color ratio of unique to majority pens was either 1:4 or 2:3. Compared to East Asians, Westerners were more likely to choose unique pens. Kim and Markus interpreted this finding in terms of cultural differences in self-construal, arguing that Western participants’ choice of a minority color pen reflected their independent self-construal including the preference for uniqueness, while East Asians’ choice of a majority color pen reflected their interdependent self-construal, including the preference for conformity.</p>
<p>In response to this interpretation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi et al. (2008)</xref> provided an alternative interpretation of the Asian “preference” for conformity, arguing that the choice of the majority pen could be understood as an adaptive strategy tailored to particular social ecologies in which exclusion from collectives can cause serious consequences. They argued that the Asian travelers who chose majority pens in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111415407">Kim and Markus’s (1999)</xref> study were not necessarily driven by an intrinsic preference for conformity, but instead may have refrained from taking a pen which they actually preferred—a unique color pen—because they anticipated that others might respond to them negatively for selfishly choosing a pen without regard to others. To provide evidence for this alternative explanation, Yamagishi et al. conducted an experiment in which American and Japanese participants were presented with a set of scenarios. In each scenario, participants were asked to imagine that they were to fill out a questionnaire and had been offered a choice of one of five pens to take home as a token of appreciation. Four of the pens were of the same color, and the remaining one was of a different color. Participants were asked to indicate which pen they would choose. In the first, default scenario, in which they were simply asked to choose a pen, Yamagishi et al. succeeded in replicating the finding that Americans preferred unique pens more than Japanese. However, this cultural difference completely disappeared in the “last choice scenario” in which participants were asked to imagine that they were the last person to choose a pen, implying that their choices had no consequences for others. In this scenario, Japanese participants chose a unique color pen just as frequently as Americans. But when it was clear that the participant’s choice would be monitored and evaluated by others—in the “first choice scenario,” in which the participant chose a pen in front of others, who would later choose a pen from the same set—even Americans avoided choosing the unique color pen, just like Japanese participants. The only cultural difference in pen choice emerged in the first, or “default,” scenario, in which presence or absence of social implications was not clearly defined.</p>
<p>If we accept Yamagishi et al.’s argument, which echoes the city air hypothesis mentioned previously, the cultural difference in pen choice between East Asians and Westerners in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111415407">Kim and Markus’s (1999)</xref> study should also be observed between metropolitan and non-metropolitan (rural and regional city) residents. We tested this prediction by comparing the responses of residents of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas of Japan to the pen choice scenario.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<sec id="section4-0022022111415407">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were self-selected from a pool of about 1.3 million potential responders registered at an Internet-based Research Site (www.cross-m.co.jp/research/internet). The survey agency (Cross Marketing) sent out email messages to potential participants soliciting their participation with monetary incentives. Participants were stratified by age range and gender, such that a roughly equal number of men and women participated for each age range. A total of 821 individuals (409 male and 412 female, ages 20 to 69) from all 47 prefectures of Japan participated in the study. We oversampled participants from Hokkaido (<italic>n</italic> = 241) and Kyoto (<italic>n</italic> = 108) prefectures in order to test the “frontier spirit” hypothesis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111415407">Kitayama, Ishii, Imada, Takemura, and Ramaswamy (2006)</xref>, by comparing Kyoto and Hokkaido residents. Tokyo, Osaka, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Aichi prefectures were classified as the metropolitan areas (<italic>n</italic> = 263). The remaining 40 prefectures (excluding Hokkaido and Kyoto) were regarded as non-metropolitan areas (rural areas and regional cities) (<italic>n</italic> = 209). The urbanization index (i.e., the percentage of urban residents in the total prefectural population) was the highest in the metropolitan prefectures (86.9%), followed by Kyoto (81.7%) and Hokkaido (73.0%) prefectures. The urbanization index was much lower in the non-metropolitan prefectures (45.0%).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022022111415407">
<title>The Questionnaire</title>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section asked the participant’s gender, age, level of education, prefecture of residence, prefecture of birth, and the prefectures where their father and mother were born and raised. The second section included three scenarios adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi et al. (2008)</xref>—the default scenario, the first choice scenario, and the last choice scenario—as well as related questions. In each scenario, participants were asked to imagine that they had the opportunity to choose one of five pens, four of which were of one color (majority color pen), while the remaining pen was of a different color (unique color pen). In the first scenario (the “default” scenario), no additional information was provided. In the second scenario (the “first choice” scenario), participants were told that they were the first person of a group of five to choose a pen. In the third scenario (the “last choice” scenario), participants were told that they were the last person to choose a pen. The order of the three scenarios was fixed for all respondents. After participants read the description of each scenario, they were asked which pen they would choose to take home. Participants chose from the following four options: (1) I would choose one of the four pens of the same color; (2) I would probably choose one of the four pens of the same color; (3) I would probably choose the pen of distinct color; and (4) I would choose the pen of distinct color.</p>
<p>The third section of the questionnaire included supplemental questions asking about the setting in which participants accessed the Internet site and filled out the survey, as well as the degree to which they clearly understood the questions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111415407">Figure 1</xref>, metropolitan residents were more likely to report that they would choose the unique pen (<italic>M</italic> = 2.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.93; 1 = <italic>majority pen choice</italic> and 4 = <italic>unique pen choice</italic>), closely followed by Hokkaido residents (<italic>M</italic> = 2.65, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.94). Respondents from non-metropolitan areas and the Kyoto prefecture were less willing to choose a unique pen (<italic>M</italic> = 2.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.93, and <italic>M</italic> = 2.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.91, respectively). The main effect of the four regions was significant, <italic>F</italic>(3, 817) = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .01, as was the main effect of the scenarios, <italic>F</italic>(2, 1634) = 36.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .04, in the Region × Scenario ANOVA.

</fig>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi et al. (2008)</xref>, respondents in this study chose the unique color pen more often in the last choice condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.10) than in the first choice condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.14), <italic>t</italic>(820) = 7.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. A unique finding in this study is that respondents chose the unique color pen more often in the default scenario (<italic>M</italic> = 2.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06) than in the first choice scenario, <italic>t</italic>(820) = 4.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, although the default scenario was lower than the last choice scenario, <italic>t</italic>(820) = 4.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, as in the other studies. In this sense, responses in this study fell between the pattern shown by Hokkaido University and University of Michigan students in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi et al.’s (2008)</xref> study. The increased choice of unique color pen choice in the default choice scenario compared to the first choice scenario may reflect a stronger sense of anonymity inherent in the Internet environment, which may have caused respondents to be less concerned about the social implications of their choices in the default condition.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022022111415407">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As predicted by the city-air hypothesis, metropolitan residents were more willing than those from non-metropolitan Japan to choose the unique pen. While Hokkaido residents showed a stronger preference for uniqueness than Kyoto residents, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111415407">Kitayama et al.’s (2006)</xref> frontier spirit hypothesis predicts, the difference was not unique to the Hokkaido-Kyoto contrast. While using Hokkaido samples as a representative Japanese culture has been criticized because Hokkaido has been suggested to be uniquely independent compared to the rest of the Japan (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111415407">Kitayama, 2010</xref>), this study shows that Hokkaido residents are not unique in their preference for uniqueness when compared to metropolitan residents. Instead, Kyoto was found to be an outlier in this respect; while Kyoto is a metropolis, Kyoto residents were found to be similar to non-metropolitan residents in their choice of the majority pen. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111415407">Kitayama et al.’s (2006)</xref> finding concerning Hokkaido and Kyoto residents may thus be attributed to the uniquely interdependent nature of Kyoto residents as compared to Tokyo and other metropolitan residents, rather than features of Hokkaido residents.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0022022111415407">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>While the findings of the first study generally support the city air hypothesis, the use of a scenario method combined with the within-participants manipulation of the choice scenarios may potentially create demand characteristics by causing participants to pay attention to the situational differences. This potential problem was acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111415407">Yamagishi et al. (2008)</xref>, who provided supplemental data to demonstrate that the same effect was replicated when the choice scenarios were manipulated between participants. Furthermore, the difference between the first and the last choice conditions was later replicated in a laboratory setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111415407">Hashimoto, Li, &amp; Yamagishi, 2011</xref>) in which only 7% of the first choosers chose a unique pen compared to 48% of those who chose last. While these findings strongly suggest that situational differences observed in the pen choice scenario are not artifacts caused by the scenario method, we further conducted a second study using a between-participant manipulation of the scenarios to allow us to make a firmer conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p>The second purpose of the second study is to address the issue of the lack of the Region × Scenario interaction in the first study. This null result prevents us from drawing a clear conclusion, as the city air hypothesis predicts regional differences only in the default scenario, not in the first or the last choice scenario. We suspect that the strong sense of anonymity of the Internet environment weakened the rural residents’ concerns for social implications of their behavior. Thus, we replicated the Web-based study while adding pictures of other people to strengthen the responders’ social concerns. In the default scenario, a picture of people who were filling out a questionnaire was displayed. In the first choice scenario, a picture of four people sitting around a table looking toward the camera was displayed. In the last choice scenario, an empty table with no people around, suggesting that all the other people have gone away, was displayed.</p>
<p>In order to make the contrast between metropolitan and rural areas, we chose respondents from Tokyo (<italic>N</italic> = 663) and the three least urbanized prefectures of Japan (Iwate, Shimane, and Saga; <italic>N</italic> = 735). The rural sample was further broken into residents of the prefectural capitals (Morioka, Matsue, and Saga, respectively; <italic>N</italic> = 417) and those from the rest of the respective prefectures (<italic>N</italic> = 318). Among the total 1,398 responders, 24 (1.72%) responders who answered “Did not understand at all” to the question “Did you understand the questions in this survey?” were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Results of the second study provided clear support for the city air hypothesis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111415407">Figure 2</xref> shows the average willingness to choose a unique pen and the proportion of those who chose either “I would definitely choose the pen of a unique color” or “I would probably choose the pen of a unique color.” As predicted, the regional difference emerged only in the default scenario. Tokyo residents chose the unique pen most frequently (49.1%; 104/212), closely followed by the residents of prefectural capitals (49.0%; 71/145). The choice of the unique pen by the residents of the rest of the least urbanized prefectures was much lower (29.3%; 29/99). The difference was highly significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 11.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The regional difference in the choice of the unique pen did not emerge either in the first choice scenario (39.0%, 36.3%, and 39.3%, respectively by Tokyo, prefectural capital, and rural residents), χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 0.31, <italic>ns</italic>, or the last choice scenario (53.6%, 54.1%, and 55.6%), χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 0.11, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>

<p>The effect of the scenario was also highly significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 24.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. The rural residents chose the unique pen as infrequently in the default scenario as in the first choice scenario (29.3% and 39.3%) and much less than the last choice scenario (55.6%). For both the Tokyo residents and the prefectural capital residents, their choice of the unique pen in the default scenario (49.1% and 49.0%) was in between the first choice scenario (39.0% and 36.3%) and the last choice scenario (53.6% and 54.1%). This interaction was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 9.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and provides clear support for the city air hypothesis, which predicts that the city air frees people from the social constraints dominating rural life.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022022111415407">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>City air brings freedom. This assertion was confirmed by the results of two studies. Residents of Tokyo and prefectural capitals chose a unique pen more frequently in the default situation, and only in the default situation, than residents of less urbanized areas. Furthermore, residents of other metropolitan areas including Hokkaido were more willing to choose a unique pen than those from the rest of Japan. Kyoto, a prefecture which is itself a metropolitan area but has maintained a stable population size for the last 60 years, fell somewhere in between metropolitan areas, on the one hand, and non-metropolitan areas, on the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111415407">Kitayama et al. (2006)</xref> characterized Hokkaido as the frontier of Japan where the ethos of independence is engendered and nurtured by migrants who settled in a harsh natural environment one and a half centuries ago. The results of the current study, however, suggest that there is nothing unique about Hokkaido residents regarding their preference for uniqueness, compared to residents of other major metropolitan areas totaling about half of Japan’s entire population.</p>
<p>The current study demonstrates the presence of within-culture regional differences and suggests the need for caution when using a sample from one particular region as representative of the entire culture. One sensible approach to this issue is to delineate the nature of social ecology in which a particular group of people—be it a specific region, social class, or gender—find themselves. Specifying the particular social ecology, which Yamagishi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111415407">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111415407">Yamagishi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111415407">Yamagishi &amp; Suzuki, 2009</xref>) refer to as an “institution,” and analyzing how cultural tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111415407">Kitayama, Park, Sevincer, Karasawa, &amp; Uskul, 2009</xref>) or adaptation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111415407">Yamagishi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111415407">Yamagishi &amp; Suzuki, 2009</xref>) shape human cognition and behavior will be a productive direction for future research in culture and psychology.</p>
<p>While we focused on one such socio-ecological factor, which we refer to as the “city air,” we acknowledge that this concept may be too broad to identify the particular aspects of social ecology that are associated with metropolitan life. The next stage of research is to identify the particular aspects of urban life that free people from social constraints. Research programs that specifically examine the impact of different types of mobility, such as relational mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111415407">Schug, Yuki, &amp; Maddux, 2010</xref>), residential mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111415407">Oishi, 2010</xref>), and occupational mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111415407">Chen, Chiu, &amp; Chan, 2009</xref>), can be important avenues through which the conflict between the strength of social constraints and the pursuit of individual goals is to be understood.</p>
