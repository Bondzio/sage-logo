<abstract>
<p>Encopresis is a medical condition that is associated with incontinence in children. It leads to frustration and anxiety in both parents and children due to the presenting symptoms and the inability to control elimination patterns. There is overwhelming concern among families that a child with encopresis will be ostracized from peers and will suffer long-term psychological effects. It is therefore important to define encopresis to include the etiology, prevalence, and treatment measures in order to ensure a positive outcome. In addition, as a child enters elementary school, the school nurse plays a vital role in assisting the child to reach educational goals and managing health concerns. This article will guide the reader through the origin and diagnosis of encopresis as well as the principles of management. It will also delineate the school nurse role in managing encopresis in the school setting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The number of pediatric cases of constipation referred to a gastroenterologist has nearly doubled in the past decade and emergency room visits due to constipation have also increased resulting in a financial burden of $3.9 billion dollars per year in caring for children with constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511429685">Philichi &amp; Yuwono, 2010</xref>). Constipation in children is frequently a common problem that generally does not lead to any significant impairment but is often unrecognized, thus delaying early intervention and treatment. It is important to recognize that constipation is not a disease, but rather it is a treatable medical condition that accounts for 3% of the pediatric population and 30% of referrals to a pediatric gastroenterologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429685">Culbert &amp; Banez, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Chronic constipation can lead to a condition known as encopresis which is a term used to describe involuntary or intentional soiling of feces in improper places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511429685">Coehlo, 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, encopresis presents with a great deal of frustration from parents along with feelings of embarrassment in children. Furthermore, children with this medical condition are often taunted, bullied, and ostracized from their peers, which results in low self-esteem and decreased academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>). Because of the consequences of untreated encopresis, it is imperative that children receive interventions, particularly in the school setting, as outlined and established. The purpose of this manuscript is to define encopresis and discuss its etiology, discuss diagnosis and treatment, and describe the vital role of the school nurse in assisting children and families with managing this medical condition.</p>

<title>Etiology</title>
<p>Constipation, defined by stool consistency and frequency, can be a very common childhood condition that will often lead to fecal incontinence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429685">Dobson (2009)</xref> further defines constipation as when a child has experienced two or more of the following characteristics:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>less than three bowel movements per week;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>more than one episode of fecal incontinence per week;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>presence of large stool in the rectum;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>production of large stools that obstruct the toilet;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>indication in the child’s posture and behavior that stools are being withheld.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Encopresis is the term used when a child, developmentally over 4 years of age, has chronic constipation that leads to involuntary soiling of predominately loose stool. Encopresis occurs in 2.8% of 4 years old, 1.9% of 6 years old, and 1.6% of 10–11 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429685">Philichi, 2008</xref>). There is some evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between encopresis prevalence and psychiatric problems as well as behavioral and emotional disorders. For example, in a study of children with autism, it was reported that 10–20% of those children had problems with encopresis, and children with bipolar disorder were also found to have higher incidences of fecal soiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429685">Hardy, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, children with emotional and behavioral problems such as attention problems, obsessive and compulsiveness and oppositional behaviors have higher incidences of reported fecal soiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429685">Hardy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Encopresis is defined as either primary or secondary. Primary encopresis is stool soiling that occurs before a child has ever achieved fecal continence, while secondary encopresis refers to soiling after fecal continence was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>). Encopresis is further described as being either functional or nonfunctional. Functional encopresis is when a child has repeated episodes of fecal soiling that is not as a result of any organic defect, and it accounts for 90% of chronic encopresis. It is associated with painful bowel movements that have resulted from withholding behaviors that become automatic over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511429685">Table 1</xref>
). The child can sometimes go more than a week without having a bowel movement which may result in seepage around the large impacted stool. At times parents will often confuse this with their child experiencing diarrhea. Children can experience functional constipation as a result of diet, illnesses, stress, or attention disorders that make it difficult to concentrate on having a bowel movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429685">Philichi, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Nonfunctional encopresis is related to congenital defects, anorectal anomalies, or organic causes and accounts for approximately 5–10% of fecal incontinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>). Hirshchprung’s disease is an example of a congenital disease and is a cause of nonfunctional encopresis. This disease is defined as a blockage in the large intestine at birth that is caused by a lack of nerves that trigger bowel contractions. Another example of organic encopresis is anorectal abnormalities in which malformations range from minor to complex. These are usually a result of incorrect development in utero which may result in malformations of the anus, urogenital tract, or the lower rectum. Other conditions such as hypothyroidism, metabolic conditions that lead to water depletion, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease are causes of nonfunctional encopresis that should be considered in determining a diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429685">Philichi, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511429685">
<title>Assessment and Diagnosis</title>
<p>When encopresis is suspected, a comprehensive and thorough health history and physical examination are necessary to determine what treatment will be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511429685">Coehlo, 2011</xref>). The health history should include the onset of symptoms as well as a clear understanding of how the parent defines constipation. Information regarding stool consistency and frequency as well as pain with bowel movements needs to be provided. Such behaviors such as straining or withholding are also noted. In addition, the health history should provide answers to questions such as dietary practices, nutritional status, activity levels, and current medication. The health care provider should assess interpersonal relationships within the family to determine who is significantly involved with the child (i.e., siblings, grandparents, or child care providers), which may reveal the emotional and interactive atmosphere within the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511429685">Reid &amp; Bahar, 2006</xref>). Questions regarding the school environment are also assessed and include scheduled toileting breaks, bathroom accessibility, and classroom accommodations. Lastly, toilet training techniques used by the parents and the availability of a bathroom at home that is comfortable, clean, and private are also assessed, as these may contribute to withholding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511429685">Mason, Tobias, Lutkenhoff, Stoops, &amp; Ferguson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The next part of the assessment for encopresis includes a complete physical examination. The examination needs to include a general evaluation of the child’s growth and development and gait patterns as unsteadiness would warrant further investigation. The lower back and spine are examined for congenital defects as well as boney irregularities. Dimpling or a hairy patch would be indicative of anal stenosis (the anus is tight or wrongly positioned on the perineum), and spina bifida, a congenital neurological tube defect resulting in incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511429685">Mason et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The abdomen is assessed for distention, history of pain, and auscultation of bowel sounds; however, this cannot always be conclusive if the child has routinely been taking stool softeners. If, during the abdominal assessment, there was a detection of a large fecal mass, it would be an indication of impaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511429685">Table 1</xref>). A plain abdominal x-ray is sometimes ordered but is not routinely required due to the potential dangers of subjecting children to radiation and because constipation can usually be diagnosed by history and examination alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429685">Dobson, 2009</xref>). A rectal examination is sometimes conducted to observe for the presence of hard fecal material and to assess for any fissures or hemorrhoids which could be from passing large hard stool. However, when performing a rectal exam, it is important to consider the stress that it can have on the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511429685">Mason et al., 2004</xref>). The anal sphincter is evaluated for tone which may diminish due to the chronic dilation from withholding behaviors and chronic stool in the rectum. In addition, blood tests are recommended in all constipated children to rule out thyroid and adrenal hormone abnormalities or electrolyte imbalances as with hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511429685">Mason et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511429685">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment of encopresis occurs with initial disimpaction, medications, lifestyle changes, and behavior modification. Disimpaction can be achieved either manually, with enemas, or with a polyethylene glycol electrolyte (PEG) solution. It is important to consider with that manual disimpaction, sedation is required to achieve the maximum benefit of the procedure; however, if this method is performed, a rectal biopsy could also be obtained while the child is sedated. Enemas are another form of treatment utilized, which has shown effectiveness. They are more convenient and have the benefit of being administered at home; however, they do require cooperation and consistency from the parent. If the PEG solution is utilized in treatment of constipation, hospitalization is necessary due to its invasiveness and the large amounts of fluids necessary via a nasogastric tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Medications are administered for the treatment of encopresis with the institution of a laxative regime that will be part of encopresis maintenance therapy. Medications should be chosen to suit each individual child, and it should be made clear to the parent by the prescriber as to the mode of action, dose of medication, and to not stop the medication abruptly unless instructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429685">Dobson, 2009</xref>). A medication treatment plan would begin with initial disimpaction, (which is either done manually or with enemas) and with the establishment of a laxative regimen. For example, bulk forming laxatives such as Citrucel or Metamucil are often recommended to add bulk to stool. Osmotics, such as Milk of Magnesia, MiraLax, or Sorbitol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511429685">Table 2</xref>
) are often prescribed for increased water absorption in the colon, and stool softeners, such as Colace, are medications ordered for making stool passage easier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, promote bowel activity and are another important factor with managing encopresis. According to Philichi, if a child is severely constipated, increasing fiber may only worsen the symptoms, however, a diet should be balanced with whole grains, cereals fortified with bran, fruits, and vegetables (2008). Additional fluids are often suggested, not necessarily in the treatment of constipation, but rather to ensure that a child does not become dehydrated and because increased fluid intake is recommended as fiber intake increases. Exercise on a regular basis can help facilitate stool passage. According to Dobson, “It has been shown that food transit time (the time taken for food to pass through the gut) is accelerated by moderate exercise” (2009, p. 54). Therefore, a child should be encouraged to participate in moderate activity to assist in the elimination process.</p>
<p>Behavior modification is another essential component of managing functional encopresis. This includes establishing a toileting schedule which includes the child sitting on the toilet for 10–15 min following each meal. This will maximize the benefit of the gastrocolic reflux which is a “high-amplitude colonic contraction from the proximal to distal sigmoid colon that pushes stool into the rectum following a meal or after awakening” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429685">Philichi 2008</xref>, p. 124). Toilet use should be unhurried and should allow for an environment of privacy. A child should be provided with a footstool if needed to assist with the Valsalva maneuver that will increase intra-abdominal pressure and facilitate passage of stool. Parents need to be educated and encouraged to use incentives such as stickers or a monetary reward for their children and to establish a consistent routine that must be followed to ensure success. They should be encouraged to keep a diary that will show improvements and should increase adherence to the treatment plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429685">Har &amp; Croffie, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To assist children in behavior modification, it is necessary to not only teach the physical techniques for defecating but also to utilize relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing which facilitates more comfortable and complete defecation. Mental imagery is used to assist children with bowel elimination when a child visualizes a favorite place or that the bowel movement is pain free. Stress management is a form of behavior modification used in encopresis treatment as it is said that chronic stress will lead to disturbance in intestinal motility and will contribute to constipation (Phillichi, 2008). There are instances when a psychological evaluation is recommended, particularly when a child fails with medical treatment and when there are emotional problems or family issues. The mental health care provider can reinforce the treatment plan, provide counseling and guidance for the parents, and allow for an emotional release for the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429685">Philichi, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511429685">
<title>School Nursing</title>
<p>The school nurse plays a vital role in assisting families and children in managing encopresis. Because a child spends the majority of the day in the school setting, many times the nurse is the first to identify that there is a potential medical problem. According to Boyt, “the involvement of the school nurse in the identification, assessment, and treatment of children with elimination problems is an essential component of the care of school children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429685">2005</xref>, p. 349). In addition, it is the school nurse’s responsibility to intervene when a health problem has been recognized as delineated by the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) of 1975. This act dictates that students are eligible for individualized education despite disabilities. An individual education plan (IEP) is developed to include both nursing and other services necessary to assist children in reaching their educational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511429685">Zirkel, 2009</xref>). Because of these established laws, school nurses are therefore responsible for assessing, planning and intervening on behalf of a child with a medical need and developing individualized health care plans specific for that child. The school nurse can identify children with abnormal elimination patterns, refer for treatment, educate other school faculty about encopresis, and develop an individualized treatment plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511429685">Fahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to have a clear understanding of the process, the nurse develops a plan for a student by utilizing the nursing process. This process may begin by assessing the child’s health history. For example, it is determined that a first-grade student has been having fecal incontinence since kindergarten. The soiling usually occurs during school hours and the child seems to have no awareness that the incontinence has occurred or that there is a noticeable odor. The school nurse further assesses this child for abdominal distention, pain, cramping, nausea, and/or vomiting. The nurse speaks with the student’s parents to determine current stool patterns, withholding behaviors, weight loss/gain, dietary habits, fever, over-the-counter medications; and may speak with school faculty to obtain reports of bathroom issues within the school such as uncleanliness, lack of privacy, and inability to leave the classroom. The nurse assesses psychological factors to determine whether there have been any changes in the family structure, current relationships, or recent losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511429685">Montgomery &amp; Navarro, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The school nurse obtains a child’s complete health history from the parents and the physician and should also request a complete report of the child’s physical examination to develop nursing diagnoses such as knowledge deficit, alteration in elimination, alteration in self-care, and a potential for alteration in self-esteem. Based on these diagnoses, goals are set and interventions are put into place. They may include:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the child and family will gain understanding of the signs and symptoms of constipation and the treatment plan;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the student will demonstrate self-care practices by complying with toileting schedule throughout the day;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the student’s self-esteem will be supported by demonstrating positive feedback and open communication with parents and health care provider.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The school nurse begins the implementation process by developing an individualized health plan (IHP) specific for the child with encopresis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840511429685">Table 3</xref>
). This plan would include an established toileting schedule to allow bathroom breaks in an unhurried, private, and clean environment. It may be part of the health plan that the student comes to the nurse’s office for bathroom breaks several times throughout the school day to allow for the following benefits: cleanliness and privacy of the facility, access to personal care items such as clothing changes, disposable wipes, and bags to store soiled clothing, and allowance for success and failures accurately documented and communicated with the child’s physician and parent.</p>

<p>The child’s health plan should also include times for medication administration. The student may have orders to take medications at school in which side effects would be expected. The school nurse is the key individual to provide education about the medications used to treat encopresis. Because often laxatives are ordered for encopresis management, there may be frequent episodes of fecal incontinence. Teachers and other school personal need to be aware of this and have a procedure to follow in managing the situation.</p>
<p>Lastly, the school nurse often will provide education to parents regarding the importance of proper nutrition in treating and managing encopresis. Certain food aide in normal elimination patterns such as adequate fiber, fruits, and vegetables, and it is important to know which foods will produce the desired benefit. In addition, the nurse may be a resource in assisting families that have limited financial resources. Because fresh fruit and vegetables are often more expensive than processed foods, the nurse can be influential in connecting families to resources that offer financial assistance. In summary, the IHP will require ongoing evaluation for success and failures to determine what goals have been met and which ones require modification.</p>
<p>The evaluation phase of the components of the IHP will take place during the 1–2 months after the initial treatment plan was established and every 4–6 months thereafter. It is during this evaluation phase that the child’s baseline is compared to the results of the treatment plan. The school nurse will identify those areas that require modification and will evaluate what interventions are being implemented and followed in the classroom. Areas that will be evaluated will include the child’s incidences of incontinence and cooperation with the toilet routine established, adherence to the dietary recommendations of increased fiber and fluids, and participation in exercise throughout the school day. The school nurse will also assess whether the student’s teacher is assuring access to a clean bathroom and that there is adherence to the toileting schedule established. Classroom interactions between the child with encopresis and other students are examined to ensure that positive relationships are maintained. The documented findings are then discussed with the health care provider and the parents to make certain that progress is being made toward the established goals and whether changes need to be made in the plan of care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Chronic constipation and fecal incontinence in children cause emotional distress and decreased self-esteem while having significant impact on the dynamics of family relationships due to frustration, shame, and embarrassment. However, despite the distressing effects of encopresis, it is a treatable medical condition that requires strict adherence to the treatment plan as well as support from health care professionals. Nurses, particularly those in the school setting, play a significant role in facilitating and establishing care to assist children with the establishment of IHP and by acting as a liaison between school personnel, health care providers, and parents. The involvement of the school nurse is essential in treating encopresis because of the planning and education provided regarding this medical condition. It is with identification, assessment, treatment, and evaluation that the nurse will assist children in leading normal, healthy, and successful lives.</p>
