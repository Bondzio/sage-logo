<abstract>
<p>The primary focus of the current research is goal projection or the ascription of a perceiver’s own goal onto an interaction partner (i.e., target). Extending the finding that perceivers project their goal onto a target (Kawada, Oettingen, Gollwitzer, &amp; Bargh, 2004), two studies applied a cognitive conceptualization of goal pursuit and detection to explain boundary conditions for goal projection in conversation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the strength of the cognitive association between perceivers’ goal and the social context moderated projection: Projection was greater for strongly than moderately or weakly linked goals. Experiment 2 established that the target’s goal pursuit efficiency and the congruency between the perceiver’s and the target’s goals influenced projection: Compared with targets’ efficient pursuit of nonidentical goals, projection was greater (a) when the target and perceiver had the same goal regardless of efficiency or (b) when they had different goals but the target was inefficient.</p>

<p>The goal construct is at the core of much scholarship on interpersonal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211408592">Berger, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211408592">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211408592">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211408592">Dillard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211408592">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Although a great deal of work on goals exists from a message-production framework, less resides in a message-processing point of view; and even less work has emerged from an interactive dialogue perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211408592">Bavelas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211408592">Berger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211408592">Waldron, 1997</xref>). An interactive approach to study communicative aspects of goals (and planning) adds “relatively new theoretical ground by considering planning a process of mutual construction and coordination of action plans, rather than simply a process of individual-level cognition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211408592">Waldron, 1997</xref>, p. 196). Indeed, <italic>goal projection</italic>—the process of a social actor or perceiver ascribing his or her goal onto an interaction partner or target—encourages an approach to understand goals from an interactive message-processing framework and, thus, adds to the literature on goals by highlighting interaction-based processes. Projection occurs, for instance, when a person who is trying to get to know someone during an initial interaction infers that his or her interaction partner is striving for the same objective; the extent of such projection, however, is susceptible to the partner’s goal and behavior. Goal projection is sensitive not only to internal cognitive mechanisms but also to social message-based processes.</p>
<p>Goal projection is a meaningful research endeavor also because it is consequential for interpersonal communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211408592">Caughlin, 2010</xref>). Projecting aspects of oneself onto another increases perceived self–other similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211408592">Mikulincer &amp; Horesh, 1999</xref>), which in turn can increase liking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211408592">Pinel, Long, Landau, Alexander, &amp; Pyszczynski, 2006</xref>) and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211408592">DeBruine, 2002</xref>). Goal projection, thus, is relevant to significant relational-communication outcomes. Goal projection has implications for negotiation as well. When negotiators trusted that their partner had similar objectives, participants were less likely to seek additional information from their partner regarding the negotiation and thus generated worse negotiation outcomes than when negotiators suspiciously thought their partner had dissimilar objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211408592">Sinaceur, 2010</xref>). In other words, a trusting negotiator who projects his or her goal onto a partner might be less likely to have favorable outcomes from the negotiation than a suspicious negotiator who does not project a goal. Goal projection is consequential for and has the potential to cast light on key areas of interpersonal communication.</p>
<p>Given the substantive capacity of goal projection for the goal and other literatures, the current article attempts to further understand it during conversation. First, theory and research relevant to goal projection are detailed. Next, the theoretical rationale for Experiment 1 is articulated to form hypotheses, followed by an empirical test of the predictions. Then, by explicating and testing a new set of predictions, Experiment 2 extends Experiment 1. Finally, implications are discussed in light of the findings across both experiments.</p>
<sec id="section1-0093650211408592">
<title>Goal Projection</title>
<p>Evidence for goal projection emerged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). In three experiments, perceivers tended to infer that another social actor sought the same goal they had: Participants with a chronic goal projected that goal onto a target more than those with a different chronic goal (Experiment 1), participants implicitly primed with or explicitly assigned a goal projected that goal more than those without the goal (Experiment 2), and participants who failed to achieve their goal projected it more than those who actually achieved and thus no longer possessed the goal (Experiment 3). The two experiments herein built on these findings in three ways. First, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al. (2004)</xref> exclusively tested projection in written scenarios, the current research employed actual social interactions. Second, the current Experiment 1 examined a moderator for goal projection to see if it depended on the goal being projected and its cognitive association with the social context. Third, Experiment 2 assessed two additional boundary conditions for projection: (a) the congruency of the perceiver’s and the target’s goals and (b) the efficiency of the target’s verbal tactics employed during goal pursuit.</p>
<p>The common notion of projection is to assign one’s personal characteristics, which can include states, traits, attitudes, and beliefs, onto another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211408592">Ames, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211408592">Ross, Greene, &amp; House, 1977</xref>). For example, people who consider themselves helpful might think that others are helpful too. Goal projection is similar, except the projected element is confined to a goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, people who want to enjoy a friend’s company will project that goal when they think their partner wants to do the same. A goal is a mental representation of a desired end state that social actors pursue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211408592">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211408592">Dijksterhuis, Chartrand, &amp; Aarts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211408592">Wilson, 2002</xref>). A goal is a psychological construct with attendant neural correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211408592">Berkman &amp; Lieberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211408592">Eddington, Dolcos, Cabeza, Krishnan, &amp; Strauman, 2007</xref>). Whereas goals are mentally represented, their existence can influence overt behavior and is often the focus of people’s inferences about others. Recent work even provides evidence for the neurological basis of goal inferences by adults and 9-month-old infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211408592">Reid et al., 2009</xref>). Goals are distinct from constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211408592">Kellermann, 2004</xref>) or what others have called secondary goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211408592">Dillard, Segrin, &amp; Harden, 1989</xref>). Whereas people strive to reach a single primary goal (e.g., comfort, find information) that can change from situation to situation, people continuously satisfy constraints (e.g., maintain politeness) that recur across interactions. Goal projection is, thus, an attempt to understand another’s objective but not another’s constraints.</p>
<p>A significant conception of goal projection is that it can proceed in either a conscious or unconscious manner; that is, a perceiver can project goals at various levels of awareness. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al. (2004)</xref> maintain that “goal projection effects are equally strong when the projector is aware and when he is unaware of possessing the projected goal” (p. 550). The present research focuses exclusively on explicit goal projection. Even though this focus limits to an extent the generalizability of the current experiments, because they aim to test some boundary conditions to goal projection and examine it in real conversations, using explicit goals is most conducive to such objectives. Moreover, the mirrored effects from Kawada et al. at least suggest that any presently demonstrated outcomes should replicate with implicit goals.</p>
<p>Also integral to this conceptualization of projection is that it is a subjective process, which means that goal projection can occur independent of whether a target is truly pursuing the projected goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211408592">Krueger, 2000</xref>). For example, projection occurs in either of these two situations: A perceiver with a persuasion goal infers that a target also has a persuasion goal, but the target actually has a teaching goal; or a perceiver, who has a goal to persuade, infers that a target also has a persuasion goal, and the target in fact has the persuasion goal. In the former instance, projection leads to an inaccurate inference, whereas the projected goal in the latter instance yields an accurate inference. Inference accuracy, however, is not a current concern. Similar to the construct of shared reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211408592">Echterhoff, Higgins, &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>), what matters for projection is if a perceiver infers that a target holds the same goal in common and not if the goal is actually mutually held.</p>
<p>Two domains of scholarship are primarily germane for goal projection. First, the previously mentioned set of experiments on goal projection is relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). As the only known work that has directly assessed goal projection, it theorized that because a context activates a goal, perceivers will project that goal onto a target when they are confronted with that context. In particular, perceivers who either chronically held a learning goal versus a performance goal projected their respective goal onto a target in an achievement context (Experiment 1). In other studies, perceivers induced to have a competition goal projected the goal more than those not induced with that goal (Experiment 2), especially if those induced with the competition goal failed to obtain it (Experiment 3). The rationale for all three experiments was that because perceivers’ goal was cognitively associated with the social context and thus highly accessible (i.e., high activation potential; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211408592">Higgins, 1996</xref>) for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211408592">Bargh &amp; Barndollar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211408592">Bargh &amp; Gollwitzer, 1994</xref>), they projected their goal onto a target. In other words, if perceivers’ goal and the context were not linked via an associative network and thus the goal had very low activation potential to operate during cognitive processing, then they would not have projected the goal. Yet these studies only altered whether perceivers had the goal to be projected; they did not alter the strength of the association between the context and the goal. Across all studies, either perceivers sought a goal strongly associated with the context or they did not possess such a goal. Left uncertain is whether the strength of the association between the context and perceivers’ goal alters the extent of projection.</p>
<p>Second, work on goal detection, or the processes by which perceivers infer others’ goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>), is relevant. Goal detection is similar to, yet distinct from, goal projection. Goal detection research has almost entirely stressed how the social context and/or targets’ communicative behavior activate goals that perceivers subsequently tend to infer, whereas goal projection uniquely underscores the role that a perceivers’ goal plays in relation to the context and targets’ behavior. Both detection and projection focus on how perceivers understand a target’s goal, but projection is limited to the ascription of perceivers’ own goal onto a target; detection does not have this limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2009a</xref>). Goal projection is, nonetheless, a subset of goal detection. Given their similarity, goal detection theorizing can enlighten goal projection. Specifically, Palomares’ theoretical framework for goal detection posits that perceivers tend to infer goals that are strongly associated with the social context because the context will activate linked goals and yield them highly accessible. Perceivers, for example, inferred a goal strongly linked to a context more than goals not linked to the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>, Experiments 1 &amp; 2). Yet when the true goal was weakly associated with the context, a perceiver drew on targets’ verbal behavior to infer their goal; thus, the more efficient targets’ tactics were, the more the perceiver inferred their goal accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211408592">2009b</xref>). More broadly, both the efficiency of the target’s goal pursuit and the target’s true goal determine what goal a perceiver infers a target to be pursuing. Applying these processes to the current work suggests that the effects of the efficiency of targets’ tactics and the targets’ true goal can combine with the perceivers’ goal to influence goal projection.</p>
<p>Together, these two domains of scholarship yield two implications for goal projection. First, goal projection is likely contingent on the goal of the perceiver and the social context. Specifically, projection depends on the extent to which perceivers’ own goal is cognitively paired with the context: The stronger the association is, the more likely projection is. Second, what goal the target is actually pursuing and the efficiency of the target’s goal pursuit also likely moderate goal projection: If the target’s actual goal is different than the perceiver’s goal, then projection depends on the efficiency of the target’s verbal tactics. The following provides explanations for these effects to propose corresponding hypotheses. Experiment 1 addresses the first implication, whereas Experiment 2 undertakes the second implication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0093650211408592">
<title>Experiment 1: Projection Depends on the Context and the Perceiver’s Goal</title>
<p>As previously stated, any given goal is likely projected when it reaches a relatively high level of accessibility for the perceiver; when the goal is not cognitively active, it is not projected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). This rationale assumes an accessible goal is always applicable to the context and thus always projected. However, the magnitude of the association between an active goal and the social context moderates goal projection. If a perceiver’s goal is weakly linked to a context, then projection is unlikely because the goal is not fitting or appropriate for the context even if the goal is highly accessible for the perceiver. For example, a student who is trying to cheat when taking an exam is not very likely to think a fellow student has the same goal given its low frequency in, and hence weak link to, the context, whereas another student who is trying to perform well on the exam is relatively more likely to project that goal because of the goal’s high frequency in the context. Pursuing a goal that is not strongly linked to the context at hand, in other words, will reduce projection because the goal is unlikely in and unsuitable for the context.</p>
<p>To determine if projection varies based on the strength of the context-goal linkage, the current experiment employs initial interactions as the context and manipulates perceivers’ goal via goal specificity. <italic>Goal specificity</italic> is the level of detail or precision at which someone sets a goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211408592">Dillard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211408592">Locke, Shaw, Saari, &amp; Latham, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2009a</xref>). For example, a specific goal of obtaining reasons for a political or religious affiliation is more concrete than a midlevel goal of obtaining views on politics or religion, both of which are more concrete than an abstract goal of obtaining personal information. In this instance, the specificity of these goals is negatively correlated with the magnitude of the cognitive association between the goal and an initial interaction: Given the relative frequencies of co-occurrence, the goal of obtaining personal information is strongly associated with an initial-interaction context, the goal of seeking religious or political views is moderately associated with the context, and the goal of obtaining reasons for a political or religious affiliation is weakly associated with the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211408592">Berger &amp; Kellermann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211408592">Kellermann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211408592">Kellermann &amp; Palomares, 2004</xref>). Experiment 1 used these goals and initial interactions to adjust the strength (strong, moderate, or weak) of the context-goal linkages.</p>
<p>An inverse linear relationship is predicted: As specificity increases (i.e., moving from an abstract goal to a midlevel goal to a concrete goal), perceivers decreasingly project their goal onto a target. The explanation for this relationship is that reductions in the association between the perceiver’s goal and the context yield a less likely chance that the target actually has the same goal. Hence, even if perceivers have a general tendency to project their goal onto a target, they are still sensitive to the likelihood of co-occurrence and fit between their goal and the social context. If perceivers’ goal is uncommon for the social context, then they are less likely to project their goal. Based on this conceptualization, the following predictions are advanced:</p>

<title>Participants and design overview</title>
<p>University undergraduates (<italic>N</italic> = 138; 63% female; age: 18 to 38 years, <italic>M</italic> = 21.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.14; ethnicity: 42% White, 29% Asian, 8.7% Pacific Islander, 7.2% Mixed Ethnicity, 5.8% Hispanic/Latin American, 5.8% Middle Eastern, 1.4% African American/Black) received credit for their participation. In each of 69 dyads, one participant was randomly assigned as the perceiver and randomly assigned an abstract, midlevel, or specific goal. The other participant was the target, not assigned a goal, and unaware that the perceiver had a goal. Each participant independently received instructions tailored to the perceiver or target roles, conversed with a dyad partner, and then privately completed a questionnaire also tailored to a certain role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093650211408592">
<title>Goal specificity</title>
<p>Five different information-seeking objectives (i.e., one abstract, two midlevel, and two specific goals) manipulated specificity; the redundancy served a stimulus-generalizability purpose. Consistent with related past work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211408592">Waldron, 1990</xref>), the four nonabstract goals focused on either politics or religion. For the specific goals, perceivers sought to “find out what your partner’s” political party or religious “affiliation is (if any) and why your partner has that” political or religious “preference.” For the midlevel goals, perceivers aimed to “find out as much as you can about your partner’s views on” politics or religion. For the abstract goal, perceivers tried to “find out as much as you can about your partner.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093650211408592">
<title>Goal projection</title>
<p>Projection was assessed in three steps. First, an open-ended item asked perceivers what they thought their partner was trying to do during the conversation and to list any goal(s) they thought their partner was trying to achieve. Second, among the goals listed in the first item, perceivers singled out one goal as the principal goal they thought their partner was pursuing foremost. Third, two judges read perceivers’ responses to the first item to inform their ultimate coding of projection for only the singled-out goal. The similarity between perceivers’ assigned and inferred goals was assessed focusing on the specificity and content of the goals. Judges concentrated on the underlying conceptual meanings of the assigned and inferred goals and not lexical and syntactic similarities. For example, for perceivers with the abstract goal, the projection score of the following four potential goal inferences would increase incrementally: (a) to be nice, (b) to learn about my educational background, (c) to discover my beliefs and views, and (d) to get to know me. Judges independently and reliably coded projection on a 4-point scale; the average of the two judges’ codes served as the projection measure (4 = <italic>high projection</italic>; <italic>M</italic> = 2.32; <italic>SD</italic> = .96; Krippendorff’s α = .96).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0093650211408592">
<title>Manipulation check measures</title>
<p>To ensure an effective goal specificity manipulation, perceivers wrote their goal in an open-ended goal-recall item. To examine initial interactions only, all participants indicated via a partner-recognition item if they knew their partner before participating in the study, and if so, how. Finally, in a demand-characteristics item, participants wrote what they thought the researcher was trying to examine and understand from the study. How these items functioned as manipulation checks is detailed at the start of the results sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0093650211408592">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>First, one member of a dyad was randomly assigned as the perceiver. Dyad members arrived at separate labs; a different research assistant greeted each member. The assistants used walkie-talkies to determine when to start the study. Written instructions informed participants that they would meet someone and have an interaction as if at an informal setting like a party. Next, only perceivers learned that they needed to try to do something during their conversation. Specifically, perceivers were instructed to have a certain objective or purpose for the interaction and then read one of the five randomly assigned goals. Perceivers read that they should not state their goal to their partner or that they even had a goal. Both perceivers and targets read that their conversation would be videotaped and that they should not discuss the instructions. Perceivers read the full description of their goal, as listed above, three times.</p>
<p>Next, both research assistants asked their participant to briefly recall the instructions. After the perceiver and target correctly summarized their respective directions and the perceiver correctly stated his or her goal, an assistant escorted one participant to the other. Facing each other at a 90º angle, perceivers always sat to the right of targets. An assistant directed the dyad to start the conversation once the assistant left the room. Then, the assistant started the camera, left, closed the door, and started a stopwatch. The assistant reentered the room after 5 minutes, stopped the camera, escorted participants to separate rooms, and asked each to complete a questionnaire tailored to their respective roles as either the perceiver or the target.</p>
<p>Perceivers first completed the goal-recall manipulation-check item. Next, perceivers completed several open- and close-ended filler items so that the recall of their goal was separated from the projection measure. Perceivers then completed the projection measure followed by other filler items. Finally, perceivers completed the demand-characteristics and partner-recognition items and wrote their sex, age, and ethnicity. Targets first completed several filler items and then answered the demand-characteristics and partner-recognition items and stated their sex, age, and ethnicity. After the questionnaire, research assistants debriefed and thanked participants. The entire procedure lasted approximately 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-0093650211408592">
<title>Manipulation checks</title>
<p>Four precautions certified the integrity of the experiment. First, any dyad whose perceiver incorrectly recalled the goal was deleted; the recalled and assigned goals did not have to agree verbatim, but their underlying meaning had to be identical. Only 7 perceivers (10.14%) inaccurately recalled their assigned goal; thus the corresponding dyads were excluded from subsequent analyses. Based on the partner-recognition item, only one dyad (1.45%) had previously interacted and therefore was dropped. No dyad was dropped based on the demand-characteristics item because all participants inaccurately stated the study’s purpose and indicated no awareness of the predictions. Finally, videotapes, questionnaires, and debriefings were closely monitored to see if perceivers and targets participated seriously and upheld the instructions and protocol; all did. In particular, no perceiver was suspicious about the experiment’s focus on projection and the likely relationship between the assigned and inferred goals. However, because a videotape revealed that one dyad member had poor English skills, which obviously resulted in miscommunication, this dyad was removed. Thus, the remaining sample of 60 dyads allowed for an effective test of the hypotheses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In sum, projection occurred when the perceiver’s goal was strongly cognitively linked to the initial interaction context more than when the goal and context were moderately or weakly associated. Although full support did not emerge for H<sub>1</sub> (i.e., an inverse linear relationship), data were consistent with the idea that a strong association between a potentially projected goal and the context encourages projection, whereas a less-than-strong link reduces projection. This outcome is logical: Because perceivers are aware of what is likely, fitting, or appropriate during interactions, they do not project any goal willy-nilly. Perceivers are much more likely to project their goal when the goal suits or is conducive to the context (i.e., when the target might reasonably have the goal). That is, projection is more likely for the abstract than the midlevel and specific goals because of their relative frequencies of co-occurrence with the context.</p>
<p>Then again, this account is probably confined to unique circumstances: Perceivers are particularly likely to project their abstract goal when the target is actually pursuing it. Perceivers, in other words, conceivably inferred the abstract goal more than the other two goals because targets tended to have the abstract goal. For example, perhaps the target adopted the perceiver’s goal over the course of the interaction; therefore, the perceiver’s projection was warranted by the target’s behavior. In contrast, when a target does not actually have the abstract goal, maybe perceivers are less likely to project their abstract goal. To extend Experiment 1 and thereby address this issue, a second experiment held constant perceivers’ goal as the abstract information-seeking objective and modified targets’ goal to see if projection depended on the congruency between targets’ and perceivers’ goals. In addition, the efficiency with which targets sought their goal was assessed to see how it moderated the congruency-projection relationship.</p>

<sec id="section14-0093650211408592">
<title>Experiment 2: Projection Depends on the Target’s Goal and Efficiency</title>
<p>Whether a goal is projected depends, not just on the applicability (or link) of the perceiver’s goal to the context (as in Experiment 1) but on the congruency between the target’s and the perceiver’s goals. <italic>Goal congruency</italic> is the extent of correspondence or harmony between the goals of two interlocutors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211408592">Wilensky, 1983</xref>). By holding constant perceivers’ abstract obtain-personal-information goal and varying targets’ goal, this experiment employed three levels of congruency: (a) <italic>identical goals</italic> or when the perceiver and target both seek personal information about the other; (b) <italic>goal concord</italic> or when the target’s goal of reveal personal information complements the perceiver’s goal; and (c) <italic>goal discord</italic> or when the target’s goal to conceal personal information conflicts with the perceiver’s goal (i.e., for one to succeed, the other must fail). Projection depends on congruency because perceivers are sensitive to whether the target actually has the potentially projected information-seeking goal. Thus, if the target is actually pursuing the same goal as the perceiver—in this case, the abstract information-seeking goal of the identical goal-congruency condition—then projection is more likely than if the target has some other goal (i.e., concordant and discordant conditions [reveal and conceal goals, respectively]). Thus, the following prediction is rendered to compare the levels of congruency:</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211408592" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Holding perceivers’ goal constant as an abstract information-seeking goal, perceivers project their goal onto a target when the target’s goal is identical to perceivers’ goal more than when the target’s goal is different than (i.e., concordant or discordant with) perceivers’ goal.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Inherent in the rationale for H<sub>1</sub> is that targets somehow signal to a perceiver the odds that they actually have the perceiver’s potentially projected goal. One such signal is targets’ tactics or means of goal attainment. As goals are mentally represented, in other words, a target’s goal can only moderate projection via the target’s actions (unless, of course, one believes in mental telepathy). Hence, Experiment 2 also incorporated the efficiency of targets’ goal pursuit. <italic>Goal pursuit efficiency</italic> is the level of expediency, effort, and persistence with which someone seeks to achieve a goal; high efficiency yields a rapid series of direct tactics that are indicative of or conducive to goal pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211408592">Kellermann, 2004</xref>). As efficient tactics supply diagnostic data regarding someone’s goal, efficiency is a key indicator for what goal someone is actually pursuing: The more efficient people pursued their goal, the more likely someone inferred that goal accurately, but only if the true goal was uncommon in (i.e., not cognitively linked to) the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211408592">2009b</xref>). In general, efficiency alters projection when the perceiver’s and the target’s goals are different because a target’s efficient pursuit suggests to perceivers that the target has some other goal rather than perceivers’ potentially projected goal. Otherwise, if the goals are the same, then efficiency is relatively ineffective or unessential.</p>
<p>The following elaborates this rationale to synthesize the interactive effects of goal congruency and the efficiency of targets’ goal pursuit on projection. Specifically, if perceivers’ and targets’ goals are identical, then efficiency does not modify perceivers’ projection. Whether targets are efficient or inefficient does not change the extent of projection for identical goals because high and low efficiency are equally consistent with perceivers’ potentially projected information-seeking goal. Stated differently, for identical goals, a target’s efficiency does not signal to perceivers that the target’s true goal is actually different than perceivers’ goal and thus cannot indicate that projection is unsuitable. In contrast, when perceivers’ and targets’ goals are not identical (i.e., concordant or discordant), targets’ highly efficient behavior, but not low efficiency, signals to perceivers that targets do not actually have the same information-seeking goal and thus indicates that projection is unsuitable. In other words, low efficiency from a target encourages projection even if the target does not truly have the to-be-projected information-seeking goal, whereas high efficiency discourages projection. The following hypothesis encapsulates this explication:</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211408592" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypotheses 2a-c:</italic> Holding perceivers’ goal constant as an abstract information-seeking goal, perceivers project their goal onto a target when the target’s goal pursuit is inefficient more than when the target’s pursuit is efficient if the target’s goal is (a) concordant or (b) discordant with perceivers’ goal (c) but not if the target’s goal is identical to perceivers’ goal.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The theoretical rationale, however, does not specify whether the effects of efficiency on projection across the concordant and discordant congruency conditions will differ; moreover, it does not prohibit a difference. As a result, the following research question is asked as well:</p>

<title>Goal congruency</title>
<p>Different than Experiment 1, perceivers always aimed for the abstract information-seeking goal (i.e., “Find out as much as you can about your partner”). Targets, however, were randomly assigned one of three goals that differed in congruency with the perceiver’s goal: (a) “Find out as much as you can about your partner” (identical), (b) “Reveal as much as you can about yourself” (concord), and (c) “Reveal as little as you can about yourself” (discord).

<p>Three stages identical to those used in Experiment 1 assessed goal projection in the current study (<italic>M</italic> = 2.54; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.45; Krippendorff’s α = .99). Also, the goal-recall, partner-recognition, and demand-characteristics items were employed again.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0093650211408592">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The protocol from Experiment 1 was identical to that of Experiment 2 apart from four exceptions. First, the two dyad members arrived at the same lab, where a research assistant immediately greeted and separated them by bringing the randomly assigned target into the lab. Second, both the target and the perceiver read instructions similar to the directions that only perceivers received in Experiment 1. These instructions stated that they should attempt to achieve a goal during the interaction using whatever means they wanted to employ: Perceivers always learned about the abstract information-seeking goal, and targets learned about one of the three above-listed goals that varied in congruency with perceivers’ goal. Third, after the first set of instructions, about half of the targets were randomly assigned to do a cognitive busyness or load task (i.e., digit rehearsal), the inclusion of which served a purpose for a different paper. Thus, because no theoretical motive exists for assessing the effects of targets’ cognitive resources on perceivers’ projection and because (as subsequently reported) busyness yielded no effects for the measures herein, cognitive load was disregarded and collapsed for all tests of hypotheses. Fourth, whereas perceivers’ questionnaire followed the same pattern in both Experiments 1 and 2, targets’ questionnaire did not. Targets first completed several filler items followed by the goal-recall item. Then, targets answered additional filler items. Finally, targets answered demand-characteristics, partner-recognition, sex, age, and ethnicity items. Other than these four deviations, the procedures for Experiments 1 and 2 were identical.</p>

<sec id="section20-0093650211408592">
<title>Efficiency coding</title>
<p>Highly efficient goal pursuit was defined as expedient, not wasteful, to the point, immediate, effortless, and direct. Efficiency is orthogonal to effectiveness or one’s success of goal attainment; someone, for instance, can efficiently pursue a goal and still be unsuccessful in reaching that goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211408592">Kellermann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211408592">Wilson, 2002</xref>). As a guiding principle, efficiency increased, as the style and content of a target’s tactics were highly conducive to his or her goal, which means efficiency is goal dependant and the same behavior can be efficient for one goal but inefficient for another goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211408592">Kellermann &amp; Kim, 1991</xref>). For example, targets in the identical congruency condition very efficiently sought their goal by frequently and directly asking perceivers personal, broad, and open-ended questions in a short time. Yet targets in the discord condition were very efficient if they revealed very little personal information, made aloof or superficial comments about impersonal topics, asked general questions, infrequently answered questions about themselves, and tended to respond to a perceiver’s questions about the target by redirecting the question onto the perceiver without answering it. As a final example, targets in the concord condition who frequently revealed personal information (sometimes without a prompt or question from the perceiver), answered perceivers’ personal questions in great detail, and talked about or made comments on personal topics received high-efficiency scores.</p>
<p>To measure targets’ efficiency, three judges watched the videotaped interactions. To train judges, they received descriptions and examples of tactics varying in efficiency for the three goals and watched videotaped exemplars of (in)efficient pursuits of other goals from past research. Judges also learned differences between efficiency, effectiveness, and appropriateness (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211408592">Kellermann, 2004</xref>) and to discount the latter two for their efficiency ratings. As highly explicit tactics (i.e., “I’m going to learn as much as I can about you,” “I want you to get information about me,” “The researcher told me to avoid telling you about myself”) would have threatened the experimental protocol, judges keenly noted their appearance; yet targets did not employ these tactics. Moderately explicit tactics, however, were nonthreatening because they are efficient methods to obtain a goal that do not definitively reveal the goal. While rating, judges knew targets’ true goal, emphasized targets’ communicative behaviors, and excluded detectors’ behavior. Judges determined each target’s global level of efficiency for the entire 5-minute interaction on a 7-point scale (7 = <italic>high</italic>), after having first rated efficiency for each 1-minute increment, which helped facilitate the global judgment.</p>
<p>The average of judges’ ratings reliably defined efficiency (intraclass correlation: ρ<sub>I</sub> = .85; <italic>M</italic> = 4.08; <italic>SD</italic> = .99). As the rationale and attendant hypotheses focus on high and low levels of efficiency, this continuous measure was dichotomized using a median-split technique. Dyads with a target whose efficiency was at or above the median (4.00) on the efficiency scale were coded as efficient, whereas all remaining dyads below the median were deemed inefficient. Importantly, using the continuous efficiency measure replicates all subsequent results using the dichotomous variable of efficiency. Nonetheless, for ease of interpretation and conceptual consistency, only the results employing the median-split measure are reported below.</p>

Finally, inspecting videotapes, questionnaires, and debriefings revealed that all people in the remaining 141 dyads participated seriously and abided by the protocol.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The hypotheses for Experiment 2 generally gained support: Projection depended on the congruency of perceivers’ and targets’ goals and the efficiency with which targets sought their goal. Specifically, the likelihood of projection was greater if the target actually had the same information-seeking goal as perceivers (identical condition) than if the target had a different goal (concord or discord; H<sub>1</sub>). Yet projection was relatively more likely when the target had a goal different than perceivers’ goal but only if the target pursued it inefficiently because such inefficient pursuit did not relay to perceivers that they should not project their goal (H<sub>2</sub>). In other words, behavioral cues conducive to the target’s pursuit of a nonidentical goal indicated to perceivers that projection was unsuitable because the target’s behavior was inconsistent with perceivers’ potentially projected goal, whereas target’s inefficient behavior did not indicate this. When wanting to catch up with an old friend, projecting that goal onto the friend is reasonable so long as the friend does not somehow signal he or she has some other objective (e.g., to boast). Thus, projection is less likely if a target’s behavior suggests projection will lead to an otherwise inaccurate inference.</p>
<p>Comparing the effects of efficiency in the concord and discord congruency conditions (RQ1) revealed an important caveat to these conclusions, however. Projection was hampered in the discordant condition even if targets were inefficient. Because the conceptualization did not predict nor reject this result as a potential outcome, a post hoc reason why it might have occurred is needed. Targets’ concordant goal is compatible with perceivers’ goal, but targets’ discordant goal is incompatible with perceivers’ goal. Thus, although a target in the discord condition is inefficient, the conflict between the target’s and the perceiver’s goals might signal that projection is unsuitable. Even inefficient pursuit will contain an occasional tactic that hints at the concealment goal, whereas perceivers likely deemed targets’ inefficient pursuit of revealing personal information as acquiescing to perceivers’ find-information goal. Moreover, inefficient pursuit of the concealment goal was likely more salient to perceivers than inefficient pursuit of the reveal goal because concealing was an obstacle to perceivers’ find-information goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211408592">Francik &amp; Clark, 1985</xref>). In sum, projection was less likely for goal discord than concord with inefficient targets perhaps because the clash between discordant goals signaled to perceivers that projection was unsuitable even at low levels of efficiency.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The experiments herein discovered moderators or boundary conditions of goal projection. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al. (2004)</xref> determined if the projection of goals onto others occurred, the current article examined the extent to which projection is likely to occur. As with other social phenomena, some circumstances promote and others discourage projection. First, the mental link between the social context and perceivers’ goal can alter projection, with strong associations being particularly favorable for projection. That is, perceivers are sensitive to the context at hand and whether their own goal is frequently pursued in similar social settings. If perceivers’ goal is uncommon in these settings, then they are less likely to project that goal. Second, assuming perceivers’ goal is linked to the context, they are likely to project that goal onto a target only if the target does not somehow signal to the contrary. If a target has a different goal than the perceiver has, then the perceiver is less likely to project that goal if the target’s behavior suggests that projection would lead to an inaccurate inference. Importantly, these hypothesized outcomes entailed respectable effect sizes (range: .11-.21), which signify the impact of these moderators.</p>
<p>The explanation for projection is that when a goal reaches a high level of accessibility for a perceiver, he or she will infer that someone else also has that goal. Reliable moderating effects, however, revealed that high accessibility is insufficient sometimes. Perceivers might be inclined to project their goal but only if the context and the target’s behavior are consistent with the potentially projected goal. Future research might assess other provisions for projection. One candidate is the previous history between interlocutors. Perceivers might be more likely to project a goal when they have formerly experienced a target pursue that goal than having no such experience. In contrast, goal projection might be unlikely if a perceiver knows a target does not tend to pursue a goal. Another moderator for projection might include perceivers’ motivation to infer targets’ goals accurately (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211408592">Stapel, Kooman, &amp; Zeelenberg, 1998</xref>): A high desire to be accurate might yield relatively less projection in some circumstances. In addition, projection might be more likely for ingroup than outgroup members, and such projection might be linguistically codified (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211408592">Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988</xref>). Future research will likely reveal other moderators as well.</p>
<p>As goal projection is related to—albeit distinct from—goal detection, the current work can inform scholarship on goal detection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211408592">Palomares (2009b)</xref> claims that goal detection is a function of the factors or components encountered in social interaction because they limit perceivers’ set of inferable goals. For example, when a context and a target’s efficiency strongly indicate that the target is seeking a particular goal, then perceivers will likely infer that goal because the context and efficiency elevate that goal’s accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>). The goal detection process, in other words, is the result of multiple sources of diagnostic data that perceivers cognitively integrate to assess what goal a target might be pursuing. Research hitherto has focused on the sources of the social context and targets’ behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211408592">2009b</xref>). Goal projection uniquely demonstrates that someone’s own goal can be added to that list of sources. In fact, Experiments 1 and 2 distinctively demonstrated that goal projection is not entirely consistent with other nonprojection means of inferring others’ goals because someone’s own goal can, in part, determine what goal he or she likely infers a target has. Goal detection research has focused on the activation of goals mostly from external sources that detectors perceive during the interaction. The current experiments reveal that someone’s goal can affect the process of limiting potential inferences. Although the current work is unique, the explanation and data are consistent with the general goal detection theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Work on goal projection, coupled with goal detection research, suggests a possible middle ground between projection and general detection wherein perceivers might infer for a target a goal that does not duplicate their own goal (e.g., “I am trying to persuade you, and you are trying to persuade me.”) but a goal that is highly related to perceivers’ goal (e.g., “I am trying to persuade you, and you are trying to resist my persuasion.”). In other words, a perceiver’s goal could marginally influence the perceiver’s inference to a point that is similar to but different than goal projection. What is more, research on goal inferences has focused on various attributes of inferred goals, such as accuracy, certainty, and projection similarity; less emphasis has been placed on understanding what specific goals individuals infer and what affects the content of goal inferences. The perceiver’s goal can be one such influence (e.g., “I want to impress you, and you want to interview me for a potential position.”). Beyond the perceiver’s goal, perhaps other situational features encourage specific types of goal inferences. For example, dark allies at nighttime might foster inferences of dangerous or threatening goals with the perceiver as a victim (e.g., “He wants to mug me.”). Some research taps these possibilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211408592">Magliano, Skowronski, Britt, Güss, &amp; Forsythe, 2008</xref>), but much more remains uncovered.</p>
<p>Besides theoretically advancing earlier work on goal projection by placing some limits on the process, the present set of experiments tested projection in actual conversations. The only known previous research on projection used written scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). This method was effective in that it allowed for a highly controlled experimental setting wherein explicit and implicit goal projection could be assessed. Yet this method left equivocal if projection would manifest during genuine conversations of dyadic pairs. Experiments 1 and 2, however, mitigated this limitation because they tested projection in real social interactions. Nonetheless, the studies were not immune to their own set of limits. First, the conclusions are confined to interactions among unacquainted students pursuing informational goals. Thus, whether projection and the moderators will generalize to other relational types and other goals is uncertain. Also, only explicit goal projection was assessed, which leaves unclear if the moderation effects will occur when goal projection lies outside perceivers’ awareness; unknown is whether the results would replicate using a method to induce goals implicitly, although given the symmetrical results for implicit and explicit goals from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al. (2004)</xref> replication appears likely. Still, additional studies are needed to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Practical implications for goal projection are also noteworthy. Projection can lead to accurate or inaccurate goal inferences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">Palomares (2009a)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211408592">Lakey &amp; Canary, 2002</xref>) have shown that inference accuracy is associated with perceived communication competence, typically implying that accuracy leads to high-competence judgments. Thus, projection could also relate to competence, although perhaps not always in the same direction. If the projected goal is socially appropriate, then projection likely fosters a perceiver’s competence judgment of a target. For example, a perceiver who projects a get-to-know-you goal onto a target during an initial interaction will likely think the target is communicatively competent. In contrast, if the perceiver does not project this goal, then that might reduce his or her competence assessment of the target. Moreover, projection might affect other judgments too. A perceiver, for example, who projects an inappropriate goal (e.g., concealment or embarrassment goals) onto a target might think the target is rude, difficult, or an otherwise unlikable person.</p>
<p>Another implication is that projection might generate misunderstandings. By inferring one’s goal onto another, a perceiver might erroneously assume competition with a target. For example, someone who is telling an acquaintance about a potential dating partner might think the acquaintance also wishes to romantically pursue the person, unduly leading to conflict, which could result in an argument and a termination of the relationship. Projection of cooperative goals, however, might promote rapport and closeness between a perceiver and a target. For example, if a daughter projects a helping goal onto her father, the child might increase her bond to the parent, which could lead to increased openness and other behavior that can benefit the relationship. This process might contribute to attachment development in infants, as infants as young as 6-months infer adults’ goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211408592">Southgate, Johnson, &amp; Csibra, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211408592">Phillips, Baron-Cohen, &amp; Rutter, 1992</xref>), and they might also project goals. Hence, an offspring’s attachment to a parental figure might result in part from projection through perceived similarity and subsequent liking. (As an aside, projecting competition and cooperation goals would also likely have implications for negotiation patterns and behaviors.)</p>
<p>The present research focused on the projection of a single goal onto an interaction partner. Work on goals has contemplated the pursuit of multiple goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211408592">Berger, 2004</xref>), which suggests the projection of multiple goals. Someone with a goal to discuss with an interaction partner a movie they both saw recently might simultaneously aim to procrastinate; thus, that person could conceivably project either one of the goals or both goals. In this example, the discussion goal might serve the procrastination goal in a hierarchy (e.g., “I don’t want to study, so let’s talk about that movie we saw the other day.”). Thus, perceivers might project multiple, hierarchically represented goals (e.g., “We both desire to delay studying, so we both want to talk about that movie. . .”). Whereas scholars clearly acknowledge at a conceptual level the existence of the pursuit of multiple goals and goal hierarchies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211408592">Berger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211408592">Dillard, 1997</xref>), there is a lack of corresponding empirical observations of such goal pursuit and an even greater gap in terms of the detection/projection of multiple goals and goal hierarchies.</p>
<p>A related issue is whether perceivers tend to project/infer constraints in addition to goals. The projection and, more generally, the detection of others’ constraints are clearly distinct from goal detection/projection; and, from the outset, this research made a clear separation between the two and aimed to focus exclusively on goals and their projection. Whether individuals project constraints is unknown, nonetheless. Perceivers who are trying to be polite, for example, might infer a similar level of politeness for a target, and this might be discrete from any level of goal projection. The literature almost exclusively emphasizes goal projection or detection and does not associate these with constraint detection, and therefore the process of how people understand others’ constraints is virtually unknown. A sample of questions prime for theory and research includes to what extent is the process of projecting goals similar to the process of projecting constraints and at what level does a perceiver focus on others’ goals relative to others’ constraints. Scholars have argued for the primacy of goal inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211408592">Berger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211408592">Palomares, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211408592">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211408592">2009b</xref>) but admittedly have not conducted any comparative tests with constraint inferences to empirically justify this emphasis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current work established some confines for goal projection, which was hitherto verified only as a main effect: Perceivers ascribed their goal onto the target of a written scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211408592">Kawada et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, projection is more likely under some circumstances and less likely under others. Projection is undoubtedly an interpersonal process of genuine conversations with strong ties to goal detection and person perception processes. Predictions generated from the theoretical framework generally received support, and future work will likely tease apart other aspects of goal projection and thereby continue to add to the understanding of social interaction and in particular goal detection.</p>
<p>Moreover, goal projection speaks to broader aspects of communication. Perceivers might not only project their goal onto a target in conversation but also do the same in other communication domains. For example, people might project an entertainment goal onto the producers or actors of television shows. Likewise, a perceiver visiting an educational website to get information about a particular topic might project an informational goal onto the website, its creator, fellow users, or other entities. Goal projection can also occur in organizational settings, wherein for example an employee projects onto the company a goal of increasing revenue. Patients might also project their goal onto a health organization. All of these instances of projection are likely consequential as well. In other words, whereas the current work and conceptualization place goal-projection processes into interpersonal communication, these processes are not secluded from other forms of communication. Goal projection and more generally goal detection span multiple, broad realms of human communication. This and other research on how and why people understand others’ goals is capable of advancing the field of communication as a whole by investigating goals and their projection and detection in interpersonal and other types of communication.</p>
