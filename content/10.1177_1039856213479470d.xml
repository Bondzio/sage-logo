<p>Jim was a tall modest man with a distinctive clear voice and ready smile. He had charm, a ready ear and a clear and enquiring mind. There was no pretention but an openness and ability to share. His rural derivations gave him an uncluttered approach to his work and expression, which tended to disguise his considerable intellect and other capacities in practical matters. He retained a wonderful memory and he was comfortable with the intricacies of such puzzles as the Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Gaining an exhibition to Sydney University he then achieved well in a medical degree and chose General Practice. After three years he began his training in psychiatry at Bloomfield Hospital, Orange and Gladesville Hospital, Sydney. Having gained his Diploma in Psychological Medicine he became Deputy Superintendent at Kenmore Hospital Goulburn and then at Gladesville. He was a Foundation Member of the ANZ College of Psychiatrists.</p>
<p>He was Superintendent of Watt St, the main psychiatric hospital in Newcastle, for 18 years. During that period, in 1968, he bought a farm at Kendall, in the Mid North Coast. Subsequently he pioneered activities in the area with the Mental Health Service in Taree and continued to extend his clinical expertise around such places as Port Macquarie, Wauchope, and Wingham. At one time he was the only psychiatrist between Newcastle and Queensland.</p>
<p>His wife Peggy, in Laurieton, was his constant support and they had Anne, Bruce and Philippa, who provided them with nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He had the respect and affection of staff who worked with him and is greatly missed by close friends and colleagues.</p>
