<p><italic>Living with Violence</italic> is an anthology of everyday life through which communal riot is seen, understood and portrayed in a place called Dharavi, which is an overcrowded, poverty stricken and crime prone slum of Mumbai. In this book, Chatterji and Mehta attempt to provide a detailed account of the Mumbai riots of 1992–1993 between Hindus and Muslims, which began on the day of demolition of Babri Mosque (6 December 1992), and its consequential aftermath in terms of people’s narratives, relief and rehabilitation work; and most importantly, issues related to governance. By adopting a sociological standpoint, the book grounds the cause of communal violence as historically rooted, culturally sanctioned and socially approved in society. The central argument of the book is that violence is an integral part of everyday life and the study of everyday life can provide a passage to inner worlds of experience of people. Due to the unfaded bitter memories of India’s colonial past, entrenched suspicion, distrust and misunderstanding is crafted in the everyday lifeworld of people, eventually culminating in communal riots. The aftermath of the riots witnesses deeper division between Hindus and Muslims, which is reflected in the creation of ghettos on communal lines and transformation of public spaces of neighbourhood into zones of instability and insecurity, and labelling of each other’s localities by nomenclatures like the ‘Line of Control’, the ‘Hindustan–Pakistan border’ and the ‘Parliament of Pakistan’.</p>
<p>The volume is accredited with a forwarding note by the eminent anthropologist Veena Das, who has done exemplary work on the anthropology of violence, by recording the trauma and misery of riots in South Asia and its meaning for those who survived. Divided into six chapters, the book focuses on three major strands having communal violence as the focal point. To begin with, the book provides a detailed conceptual analysis, a brief narrative about the shanty town Dharavi, its communal past, its image in the eyes of the state, communal violence and its genealogical connection to colonialism, and how residents see each other in the neighbourhood, public spaces and everyday life. The authors hold that the details of ‘everyday’ provide an understanding of ‘ordinary’ people’s life and death. In view of a dearth of individual reporting agency, the authors argue, genealogy and analogy is the best method to peek into history and then trace its link with the present. Afterwards, they make an attempt to establish a genealogy of riots from the colonial period through to the Sri Krishna Commission Report (SCR), which considers communal riots a disease that awaits diagnosis. They highlight the SCR for usage of generic categories like ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’ and its representation of riots’ geography through an alphabetic listing and enumeration of riot-affected localities.</p>
<p>The second strand of the book is woven around the recording of people’s narratives and accounts of the way in which the course of communal violence and rehabilitation work that follows are understood by ordinary people. Violence is used by the authors as a prism through which the estranged everyday is viewed through narratives. For them, most importantly, relief work acts as a bridge between the communal violence and reformulated everyday life. The study found that the day-to-day survival of the people involves a denial of victimhood and silencing of suffering – which certainly suppress and cripple the individual and group identity. Surprisingly, it was observed in Dharavi that the restoration of normalcy after the riots augmented a culture of disarray in which a leading culprit of violence was found to be a member of a community-based organization engaged in rehabilitation work. In the post-riot scenario, the people were communally segregated, which became apparent in the division of neighbourhood on the basis of territorial boundaries and, as such, the division between nation and state is augmented by other divisions within localities.</p>
<p>The third and last strand of the volume evaluates violence associated with unstable habitation. Here, it examines some important policies and slum redevelopment schemes in the post-riot scenario and the role of NGOs and community-based organizations, which act as mediators between the state and slum dwellers. It also highlights how everyday is crafted in the course of violence and rehabilitation and the modalities through which negotiations by the slum dwellers over governmental schemes take place. For the authors, by exercising their rights to be heard, the residents claim their citizenship rights.</p>
<p>The book under review diverges from an earlier dominant practice of studying communalism on the basis of nature and cause of violence. It marks difference from the similar study done by Meena Menon, a journalist who studied the Mumbai riots covering the period February 2007 to November 2009 and published a book entitled <italic>Riots and After in Mumbai: Chronicles of Truth and Reconciliation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580912452370">2012</xref>). Menon used a novel approach combining historical records of the pre-independence era with personal interviews. Methodologically, the volume converges with Veena Das’s earlier study on violence, <italic>Mirror of Violence: Community, Riots and Survivors in South Asia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580912452370">1990</xref>) and her most recent <italic>Life and Words: Violence and Descent into the Ordinary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580912452370">2006</xref>), which, by focusing on everyday life, studies the moment of rupture enunciated through violence and its meaning for those who survive the misery. The book by Chatterji and Mehta seems to be methodologically sound and tries to connect theoretical acumen with the realities of everyday life based on people’s narratives and memories. But it has an ingrained problem. Individuals may be subjective; their memories can fade away with time. Memories can be concocted and coloured with other presuppositions. Individuals can also intentionally disguise information or provide misinformation, and are capable of masking their everyday life by altering certain inconvenient behavioural traits. Hence, the findings of the study may create doubts in light of inherent accuracy problems of sources. But overall, this is an interesting work and will prove to be a valuable addition for future research and debates in the area of communalism.</p>
