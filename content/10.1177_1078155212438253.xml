<abstract>
<sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>To determine the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant 250 mg compared to 500 mg in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and disease progression after antiestrogen therapy.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A Markov model was constructed to find the incremental cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant 250 mg monthly when compared with the 500 mg monthly in patients with progression after antiestrogen therapy. The model duration was 24 months. Clinical efficacy data inputs were derived from a phase III clinical trial demonstrating a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival in patients receiving 500 mg versus 250 mg. Cost data utilized were all relevant Ambulatory Payment Classification payment rates from the 2011 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to test the model at various willingness to pay thresholds.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title><p>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as determined by the Markov model was US$10,972 per month of progression-free survival for the 500 mg dose compared with the 250 mg dose. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, it was found that 500 mg monthly was cost-effective at and above the willingness to pay threshold of US$15,000 per month. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses showed this result is robust to geographical practice variations in costs of drug administration and physician examination.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>From a third party payer perspective, the value of fulvestrant 500 mg monthly is dependent on the willingness to pay threshold. Despite a labeling change for fulvestrant in September 2010, fulvestrant 250 mg monthly appears to be a viable option in the target population.</p></sec>

<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women in the United States (US), with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212438253">1</xref></sup> In 2010, there were an estimated 207,000 new cases and it is estimated that almost 40,000 women died of the disease in that same year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212438253">2</xref></sup> In 2006, the total cost of care for female breast cancer was nearly US$13.9billion, making it the most expensive type of cancer to treat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212438253">3</xref></sup> Although its incidence has decreased since 1990, likely as a result of earlier detection and improved treatment, breast cancer continues to impose a large financial burden in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212438253">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment options for invasive breast cancer include single agent or combination chemotherapy regimens with subsequent hormonal therapy for systemic disease. Despite the use of conventional chemotherapy regimens such as doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (A-C), few women with metastatic breast cancer will achieve complete response after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212438253">4</xref></sup> Histological testing has revealed the majority (77.9%) of breast cancers in women are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212438253">5</xref></sup> The presence of estrogen receptor (ER) typically renders the tumor responsive to hormonal therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212438253">6</xref></sup> In most women with metastatic disease, hormonal therapy is administered before chemotherapy, unless the disease is aggressive or involves the liver or lungs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212438253">7</xref></sup> While such hormonal therapy may decrease tumor size in some patients, this type of treatment generally works to inhibit further tumor growth, and to improve symptom control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212438253">7</xref></sup> In addition, patients with metastatic disease can benefit significantly from partial response or delay of progression, which may be afforded by hormonal agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212438253">8</xref></sup> Therapeutic options include nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole), a steroidal aromatase inactivator (exemestane), a pure antiestrogen (fulvestrant), selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen, toremifene), megestrol acetate, fluoxymesterone, and ethinyl estradiol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212438253">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fulvestrant (Faslodex®, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), an ER antagonist, competitively binds to the estrogen receptor causing downregulation of the receptor in breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212438253">10</xref></sup> In addition to competing with estrogens for receptor binding, fulvestrant renders the ER inactive and causes it to degrade. In patients with ER+ disease, use of fulvestrant produces antitumor effects without estrogen agonist activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212438253">11</xref></sup> This unique property differentiates fulvestrant from other hormonal therapies available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212438253">11</xref></sup> Fulvestrant is approved for administration in postmenopausal women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer who have relapsed following antiestrogen therapy, which is typically tamoxifen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212438253">12</xref></sup> Previous studies involving fulvestrant have shown it is at least as efficacious as other hormonal therapies, specifically aromatase inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212438253">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212438253">14</xref></sup> It has also shown promise in women with advanced disease that have progressed after heavy pre-treatment with cytotoxic and endocrine therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212438253">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CONFIRM trial, a phase III clinical study, evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) in patients given 500 mg monthly (with an additional loading dose in the first month) versus the previously approved monthly dose of 250 mg. Results from this trial showed a statistically significant increase in PFS in the 500 mg group (6.5 versus 5.5 months, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) with no notable difference in severity or incidence of adverse effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref></sup> The results of this trial led to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling change in September 2010. The new labeling suggested that all patients, in the absence of hepatic impairment, receive fulvestrant 500 mg once monthly, plus an additional loading dose in the first month, instead of the previously labeled dose of 250 mg once monthly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212438253">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant 250 mg compared to fulvestrant 500 mg from a third party payer perspective. There appear to be significant cost implications in this population, considering the additional drug cost of the 500 mg regimen and a relatively modest benefit in terms of PFS. There is currently a lack of comparative analysis of the two dosing regimens, and it is hoped that this model will provide additional evidence to inform decisions regarding ideal treatment options in this population.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155212438253"><title>Markov model</title>
<p>The population analyzed consisted of postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer who experienced relapse during or 1 year after completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy, as specified in the CONFIRM trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref></sup> Patients must have been previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor or antiestrogen therapy. Fulvestrant injection is typically administered as an outpatient procedure and does not require hospitalization. Therefore, the analysis was based on an ambulatory clinic visit including a physician examination and drug administration by a nurse or other healthcare practitioner.</p>
<p>A Markov model, constructed using TreeAge Pro 2011 (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA), was used in our analysis due to the progressive nature of metastatic cancers. Since 92% of patients had experienced progression by 24 months in the CONFIRM trial, we chose to construct a model with 24 one-month cycles. In addition, a cycle length of 1 month coincides with the dosing interval of fulvestrant. The model simulated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the treatment arms in terms of US dollars per month of PFS.</p>
<p>The treatment arms for comparison were a 250 mg regimen (one 250 mg injection on day 1 and day 29, then once monthly) and a 500 mg regimen (two 250 mg injections on day 1, day 15, day 29, then once monthly).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212438253">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212438253">17</xref></sup> Patients entered either arm of the model upon receiving the initial dose of either treatment regimen. Patients would continue to cycle monthly until evidence of disease progression, at which point they would continue to the terminal node and exit the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212438253">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1078155212438253" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Markov model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1078155212438253-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The Markov model is based on PFS, which was the primary endpoint of CONFIRM. The investigators of CONFIRM included overall survival as a secondary endpoint. While the study was not powered to detect a difference in overall survival between groups, the median time to death was 25.1 months and 22.8 months for patients receiving 500 mg versus 250 mg, respectively (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.91). The body of evidence supporting the use of fulvestrant in this population has demonstrated improvements in PFS or time-to-progression in patients treated with the drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212438253">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212438253">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212438253">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>As our analysis is from a third party payer perspective, costs considered were limited to payment for the drug, the drug administration, and physician examination fees. Costs due to adverse effects were omitted due to the relative similarity in incidence between patient groups in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212438253">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212438253">19</xref></sup> The most common adverse effects observed were GI disturbances, joint disorders, and injection site reactions, the majority of which were grade 1–2 in severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref></sup> All other costs associated with treatment of these side effects were not included because they were similar in both treatment regimens.</p>

<p>Efficacy data were obtained from the CONFIRM trial.

<sec id="sec6-1078155212438253"><title>Costs</title>
<p>All cost data were based on 2011 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212438253">Table 2</xref>). Medicare payment data were used due to its broad applicability, as private third party payer fees are variable. Costs relevant to treatment were fulvestrant injection, intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy administration, and physician examination. The APC payment rate for fulvestrant injection (25 mg) was calculated in order to represent the clinically relevant doses of 250 mg and 500 mg. For drug administration, an APC code for chemotherapy administration of a hormonal antineoplastic agent by the subcutaneous or IM route was selected. Previously, fulvestrant 250 mg was administered monthly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212438253">17</xref></sup> To account for the current FDA-approved dosing, payments for an additional 500 mg dose and chemotherapy administration were included for the first month of treatment with the 500 mg regimen. Since the patient will receive most injections at a monthly clinic visit, we accepted that patients in our model would incur one physician visit per month, except for the first month of treatment in the 500 mg arm, where they would have two physician visits. A number of physician exam fees are present in the APC payment system. Due to the complexity of cancer treatment and the time necessary for thorough evaluation by the physician, we felt APC 0607 was appropriate. The service provided under this code is an outpatient visit for evaluation and management of an established patient, including at least two of three components: a comprehensive history, a comprehensive examination, and medical decision making of high complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212438253">21</xref></sup> This code has been cited in a similar cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212438253">22</xref></sup> Discounting was applied for all costs incurred during the second year of analysis at a rate of 3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212438253">23</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec7-1078155212438253"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>In order to determine the robustness of our analysis, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis to measure changes in key variables with uncertainty including cost of drug, physician examination, and chemotherapy administration, as well as probability of PFS. Since APC payment rates vary based on geography, the national payment rates were adjusted using minimum and maximum wage index figures. The lowest wage index for 2010 was for the state of Arkansas and the highest was for Santa Cruz, CA (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1078155212438253">Table A1</xref>). The probability of PFS was tested by varying the hazard ratio (HR 0.8) between the values of the 95% confidence interval (0.68–0.94).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212438253">16</xref></sup> A sensitivity analysis was performed considering potential variation in the four model inputs: drug administration cost, physician examination cost, drug product cost, and the HR for PFS.</p>

<p>The model determined that the costs per month for the 500 mg regimen and the 250 mg regimen were US$11,899 and US$4259, respectively. The duration of PFS was 16.78 months for the 500 mg regimen versus 16.08 months for the 250 mg regimen.

<p>A number of Monte Carlo simulations were run to test the model against varying monthly WTP thresholds. Examples A, B, and C each represent a random sampling of 1000 simulations in the Markov model. The ellipse represents the 95% confidence interval. In example A, 100% of samples exceeded a WTP threshold of US$5000. In example B, 77% of samples exceeded a WTP threshold of US$10,000, and in example C, 1% of samples exceeded a WTP threshold of $15,000.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1078155212438253"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which variables affected the outcome of the model most significantly. The ICER was found to be most sensitive to variation in the cost of fulvestrant followed by the HR for PFS. The results of the model were robust to changes in drug administration cost and physician examination cost.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1078155212438253" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to changes in labeling for fulvestrant based on results from the CONFIRM trial, we felt there was a need for investigation into the cost-effectiveness of the newly approved 500 mg dose versus the previously indicated 250 mg. While the authors of the CONFIRM trial conclude that treatment with 500 mg is associated with significantly longer PFS than with 250 mg, it also results in a substantially higher cost. Considering an incremental gain of about 21 days (0.7 months) in the 500 mg arm with an incremental cost of about US$7680, the ‘value’ of this intervention will be debated. When analyzing the ICER scatter plot reflecting the Monte Carlo analysis, the probability of cost-effectiveness of the 500 mg regimen is dependent on the WTP threshold. If the payer is willing to spend US$15,000/month (US$180,000/year) on treatment, the 500 mg regimen is cost-effective in 99% of the Monte Carlo simulations. However, at a WTP threshold of US$10,000/month (US$120,000/year), the 500 mg regimen would be cost-effective in only 23% of the simulations.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding treatment with fulvestrant may be affected by variation in the financial demographics of a patient population. A third party payer could consider the incremental cost-effectiveness of the 500 mg regimen when determining drug coverage. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) do not typically incorporate cost-effectiveness studies in decision making involving patient care, other nations have adopted this type of analysis as a means of justifying changes in guidelines and formulary management. For example, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom includes the cost-effectiveness of various drugs in guidance to practitioners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155212438253">24</xref></sup> This may become increasingly important as healthcare expenditures in the US are reaching unsustainable levels, and the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has led to discussion of implementation of cost-saving standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212438253">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note the limitations of our primary source of data, the CONFIRM trial. Patients with extensive liver and lung disease or brain metastases were excluded, which may restrict the generalizability of the results. Patient demographics were limited, with only age and sex described. Racial composition may have affected the study results, although uncertainty remains on the impact of race on prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212438253">26</xref></sup> Presence of ER+ disease was not confirmed and was based on original diagnosis, which could impact efficacy data as fulvestrant is active only against ER+ tissue. While the CONFIRM trial demonstrated improved PFS, it should be noted that conditions outside the controlled environment of a clinical trial can influence the results. It was not powered to detect the influence of covariates on the primary endpoint. The duration between discontinuation of previous antiestrogen therapy and use of fulvestrant was not accounted for and may have had an impact on response. A number of patients may have possessed or developed resistance to hormonal therapy, which would render them unresponsive to fulvestrant.</p>
<p>Our analysis relied on several assumptions, which may limit its applicability. First, all costs were based on Medicare OPPS payment rates. While many patients in our target population may qualify for Medicare benefits, others are covered by private third party payers with alternative payment structures. The type of physician examination that was used would also influence the total cost of treatment. For example, an APC payment rate for a shorter, less complex physician examination would incur less cost. However, these changes would apply to each arm equally and the relative differences would not change. We assumed a national average for OPPS payment rates. Payers could consider this variation when making formulary decisions; however, our findings suggested that the relative relationship between the two treatment options would not change.</p>
<p>While there is no ‘gold standard’ ICER threshold for cost-effectiveness, there are many differing opinions on the subject. One widely used value, while considered by some to be arbitrary, is US$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212438253">27</xref></sup> A recent review of cost-utility analyses in oncology found the median ICER (US$ per QALY) to be US$27,000 among 86 studies of patients with breast cancer, reported in 2008 US$.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212438253">28</xref></sup> While these values are not adjusted for inflation to the present, there is literature to support much higher thresholds. In 2008, investigators proposed values between US$183,000 and US$264,000 per life-year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078155212438253">29</xref></sup> Still, others propose an upper limit of US$129,090 per QALY, which reflects the cost of 1 year of renal dialysis for a single patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212438253">30</xref></sup> These values would support the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant 500 mg in the model presented here.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our analysis identified the incremental cost-effectiveness between treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg and fulvestrant 500 mg. The results of our cost-effectiveness analysis did not take into account quality of life, which would significantly impact the final calculated ICER. It should be noted that the CONFIRM trial concluded that quality of life was similar between patient groups. Therefore, we considered WTP thresholds and not cost per QALY values as a means of testing our model. For this reason, our results cannot be directly compared to other studies that have reported results in terms of US dollars per QALY. The perceived value of PFS when similar quality-of-life exists depends on a variety of factors that cannot be expressed in cost-effectiveness analyses.</p>
<p>In addition, variability among stakeholders is of concern, as different stakeholders may be willing to spend higher or lower amounts on treatment for patients with cancer. Increasing attention is being paid to cancer health disparities and the associated economic burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078155212438253">31</xref></sup> Recent recommendations from the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities include identifying changes in the healthcare delivery system that may decrease associated economic burden and inclusion of cost-effectiveness analyses in clinical trials and other intervention studies that address disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078155212438253">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses, specifically in cancer research, are important in assessing the value of various therapies and provide another input into decisions made by third party payers. When considering this type of analysis in the setting of coverage of drugs, such as fulvestrant, third party payers may also take into account potential variations in relevant costs and patient clinical characteristics. Future cost-effectiveness analyses would be valuable in further defining the role of fulvestrant in this population, with the ultimate goal of balancing prudent use of resources with potential improvements in survival.</p>
