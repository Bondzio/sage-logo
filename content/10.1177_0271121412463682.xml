<title>Issue 33:3 Families, Family Support and Early Intervention</title>
<p>An understanding of family functioning in the context of disability and early intervention is crucial as the field seeks to improve its responsiveness to family needs and its ability to provide effective supports for families. This issue will focus on the broad issue of families and the ways that families interact with their children, with early intervention practitioners and with the systems that encompass early childhood and early intervention services. Topics that manuscripts might address include family perceptions, family-centered interventions, involvement of siblings, family quality of life, home visiting, and programs that offer innovative services in building on family strengths and supporting families in their efforts to promote their children’s development. We welcome submission of manuscripts that include descriptions of empirical research, reviews and syntheses of the literature, and discussions of pertinent policies, programs, and conceptual perspectives. <italic>Due Date: January 31, 2013</italic></p>
