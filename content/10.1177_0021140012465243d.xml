<p>Hans Boersma teaches theology at Regent College in Vancouver. Coming from an evangelical background, he has written on the <italic>Nouvelle Théologie</italic> and Sacramental Ontology, as well as the Atonement tradition. This book is aimed at evangelical readers and is ‘a somewhat more popular account which—with a particular eye toward an evangelical audience—would spell out the theological implications that I believe <italic>nouvelle théologie</italic> continues to have’ (p. xi). In this study he is calling Western Christians back to a sacramental framework and mindset, which he feels they have strayed too far away from: ‘The rise of modernity corresponded with the decline of an approach that regarded the created order as sacramental in character. The patristic and medieval mind recognized that the heavenly reality of the Word of God constituted an eternal mystery; the observable appearances of creation pointed to and participated in this mystery’ (p. 17). The book is both a continuation and a popularization of Boersma’s earlier study: <italic>Nouvelle Théologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), and reviewed in this journal by Gabriel Flynn, <italic>Irish Theological Quarterly</italic> 75 (2010) pp. 225–7.</p>
<p>Part One of the book outlines the contours of this ‘tapestry’ in Early Christian writers and later medieval ones. Boersma reminds us that this viewpoint was rooted in a Platonist–Christian synthesis. Chapters three and four of this part discuss how later medieval developments began to unravel this synthesis and how it is finally reconfigured in the Reformations of the 16th century (Chapter five). It is the reconfiguring of the relationship between nature and supernature that prevents the restoration of this sacramental tapestry. In surveying contemporary evangelicals Boersma finds that their uncritical acceptance of postmodernity has led them towards a sceptical worldview and an inability to embrace the sacramental mystery: ‘I am convinced that postmodernism is simply the natural outcome of modernity, both of them predicated on a desacramentalized universe; and I believe that the solutions to our problem hardly lie in evangelical accommodation to contemporary cultural trends. Instead, as Protestants, we need to relearn to see the world with sacramental eyes’ (pp. 98–99).</p>
<p>In Part Two, Boersma turns to his theology of heavenly participation; in order for him to proceed, he must reconnect the shattered threads of a medieval Platonic–Christian synthesis. To retrieve a sacramental ontology, he claims, leads to a focus on Christology in every branch of the theological enterprise. In examining the links between the Eucharist and the Church, Boersma sees the Church as a sacrament of the fullness of Christ. Tradition is the topic of Chapter seven. In Chapter eight the focus is on how scripture is interpreted sacramentally, which leads to a consideration of truth in Chapter nine. Theology as a participation in the life of Christ is the focus of Chapter ten. It is in this second part of the book that Boersma uses much of his study of the <italic>nouvelle théologie</italic>.</p>
<p>An Epilogue, entitled ‘Christ-Centred Participation,’ concludes the book. In this, Boersma outlines a way forward beyond the desacramentalizing of modernity. Only in recapturing sacramental ontology is the split of the Reformation finally overcome for Boersma. This is a return to the central theme of Christology. ‘Christology, then, lies at the heart of the Christian transposition of the Platonic tradition. Past, present, and future cohere in Christ, the eternal Word become flesh. The Incarnation becomes the norm and standard that reaches backward and forward, redeeming past, and future through God’s gracious entry into the created order’ (p. 188). Boersma’s is an ideal book for students to engage with one of the great movements in contemporary theology and an impassioned call to heal the rift of a divided Christianity.</p>
