<abstract>
<p>From 1997 until his retirement in 2011, Michel Hersen served as the dean of the School of Professional Psychology (SPP) at Pacific University in Oregon. Through teaching, supervision, and modeling, Michel promoted his vision of a professional school that could compete on the national stage. He grew the program from a regional focus to one with a strong national presence through careful faculty hires and by anticipating national trends in diversity issues and interprofessional education. His decisions as an administrator were sometimes counterintuitive and challenged the status quo, but they often were correct and advanced the program. His footprint as an administrator was quite large and will be difficult to fill. The SPP benefited greatly from his leadership, and it will continue to grow by following the plans he set in place for us.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Did Michel Hersen know what he was getting into when, in 1997, he moved across the country to become dean of a professional psychology program located in a small town named Forest Grove, Oregon? Did his training and subsequent years of work in programs designed to produce academicians and researchers prepare him for the decisions he would have to make as the top administrator of a practitioner-oriented program? He joined a small but well-established, stable, and vocal group of core faculty members who fully embraced the professional psychology training model. The decisions Michel made throughout his tenure as dean of the School of Professional Psychology (SPP) at Pacific University from 1997 to 2011 were sometimes counterintuitive, and occasionally provoked controversy among faculty. Yet, his leadership was often prescient and forward thinking, propelling the program to greater heights of excellence. His decisions were always made in the best interest of the School as a whole and the results clearly attest to his success as the dean of a professional psychology program.</p>
<p>Professional psychology has a relatively short history compared with programs focusing on producing researchers and academicians. In 1963, the American Psychological Association (APA) commissioned a committee to examine the scientific and professional goals of psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512453736">Stricker, n.d</xref>.). This committee recommended that two separate but equal pathways be established within graduate education in clinical psychology. The traditional research pathway would be maintained, with students trained in this model receiving the doctorate in philosophy degree (PhD). In addition, a new practitioner pathway would be established, with students trained in this model receiving the doctorate in psychology degree (PsyD). Following this recommendation, the first practitioner program was started in 1968 by Donald Peterson. In 1973, APA sponsored the Conference on Levels and Patterns of Professional Training in Psychology (known as the Vail Conference), in which the PsyD degree was endorsed as the recommended degree for psychology practitioners. Professional psychology grew rapidly but somewhat haphazardly immediately following the Vail Conference. In response to the burgeoning growth of professional programs with somewhat undefined curriculums, in 1976 Nicholas Cummings called 19 professional programs to join together with the goal of developing a cohesive definition of training and education in professional psychology. In 1986, this group, now known as the National Council of Schools and Programs in Professional Psychology (NCSPP), sponsored a conference in Mission Bay in which the standards for professional education and training were adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512453736">Dobbins, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512453736">Peterson, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512453736">Peterson, Peterson, Abrams, &amp; Stricker, 1997</xref>). Currently, NCSPP is the main advocacy group and training council for the growing number of professional psychology programs. There are now 66 accredited professional psychology programs across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512453736">APA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Having worked so long in programs that produced academicians and researchers, Michel was keenly aware of the negative bias held by some psychologists who had been trained in PhD programs about their peers who had been trained in a PsyD program. He was determined to have students from the SPP at Pacific University compete successfully with students from traditional PhD programs for internships, postdoctoral positions, and, eventually, jobs. He set his sights high, often stating that he wanted SPP to become the “number one professional psychology program in the country” in an attempt to motivate faculty members to set and maintain high expectations of themselves and their students. During his tenure as dean, Michel realized his ambitions to see SPP’s graduates compete on the national stage. SPP’s students are successful in obtaining internships at a level higher than the national average, and they obtain internships and postdoctoral positions around the country in prestigious places (e.g., Johns Hopkins, Stanford). Surveys find that the majority of our graduates are licensed and are working in the field, many in high-level administrative positions within agencies. Every year, we attract applicants to our program from around the country. Many of these applicants have encountered our graduates and then want to come to SPP. In other words, Michel moved our program onto another playing level, and our students and graduates have reaped the benefits.</p>
<p>He did not accomplish these outcomes without the inevitable struggles that come from organizational change and the pursuit of new directions. Michel restructured a number of things about the SPP, sometimes with resistance from current faculty members. Yet, his commitment to new directions and a clear vision for a stronger program carried the day. Michel could see the various options available and weigh the pros and cons more quickly than most people, and his rapid and decisive decision-making style illustrated that. In the end, the majority of his decisions were correct, in that they ended up advancing the program and its national reputation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145445512453736">
<title>Major Interventions</title>
<p>To transform SPP from a small, regionally focused program to one that competes on the national stage, Michel intervened in two main areas. First, he increased resources overall, including increasing the number of faculty members and the number of students as well as the availability of quality-controlled clinical training opportunities for the students. Second, he continually focused faculty discussions on national trends, including diversity and interprofessional education, often anticipating these developments by several years.</p>
<sec id="section3-0145445512453736">
<title>Resources</title>
<p>The majority of professional psychology programs are tuition driven, meaning that resources derive primarily from tuition dollars rather than state or federal dollars or grant funding. To increase resources for SPP, Michel had to increase tuition dollars. He accomplished this primarily by increasing the numbers of students in the program. When he came to the SPP, the doctoral program admitted approximately 25 students each year. Michel slowly and thoughtfully increased this number over the years, and in 2011, approximately 56 students were admitted annually to the doctoral program. In addition, in 1999, Michel helped to start a terminal master’s program at SPP (master’s in counseling psychology), which now enrolls approximately 40 students per year. Finally, he was the driving force behind the recent adoption of a PhD program within SPP; this program is set to accept its first cohort of students in 2013 and should add approximately 7 new students every year.</p>
<p>Michel utilized these increased tuition dollars first and foremost to hire additional qualified core faculty members, with the goals of expanding curriculum offerings as well as the number of clinical supervisors available to students. In 1997, there were only 7 core faculty members, and most were not engaged in clinical supervision of practicum students. Michel hired continually throughout his time as dean; before he retired in 2011, there were 25 core faculty members, and the majority had as part of their workload clinical supervision of practicum students. This large number of faculty members also allowed the program to begin offering tracks or concentrations for students, so that they could be competitive for internships, postdoctoral positions, and jobs in such growing areas as health psychology, forensic psychology, organizational consulting psychology, and neuropsychology, or with growing populations, such as children/adolescents or Latinos.</p>
<p>In addition to increased numbers of core faculty members, Michel utilized the increased tuition revenue to secure another very important resource: access to quality-controlled practicum training for all SPP doctoral students. When he arrived at SPP, administrators were in negotiations to sell SPP’s internal training clinic (the Psychological Service Center) to a community agency. As all administrators know, training clinics are expensive to operate, and, at that time, SPP badly needed revenue to cover expenses of clinical facilities and programs. Michel saw the selling of the clinic as a short-term fix rather than the answer to long-term budgetary problems. He decided to keep the clinic under our internal control and within SPP’s budget, seeing it as mandatory for excellent training for our students. He also decided to staff the clinic with core faculty members rather than part-time community supervisors, believing that oversight by core faculty members was needed for quality control. Moving core faculty members’ workloads substantially so that they could focus their time on supervising students during a time of budget problems was a risky move, but it paid off in the long run. Now SPP has two internal training clinics, one in downtown Portland and one in Hillsboro, Oregon, a community about 20 miles west of Portland. First-year practicum students are, by and large, supervised solely by core faculty members and see a variety of adult and child cases. We currently have 13 teams of students focusing on interventions and 3 teams of students focusing on assessment, all of which are supervised by core faculty members. The clinics are run by a director and an associate director, both core faculty members. Michel put considerable resources into the clinic, believing that a practitioner program should and must have a strong clinical training component.</p>
<p>Finally, Michel utilized the resources at his disposal to support the main mission and goals of NCSPP. He showed his continual support for the institution by annually budgeting for NCSPP dues and the substantial costs of sending core faculty members to its annual conferences. In addition, he regularly devoted time in faculty meetings and retreats to discuss developments at the national level that had been introduced at NCSPP conferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145445512453736">
<title>National Trends</title>
<p>Michel made certain that SPP stayed ahead of the curve on national issues. NCSPP has diversity as one of its core components, meaning that all students in professional programs should receive training and education in diversity issues. However, NCSPP did not add diversity as a core component of training until 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512453736">NCSPP, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512453736">2010a</xref>). Michel focused on diversity early in his tenure as dean of SPP, taking swift and decisive action on the topics of how to recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds, as well as how to ensure that all students received quality education and training on diversity issues. He created a position within SPP titled director of human diversity, and he appointed one core faculty member to that position. He ensured that the person filling this position had the time and resources needed to be successful. First, he restructured the faculty member’s workload so that she could truly focus on diversity issues. Second, he made sure that the position was represented within SPP’s executive committee (EC). The EC consisted of faculty members with leadership positions within the program (e.g., director of clinical training, director of academic issues); the group met monthly to set the faculty meeting agenda and to provide advice to the dean. By including the director of human diversity on this influential committee, Michel ensured that diversity issues were considered throughout the whole program. Michel charged the director of human diversity with developing a long-term plan for increasing the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty and students. In addition, Michel charged this director with increasing coverage of diversity topics within the curriculum and increasing exposure to diverse clients within the program’s clinical training sequence.</p>
<p>Michel’s efforts have yielded impressive results. For example, diversity is now better represented within the faculty and student bodies. In 1997, only 1 out of 7 faculty members was a member of an ethnic minority group, but, by 2011, this had increased to 6 out of 25. In 1997, only 6 incoming students were members of an ethnic minority group, but, by 2011, this rose to 14 incoming students. In addition, all course syllabi and practicum experiences now contain a diversity component, which includes required readings on diversity topics and discussions of diversity issues interwoven throughout each lecture. Finally, Michel recognized that Latinos were becoming an increasing percentage of our population, and that their mental health needs were largely ignored. To rectify this issue, he was instrumental in starting our Latino Bilingual track, wherein students could focus on improving their knowledge, skills, and awareness of the needs of the Latino community. He was also instrumental in opening a second in-house training clinic staffed by our practicum students in Hillsboro, Oregon, an area with a large Latino population. Some of the supervision in this clinic is conducted in Spanish, as are some of the clinical sessions with clients.</p>
<p>In addition to diversity issues, Michel was ahead of the national trend toward interprofessional education. NCSPP had its first conference on interprofessional education in 2010, focusing on how psychologists can become more integral players in the health care field by training students in health care settings and with other health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512453736">NCSPP, 2010b</xref>). Michel advocated for this type of education and was named the Founding Dean of Pacific University’s College of Health Professions (CHP), which was formed in 2004. As part of his duties, Michel helped unite what had been separate schools (e.g., occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistant studies, and SPP) into one college with the central theme of educating future health professionals. He also worked to consolidate the separate schools into one location in Hillsboro, Oregon, in 2010 to improve collaboration across the professions. Such collaboration now includes the interprofessional case conferences that are held 6 times per year for all CHP students and faculty, as well as the required interprofessional course taken by all 1st-year CHP students. It also includes the new online journal produced by CHP, titled <italic>Health and Interprofessional Practice</italic>, which focuses exclusively on interprofessional research. None of these things would have been possible without Michel’s early work and dedication to interprofessional education.</p>
