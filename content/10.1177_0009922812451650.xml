<abstract>
<p>This study determined the incidence of cardiac diagnoses demonstrably related to chest pain in young patients and determined whether those with exertional chest pain were more likely to have a cardiac diagnosis. It evaluated the course of patients with chest pain after pediatric cardiology evaluation regarding interventions, outcomes, and additional test burden. This was a retrospective study of 203 patients with an office pediatric cardiology assessment of chest pain from January 2000 through December 2004. Fifteen patients (7.4%) had cardiac diagnoses, 5 (2.5%) had cardiac diagnoses demonstrably related to their chest pain complaints (arrhythmias, mitral valve prolapse), and none had ischemia. Exertional chest pain, in this study, did not increase the risk of having a cardiac diagnosis. Following evaluation, 80% of patients did not return for complaints of chest pain. Ten percent had 2 or more additional visits to any medical site for chest pain but no additional cardiac diagnoses were found.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chest pain in children and adolescents is a common complaint in the primary care setting that generates anxiety in patients and their parents who worry that the child has underlying heart disease. In contrast to the adult population, where chest pain more commonly reflects angina, coronary insufficiency, or myocardial infarction, chest pain in young patients generally reflects a noncardiac cause. Serious cardiac diagnoses can present with chest pain but are uncommon, as shown in early studies by Driscoll et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812451650">1</xref></sup> and Pantell and Goodman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812451650">2</xref></sup> and recently by Kane et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812451650">3</xref></sup> Fyfe and Moodie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812451650">4</xref></sup> and Selbst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812451650">5</xref></sup> have reported on the distribution of diagnoses in children and adolescents with chest pain, finding that approximately 5% had cardiac diagnoses, while the majority were idiopathic or of musculoskeletal origin. Despite studies indicating that the vast majority of children with chest pain, especially chronic pain, have noncardiac explanations for their chest pain, patients are often referred for pediatric cardiology evaluations to rule out a cardiac cause in what is for patients and parents a stressful, frustrating, and costly experience.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine, in children and adolescents seen in our pediatric cardiology practice for chest pain, the number of patients whose chest pain complaints were of cardiac origin; to investigate whether children with exertional chest pain in this population were more likely to have cardiac diagnoses; and to study the longer term outcomes of all of these patients, in terms of cardiovascular interventions, further follow-up for chest pain, the additional test burden, and any late cardiovascular events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812451650">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This is a retrospective record review of 203 patients between 4 and 18 years old who were referred to pediatric cardiology for a first assessment of chest pain. They were referred by primary care providers within Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a multispecialty group practice in the Greater Boston area, from January 2000 through December 2004. Patients with previously recognized cardiovascular diagnoses, including congenital heart disease, and patients previously evaluated for chest pain (pediatric cardiologist, emergency department, hospitalization) were excluded. The evaluation consisted of history, physical examination, and an electrocardiogram. Additional studies (24-hour electrocardiogram, event monitor, echocardiogram, and exercise testing) were obtained on a case-by-case basis to answer specific questions raised in the initial assessment. Use of the electronic medical record made evident, for each patient, the sequence of all medical visits from the initial evaluation of chest pain until 5 years after the end of the study period unless the patient had left Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates medical care; the follow-up period was of 5 to 10 years duration. Continuous data are shown as mean ± standard deviation. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare proportions of patients with cardiac diagnoses in different groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In all, 203 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study (119 males, mean age 12.2 ± 4.0 years and 84 females, mean age 11.6 ± 3.9 years). The distribution of diagnoses among patients who were seen for an initial pediatric cardiology evaluation of chest pain is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812451650">Table 1</xref>. The musculoskeletal category was the largest (44%) and included patients with costochondritis (n = 21), precordial catch syndrome (n = 36), and other musculoskeletal diagnoses (n = 33). In the idiopathic category (36%), patients had neither an obvious cardiac diagnosis nor a specific noncardiac diagnosis. The remaining patients with noncardiac diagnoses were in the pulmonary (bronchospasm, exercise-induced asthma), gastrointestinal (gastroesophageal reflux), and psychogenic categories (anxiety, panic disorder). Fourteen patients were found to have cardiovascular diagnoses at the initial pediatric cardiology evaluation. One additional patient was found to have a cardiovascular diagnosis at a second pediatric cardiology visit (footnote b, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812451650">Table 2</xref>). No additional patients were found to have a cardiovascular diagnosis at subsequent visits to any medical sites.</p>

<p>All patients with cardiovascular diagnoses (n = 15, 7.4%) are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812451650">Table 2</xref>. We sought to determine a relationship between the cardiac diagnosis and the chest pain symptom for each patient by finding a temporal connection between the 2 on a specific cardiovascular study (eg, chest pain at the time of narrow complex tachycardia documented by event monitor). Five patients had such a relationship (cases 1-5); 2 needed intervention (pharmacological therapy for ventricular ectopy, catheter ablation for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia). In case 4, the clinical findings of mitral valve prolapse were intermittent as reported by the examiner; as they became audible to the patient, they were temporally associated with the appearance of chest pain. We do not know whether the chest pain was from some aspect of the mitral valve prolapse or from anxiety associated with suddenly hearing the squeaky sound. The rare ventricular ectopy and the brief ventricular tachycardia reported on the 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) were not temporally related to the chest pain and were unlikely to be causative. In 4 patients (cases 6-9), a temporal relationship between the cardiac diagnosis and the chest pain symptom was not demonstrated at the time of any specific studies; however, we considered that a connection was possible although none was found during the time period of any specific study. These patients warranted further pediatric cardiology follow-up; none needed intervention. Among 6 patients (cases 10-15), a relationship was not demonstrated between the cardiac diagnosis and the chest pain symptom on specific cardiovascular studies; in each of these cases, the cardiac diagnosis was judged unlikely to be associated with the chest pain symptoms. Two of these patients needed intervention (catheter ablation for an accessory pathway associated with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and pharmacological therapy for systolic hypertension).</p>
<p>Forty-six patients complained of exertional chest pain (22.7%). Within this group, 4 patients (8.7%) had a cardiovascular diagnosis (footnote a, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812451650">Table 2</xref>); of the 157 patients with nonexertional chest pain, 11 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular diagnosis. The proportion of patients with cardiovascular diagnoses was compared for the 2 groups using Fisher’s exact test (differences not significant). Eleven of the 46 patients with exertional chest pain underwent exercise testing; none had abnormal exercise studies although 2 patients experienced chest pain near peak exercise. Two of the 157 patients with nonexertional chest pain underwent exercise studies; neither had an abnormal study. No patients in this study had evidence of any ischemic changes.</p>
<p>We found that 80% of patients (151 of 189) without identifiable cardiovascular diagnosis at initial pediatric cardiology evaluation did not return to any medical site for further complaints of chest pain (median follow-up 81 months, range 0-122 months). Overall, 9.5% of patients (18 of 189) returned for one additional visit to any medical site for chest pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812451650">Figure 1</xref>). As noted earlier, one patient was found to have a new cardiovascular diagnosis. The 18 additional visits were spread evenly among 3 sites: 6 at pediatric cardiology, 6 at pediatrics, and 5 at emergency departments. Following the one additional visit for recurrent chest pain, the patients of this group did not visit any medical site for chest pain (median follow-up 35 months, range 0-95 months). Ten percent of patients (19 of 189) returned for 2 to 6 additional visits for chest pain to any medical site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812451650">Figure 2</xref>); of these, 4 patients initially in the “idiopathic” group were assigned a noncardiac diagnosis at the last recorded visit for chest pain. Following the last recorded visit for chest pain, no patient went to any medical site for chest pain (median follow-up 42 months, range 0-122 months). There were 52 additional visits, 31% each to pediatric cardiology and to emergency departments, and 38% to pediatrics.</p>

<p>At the initial pediatric cardiology evaluation, each patient had an ECG. Echocardiograms were obtained in 21.2% (n = 31) of patients. Exercise testing was performed in 6.4% (n = 13), nearly all of whom had complained of exertional chest pain. 24-hour ECGs and event monitors were obtained in 7.9% and 3.4% of patients, respectively. Except for ECGs, very few additional tests were obtained in those patients who returned for one additional visit to any medical site for chest pain. In contrast, the cardiovascular test burden of patients having two or more additional visits to any medical site for chest pain was considerably greater. Seventeen of 19 patients in this group had additional cardiovascular testing; nearly all had additional ECGs; 10 of 19 had other studies, including 6 echocardiograms and 4 exercise tests. Despite the increased cardiovascular test burden in this group, no additional cardiovascular diagnoses were found. Except for repeated ECGs, there was no duplication of cardiovascular studies among the patients in this group despite the multiple visits to different sites.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922812451650" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rationale for this study was to examine a basic question: Among young patients referred to pediatric cardiology for chest pain, how often is a cardiac diagnosis identified and also demonstrably related to the chest pain symptom? We attempted to establish this relationship by looking for a temporal connection between the cardiac diagnosis and the chest pain symptom on a specific study. It was conceivable to us that there might not be any such cases. The 2.5% incidence of cardiac diagnoses related to specific chest pain complaints was higher than we expected to find and for reasons other than ischemia. Ischemia in young patients is extremely rare but does occur (eg, coronary arterial anomalies, aorta to left ventricle tunnel, myocardial infarction as late complication of Kawasaki disease); however, none of our patients described typical angina symptoms or had evidence of ischemia. Neither a history of exertional chest pain nor the use of exercise testing helped identify patients with cardiac diagnoses in the present study, whereas ECGs and echocardiograms were the most helpful studies, after the clinical evaluation suggested structural cardiovascular lesions. Nearly all patients with cardiac diagnoses were identified at a first pediatric cardiology evaluation for chest pain.</p>
<p>One strength of this study was the use of the electronic medical record database of the multicenter group practice. Unlike previous studies which relied on questionnaires or physician-requested follow-up to a single office site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812451650">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812451650">7</xref></sup> the electronic medical record data provided comprehensive documentation of patients’ clinical status and visits to all medical sites, including outside referrals, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations throughout the study period and for 5 years afterward. Such data allowed us to accurately evaluate each patient’s clinical status over time, including the need for interventions, repeat visits for chest pain, and the additional test burden.</p>
<p>The distribution of diagnoses in our study population was similar to that reported previously. The vast majority (93%) did not have a cardiovascular diagnosis. This similarity was noteworthy because we had expected that studies of patients seen in the emergency department<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812451650">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812451650">2</xref></sup> or those seen in pediatric cardiology clinics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812451650">4</xref></sup> would have reported a higher percentage of cardiac diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses found in our study was similar to those reported by Selbst et al in retrospective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812451650">5</xref></sup> and in prospective studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812451650">8</xref></sup> Selbst et al also noted that cardiorespiratory diagnoses were more common in young children and anxiety was more common in adolescents; we did not observe that distinction in our population.</p>
<p>The musculoskeletal category accounted for nearly half of the patients with noncardiac diagnoses associated with their chest pain. Patients with costochondritis had a history of sternal pain and tenderness to palpation over one or more costochondral junctions. Patients with precordial catch syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812451650">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812451650">10</xref></sup> constituted the largest group within this category. This entity is easily recognized by history; it is characterized by sudden, sharp pain at or above the cardiac apex on inspiration, preventing a deeper breath; it commonly occurs in young persons when sitting or slouched, and resolves spontaneously. Patients with musculoskeletal diagnoses had physical findings which corroborated their symptoms.</p>
<p>Rhythm disorders accounted for the majority of cardiac diagnoses. Several diagnoses involved mitral valve structure or function. No new congenital heart lesions were identified. Kane et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812451650">3</xref></sup> retrospectively reviewed a hospital record database for 9 serious cardiac diagnoses (including coronary arterial anomalies, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, pericarditis, and others) over a 10-year period and found 41 of 484 patients with those entities who presented to a pediatric cardiology clinic with chest pain. In contrast to their findings, we did not see, during the 5-year study period, patients referred to our practice primarily for chest pain who had those entities. We did manage 14 patients with some of those cardiac diagnoses, who were first seen prior to the study period. One patient, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, presented with chest pain and an abnormal ECG. The remainder had no chest pain as part of their clinical course, and had been referred to our practice for other reasons. We found patients with coronary arterial anomalies who presented with syncope, an abnormal ECG, or mitral insufficiency. Although Kane et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812451650">3</xref></sup> reported a 70% incidence of exercise-induced chest pain in patients with coronary anomalies, we did not find any such patients presenting with chest pain in our study, possibly because of a relatively smaller sample size. We identified patients with cardiomyopathies through family history, arrhythmias, or abnormal ECGs. Echocardiographic imaging then confirmed the presence of cardiomyopathy and was the tool used to confirm all of the rare but serious cardiac diagnoses noted by Kane et al. In a recent study, Kakavand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812451650">11</xref></sup> reported that chest pain, dizziness, and syncope were the most common symptoms associated with frequent ventricular ectopy. In the present study, several patients described sharp, intermittent chest pain at times that corresponded to ventricular ectopy on 24-hour ECG monitoring. Several other patients with documented ectopy or supraventricular tachycardia described vague chest pain/pounding historically, but the complaints did not correlate specifically with 24-hour ECG monitoring.</p>
<p>We were surprised that the incidence of cardiovascular diagnoses in patients with exertional chest pain (8.6%) was similar to the patients with nonexertional chest pain (7.0%); we had expected the exertional chest pain group to have a greater incidence of associated cardiovascular diagnoses. Of the 4 patients who complained of exertional chest pain and had a cardiovascular diagnosis, only one had chest pain directly related to a cardiovascular process; none of these patients described angina symptoms. Of those patients who described exertional chest pain, approximately one fourth underwent exercise testing. Two of these patients reproduced their chest pain symptoms at or near peak exercise. Despite reproducible symptoms, no ischemic changes, rhythm disorders, or other significant electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in subsequent follow-up. Patients in the “exertional chest pain” group did not experience any cardiovascular complications, neither during the 5-year study period nor during an additional 5 years of follow-up.</p>
<p>Review of repeat visits for chest pain indicate that, following the initial pediatric cardiology evaluation, 88% of patients in the “idiopathic” group and 75% with noncardiac diagnoses did not return to pediatric cardiology or any medical site for further chest pain complaints. It is plausible that once reassured that there was no evidence of underlying heart disease, those patients did not seek out further medical advice for chest pain. These findings differ from those reported by Rowland and Richards,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812451650">6</xref></sup> who reported that 45% of patients with “idiopathic” chest pain had continued pain but had improved over a 4-year follow-up period; our findings also differ from those reported by Selbst et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812451650">7</xref></sup> who found 43% with persistent chest pain on follow-up. In the current study, a much smaller percentage of patients (9%) returned to any medical site for one additional visit regarding chest pain. The majority of patients in the “idiopathic” group received noncardiac diagnoses and did not return for further medical visits for chest pain. A slightly greater percentage of patients had two or more additional visits for chest pain (to primary care, pediatric cardiology, or an emergency department). Those patients underwent further cardiovascular testing but no new cardiac diagnoses emerged. All patients in the “idiopathic” group received noncardiac diagnoses and none returned subsequently for complaints of chest pain. None of the patients in the “idiopathic” group were later found to have a cardiac diagnosis, which is in agreement with the observations of both Rowland and Richards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812451650">6</xref></sup> and Selbst et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812451650">7</xref></sup> Perhaps most reassuring, there were no late cardiovascular events in any patients of the study population.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the history and description of chest pain, including events leading up to the chest pain, are crucial to the diagnoses of both cardiac and noncardiac causes. A careful clinical examination helped to identify the presence of ectopy or findings related to mitral valve prolapse or mitral regurgitation. One patient with mitral valve prolapse had considerable anxiety over audible sounds such as systolic clicks (the squeaky hinge sounds) and was relieved and reassured when the findings were explained. Eleven of 15 patients with a cardiovascular diagnosis for chest pain were identified by careful history and physical exam alone, demonstrating the importance of these sometimes undervalued parts of the cardiac evaluation. The ECG, echocardiogram, and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring (and not exercise testing) confirmed suspected diagnoses of ectopy or mitral valve disease in the 5 patients with chest pain demonstrably related to a cardiac cause in our study population.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Chest pain is a common complaint in children and adolescents and very rarely has a cardiac cause. We found a 7.4% incidence of cardiac diagnoses overall and a 2.5% incidence of cardiac diagnoses demonstrably related to specific chest pain complaints. All were secondary to rhythm disorders or mild mitral valve disease and not to ischemia. Neither a history of exertional chest pain nor the use of exercise testing helped identify the patients in our study with cardiac diagnoses. None had fever or signs of acute illness consistent with peri-myocarditis or ischemia (this subpopulation was likely referred to an emergency setting). We did not identify any patients with coronary anomalies, possibly because of the relative rareness of the entity and the sample size of this study. Eighty percent of patients in the noncardiac or “idiopathic” groups did not have further medical visits to any site for chest pain, following an initial pediatric cardiology evaluation. Only 10% returned for 2 or more visits; despite the additional test burden, no additional cardiac diagnoses were found and there were no late, cardiovascular events among any patients in the study population over a 5- to 10-year follow-up period. This study should provide reassurance to caregivers and patients that a cardiac diagnosis is not likely to be missed after an initial pediatric cardiology evaluation for chest pain. Considering the anxiety level surrounding chest pain in children and adolescents, it is striking that all the patients in this population fared very well.</p>
