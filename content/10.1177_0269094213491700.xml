<abstract>
<p>This article aims to assess the extent to which connectivity technology has contributed to home-based business activities of women in the North East of England. Based on an empirical survey of 98 women-owned home-based businesses, the article concludes that technology has reframed the concept of ‘home economics’, providing an effective medium for engaging women in the labour market. The article argues that home-based business venturing needs to be further promoted via appropriate policy channels and support networks as a viable and serious employment opportunity, as well as a solution to dual-role conflict experienced by some women who may otherwise be deterred from playing active roles in the local and regional economic development.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094213491700" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the turn of the 21st century ‘home’ has increasingly been viewed as the ‘place’ for significant economic activities, and the focus for much of the self-employment and business start-ups in the UK. The growth of home-based business (HBB) is increasingly viewed as one of the most radical forms of new work organisation in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094213491700">Enterprise Nation, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213491700">2009</xref>). It is now widely acknowledged that the rapid development of connectivity technologies has provided significant opportunities for e-flexible and home-working opportunities. Unlike hard technology that has, traditionally, been associated with ‘masculinity’, connectivity technologies such as Internet and cyberspace are increasingly viewed as ‘feminine media’: ‘providing the technological basis for a new form of society that is potentially liberating for women … due to the nature of connectivity technologies, women, rather than men, are uniquely suited to life in the digital age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213491700">Wajcman, 2009</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Based on a sample of 98 women-owned HBBs in the North East of England, this article aims to assess the impact of the adaptation of connectivity technologies on HBB venturing in that area, a region with the lowest level of HBB activities of any region in the UK and more so amongst women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213491700">Workhubs, 2012</xref>). The empirical results reported in this article focus on the North East of England, a peripheral region which, since the demise of the traditional industries during the 1970s and 1980s, has continued to face some persistent structural handicaps and socio-economic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213491700">ONS, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213491700">Phillipson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094213491700">Wynarczyk, 2005</xref>). Despite decades of public subsidies and some progress, the region has been unable to create and sustain a vibrant enterprise culture and is hence home to the lowest number of indigenous enterprises per 10,000 resident adult population of any English region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213491700">ONS, 2012a</xref>). The region also underperforms in a number of other key indicators, including a low level of innovation and productivity, fewer jobs in key service sectors, a lower level of managerial and professional positions and, above all, the highest rate of unemployment and lowest rate of economic activity of all English regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213491700">ONS, 2012a</xref>). According to the Labour Force Survey, between 2007 and 2012 female employment fell by 10,600, the steepest rate of decline in the country. This is almost certainly due to the fact that the North East has a disproportionate share of public sector employment and that women tend to be disproportionately employed in the public sector, and hence will suffer disproportionately from the Government’s current austerity drive. This article is underpinned by the premise that HBB is an effective and viable route for engaging women in the labour market and, hence contributing to revitalisation of local communities and regional economic development.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article consists of five sections. The first section provides an overview of the concept of the ‘workspace’ and is followed by an overview of the HBB and a specific section on gender and HBB. The fourth section focuses on the evolution of connectivity technologies. A description of the empirical data used, methods of analysis employed, research questions and empirical findings follow this. The key findings and policy implications, discussed in the final section, conclude the article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094213491700"><title>A shift in the concept of ‘workspace’</title>
<p>Pre the industrialisation era, the home and surrounding land existed largely as a focal point for work for men, women and children. Post industrial revolution and up to the late 20th century, the development of modern industry and the rise of the factory system resulted in the separation between ‘work’ and ‘home’ and, as the process continued, workers were hired on an ‘individualistic’ rather than a ‘household’ basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213491700">Krishan, 2005</xref>). As a result, women’s employment outside the home remained low until the early part of the 20th century since when it has risen more or less continuously and markedly so during two world wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213491700">Johnston et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of public workplaces during the 1920s resulted in clear separations and boundaries between ‘work’ and ‘domestic activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213491700">Krishan, 2005</xref>). The amount of hours someone was ‘seen’ to be at work, often equated to their level of commitment and visibility, was central to a command and control culture. Social networks were dominated by physical presence, whether that involved lunch in the canteen or trips to the pub after work. Moreover, status and hierarchy within organisations were often represented through physical location, with employees aspiring to ‘reach the top floor’. The physical separation between work and domesticity through the dominance of public workplace resulted in the disengagement of women, and often necessitated a choice to ‘attend’ work or ‘remain’ at home to attend to the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094213491700">Gornick and Meyers, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the public workplace has continued to be prevalent to the present day, since the turn of the 21st century a ‘virtual workspace’ concept has also emerged, complementing and, in some cases, replacing the physical workspace through technology. In particular, through virtual workspace, the physical place in which business transactions are undertaken has become secondary to the transactions themselves and detached from individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213491700">Felstead et al., 2005</xref>). Connectivity technologies such as laptop and associated software, cell phones, and high-speed broadband Internet and WiFi mean that where there is a signal, there is a potential business opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213491700">Rigby, 2008</xref>). In spatial terms, there is a hollowing out of the fixed organisational workspace and a polarisation towards the relocation of work into domestic space on the one hand and the dislocation of work into cyberspace on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213491700">Halford, 2005</xref>). This shift has re-opened the possibility of combining work with domestic responsibilities, through working from home. ICTs, in combination with a move to non-territorial offices, have revised home-working, moving it back to a historic work pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094213491700">Hardill and Green, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094213491700"><title>Home-based business</title>
<p>A home-based business is generally defined as a business that uses the family residential property as a substitute for commercial premises for the conduct of business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094213491700">Dwelly et al., 2005</xref>). In recent years there has been a burgeoning interest from policy makers, academics and practitioners in HBB, primarily driven by the fact that this enterprise/self-employed segment of the economic activity represents the largest and fastest growing subset of the overall business sector in the UK. In spite of the growth in volume and importance, there remains a lack of official statistics or database on HBBs in the UK as whole, let alone in its regional constitutes such as the North East. This is due to the fact that HBB is not recognised as a segment of the SME sector in ‘its own right’ and often viewed as ‘life style’ or ‘trivial’ businesses and, hence, they continue to remain, largely, ‘invisible’ and ‘under the radar’ and do not receive the policy attention they deserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213491700">Mason, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213491700">Mason et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213491700">Phillipson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, some attempt has been made to estimate the increasing proportion of HBBs. A report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213491700">Enterprise Nation (2009)</xref> estimated that there were around 2.8 million businesses operating full time from home, contributing some £284bn to the annual UK economy, with some noticeable regional variations, with the South East and London noted as the fastest growing regions for HBB start-ups, followed by the East of England, North West and West Midlands. In contrast, the North East region has reportedly the lowest number of HBBs of any region of England.</p>
<p>A recent survey of 1400 adults by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213491700">Lloyds TSB Business Insurance (2011)</xref> indicates that around 5.9 million businesses across the UK are based at home – with 27% of them new start-ups in 2010 alone. Most recent figures which demonstrate growth in the HBB marketplace are estimated in a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213491700">Workhubs UK in their Live Work Business Briefing 2012</xref>, based on analysis of Office of National Statistics Labour Force Survey data for the Fourth Quarter of 2011. The report finds that in 2011, the number of those running a business from home was up by 80,000 to 2.43 million people, representing more than 1 in 12 of those in work. In contrast, the number of traditional workers (commuting employees) decreased by around 100,000 to 23.7 million over the same period. Furthermore, the report claims that the North East is the region with the fastest growing ‘live/work workforce’, up 33% to 70,054. However, in 2012, the North East had only around 6.1% of its total workforce engaged in HBBs, compared with the national average of 8.2%. Moreover, in the North East men are far more likely than women to run a home/live business, 77% of all HBBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213491700">Workhubs, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of industry sectors, HBBs are believed to be ‘heterogeneous’. However, it has been suggested that the fastest growing HBB sectors have been found to be in business services (business consultancy, legal, accountancy, architecture/design, training, outsourced services) and consumer services such as arts/crafts, domestic repairs/services, beauty/wellness, tutoring, and caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213491700">Enterprise Nation, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The phenomenal rise in the number of HBBs has been attributed to several factors and opportunities they offer, including search for a better work-life balance, flexibility, rising property and energy costs, traffic congestion and commuting, unemployment, recent global financial crisis, economic downturn, and above all the availability of affordable Internet-based connectivity technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213491700">Halford, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213491700">Mason et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094213491700">Still and Walker, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, HHB is not without its challenges. There are several personal and professional barriers associated with operating a business from home that hinder growth, expansion and diversification. In general, HBBs lack access to specific business and IT support, face space constraints and additional administration burden in terms of, for example, recruitment of in-house staff, tax, business rates and insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213491700">Phillipson et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, balancing between work and life and flexibility, key advantages of HBB, are often viewed as disadvantages too, blurring the boundary between work and life and adding pressure on family relationships, through, for example, the extension of the long hour culture in the personal space of the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094213491700">Mann et al., 2000</xref>; Powerhomebiz, 2013).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094213491700"><title>Home-based business and gender</title>
<p>There are several reasons why HBB is an attractive self-employed and economic activity route for women. Existing research shows that caring and domestic responsibilities have presented a genuine barrier to labour market activities amongst women, therefore the opportunity to run a HBB from home, at least in part, erodes this barrier. The greatest attraction of a HBB for women is believed to be the flexibility that it offers to more effectively combine and accommodate both family commitment and economic activity under the same roof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213491700">Fondazione and Brodolini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213491700">Loscocco and Smith-Hunter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094213491700">Walker and Webster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094213491700">Walker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094213491700">Wynarczyk et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, setting up and running a business at home requires a relatively lower level of seed finance that women generally tend to find difficult to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213491700">Carter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213491700">Kirkwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094213491700">Loscocco and Robinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213491700">Loscocco and Smith-Hunter, 2004</xref>). It has been argued that a smaller start-up investment associated with HBBs also reduces more general personal and psychological risks perceived by women who tend to be, generally, more risk-averse than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094213491700">Hughes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094213491700">Walker and Webster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094213491700">Walker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the growth in HBB activities by women has resulted in some general stereotyping views and assumptions about the importance and contribution of HBBs to local and regional economic development. This could be associated with the fairly recent re-emergence of the home as a workplace, and an assumption that a HBB does not follow the traditional public workplace model which is associated with professional image and business success. It has been argued that using the home as the place for self-employment may provide the opportunity for the flexibility needed for women to balance work and caring responsibilities, but at the cost of potential sacrifices for the prosperity and growth of their business ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213491700">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094213491700">Walker et al., 2008</xref>). For example, it has been suggested that women have simply migrated lower skill jobs and activities, which are generally associated with the nature of women’s work, into the home environment. This ‘normalisation process’ is further reinforced by evidence that women have a tendency to set up their businesses in marginal and crowded sectors of the economy. Moreover, existing research suggests that this route to business ownership, i.e. setting up a business at home, is more likely to be on a ‘part-time’ or ‘casual’ basis, attracting those women who are briefly ‘trade testing’, those with ‘dedicated hobbies’ wishing to add to the family income, and/or those with the poorest background and prospects for success and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213491700">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094213491700"><title>Connectivity technology</title>
<p>It is now widely acknowledged that the rapid and on-going development and diffusion of connectivity technologies, both hardware and software systems, and more recently the emergence of ‘cloud-based technologies’, have dramatically transformed almost every aspect of human life. Connectivity technologies such as laptops and associated software, cell phones, smart phones, high-speed broadband Internet and WiFi have provided significant potential for e-flexible working opportunities, such as tele-working or other forms of home-working. In turn, these practices have been identified as key to the development of new forms of organisations such as call centres, dot.com enterprises, e-commerce and HBB. As a result, connectivity technologies have generated a lot of interest among researchers and policy makers<bold>,</bold> not only for their social influence, but also for their economic impact. The connectivity technology, and its associated impact on work-life balance, has long been promoted as a remedy for economic and social problems, such as skill shortages, labour market inactivity, remoteness of rural and peripheral areas, reduction of traffic congestion in cities and its related fuel consumption and environmental pollution, and provision of employment for the disabled and those, particularly women, with caring and domestic responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491700">Hotopp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213491700">Katz and Rice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213491700">POST, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094213491700">Wynarczyk, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp upward trend in the number of Internet users in the UK, mainly attributed to the development of wireless networks (WiFi) and latest new technologies such as smartphones and iPods that provide platforms for fast wireless networks around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213491700">Clickymedia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213491700">Techradar, 2010</xref>). In 2012, the number of daily adult Internet users stood at 33 million, more than double the 2006 figure of 16 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213491700">ONS, 2012b</xref>). It has been reported that Internet use is linked to key socio-economic and demographic indicators, including, for example, gender, age, location, marital status and education. There are, for example, some noticeable differences in the number of Internet users by regions with London having the highest rate (87% of adults) and the North East with the lowest number of Internet users (71%) of any region of the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491700">Broadband Choice, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the key areas of Internet activities amongst both female and male populations is believed to be the use of social media, or ‘social e-networking’, with 48% of both female and male adult Internet users posting messages to social networking sites or chat sites and blogs in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213491700">ONS, 2012b</xref>). This emergence of technology-based networks has removed reliance on ‘face-to-face’ and direct contact with peers and potential customers, introducing a whole new dimension to marketing for business, providing new routes to globalisation and opportunity for HBBs to compete on a level playing field with those organisations that maintain traditional workplace models. With over 500 million users worldwide, Facebook continues to dominate the social networking world, now available in 70 different languages with 30 billion pieces of content being shared each month, with slightly more women using Facebook compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213491700">Clickymedia, 2011</xref>). In 2011, there were around 106 million users of Twitter, with an estimated 300,000 people joining every day. In the UK, 36% of users are female and 64% male, compared to the US where 62% of users are female. Twitter has driven new standards in the immediacy of communications, with 92.4% of ReTweets and 96.9% of @Replies happening within the first hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213491700">shiftgroups, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0269094213491700"><title>Empirical investigation</title>
<p>This article builds upon a research project sponsored by the European Social Fund (ESF) Objective 3 Programme 2004–2008, Policy Field 5, Measure 2. This measure was specifically designed to reduce the level of disadvantage faced by women in the labour market. This research project aimed to investigate and identify barriers (direct and/or indirect) that constrained or did not otherwise enabled female participation and engagement in the e-flexible labour market in the North East of England. The project investigated the degree and extent to which HHB had the capacity to increase female rates of participation/economic activity, particularly in the rural areas (Northumberland sub-region), where HBB is more prevalent and women are more likely to be engaged in self-employment than women in the North East as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213491700">nomis, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of a publicly available database of HBBs in the North East of England, two female consultants working from home in the North East were recruited to assist in the identification of women-owned HBBs and collection of data. They managed to identify some 400 women-owned HBBs, via a combination of methods that included: consultation of several unofficial databases; attending networking events; placing adverts at local press; word of mouth; and personal contacts. However, only 98 out of 400 who were approach agreed to take part in the semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The consultants used a specifically designed questionnaire to guide discussions which covered the owner’s characteristics such as caring responsibilities, as well as their background (education and employment) prior to setting up and running a business at or from home, nature of the business. The interviews were carried out in 2005 and 2006 when some parts of the Northumberland sub-region lacked access to connectivity technologies such as mobile phone and high-speed broadband and, despite some improvements, continued to lack these technologies in 2012. The interviews were taped and transcribed and the information collected was quantified, where possible, and entered into SPSS software package for analysis. Subsequently, in order to obtain additional and more up-to-date information relating to the use and extent of connectivity technology, in 2012 a questionnaire was dispatched, online and followed on through email and post, to all 98 participants. At the time this article was prepared, a total of 45 responses were obtained and the results are embedded in the sections relating to connectivity technology.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0269094213491700"><title>Empirical findings</title>
<p>The empirical findings presented below are based on univariate analyses. The empirical data allows us to examine: motivations for setting up a HBB; opportunities and challenges brought about by HBB activities; whether HBB provides a fulfilling economic activity, both for women themselves and to meet the needs of local and regional communities; and the extent of which the adaptation of connectivity technology has contributed to the development of the HBB sector by women in the North East of England. As mentioned above, the empirical investigation is based on a survey of 98 women-owned HBBs. For the purpose of this article, the Z-scores derived from Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test have been used to test the significant differences, where possible, between those participants with caring and domestic responsibilities (53) and those without these commitments (45), as well as between those HBBs located in the rural (70) and urban areas (28) of the North East. It should be noted that some differences between these two latter sub-groups presented below are partly due to the fact that a higher number (18 out of 28) of those located in the urban areas had no caring responsibilities compared with those living in the rural areas (43 out of 70).</p>
<sec id="sec8-0269094213491700"><title>Motivations and underlying reasons for setting up a home-based business</title>
<p>A key concern in this article is in the perceived motivations for establishing a HBB. We are particularly interested in exploring whether HBB ownership achieves its potential as a solution to inter-role conflict experienced by some participants. Based on the data collected, it was, broadly, possible to identify and quantify several ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors. The results, summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094213491700">Table 1</xref>, demonstrate that ‘balancing between work and life’ was the prime reason for setting up a HBB, mentioned by nearly half of the participants, while over 35% mentioned ‘flexibility’ as a prime motivator. The Z-score of 5.402 derived from Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test reveals that, not surprisingly, a significantly higher proportion of those with caring responsibility established a HBB primarily to combine running a business with family responsibilities. Although ‘flexibility’ and ‘work-life balance’, often associated with caring responsibilities, were the primary drivers in setting up a HBB, several owners of the established HBBs stated that they had continued to run and grow the business at home despite these reasons no longer being impediments. The following comment was echoed by several participants:<disp-quote>
<p>I started my own business at home because I had young children and liked the flexibility of hours it offered. Now that the children are older and have left home and the business is established I would not work anywhere else.

</table-wrap></p></disp-quote>This finding conforms to existing research that shows home is not used as just a temporary base for conducting the business. For example, in an online poll of 340 HBB owners undertaken in December 2011, only 9% said they had definite plans to move their business out of the home, with 70% confirming that they planned to continue to operate from home. Moreover, 47% of the overall respondents were women, as were 51% of those planning to remain at home long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213491700">Graham, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several other ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors such as, ‘being own boss’, ‘identification of niche market’, ‘suits business’, and ‘utilising space at home’ were also found to be amongst the key reasons for setting up a HBB but mentioned to a greater extent by those without caring responsibilities. For example, the Z-score of 2.30 reveals that a significantly higher proportion of those without caring responsibility mentioned the ‘desire for being my own boss’ as a main reason for setting up a HBB compared with those with caring responsibilities. Comments made by a number of those without caring responsibilities included:<disp-quote>
<p>I like the freedom of being self-employed and the feeling of being my own boss.</p></disp-quote>and<disp-quote>
<p>I am self-directing, and prefer to have the choice of what projects I do and to be able to cultivate my own ideas.</p></disp-quote>The results also exhibit some noticeable differences associated with the location. For example, a relatively higher proportion of those located in the rural areas mentioned ‘work- life balance’ and ‘flexibility’ as their prime motivators. In contrast, ‘being own boss’ was found to be the prime reason for setting up a business at home for those located in the urban areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094213491700"><title>Opportunities, advantages and rewards</title>
<p>In terms of opportunities and rewards, the results summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094213491700">Table 2</xref> show that ‘flexibility that enables to choose own working hours’ was the most commonly mentioned advantage, perceived by some 74.5% of all participants, followed by ‘balancing between work and life’ that was mentioned by over half of all participants. The other advantages shared amongst the participants included, ‘less commuting/travel to work’, ‘being own boss’ and ‘reduced overheads and other costs’. The Z-scores displayed in the table exhibit some differences between those participants with caring and non-caring, and those located in rural and urban areas. For example, a significantly higher proportion of those without caring responsibilities mentioned ‘less commuting’ compared with those with caring responsibilities. An overview of the data suggests that this is largely due to the lack of local schools and poor public transport in some rural and remote areas of the North East. In contrast, a relatively higher proportion of those without caring responsibilities mentioned ‘flexibility’ and ‘work-life balance’ as the key advantages. It is interesting, however, to note that although ‘flexibility’ and ‘balancing between work and life’ were not the main motivations for setting up a HBB for those with caring responsibilities, these factors were also perceived as key advantages by this sub-group.

<p>The table also exhibits some differences between responses by those located in the urban and rural areas. For example, the Z-score of 2.179 reveals that a significantly higher proportion of those located in the urban area mentioned ‘less commuting/travel to work’ as a key advantage and a relatively higher proportion mentioned ‘reduced overhead’ and ‘being own boss’. In contrast, a relatively higher proportion of those in rural areas perceived ‘flexibility’ and ‘work-life balance’ as key advantages.</p>
<p>In overall, the responses reveals several fulfilling opportunities and advantages associated with HBB as demonstrated by the following comments:<disp-quote>
<p>Freedom to be creative, self-directed and self-motivated.</p>
<p>Working in beautiful surroundings.</p>
<p>Being able to work in the community where I live.</p>
<p>Bringing business to and serving rural community.</p>
<p>Not polluting atmosphere by driving and using extra resources.</p>
<p>Working and bringing up a child at the same time.</p></disp-quote>One owner of an international business, for example, commented:<disp-quote>
<p>The biggest advantage is time: I can work till all hours of the night. And it is great because my clients are overseas, need the time flexibility, with no distractions of office chatter and constant interruptions.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094213491700"><title>Disadvantages</title>
<p>The results clearly demonstrate that running a business from home is not without challenges and drawbacks. As the results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094213491700">Table 2</xref> show, the most commonly shared disadvantage was ‘isolation’, particularly mentioned by those without caring responsibilities and, in contrast to general assumption, by those located in the urban areas. For some participants, HBB does not appear to offer the flexibility and balancing between work and life that was expected, particularly amongst those without caring responsibilities and those located in the urban areas. Other key disadvantages included:<disp-quote>
<p>Not being taken seriously.</p>
<p>Lack of interaction with colleagues.</p>
<p>Administration burden and lack of access to technical and non-technical support.</p></disp-quote>with some noticeable differences between different sub-groups, as displayed in the table.</p>
<p>The discussion with the participants revealed several psychological, emotional, personal and professional disadvantages that paint a picture of the challenges that HBB in effect could transfer to the personal space of the family home. These include:<disp-quote>
<p>Work invades time.</p>
<p>No Christmas parties.</p>
<p>No bonuses.</p>
<p>No social interaction.</p>
<p>Family and friends can intrude on business time.</p>
<p>Difficult to switch off.</p>
<p>Lack of discipline and motivation.</p>
<p>Home is not necessarily a suitable place to meet clients.</p>
<p>Poor access to training.</p>
<p>No sick, holiday or maternity pay.</p>
<p>Temptation to work all hours.</p>
<p>It can be very tiring at the weekends.</p>
<p>Pressure of doing all aspects of running a business without the skills.</p>
<p>Noone to delegate work to.</p>
<p>Phone never stops ringing, internet is on all the time – work is always there – no escape.</p>
<p>Lack of office corridor learning and informal conversation at coffee breaks with colleagues.</p>
<p>Unable to bounce ideas off other people.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0269094213491700"><title>Characteristics and sector of activities of home-based businesses</title>
<p>Existing research suggests that women are more likely to set up a HBB as a hobby or on a ‘part-time’ and ‘casual basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213491700">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>). The results summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094213491700">Figure 1</xref> show, however, that a high proportion of participants (70.4%) stated that they run their business on a full-time basis and only 29.6% stated that their business was a part-time venture. A slightly higher proportion of those with caring responsibilities appear to be running their HBB on a part-time basis and this appears to be the case for those located in rural areas. When considering the number of hours worked by HBB, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094213491700">Table 3</xref>, 52% of participants reported that they worked over 35 hours a week now that they worked from home, compared to 64.5% who reported that they worked more than 35 hours before working from home. Not surprisingly, those with caring responsibilities worked, on average, fewer hours post-HBB compared with those without caring responsibilities. It is, therefore, notable that the majority of women in our sample (70.4%) claimed they were operating their businesses on a full-time basis, and although those with caring responsibilities and those located in the rural areas appeared to have a relatively higher tendency to work fewer than 35 hours a week and on a part-time basis, the shift to part-time working is not significant relative to their former work hours whilst employed outside the home.

This profile is quite different to the sectors within which participants were employed before setting up their HBBs. The results show that 17.3% were in in health care, 10.2% in art and design, 13.2% in education, 8.2% in beauty and wellness, and 23.5% in secretarial and administration related sectors. Only 5% of all the participants had no previous work experience, identifying themselves as ‘housewives’ prior to setting up their own HBBs. An examination of the data reveals that previous occupations included managers, nurses and carers, artists, chemist, IT workers, beauticians and farmers.

<p>There are examples of women setting up a HBB in a closely associated field to their former employment, illustrated by the following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>I qualified as a physiotherapist in 1997, worked in a NHS hospital prior to having children, then set up my own physiotherapy business at home.</p></disp-quote>Others had evolved their original career, remaining in the same sector but undertaking a different role, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>I worked as a Biochemical Researcher, and then started a family. There was no crèche in those days so I decided to start up from home. Techniques in biochemistry are always changing so I went over to the writing and editing side of the science.</p></disp-quote>Finally, some women had either retrained or diversified altogether as illustrated in the following examples:<disp-quote>
<p>I worked as an office admin full time in London, left to have family, and then did part-time admin work for a consultancy management company. There was no opportunity for progression so I decided to re-train as a provider of coaching and set up my own business at home.</p>
<p>I worked for a large company in chemistry R&amp;D. I moved into information science  … then was promoted to global marketing communications manager. I took early retirement but got bored so set up my own successful business at home to offer a service around my own expertise to advise businesses on how to execute their marketing communication strategy.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec13-0269094213491700"><title>To what extent do connectivity technologies act as an enabler of the creation and running of a business at home by women?</title>
<p>The overall results clearly demonstrate that, in general, connectivity technology had a profound impact on running a business from home, similarly amongst those with and without caring responsibilities and located in rural and rural areas, with several of the participants stating that without hard and soft technologies they would not have been able to set up and run their HBB. One participant, for example, referred to technology as the ‘life blood of the company’ and another described technology as having ‘a phenomenal benefit – transformational’. Connectivity technology appears to be ‘enabling’ HBBs in several ways as illustrated in the following section of the article which sets out specific examples drawn from the empirical study. First we explore the ways technology is used in the functional activities of the business, and then analyse the unique benefits brought by technology such as enabling communications, access to international markets and providing flexibility to operate literally anywhere.</p>
<sec id="sec14-0269094213491700"><title>Technology as a medium for promotion and selling online</title>
<p>At the time of the initial empirical study, around 25% of the participants were involved in selling and trading online and 45% were involved in buying online for work-related activities. The results of the follow-up survey carried out in 2012, reveal that these figures had increased to 35% and 65% respectively. The continuing trend towards adoption of technology in business processes is likely to continue to lead to a subsequent increase in the online activity of the women who participated in the empirical study.<disp-quote>
<p>I am an artist. I design and make contemporary oil paintings on canvas. I sell my work physically in galleries and virtually on their websites. I have been undertaking R&amp;D with the aim of developing the ceramic side of my business.</p>
<p>IT has helped me to produce my own publicity materials. I can design and process my own photographs using software packages. It has enabled me to research online to find galleries to exhibit and sell my work and to communicate with many artists at once, all from the comfort of my home.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0269094213491700"><title>Technology for operations and marketing</title>
<p>The following comments are illustrative of the extent to which technology is used for operation and marketing:<disp-quote>
<p>I provide personal and professional coaching, personal development and life coaching. Associated products include creating a customised work-life balance diary for clients. I design, create and market my own products, using technology.</p>
<p>I use a PC to create flyers, booking forms, literature about my work, to write letters and keep client notes.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0269094213491700"><title>Fundamental to the business model</title>
<p>As illustrated by the following comments, for some participants, technology appears to be an integral part of the business operation.<disp-quote>
<p>My company’s activities include technology-based design, manufacture and marketing of innovative educational aids for toddlers and young children, and exporting them to an international market.</p>
<p>I do email coaching and virtual coaching and use the web for research. I can keep up-to-date with current affairs through accessing digital radio on the web for things I have missed live.</p>
<p>I coach groups of people internationally using an online private website<italic>.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0269094213491700"><title>Central to day-to-day communications</title>
<p>As demonstrated by the following comments, technology is central to day-to-day communications with customers and colleagues, through emails, online conference calls, and social media cites, and this is believed by some to save time in travel.<disp-quote>
<p>For my home-based business, IT is essential for communicating. Email is needed to get business and stay connected to customers, to send plans and ideas and save time on travel to meetings, i.e. I can do more in less time.</p>
<p>I can have a conference call with colleagues where we can work on screen, on documents in real-time. I also have a link to automatic document formatting that produces and sends out letters/quotes direct to customers.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0269094213491700"><title>Use of virtual social media</title>
<p>In terms of social media networks, the following comments were echoed by several respondents:<disp-quote>
<p>Social media sites are great for keeping in touch and communicating with clients on a regular basis in an informal way. This allows me to build a closer and more human link with my clients.</p>
<p>Virtual social networking is great in so many ways. It helps with direct marketing and building up the client base and the brand. It helps with finding out about competitors.</p>
<p>E-social media provides opportunities to participate at virtual events. Having said that you still have to get out and meet people and clients ‘face-to-face’ and at physical social networking events; nothing can replace that.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0269094213491700"><title>Gateway to international trade</title>
<p>Technology has also been central to enabling HBBs to trade internationally, both through facilitating transnational communications and providing the flexibility to work outside standard working hours. This is illustrated by the following comments:<disp-quote>
<p>IT has enabled contact with clients who live abroad. I use email constantly, supported by telephone. It gives another dimension to my ability to work internationally and ways to be in touch any time of the day with clients who live in a different time zone.</p>
<p>IT is the life blood of my company. I could not operate without it as my clients are worldwide. It allows me to work across multiple time zones.</p>
<p>The web is my gateway to the global market, not limited geographically.</p>
<p>The internet has provided access to the market, locally, regionally and beyond, for buying core materials and selling my products that would not otherwise been possible.</p>
<p>IT enables overseas work as there are huge difficulties in keeping in touch with rural Africa.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0269094213491700"><title>Flexibility to operate at anytime, anywhere</title>
<p>This flexibility was also expressed in the context of HBBs being able to operate anywhere, at any time, as the basic infrastructure is built around such flexibility. One female business owner explained:<disp-quote>
<p>IT has given me the freedom to have the same equipment and technology as in a regular office. With my laptop and internet access I can work on the train (or in the middle of a field!) between appointments, can do business anywhere, share information, send quotes instantly and do research.</p></disp-quote>Another commented:<disp-quote>
<p>People don’t know you are working from home; where you work is irrelevant to others. The way I have set up my IT and brought in help in setting it up has enabled a high quality service. I am able to offer the same standards to clients as I would in a traditional office environment.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec21-0269094213491700"><title>Contribution of women to regional and local economic development through their home-based businesses</title>
<p>On the surface, the results presented above conforms existing research, suggesting that women-owned HBBs are generally operating in crowded and marginal sectors of the economy. However, a closer examination and insight into the nature of activities paint a different picture and clearly demonstrate that such broad classifications do not justify the contribution that women-owned HBBs are making, not only serving the needs of the local communities but also, in some cases, providing some valuable services at national and international levels. As demonstrated by the following comments, HBBs created by participants are not all based on hobbies but on creativity, artistic ability, identification of a specialised niche market, previous work experience and academic or professional qualifications. Moreover, they are demonstrating innovation and intention to diversify into new areas to enable long-term sustainability and, in some cases, growth.<disp-quote>

<sec id="sec22-0269094213491700"><title>Concluding remarks and recommendations</title>
<p>The prime purpose of this article was to assess the extent to which the adaptation of connectivity technologies has contributed to the development of HBB venturing amongst women in the North East of England. The overall results, based on a sample of 98 women-owned HBBs, clearly demonstrate that connectivity technology has, indeed, reframed home economics for women, through enabling HBB to be established as more than a ‘part-time’ or ‘lifestyle’ business. Connectivity technology has enabled operating a business from home setting to become practically possible, economically viable and commercially acceptable, adding value to communities from local to global and demonstrating innovation and intents to become sustainable through diversification.</p>
<p>Although a high proportion of the HBBs established by the women who participated in the empirical study cannot be classified as ‘technology-based businesses’, technology does appear to be significant as an enabler of their businesses in many ways, similarly amongst those with and without caring responsibilities and those located in the urban and rural areas, such as a medium for promotion and selling, in operations and marketing and, more fundamentally, to accessing international market. A vast majority of participants stated that connectivity technology had a profound impact on running their business from home, several stating that without hard and soft technologies they would not have been able to set up and run their HBB, with one participant referring to it as the ‘life blood of the company’.</p>
<p>The overall results show that the prime motivation for setting up a HBB were associated with ‘flexibility’ and ‘work-life balance’, particularly amongst those with caring responsibilities. The participants in general perceived several other motivating factors, advantages, opportunities and rewards associated with HBB ownership, including, ‘less commuting’, ‘reduce overhead’ and ‘being own boss’. However, it is noticeable that for some participants running a business from home does not necessarily lead to the kind of flexibility that they had hoped since it had increased their actual working hours, and blurred a distinction between work and home. There is evidence, in some cases, of the transition of the long hours culture that often is associated with office-based organisations, in the personal space of the family home. Moreover, it is clear that, although there are several potential skill deficits in terms of use and upgrading of technology and a general lack of technical expertise and support, there is also a more general business-management problem that leaves some of the women continuing to struggle to balance work and life to a satisfactory extent. Some of the general comments made by participants relate to the often considerable amount of business and financial administration that must be conducted whilst running a business from home. Outsourcing these time-consuming tasks may be an option for businesses that reach a certain level of financial security, but is unlikely to be an alternative for new or small home-based businesses. Another common problem is that of ‘isolation’ and lack of ‘interaction with colleagues’. Some of the general comments from participants, particularly those located in the rural areas, were related to the need to find an appropriate source of networking activities or local support groups that might help advise on general business problems and the added problem of isolation. It is clear that is one of the areas that require the greatest policy attention for HBBs in both rural and urban areas.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and the fact that ‘being own boss’ was mentioned by relatively few participants in the survey as a main reason to set up a HHB, compared to certain work-life balance benefits, a majority of the participants appeared to be enthusiastic about the benefits of HBB. The results show that women are often operating full-time businesses from home and increased ‘flexibility’ associated with HBB appears to have provided a greater capacity to work than could have been achieved if they were to combine childcare with working outside the home.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, considerable efforts and public funding have been devoted to the development of numerous local and national positive action measures and initiatives to address the ‘gender imbalance’ in the labour market, as well as major improvements in the statutory provision of maternity and paternity leave and flexible working in favour of women. However, despite some improvements, the ‘gender imbalance’ in terms of, for example, equal pay, business ownership, full-time, senior, professorial and executive positions (beyond the ‘glass ceiling’) continues to persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094213491700">Wynarczyk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>On 18 January 2012, the Prime Minster David Cameron was challenged in the House of Commons over the alarming increase in the rate of female unemployment in the North East of England that has been exacerbated by recent Government’s austerity measures such as welfare reform and redundancies in the public sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094213491700">Green, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094213491700">Robson and Robinson, 2012</xref>). The Prime Minister responded by pledging new plans to increase the prospects of women into the workforce, including: ‘boosting childcare for two-year-olds, three-year-olds and four-year- olds’; to ‘introducing universal credit support for all women with childcare who work, not just those who work over 16 hours’; and ‘lifting over a million people out of tax, the majority of whom are women’.</p>
<p>Whilst these measures appear to offer a more attractive working environment for women, it seems that these policies aid the recruitment and retention of women but, mainly, on a part-time basis. A vast majority of senior, professional and executive positions are full time and held by men. It is therefore imperative to identify the factors and conditions that contribute to engagement in the labour market more effectively. The results presented in this article clearly demonstrate that women, particularly those leaving the labour market due to redundancy, childcare or other caring responsibilities, may find it more fulfilling both in financial terms and in work-related satisfaction, to examine the option of starting their own business from home rather than return to the labour market on a part-time basis or working from home for a company in a poorly paid position or with lower levels of responsibility.</p>
<p>A high proportion (around 70%) of the participants included in this article are located in Northumberland, the most remote/rural northerly and sparsely populated county in England. Over the past two decades, Northumberland has experienced the closure and decline in some key services, including post offices, village shops, schools, and public transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213491700">NIN, 2008</xref>). Despite significant investment in ICT infrastructure and services in the North East, there remain ‘broadband gaps’ in some parts of Northumberland, where businesses and homes have slow and limited access to the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491700">Broadband Choice, 2011</xref>). The growth of HBB can be viewed as an effective means of revitalising local communities. However, whilst HBB presents these opportunities, for it to be fully realised the technology infrastructure needs to be improved and extended further in the North East of England.</p>
<p>A key conclusion of our empirical study is that, contrary to the general assumption that women running HBBs are operating in crowded, marginal sectors, the reality is quite different. There is evidence of women-owned HBBs being full-time and serious ventures, spanning all sectors, adding value to communities from local to global, demonstrating innovation as well as an intent to become sustainable through diversification. Opportunities, rewards and economic benefits generated by HHBs should be promoted further via appropriate policy channels and support networks as a viable employment opportunity, as well as a solution to dual-role conflict experienced by some women who may otherwise be deterred from playing active roles in the local and regional economic development.</p>
<p>To promote HBB activities, there is a need for specific policy measures and support networks in local areas to remove specific barriers and challenges that are associated with running a business from home. The support networks could take advantage of this situation to provide a location for homeworkers to meet on a regular basis and to help with their more general business-related problems relating to paperwork and general administration. In part, these support networks can now be achieved through the use of virtual social media, and it would be advantageous to HBB owners to be provided with the skills required to engage effectively with this free resource. Conversely, however, this element of technology-based communication could also serve to increase the potential isolation experienced by women as they operate without face-to-face contact, therefore people-based networks are as important to the development of HBBs as virtual.</p>
<p>There are some limitations associated with this article that offer scope for future research. For example, due to the focus of the study, it has not been possible to compare and contrast the issues addressed in the article by gender and to explore HHB activities by gender within the context of specific regional socio-economic factors and disparities that persist in the UK.</p>
