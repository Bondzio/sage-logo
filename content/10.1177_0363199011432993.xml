<abstract>
<p>After the First World War, many politicians sought, and ultimately failed, to replace universal suffrage with familial suffrage in French elections. This article analyzes how this new effort to think of French citizens in terms of gender and familial identities extended to the empire with the 1922 introduction of familial suffrage in Tunisia. This reform redefined the relationship between French settlers and their government. It also shows that Tunisia, which has thus far been absent from the developing literature on settler citizenship in the empire, represents a particularly compelling case study of the intersection of gender and familial status with definitions of citizenship.</p>

</p>
<p>In 1925, the journal <italic>Natalité</italic> published an article attributing the French government’s failure to protect the family and encourage population growth to universal suffrage, a system of voting that, without recognition of voters' varied familial situations, accorded each man an equal voice in electing members of parliament.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199011432993">1</xref>
</sup> Subsequently, this author argued, government legislation in France was passed with individual interests in mind and not those of the French family, a problem that led him to make the dire prediction quoted above. The solution was familial suffrage, a system in which parents cast supplementary votes on behalf of their children. If elected by familial suffrage, the author’s logic followed, members of parliament would prioritize laws favoring large families and French people would have more children.</p>
<p>In the years following the First World War, familial suffrage figured prominently on the agenda of the pronatalist movement, a diverse group of individuals from across the political spectrum who shared a common goal of finding ways to increase France’s birthrate. On one hand, their support for familial suffrage represented a further attempt to elevate the French father to a position of authority both within the family and the French state. Their efforts in this regard anticipated the renewed emphasis on French fathers that would later be seen under Vichy. The growing support for familial suffrage was also part of a larger shift in French thinking about citizenship and rights in the aftermath of the First World War. As scholars have shown, at this time there was increasingly a desire to reconceptualize citizenship in terms of one’s position within the family and contribution to demographic growth, something that was particularly evident in interwar social welfare policies. As legislators and employers began to introduce new social benefits, the question of who had the right to these benefits was shaped by gender, employment, and family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199011432993">2</xref>
</sup> Efforts to introduce the family vote represented the most poignant example of how this familialist view of citizenship and rights extended into the realm of political participation.</p>
<p>In what ways did this new postwar thinking about political participation and social welfare policies extend to France’s empire and redefine the relationship between French settlers and colonial governments? This article explores this question by looking at the French protectorate of Tunisia. Influenced by familialist conceptions of rights and political participation, Resident General Lucien Saint introduced the family vote in Tunisia in 1922. Though pronatalists' efforts to introduce familial suffrage never succeeded in France, the adoption of this reform in Tunisia illustrates the relative strength of pronatalist arguments in the French empire. Moreover, this reform shows that in Tunisia, to a much greater extent than in France, the government was inclined to think about French citizens both in terms of gender and familial status and extend rights accordingly.</p>
<p>Concerns about the birthrate, the size of the population, and the status of the French family predated the First World War and occupied a prominent place in French thinking in the nineteenth century. While under Louis XIV (reigned 1643–1715), France had had the largest population in Europe, by the late eighteenth century France’s population growth was in decline while the populations of rival states continued to grow at an accelerated rate. Inspired by Malthusian concerns about the connection between unchecked population growth and poverty, many nineteenth-century thinkers initially welcomed this reduction in the birthrate. Yet, following the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1), a war that resulted in a swift defeat for France and the unification of Germany, Malthusian prudence gave way to a growing conviction that the nation’s very survival required a larger population, something that could not be achieved without a higher birthrate. The perception that France was facing a “depopulation crisis” inspired the creation of a political movement, known as pronatalism, that was committed to promoting awareness in the French public about the consequences of the low birthrate, encouraging individuals to have more children, and lobbying the government for legislation that would encourage reproduction and reduce the financial burdens of raising children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199011432993">3</xref>
</sup> Pronatalists became more organized in the last decade of the nineteenth century with the formation of the <italic>Alliance Nationale pour l’Accroissement de la Population Française</italic>. After the devastation of the First World War, during which France endured near-defeat and lost over a million soldiers, the pronatalist cause acquired greater urgency and received more support from members of parliament. In fact even before the war had ended, three hundred and forty-eight deputies signed on to the pronatalist cause in 1916 by joining the parliamentary group known as the <italic>Protection des Familles Nombreuses,</italic> or Protection of Large Families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199011432993">4</xref>
</sup> In addition to gaining this important foothold in the French parliament, the French pronatalist movement grew more influential and organized with the formation of new groups sharing many of the same objectives as did pronatalists. Among the largest such organizations were the <italic>Ligue Française</italic>, <italic>La plus Grande Famille</italic>, and the <italic>Ligue pour la Vie</italic>. According to Joseph Spengler, by 1922 the organized pronatalist and familialist movements in France consisted of eight national associations, sixty-two regional associations, and eleven federations of large families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199011432993">5</xref>
</sup> Their numbers continued to grow throughout the interwar period and by 1939 there were at least two hundred and fifty familialist and pronatalist organizations operating within French territory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199011432993">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There were significant differences between these organizations, such as the somewhat secular position of the Alliance Nationale versus the Catholic roots of the Ligue pour la Vie. In addition, some organizations were familialist as opposed to pronatalist. According to Paul Smith, one of the key differences between the two ideologies is that pronatalism was “quantitative,” in that its adherents sought governmental reforms that would boost population growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199011432993">7</xref>
</sup> Familialists, on the other hand, were more concerned with the moral quality of the French family and with representing the interests of the <italic>famille nombreuse</italic> or large family. These differences aside, familialists and pronatalists nevertheless shared many of the same objectives and collaborated with one another during and after the Great War. One example of this collaboration is that the four largest familialist and pronatalist organizations formed the <italic>Comité Central des Ligues de Familles Nombreuses</italic> to lobby for a reform they all agreed to be critical: familial suffrage. Sometimes referred to as the plural vote or the family vote, familial suffrage was a proposed system of voting in which parents of large families would cast extra votes on behalf of their dependent family members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199011432993">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Crucial to understanding why the idea of familial suffrage became more popular in the 1920s is the impact of the First World War on concepts of citizenship and rights. As many scholars have shown, reconstruction and recovery after the First World War entailed more than simply rebuilding damaged structures and roads. The devastation of the war went much deeper and seemed to weaken the national body. During the war, France’s already low birthrate declined substantially as young men left for the front and many couples chose to avoid pregnancy because of the uncertain times in which they lived.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199011432993">9</xref>
</sup> After the war, this low birthrate showed little promise of a full recovery given that over a million soldiers died at the front and many more returned home disabled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199011432993">10</xref>
</sup> Consequently, in the years after the war, France had a significant gender imbalance that left many young women struggling to find suitable husbands. In addition to these obstacles to restoring demographic health was the sense that the war had been an attack on French motherhood, masculinity, and the family. For instance, women who were raped and impregnated by the German occupiers in the north symbolized the enemy’s violent intrusion on French soil.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199011432993">11</xref>
</sup> The inability of French men to protect these women also signified the weakened state of French masculinity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199011432993">12</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the departure of so many men to the front required that women enter the workforce in greater numbers and in industries previously considered to be unsuitable for women. Though largely temporary, this employment destablized the gender order and weakened the family by drawing more women out of the private sphere and away from their children. The effects of the war on family life persisted in the 1920s as it was widely feared that more and more women rejected their traditional roles as mothers and homemakers, and instead sought a more independent life outside of the home.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199011432993">13</xref>
</sup> The image of <italic>La garçonne</italic>, an independent girl from a good bourgeois family who sought sexual liberation and fulfilment like a man and who was immortalized in Victor Margueritte’s novel of the same name, was a powerful symbol of these threats to France’s recovery from the war.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199011432993">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Postwar recovery in its fullest sense therefore entailed many different things including reconstruction, economic growth, the reintegration of men into the workforce (and concurrent departure of women from the workforce), the establishment of stable families, a proper gender order, and a robust birthrate. France’s nascent welfare state emerged amid these intersecting concerns and consequently advanced a new idea of citizenship. In the aftermath of the war, the French state began to move toward “social citizenship” or the idea that the state had obligations to ensure a particular standard of living to its citizens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199011432993">15</xref>
</sup> This developed through the initiatives of both employers, introducing benefits like a family wage and familial allocations, and the state which implemented legislation like tax incentives for families and assumed control of and generalized familial allocations. As Laura Levine Frader argues, it was because of the strong desire to reconstitute families and encourage a stronger birthrate that employers and the state no longer conceived of workers as individuals but rather as members of families. Consequently, the aforementioned benefits, among others that they introduced in the aftermath of the war, were not allocated on an equal basis but were determined by one’s employment, gender, and familial status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199011432993">16</xref>
</sup> For instance, at companies that had a family wage, men with children were paid more than were their childless coworkers. Similarly, state familial allocations that granted a sum of money to each family with a certain number of children effectively differentiated between French citizens by granting funds to those citizens who had children but not to those who were childless.</p>
<p>The notion that there were different types of citizens extended into the realm of political participation and was particularly evident in debates over familial suffrage in the 1920s. It should be pointed out that this was not the first time that people had suggested replacing universal suffrage with a familialist model of voting; when universal suffrage was introduced in 1848 and again in 1870 there were members of parliament who favored familial suffrage. Yet, in the nineteenth century this model of voting presented only a minor challenge to the far more accepted concept of universal suffrage and, in the first years of the Third Republic, was advocated mainly by monarchists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199011432993">17</xref>
</sup> It was in the aftermath of the First World War that the idea of familial suffrage gained ground.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199011432993">18</xref>
</sup> The fact that employers and legislators alike were thinking about workers and citizens in familialist, as opposed to individual, terms is part of the reason why it was at this time that the proposed reform came closest to success.</p>
<p>In order to understand why so many people considered familial suffrage to be a solution to depopulation, it is important to recognize that many pronatalists attributed the devastation of the Great War to the prewar government’s failure to take decisive action to solve depopulation. This lack of government action in turn revealed a weakness in the democratic system; elected officials appealed to the demands of the majority, not the minority. In France, men with few or no children represented the majority of voters and wielded the most electoral power; fathers of large families were the minority and subsequently had little influence on politics. Pronatalists were unanimous in their belief that a government, elected by precisely those individuals who lacked demonstrable commitment to reversing the demographic trends, could not be entrusted with the responsibility of implementing pronatalist reforms.</p>
<p>To proponents of familial suffrage, the injustices of the contemporary political system could be traced back to the French Revolution, an event believed to have ushered in a new era of individualism. They pointed to the egalitarian spirit of the Revolution which, by way of the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen and the Constitution, granted rights to individuals without instructing them on their civic or familial duties. The Napoleonic Code further privileged the rights of the individual over those of the family by abolishing the practice of primogeniture and asserting the equal rights of children to the family inheritance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199011432993">19</xref>
</sup> As a result, Republican deputy Henri Roulleaux-Dugage argued, “selfishness practically single-handedly directs the life of each person; the principles of secular morality, with which one has tried to replace religious teaching, provide little defense against neo-malthusianism, because they do not indicate, to the individual, rules of behavior other than the pursuit of his personal interest and immediate happiness.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199011432993">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the French Revolution did lead to the establishment of the “individual-citizen,” it is important to note that the revolutionary era did not entirely mark the end of a familialist view of citizenship and political participation as some pronatalists asserted. In fact, some historians have argued that revolutionaries initially viewed this individual-citizen in terms of his social function, as a property owner or a head of household.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199011432993">21</xref>
</sup> Anne Verjus, for example, asserts that it was for this reason that revolutionaries never considered extending suffrage to servants, women, and children, whom they viewed as dependent members of the household.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199011432993">22</xref>
</sup> In this respect, individuals voted on behalf of the family unit, in their capacities as heads of households or property owners, and not solely as individuals. Though this particular view of voting did not allow for supplemental votes based on the size of one’s family, in logic it is similar to arguments underpinning familial suffrage in the twentieth century as it acknowledges a man’s authority to represent his dependents. Scholars have therefore been inclined to view 1848 to be more significant than the Revolution of 1789 in terms of the move away from thinking about citizens in familialist terms. It was in 1848 that a more individualist model of voting took hold because, with the advent of universal suffrage, voting ceased to be a social “function” and instead became an individual “right” decided not by social status or family, but by sex: all men could vote equally.</p>
<p>On the one hand it is tempting to read pronatalists' criticisms of the French Revolution’s legacy as an example of reactionary politics. However, as critical as many of them were of this legacy and the rise of individualism, pronatalists by and large did not outright reject the democratic system. In fact, like many French feminists, pronatalists simply emphasized its current failures and even evoked the principles of the Revolution as they criticized universal suffrage. For example, in his influential book on familial suffrage, André Toulemon argued that universal suffrage, as it existed in France, was not truly universal given that only ten out of forty million French people possessed the right to vote.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0363199011432993">23</xref>
</sup> If all French people were to be “born and remain truly free and equal in rights, as indicated in the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen,” the political system would have to be restructured to represent the interests of the thirty million women and children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199011432993">24</xref>
</sup> Thus, to Toulemon and other proponents of familial suffrage, the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution were less the cause of depopulation than was France’s failure to fully realize these principles.</p>
<p>In making such arguments in favor of familial suffrage, pronatalists contested the established definition of citizenship that gave rights and benefits to men equally without taking into consideration their unequal contributions to society. They believed that the problem with the existing system was its emphasis on individual rights and governments' tendency to treat citizens as individuals. Pronatalists asserted that there should be two distinct types of male citizens: the <italic>célibataire</italic>, or unmarried man, and the <italic>père de famille</italic>. While the term <italic>père de famille</italic> would best be translated as “father of the family,” it really has no direct equivalent in English. The term indicated that a man was more than simply a father by virtue of having produced children; as the <italic>père de famille</italic>, the man took responsibility for educating and supporting those children financially while they were growing up. From the pronatalist standpoint, the <italic>père de famille</italic>’s social function was considerably greater than that of the <italic>célibataire</italic> and yet, in terms of voting and taxation, the state treated them as equal individuals. In his pronatalist tract, Etienne Lamy argued that the French Revolution was supposed to have done away with privileges. Yet, “there is one [privilege] that the Revolution did not foresee and which is significant: that of households who leave all the national burdens to other households.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199011432993">25</xref>
</sup> From this perspective, the state perpetuated inequality and encouraged depopulation by failing to take into consideration such distinctions between citizens.</p>
<p>Familial suffrage, pronatalists hoped, would increase the authority of the <italic>père de famille</italic> both within the family and the French state, something that was closely related to the aforementioned desire to remove individualism from the political system. Similar to their criticism of the “individual citizen” that emerged after 1789, pronatalist discussions of the need to revive paternal authority within the family revealed some nostalgia for the Old Regime. Scholars have shown that the revolutionary era triggered a number of changes in family relations, particularly regarding the father’s authority within the family. Under the Old Regime, the law endowed fathers with the responsibility of maintaining order at the family level and to this end granted them substantial legal authority over their dependent family members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199011432993">26</xref>
</sup> The father consequently ruled over his family just as the king ruled over the country with the subordination of family members to the father being analogous to subjects' subordination to the monarch. When revolutionaries overthrew Louis XVI, the “father” of the country, they also sought a less patriarchal society more generally and introduced legislation that effectively dethroned French fathers at the familial level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199011432993">27</xref>
</sup> One of the main reasons for this is that they believed that a citizen could not stand in full possession of his rights (and they envisioned citizens as male) if he was also obligated to submit to the tyranical authority of his father.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199011432993">28</xref>
</sup> The Napoleonic Code ultimately overturned some of this revolutionary legislation and reestablished some aspects of fathers' authority over their family members. Still, as Jacques Donzelot has argued, the French Revolution nevertheless marked the end of the old “entanglement” of monarchical and paternal power and the birth of a “future state that would organize the citizens' welfare, dispensing assistance, work, education, and health to everyone without regard to outmoded family adherences.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0363199011432993">29</xref>
</sup> Over the course of the nineteenth century, paternal authority within the family was increasingly displaced by that of the state.</p>
<p>In fact it was in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that legislators found themselves in a difficult dilemma as they sought to introduce laws that would protect children and improve the birthrate. The passage of many such pronatalist laws implicitly meant intervening in family life and, by extension, reducing paternal authority within the family. In some instances it was precisely because they were uncomfortable with the idea of infringing on men’s rights that legislators were reluctant to pass pronatalist laws. Yet despite this reluctance, in the last years of the Third Republic “the interests of the family, and most importantly those of children, consistently triumphed over considerations of the status and authority of fathers.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0363199011432993">30</xref>
</sup> This occurred in a number of ways. The family allowance system, for instance, meant that the state assumed some of the responsibility for providing for French families, thereby competing with the father’s position as breadwinner. In the interest of protecting children, the state could also deprive a man of his paternal authority or, following the 1912 law on paternity suits, judge that he was the father of a child that he did not wish to recognize as his own. Finally, through paternity suits and state support of motherhood, the French state increasingly began to recognize the sexual independence of women and legitimate those families that were not patriarchal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199011432993">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In contrast to much of the existing pronatalist legislation, therefore, the family vote promoted population growth by strengthening paternal authority within the family. At a time when the French government increasingly intervened into family life in order to protect mothers and children, the institution of the family vote would effectively acknowledge a father’s position as head of household, recognize his authority over his family members, and enable him to represent the interests of his family members in the public sphere. For this reason, the proposed reform held significant appeal to those pronatalists who believed that a stronger birthrate required first and foremost the reestablishment of stable, patriarchal families.</p>
<p>Despite the fairly broad appeal of familial suffrage in the 1920s, efforts to introduce this reform suffered in part from divisions among its proponents over the particular form it would take. One of the more dominant models was advanced by Henri Roulleaux-Dugage, Republican deputy of the Orne, who made a series of attempts to introduce familial suffrage into parliamentary debate from 1916 until his retirement from public life in 1931. Though he modified his proposals repeatedly in order to gain supporters, the underlying principle of his model remained constant: every child should be represented individually through the father’s vote. For example, in his October, 1916 proposal, the father would receive a supplementary vote for each dependent member of his household (wife and children) and, in the event of the father’s death, the widowed mother would vote in his place. Single adult women would receive individual votes as well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0363199011432993">32</xref>
</sup> Thus, as feminists were quick to point out, for adult women one unfortunate consequence of getting married would be losing the right to vote. In 1920 Roulleaux-Dugage revised his proposal, stipulating that a married woman could cast her own vote.</p>
<p>Though supporting any form of suffrage that would give fathers greater electoral weight than single men, some pronatalists opposed Roulleaux-Dugage’s model of familial suffrage on the grounds that it promoted individualism. The idea that family members needed individual representation, through individual votes, contradicted the idea that the family unit should be represented in its entirety. To these pronatalists, the purpose of familial suffrage was not to extend political representation to women and children but rather to elevate the social status and electoral weight of the <italic>père de famille</italic> by giving him one or more supplementary votes in recognition of his social importance. These pronatalists preferred the model proposed by Jules Lemire, a conservative deputy from Hazebrouck who was also known as the <italic>abbé démocrate</italic>. Lemire proposed familial suffrage in the Chamber of Deputies in 1911 and again in 1920.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199011432993">33</xref>
</sup> The system Lemire proposed in 1920, for example, stipulated that a single man would receive one vote, married men would receive two votes, and fathers with four or more children would receive three votes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199011432993">34</xref>
</sup> Under this system, women would not vote under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Despite their ideological divisions, supporters of familial suffrage nevertheless rallied around the Roulleaux-Dugage model in 1923. Proponents of Lemire’s model gave their support to Roulleaux-Dugage mainly out of opportunism, wishing to see an initial victory in the fight against universal manhood suffrage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199011432993">35</xref>
</sup> When the Chamber of Deputies met to debate Justin Godart’s proposition for women’s suffrage on December 6, 1923, Roulleaux-Dugage added his proposal for familial suffrage, declaring himself a supporter of women’s suffrage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0363199011432993">36</xref>
</sup> Representing the most important victory for the cause of familial suffrage, the combined proposal was approved by 440 deputies with only 135 dissenters. Despite this initial victory, which convinced many pronatalists that success was imminent, the measure ultimately failed after the Senate refused to take it under consideration.<sup>

<p>Although proponents of familial suffrage would never again see the success witnessed in 1923, they continued their crusade until the outbreak of the Second World War. Increasingly, after witnessing the level of support given to women’s suffrage in 1923, pronatalists sought to align their interests with those of feminists and to reconcile familial suffrage with women’s suffrage. Whereas in the nineteenth-century liberal feminists in France had been obliged to acknowledge demographic concerns, thus strategically choosing not to demand political rights, by the 1920s the situation had changed considerably.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0363199011432993">40</xref>
</sup> By the 1920s, arguments in favor of women’s suffrage were so strong that pronatalists seeking familial suffrage were forced to acknowledge the strength of the feminist movement and subsequently revised their demands in order to meet the feminist challenge. In 1927, for example, then president of the Alliance Nationale Fernand Boverat argued that familial suffrage was unlikely to be adopted unless it was combined with women’s suffrage. He further expressed his fears that by alienating feminists, who refused any form of familial suffrage that placed women in an unequal position, pronatalists risked any possibility of seeing familial suffrage adopted. Thus, in order to align familial suffrage more effectively with feminist demands for women’s suffrage, Boverat proposed a new version of familial suffrage in which mothers and fathers would share equally the votes of their children. In families with uneven numbers of children, the father would receive the extra vote. Recognizing that critics might interpret this version as another attempt to extend unequal voting rights to women, Boverat emphasized that in postwar France women outnumbered men and would receive more votes on a national level.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite this apparent attempt at a concession on the part of the pronatalist movement, feminist supporters of familial suffrage rejected the proposed model on principle, asserting that giving the husband greater electoral weight than his wife would create inequality within marriage. A prominent example of this thinking was Marguerite de Witt-Schlumberger president of the <italic>Union française pour le suffrage des femmes</italic>. In addition to being a feminist leader and mother to six children, De Witt-Schlumberger was one of the rare women who rose to a position of influence within the largely male-dominated pronatalist movement. She was appointed to the <italic>Conseil Supérieur de la Natalité</italic> in 1920, was one of the administrators of the Alliance Nationale produced journal <italic>La Femme et l’Enfant</italic>, was widely quoted in a number of pronatalist newspapers, and was a chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0363199011432993">42</xref>
</sup> A proponent of familial suffrage, De Witt Schlumberger departed from her pronatalist colleagues by arguing that mothers and fathers should share equally the votes of their children. In the event of an uneven number, she asserted, it should be the mother who receives the extra vote because it was she who had actually given birth to the child in question.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0363199011432993">43</xref>
</sup> In addition to rejecting any form of suffrage reform that was designed to simultaneously grant women suffrage and minimize its impact, De Witt Schlumberger also defended the feminist view that women’s suffrage and family suffrage represented two separate issues. Whereas most pronatalists envisioned the extension of suffrage to women as part of the establishment of the family vote, feminists asserted that women deserved political rights for reasons that were entirely different from the need to represent the interests of children. Feminists such as De Witt Schlumberger alleged that by conflating the two issues, pronatalists erroneously equated women’s suffrage with the political representation of minors, a fairly insulting notion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0363199011432993">44</xref>
</sup> It was for these two reasons that the alliance that pronatalists tried to forge with feminists after 1923 had little chance of success.</p>
<p>Pronatalists nevertheless continued to lobby for familial suffrage in the 1930s and under Vichy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0363199011432993">45</xref>
</sup> However, after more than two decades of lobbying in favor of a revised version of suffrage, their worst fears were eventually realized; in 1944 Charles de Gaulle promised that women would gain the right to vote once the republic was restored, but made no mention of the family vote. Ultimately, the failure of the familial suffrage campaign in France during the interwar period can be attributed to a variety of factors. Pronatalists blamed feminists, asserting that feminists' efforts to redefine universal suffrage competed with their own efforts to do precisely that, thus complicating political debates by providing legislators with multiple models of suffrage from which to choose. This simplistic view of the debate ignored other factors, however. Pronatalists also encountered significant opposition from those who viewed familial suffrage to be too complicated to implement or simply antithetical to the principles of the French Republic.</p>
<p>While French pronatalists lobbied unsuccessfully for familial suffrage in France, their arguments received serious consideration in France’s North African protectorates. Beginning in Tunisia, a French protectorate since the Bardo Treaty of 1881, resident general Lucien Saint implemented familial suffrage with apparent ease in 1922 as part of larger political reforms aimed at curbing nationalist sentiments and addressing the demographic challenges of the colony’s growing Italian and Spanish populations. Not only did French officials introduce this reform out of concern for France’s numerical inferiority, they also anticipated possible reactions among the colonial subjects and defined the reforms in such a way that would minimize potential conflict.</p>
<p>Central to understanding the 1922 political reforms in Tunisia is the divisive issue of political representation that had for decades put the residency at odds with both the settler and indigenous populations. This conflict first emerged in 1881 when Tunisia became a protectorate and French officials chose to rule indirectly in the interest of avoiding the degree of conflict that the political assimilation of Algeria had engendered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0363199011432993">46</xref>
</sup> Subsequently, the pre-existing system of government remained nominally intact, with the Bey of Tunis retaining his title but lacking the power to act independently of French interests. The resident-minister (known as the resident-general after 1885) effectively administered through the Bey on behalf of the ministry of foreign affairs in Paris. This system of government distinguished Tunisia from neighboring Algeria which was considered to be another region of France, administratively and politically. Whereas French settlers in Algeria elected representatives to the parliament in Paris, Tunisia, like most colonies and protectorates in the French empire, was not represented in parliament.</p>
<p>Though lacking direct political representation, French settlers in Tunisia did nevertheless have a means by which to communicate their opinions and grievances to the residency: the <italic>Conférence Consultative</italic> or Consultative Conference. Established in 1892, this elected body met biannually and was designed to discuss problems in the protectorate, mainly of an economic nature, and make recommendations to the residency. To that end, its individual members were elected to represent their professional interests. Initially there were only two colleges derived from the settlers' chambers of agriculture and commerce; in 1896 a third college was added to represent government officials and the liberal professions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0363199011432993">47</xref>
</sup> The Consultative Conference had no legislative power and the resident general was by no means obliged to follow any of its recommendations; its role was merely advisory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0363199011432993">48</xref>
</sup> In 1907, the membership of the Consultative Conference was expanded to include sixteen Tunisians (out of a total of fifty-two members in the Conference); French members later consolidated the three chambers into one chamber for French representatives and a separate chamber of Tunisian representatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0363199011432993">49</xref>
</sup> They argued that this was done not to marginalize the Tunisian representatives but rather to eliminate the language difficulties that arose out of having a combined chamber.</p>
<p>The issue of Tunisian representation within the Consultative Conference was emblematic of a larger struggle underway between French authorities and Tunisian nationalists that ultimately led to the 1922 political reforms. Following the Great War, economic problems, rising unemployment among Tunisians, and the French government’s failure to follow through on promises made to Tunisian veterans who had fought in the French army, gave strength to nationalist movements in existence since the nineteenth century. Of particular concern to French officials was the formation of the nationalist organization Dustur, whose members demanded equal pay for equal work, a constitution, and a parliament to which French and Tunisian representatives would be elected by universal suffrage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0363199011432993">50</xref>
</sup> Tunisian nationalists also demanded equal representation both within the existing Consultative Conference and the parliament they hoped would eventually be established. This put them at odds with the many vocal French settlers who envisioned the formation of a representative government in which Tunisians would play little or no role.</p>
<p>It was in this context that Lucien Saint arrived in Tunisia to serve as the protectorate’s new resident general. Unlike earlier resident generals in Tunisia and Morocco, Saint was a civilian with no experience in colonial administration. He began his career in 1886 as a lawyer and later served the French administration in a variety of capacities including the head of the cabinet of the Ministry of Commerce as well as a series of prefectural positions between 1906 and 1919.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0363199011432993">51</xref>
</sup> Saint served as resident general of Tunisia from 1921 to 1929, before becoming resident general of Morocco in 1929.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0363199011432993">52</xref>
</sup> Even before his departure for Tunisia in 1920, Saint made his position on political reforms abundantly clear by telling a delegation of Tunisian nationalists with whom he met in Paris that a constitution, an elected parliament, and a responsible government were by definition incompatible with the principle of a protectorate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0363199011432993">53</xref>
</sup> After his arrival in Tunisia, Saint immediately took a hard line against the nationalist struggle, refusing to make any concessions to nationalists, even after the Bey threatened to abdicate in protest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0363199011432993">54</xref>
</sup> Instead, he sought to weaken the nationalist struggle by introducing small reforms intended to placate moderate nationalists and separate them from their more radical counterparts. He did this in July of 1922 by introducing the <italic>Grand Conseil</italic>, or Grand Council, a representative body consisting of separate French and Tunisian sections and designed to replace the Consultative Conference. The French section was comprised of twenty-one representatives of the colony’s economic interests (agriculture, industry, and commerce) and twenty-three representatives of the French settler population; the Tunisian section, by contrast, contained only eighteen representatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0363199011432993">55</xref>
</sup> Because of this great disparity between the numbers of French and Tunisian representatives, the 1922 reform ultimately did little to undermine the nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Of the two sections of the Grand Council, it is the Tunisian section that generated the most controversy and as a result has received the most attention from historians studying the 1922 political reforms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0363199011432993">56</xref>
</sup> On one side of the debate were the French settlers who objected to the very idea of Tunisian participation in government. The fact that there were more than twice as many French representatives as there were Tunisian representatives did little to mollify them. At the other end of the spectrum were Tunisian nationalists who believed that their minority status within the Grand Council weakened their voice. One telegram written by some nationalists for example, expressed anger that the residency did not even consult the Tunisian representatives before proceeding with these reforms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0363199011432993">57</xref>
</sup> Because of the controversy surrounding the Tunisian section, historians have assessed the 1922 reforms as part of the larger trajectory of nationalist unrest in Tunisia ultimately culminating in independence in 1957. The French section of the Grand Council, however, has received less attention in historical studies because its formation generated less controversy than did its Tunisian counterpart and its history was thus greatly overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the Tunisian section.</p>
<p>Though less controversial than the Tunisian section, the formation of the French section of the <italic>Grand Conseil</italic> sparked some debate within the French population, dividing settlers between supporters and opponents of what became known as the “formule.” This conflict centered on the fact that within the French section there were two types of representatives: representatives of the French colony for whom any male citizen and resident could vote and representatives of the economic interests elected solely by those citizens exercising the profession in question. The institution of the “formule” reflected, first of all, a frustration with universal suffrage as it existed in France. In a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, French officials explained that universal suffrage was more an expression of class rivalries than economic interests, something they wished to avoid in Tunisia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0363199011432993">58</xref>
</sup> In order to prioritize economic interests, therefore, the “formule” was designed to take into account the composition of the French population and give greater electoral weight to settlers working in professions of value to the residency. Of particular concern was the fact that bureaucrats represented 25.2 percent of the French population of Tunisia and greatly outnumbered agricultural workers who only represented 12.3 percent of the population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0363199011432993">59</xref>
</sup> As “bureaucrats, railroad men, etc. represent the majority of people and minority interests” the residency sought to give rural “settlers and shopkeepers a level of influence consistent with the large role that they take in the <italic>mise en valeur</italic> of the Protectorate.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0363199011432993">60</xref>
</sup> What some settlers found objectionable was that in this system of representation voters were not all created equally; the opinions of those who contributed to the prosperity of the colony by working in agriculture or business were more important and valuable than those who were working class or bureaucrats. The communists were among the most vocal opponents of the “formule,” arguing against the inequality that they saw in this system that accorded greater influence to some voters and interests over others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0363199011432993">61</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>By enabling French women to vote under certain circumstances, the formation of the French section of the Grand Council was revolutionary in its departure from the metropolitan political tradition. At a time when French women in France could not vote under any circumstances, French women in Tunisia had the right to vote on an equal basis as men for the twenty-one representatives in the economic chambers of the Grand Council.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0363199011432993">62</xref>
</sup> To be eligible to vote in these elections, individuals had to be at least twenty-five years of age, have resided in the colony for at least six months, and had to practice one of the agricultural or business professions represented by the economic chambers. Though able to elect representatives for the economic chambers, French women were not, however, able to run for office.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0363199011432993">63</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Women were not able to vote on an equal basis as men in the elections for the other chamber’s twenty-three representatives of the settler population. Nevertheless, elections for this chamber were by familial suffrage and in this way also represented a major departure from the metropolitan tradition of universal suffrage. Article thirty-two of the decree stipulated that:<disp-quote>
<p>In addition to his personal right, the head of the family exercises a right to a supplemental vote for his minor children of both sexes whether legitimate or illegitimate, if the number is at least equal to four. In the event of death, legal incapacity or the presumed or declared judicial absence of the head of the family, the complementary right of suffrage is exercised by the legal civil representative of the aforementioned minors. The right of supplementary vote is fixed each year at the moment at which electoral lists are established. These lists must mention the name and age of the minors for whom the supplemental vote exists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0363199011432993">64</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>This version of familial suffrage combined aspects of both the Lemire and Roulleaux-Dugage models advocated by pronatalists in the metropole. On the one hand, familial suffrage in Tunisia was similar to Lemire’s model in its stipulation that heads of households exercise one supplemental vote on behalf of the family as opposed to exercising multiple supplemental votes on a per child basis. Yet, in logic and purpose, this version of familial suffrage resembled more closely the Roulleaux-Dugage model. In one document detailing the functioning of this elected body, the author explained that the right to a supplemental vote did not inherently belong to the father. Rather, the person exercising the supplemental vote was simply the head of household which could just as easily be the mother or another legal guardian.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0363199011432993">65</xref>
</sup> With this version of familial suffrage, therefore, the purpose was not solely to elevate the political status of the <italic>père de famille</italic>; the purpose was by contrast to extend greater representation to large families through the political participation of the head of household, whether male or female.</p>
<p>Even though women were by and large excluded from participating in the elections for the settler representatives, familial suffrage nevertheless offered women the possibility of exercising the supplemental vote as widows or legal representatives in the absence of a male head of household. The law made it clear that in these circumstances a woman was not voting as an individual, thus casting a ballot with her own interests in mind, but rather as a representative, therefore casting a ballot to represent the children under her care. Yet, such distinctions were merely symbolic; once given a ballot, a woman was free to vote in whatever manner she saw fit, whether with her own interests in mind or those of her children. The right of women to vote under these circumstances continued to be included in later decrees reforming the Grand Council. Furthermore, the lists of registered voters for the protectorate reveal that a small number of women took advantage of the opportunity that familial suffrage represented and registered to vote. In 1928, for example, nine French women exercised this supplemental vote.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0363199011432993">66</xref>
</sup> Five of these women were widowed mothers and the other four women were legal guardians of the children on whose behalf they voted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0363199011432993">67</xref>
</sup> It should be pointed out that in these cases the woman only cast a single vote, representing her children, and did not receive a vote to represent herself as head of household. Because a man who was eligible for the family vote was allowed to cast two votes, one for himself and one for his children, there was an obvious inequality between those large families headed by a woman and those headed by a man.</p>
<p>The colonial context and French officials' perceptions of the Muslim family played an important role in their decision to adopt a model of familial suffrage that would offer only limited political participation to women. Like many Europeans, French officials during this period viewed the status of women as indicative of a society’s level of civilization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0363199011432993">68</xref>
</sup> This was particularly true in North Africa where French visitors and officials displayed a mixture of disapproval and fascination for Muslim cultural practices. French observers imagined Muslim women as oppressed, scorned by their husbands, and completely inaccessible as they were either sequestered or veiled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0363199011432993">69</xref>
</sup> While this particular assessment was erroneous in a number of ways,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0363199011432993">70</xref>
</sup> it nevertheless prompted some feminists to assert that French authorities should civilize gender relations in the empire by bringing the Muslim family under French law. Colonial authorities, however, had no interest in attempting to abolish such practices as polygamy and child marriage and maintained a policy of nonintervention. Maréchal Lyautey, for example, asserted that France should “respect the morals and private lives of the natives [and] also respect the existing hierarchies and powers.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0363199011432993">71</xref>
</sup> This policy of nonintervention in North Africa stood in stark contrast to the policies of French officials in Madagascar and French West Africa who sought to reform family life in order to raise the birthrate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0363199011432993">72</xref>
</sup> One factor that distinguished French attitudes in North Africa from French policies elsewhere in the empire was the perception that North African families were prolific; officials lacked the same types of economic motivations for introducing familial reforms as did their counterparts in Madagascar.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0363199011432993">73</xref>
</sup> More significant was the French perception that Muslims were highly protective of their traditions and impervious to outside influences. Viewing Islam as immutable in this way, French officials believed that not only would it have been futile to attempt to reform the Muslim family, but also dangerous. They did not want to alienate those Muslim elites who collaborated with colonial authorities and made indirect rule possible.</p>
<p>It was the belief that Islam defined cultural practices in Tunisia and that offending Muslim sensibilities could potentially weaken French rule in the protectorate that made officials particularly sensitive about how the Muslim population viewed French women. This perception impacted the issue of whether or not it would be wise to extend voting rights to women as part of the family vote. There is some archival evidence to suggest that officials had considered the possibility of adopting a version of familial suffrage that would enable women to vote on their own behalf, thus consistent with the model Roulleaux-Dugage proposed in 1920.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0363199011432993">74</xref>
</sup> Because this model of suffrage would simultaneously augment the voting rights of some men, the extension of voting rights to women under this formula should not be misconstrued as equal voting rights for women, however. One document explained that ultimately the residency chose not to include women’s suffrage as part of the family vote partly out of certain “prejudices” against the idea and partly because extending political rights to women, no matter how limited, could compromise French colonial rule. “In Tunisia, the natives would look disfavorably upon any interference, even indirectly, of the weaker French sex in the leadership of the country.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0363199011432993">75</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this way, officials feared that allowing women to participate actively in the government would make the French government appear weak, possibly even effeminate, and suggested that colonial subjects would resist its authority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0363199011432993">76</xref>
</sup> This same official went on to write that the “interference” of French women in political affairs would further confirm the colonial subjects in their belief that the French government was liable to being influenced by the devil, as opposed to “the clear and just inspirations of Allah.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0363199011432993">77</xref>
</sup> It is unclear how officials thought the Tunisian population would react to the small number of women who were eligible to vote in elections for the economic section and those eligible to exercise the supplemental vote for representatives of the French colony. It is possible that because such women were few in number, authorities assumed that their participation would go largely unnoticed by the colonial subjects. What is clear, however, is that the residency either considered full voting rights for women to be too controversial in a colonial setting or was willing to use perceived Tunisian cultural norms as an excuse to refuse women the vote. The fact that Tunisian women were specifically excluded from voting in the elections for the economic chambers further suggests that French officials took the potential reaction of Tunisian men under consideration when addressing gender issues.<sup>

</p>
<p>While nationalist upheaval was the initial motivation for the reforms of 1922, the decision to include familial suffrage as part of these reforms stemmed from a combination of anxieties about the unique demographic situation of the protectorate, successful lobbying on the part of the settler population, and a growing conviction that, as was evident in French political life at this time, the French family as a unit had rights distinct from those of individual citizens. First of all, demographic anxieties in Tunisia were arguably more acute than in France. As the French population continued to dominate in France and foreign immigrants remained a minority, the consequences of depopulation appeared to be more long term, despite the heightened concern about immigration and low birthrates. By contrast, in Tunisia demographic concerns seemed more immediate because the French settler population was greatly outnumbered by Italian settlers. For example, when Tunisia first became a French protectorate in 1881, there were 1.5 million people, 20,000 of whom were European settlers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0363199011432993">79</xref>
</sup> This number included 11,000 Italians, 7,000 Maltese, and only 708 French settlers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0363199011432993">80</xref>
</sup> While the French population grew considerably after the establishment of the protectorate, French settlers remained in the minority. In 1911, for example, there were 88,000 Italian settlers compared to 46,000 French settlers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0363199011432993">81</xref>
</sup> French authorities alleged that the Great War added to this demographic imbalance as the French settlers enlisted in the army in far greater numbers than did the Italians. One consequence of this was that the Italian population continued to grow during the war years and began to encroach on French farmland and industries while French men were away fighting in the war.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0363199011432993">82</xref>
</sup> In the aftermath of the war, the residency responded to these concerns by introducing the decree of 8 November 1921 mandating that children born in Tunisia to foreign citizens (with the exception of Italians) also born in Tunisia would have French citizenship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0363199011432993">83</xref>
</sup> This decree, that mimicked the law enacted in France in 1889, was specifically intended to increase the numbers of “French” settlers in order to counterbalance the Italian population. About 5,000 Maltese settlers immediately became naturalized as a result of this decree, much to the dismay of the British government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0363199011432993">84</xref>
</sup> After taking office shortly following the passage of this decree, Saint sought to build on his predecessor’s efforts by exploring the possibility of recruiting Polish immigrants for settlement in Tunisia, plans that do not appear to have been put into action.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0363199011432993">85</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the growth of the French population, therefore, officials throughout the interwar period worried that the Italian population constituted a separate, impossible to assimilate community. It was not until 1896 that Italy recognized Tunisia as a French protectorate and only agreed to this in exchange for a series of privileges for Italian citizens residing in Tunisia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0363199011432993">86</xref>
</sup> These privileges included commercial advantages and the right to establish Italian schools and hospitals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0363199011432993">87</xref>
</sup> In response, French officials carefully monitored Italian newspapers, clergy, and other perceived disseminators of Italian nationalism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0363199011432993">88</xref>
</sup> When Benito Mussolini became prime minister of Italy in 1922, soon after Saint’s reforms, concerns about Italian nationalism and the potential expansion of Italy into North Africa appeared all the more pressing. Shortly after taking power, Mussolini made his imperial ambitions known, ambitions that included the ancient Roman colonies in North Africa and rejecting the treaty of 1896.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0363199011432993">89</xref>
</sup> In response to these pressures, Saint carefully monitored numbers of Italian naturalizations and sought to encourage more Italians to become French citizens, using French schools as recruiting centers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0363199011432993">90</xref>
</sup> He proposed free tuition, books, and supplies as a way to attract students away from Italian schools and also suggested preferential employment treatment for Italians who agreed to become French citizens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0363199011432993">91</xref>
</sup> Despite all these efforts, the Italian population continued to be demographically strong in the 1920s, an advantage that, according to William Shorrock, the Italian government sought to exploit. Throughout this period, fascist leaders traveled to Tunisia and encouraged settlers to maintain their Italian identities. This included lectures and newspapers for adults, and literary clubs, free school books, and sponsored trips to Italy for children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0363199011432993">92</xref>
</sup> Rebellious youth wore fascist medals and Italians clandestinely posted portraits of <italic>Il Duce</italic> in the streets, in defiance of French decrees forbidding the practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0363199011432993">93</xref>
</sup>

<p>Because of the perceived Italian threat, French officials believed that supporting French families and promoting population growth were essential to maintaining colonial rule. Elevating the status and political importance of large families through the establishment of the family vote would contribute to these objectives. Expressing how closely these goals were related, one French official wrote that it was essential that they establish in Tunisia a voting system that would “encourage French settlement.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0363199011432993">94</xref>
</sup> This same official explained that it was prolific families who were central to French settlement and the financial future of the colony. “In Tunisia, where there are so many pressing motives for wanting to increase the numbers of French people, large families deserve more, than is the case anywhere else, to be prominent.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0363199011432993">95</xref>
</sup> It is clear, therefore, that when making the decision to include familial suffrage in the 1922 reforms, the residency connected familial suffrage with concerns about the strength of the French settler population vis-à-vis other populations in Tunisia. This was a view that was supported by some very vocal settler organizations, most notably the <italic>Ligue Française des Pères et Mères de Familles Nombreuses</italic>, a familialist organization representing 2,200 settler families and headed by Henri Lacoux.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0363199011432993">96</xref>
</sup> Members of Lacoux’s organization were very involved in the government and appealed to Saint directly to establish the family vote.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0363199011432993">97</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was because of some fundamental differences between the political system in France and that of Tunisia that the residency was able to introduce familial suffrage with minimal opposition, in contrast to what was seen in France. In France, the suggestion that familial suffrage undermined the egalitarian principles on which the Republic was based was one of the main reasons why its opponents remained loyal to universal manhood suffrage and could not be swayed by pronatalists' arguments. Furthermore, despite gaining the support of some key members of the French government, familial suffrage ultimately failed in France because of parliamentary opposition. Such obstacles were nonexistent in Tunisia, first of all, because of the absence of a parliament or analogous elected body; the resident general was able to simply implement his reforms. Furthermore, when Lucien Saint implemented familial suffrage in 1922, he was neither replacing an established tradition of universal manhood suffrage nor controversially redefining the democratic process. In fact, as we have seen, prior to 1922 the only representation that French settlers had in Tunisia was the Consultative Conference and this was merely in place to represent the interests of certain professions. The introduction of familial suffrage in elections to the settlers' section of the <italic>grand conseil</italic> marked the first time that there was an elected body in place to represent the interests of all French settlers. Its establishment, moreover, came at a time when the concept of universal suffrage was being reevaluated in France, with many individuals favoring a different form of suffrage, be it voting rights for women or the family vote. The argument that the existing form of suffrage did not represent the interests of the entire population, neither promoting population growth nor family life, extended to the empire and shaped political life in Tunisia.</p>
<p>The introduction of familial suffrage into settler political life in Tunisia in 1922 ultimately redefined the relationship between the Residency and French citizens residing in the protectorate. It is important to note that the status of French citizens in Tunisia had always differed in fundamental ways from the status of French citizens in France. First of all, French citizens had a privileged status in the protectorate as the majority of people were either foreign nationals or Tunisian subjects. Still, despite this privileged status within their own community, settlers asserted that by living in Tunisia as opposed to in France, they lacked the full range of benefits and rights ordinarily given to French citizens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0363199011432993">98</xref>
</sup> For one thing, in addition to lacking representatives in the French parliament, settlers in Tunisia did not elect their head of state, the Resident General, as he was simply appointed by the French government in Paris. Additionally, when passing new legislation, the French government often distinguished between French citizens living in France and those residing in the empire. To be included in such legislation, the colonies and protectorates had to be specifically named. This was a major grievance to settlers who argued that they were effectively second class citizens given that advantageous French laws granting financial benefits to families were not applied in Tunisia. At times this may have happened simply because French legislators did not think to add a clause extending the legislation into greater France; frequently, however, it was because legislators believed that many French laws could not be applied effectively in such a different political and demographic context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0363199011432993">99</xref>
</sup> Still, despite not benefiting from pronatalist legislation passed in France, settler families in Tunisia did gain from some legislation introduced by the Residency, including discounts on school fees, funds for birth incentives, and financial assistance for needy large families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0363199011432993">100</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned social welfare benefits for families, the advent of familial suffrage in 1922 signifies that the Residency was inclined to think of citizens in terms of their familial situation as opposed to simply viewing them as individuals. This distinguished Tunisia from France. In France, as we have seen, employers and the government extended social welfare benefits to families, thereby demonstrating their inclination to distinguish between citizens on the basis of gender, family, and employment. Still, in France the tradition of universal suffrage was ultimately maintained while the concept of familial suffrage was rejected. This indicates that in political life, the French government persisted in thinking of citizens as individuals, albeit gendered individuals as suffrage for women was not introduced until after the Second World War. In Tunisia, by contrast, a citizen’s rights to political representation were decided on the basis of a combination of familial status and gender. The size of a man’s family determined whether he received one vote or two. In addition, large families that lacked a patriarch and were instead headed by a woman received voting rights, something that was not the case in France where such families lacked representation entirely because of the absence of a man. Neverthless, the fact that large families headed by a woman only received one vote, as opposed to the two votes given to similar families headed by a man, shows the significance of gender to the familialist view of citizenship in Tunisia.</p>

<p>In fact, in the years after the war, the overall population growth was due entirely to immigration.
