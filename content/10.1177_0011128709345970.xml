<abstract>
<p>A detailed examination was conducted of the factors associated with pre- and postadjudication secure detention, including secure detention as a dispositional sentence and the effects of secure detention on decision making that further contribute to cumulative disadvantage for African Americans. The research was based on interpretations of the symbolic threat thesis, with emphasis on the stereotyping of African Americans as threatening, delinquent, and/or in need of confinement, to study decision making in one juvenile court jurisdiction. The results reveal that legal factors were most often predictors of each type of secure detention and decision making at other stages, but so too was race individually and in combination with legal and extralegal considerations and indirectly through secure detention. The relationships, however, did not always result in disadvantageous outcomes.</p>

<p>Minority youths and, in particular, African Americans continue to be overrepresented in the juvenile justice system relative to their representation in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709345970">Piquero, 2008</xref>). Discrepancies in the use of secure detention appear to be a contributing factor to the overrepresentation of African Americans in the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709345970">Holman &amp; Ziedenberg, 2006</xref>). Nationwide, for example, between 1983 and 1997, four out of five of new detainees during this 15-year period were minority youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709345970">Justice Policy Institute, 2002</xref>). In 2005, 19% of all juvenile delinquent referrals resulted in detention, with African American youths comprising 40% of those detained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128709345970">Puzzanchera &amp; Adams, 2008</xref>). Race also appears to have an indirect effect on case outcomes through detention that further contributes to the disproportionate representation of African American youths in secure corrections (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>). Relatively recently, a growing concern has emerged that has called into question the use of and criteria used to justify detention, especially for African American youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709345970">Holman &amp; Ziedenberg, 2006</xref>). Of particular interest, and the impetus for this study, has been the justification of detention on the basis of technical violations and judges’ use of secure detention as a dispositional outcome.</p>
<p>In the present study, the predictors of pre- and postadjudication secure detention, including detention as an outcome at judicial disposition, are examined, as is how being detained influences case outcomes. The extent these relationships vary by race and contribute to minority youths’ overrepresentation in secure detention and in the juvenile justice system is also assessed. A sample of juvenile court records in one jurisdiction in Iowa is used to ascertain the use of detention and the effect of race and detention on four decision-making stages (intake, petition, adjudication, and judicial disposition). Interpretations of consensus theory and the symbolic threat thesis with an emphasis on race stereotyping guide the inquiry.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128709345970">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The symbolic threat thesis is one example of a perspective that attempts to identify the contingencies of juvenile justice decision making by focusing on the characteristics of youths, especially minorities, and the social psychological emotions of juvenile court officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709345970">Tittle &amp; Curran, 1988</xref>). Central to the symbolic threat thesis is the emphasis on racial stereotyping and the negative perceptions of minority youths by juvenile court personnel. These stereotypes include African Americans as undisciplined; as living in dysfunctional families that are primarily headed by young mothers; and as sexually promiscuous, dangerous, delinquent, and prone to drug offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709345970">Feld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709345970">Leiber, 2003</xref>) or in need of more protection than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709345970">Bridges, Conley, Engen &amp; Price-Spratlen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709345970">Bridges &amp; Steen, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709345970">Sampson and Laub (1993)</xref>, for example, treated these perceptions as representative of symbolic threats to the middle class and their standards and values. Bridges and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709345970">1995</xref>) examined the interplay between racial stereotypic images to causal attributions and concerns for the public and moral order of a community. The symbolic threat thesis and the emphasis on racial stereotyping serve as the backdrop for the present research and may account for the overrepresentation of minority youths in pre- and postadjudication secure detention.</p>
<p>Over the years, there has been a plethora of studies that have examined the extent to which legal criteria, race, and other extralegal factors, as well as preadjudication detention, influence case processing and case outcomes in the juvenile justice system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709345970">Armstrong &amp; Rodriguez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709345970">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709345970">Guevara, Herz, &amp; Spohn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Mack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709345970">O’Neil, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128709345970">Steen, Bond, Bridges, &amp; Kubrin, 2005</xref>). Some research has shown that legal factors rather than race predict decision making and lend support for a consensus interpretation for minority overrepresentation in the juvenile justice system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709345970">Tracy, 2005</xref>). Still, at least five recent comprehensive reviews of this literature report that legal and extralegal factors alone are unable to account for race differences in involvement in the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709345970">Bishop, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128709345970">Engen, Steen, &amp; Bridges, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128709345970">Leiber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128709345970">Pope &amp; Feyerherm, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709345970">Pope, Lovell, &amp; Hsia, 2002</xref>). An in-depth discussion of these findings is beyond the scope of this article, but race was found to have a direct relationship with decision making, including detention, and/or interaction effects with legal variables (e.g., crime type, prior record, etc.) and/or extralegal factors (e.g., age, family status, etc.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709345970">Guevara et al. (2006)</xref>, for example, discovered that at preadjudication detention, females and Whites were less likely to be detained and that White males were less likely to be detained than were minority males. There was no reported race difference between girls. At disposition, White females, however, were found to be more likely than minority females to receive out-of-home placement and less likely to have charges dismissed. Among males, there were no race differences in terms of dismissed charges, but White males were more likely to receive probation and less likely to receive out-of-home placement than were minority males. In short, individual and combination effects of race and gender with decision making were found to exist, but the effects indicated both more severe and more lenient treatment.</p>
<p>Although most prior studies report African Americans to be more likely than similarly situated Whites to be held in preadjudication detention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709345970">Guevara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709345970">Justice Policy Institute, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345970">Rodriguez (2007)</xref> recently discovered just the opposite. According to her, “The less severe treatment received by Blacks at detention involves a ‘self correct’ process” whereby “juvenile court officials may be compensating for proactive arrest policies” (p. 649). A similar interpretation of decision making involving a correction factor on the part of juvenile court personnel for disparities at earlier stages in the proceedings has been offered elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709345970">Dannefer &amp; Schutt, 1982</xref>) and highlights the complexity of decision making in the juvenile justice system and the contextual nature of race.</p>
<p>Race has also been discovered to have indirect effects on decision making through detention. Studies have found that preadjudication detention affects outcomes at later stages and in particular judicial disposition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128709345970">Engen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709345970">Frazier &amp; Cochran, 1986</xref>). That is, being detained strongly predicts more severe treatment at judicial disposition. Although African American youths and White youths who have been detained may be treated similarly, because African American youths are more likely to be detained they receive more severe dispositions than do their White counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709345970">Frazier &amp; Bishop, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>). Consequently, race may not directly influence judicial disposition, but its effects may be masked, operating through a racially tainted but legitimate criterion of detention.</p>

<title>Implications for the Present Research</title>
<p>The individual, joint, and indirect effects of race and detention on decision making have been studied extensively, and although the results, for the most part, show an effect, much of the extant literature has limitations that the present study attempts to overcome. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709345970">Austin, Johnson, and Weitzer (2005)</xref> report that one third of all youths held in juvenile detention centers are detained for technical violations and status offenses (p. 1). Furthermore and as previously reported, African Americans and other minority youths are overrepresented in detention not for delinquent activity but often for technical violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709345970">Rosay &amp; Everett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709345970">Steinhart, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the very few studies that report on technical violations, race, and detention in juvenile justice proceedings, this limited body of work is lacking in empirical sophistication. For example, there is a failure to control for measures of either the social situation of the youth (family structure, school situation, etc.), the offending characteristics, and/or use of multivariate techniques. Because these studies use descriptive and inferential statistics (frequencies, percentages, or relative rate indexes), rather than employing multivariate statistical analyses, uncertainty exists whether minority overrepresentation in secure detention is due to differential offending and/or to differential selection. These shortcomings in the literature provide a need for further research and provide a justification for the present study.</p>
<p>Another void in the literature is the lack of information involving the use of secure detention postadjudication, especially as a dispositional sentence. Most studies focus on preadjudication secure detention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345970">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>). When postadjudication detention is examined, the focus of the inquiry is the effect of being detained on judicial disposition decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>). This is done to assess the relative negative impact of detention on case outcomes and to discover evidence of race indirect effects on decision making through detention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709345970">Frazier &amp; Cochran, 1986</xref>). Missing from this line of study is an assessment of detention as a dispositional sentence. In fact, a review of the prior literature failed to produce a single study. Thus, there is a need for research into the use of detention as a sentencing option and the factors, including race, predictive of its use. The objective of the present study is to address this limitation in the literature.</p>

<title>Types of Secure Detention and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Decision making in one juvenile court jurisdiction in the State of Iowa is examined to assess the effect of race on each type of detention and the extent to which race and detention influence further court proceedings. There are three types of secure detention or ways youths can be held in secure detention in Iowa. The first type is the non-48-hour hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709345970"><italic>Iowa Code</italic>, 2001</xref>, section 232.52.2), whereby youths on the basis of the crime (or crimes) that led to the referral can be detained prior to or at adjudication; this will be referred to here as <italic>preadjudication detention</italic>. A youth who has been adjudicated (found delinquent) and awaiting disposition (section 232.47) can be detained due to a crime and/or violation of probation condition (e.g., missed appointment, curfew violation, etc.). This type of secure detention will be defined as <italic>postadjudication detention</italic>. The third and last type of secure detention is a 48-hour hold (section 232.52) and occurs postdisposition at the discretion of a judge at the judicial disposition hearing as a sentencing outcome. Similar to detention criteria across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709345970">Austin et al., 2005</xref>), state statutes for each type of secure detention lack specificity and provide a great deal of discretion to the police, juvenile court officers, and judges to determine whether detention is necessary (sections 232.22, 232.52).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128709345970">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The assumptions of the symbolic threat thesis and results of prior research on race and secure detention inform the hypotheses guiding the study. The first two hypotheses center on the assumption that African American youths will be the recipients of preadjudication (Hypothesis 1) and postadjudication detention (Hypothesis 2) than similarly situated White youths. Justification for these two hypotheses rests with the anticipation that African American youths will be perceived by decision makers as dangerous, delinquent, or prone to drug offenses; coming from dysfunctional families; and/or in need of supervision involving secure detention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709345970">Bridges &amp; Steen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709345970">Feld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709345970">Sampson &amp; Laub, 1993</xref>). The role of race stereotyping is assumed to extend to decisions on the part of decision makers to exercise secure detention postadjudication involving violations of the conditions of probation. That is, decision makers are expected to adhere to different thresholds of tolerance for African Americans compared to Whites who engage in behaviors or activities that are believed to constitute a violation of a condition of probation. A counterhypothesis based on consensus theory is that any discovered race differences in pre- and postadjudication secure detention will be explained away by differences in the commission of crime and/or probation violations involving technical violations as well as extralegal factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709345970">Tracy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The third and fourth hypotheses framing the research are based on the anticipation that preadjudication detention will predict postadjudication detention (Hypothesis 3) and that both will influence, when appropriate, more severe outcomes as youths move through the proceedings, including the use of a change of placement at judicial disposition (Hypothesis 4).</p>
<p>These hypotheses come from prior research that indicates that detention increases the likelihood of both future detention decisions and receiving severe outcomes at other decision-making stages in the proceedings. Past study has revealed the presence of a cumulative disadvantage for detained youths that is especially detrimental for detained African Americans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709345970">Frazier &amp; Bishop, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The fifth and final hypothesis is the expectation that African American youths will be more likely than White youths to receive a dispositional outcome involving a change of placement than a 48-hour-hold detention or community-based corrections as a dispositional sentence (Hypothesis 5). Underlying this fifth hypothesis is the belief that when judges have a choice between community-based corrections; placement in a training school, residential facility, and so on; and the use of secure detention for 48 hours, the lengthier outcome, as well as the more severe outcome involving a change of placement, will be exercised. Once again, it is anticipated that African American youths will be perceived by decision makers, in this case, judges, as more problematic and dangerous than similarly situated White youths and, therefore, in need of a longer term of confinement and/or treatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709345970">Sampson &amp; Laub, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Black Hawk County, Iowa, has a population of 130,224 people, with persons age 17 and younger constituting 24% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709345970">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000</xref>). African Americans comprise the largest group of minority youths (11%-13%). In the largest city (Waterloo) in this county, African American youths make up about 19% of all youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709345970">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000</xref>). The present research focuses on youths referred from this county to detention and youths handled within the juvenile court.</p>
<sec id="section5-0011128709345970">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Cases were selected for those in detention and youths referred to juvenile court but not held in detention from 2003 through 2004. Of the 550 identified cases that resulted in detention, 478, or 87% of those were located in the search-through case files. There is no evidence that the missing 72 cases differed by race. The juvenile court nondetained sample consists of a random sampling of case files for Whites and disproportionate random sampling for African Americans, for a total of 449. The differences in sampling by race were done to ensure the ability to make comparisons between Whites and African Americans across decision-making stages (i.e., detention to intake to judicial disposition). The juvenile court nondetained sample was weighted to reflect the general population of cases referred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128709345970">2</xref></sup> The total sample size used in the present research was 927.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Race is defined as White and African American, with a majority White (55%). Preadjudication detention is justified by the crime that led to the initial court referral, and postadjudication detention should be due to a court violation and make up two of the three types of secure detention, defined as <italic>no</italic> and <italic>yes</italic>. Thirty-five percent of the sample had been subject to a preadjudication detention, whereas 10% was in postadjudication detention. The relatively low percentage of court violations as the reason for postadjudication secure detention in this jurisdiction is not consistent with findings nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709345970">Austin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A majority of the sample is male (74%) and approximately 15 years of age. Family living status was defined as a two-parent household versus a one-parent household. Seventy-eight percent of the sample resided in a household with one parent present. The variable school problems represents no notation of problems in school versus attending but problems or not attending. Forty-six percent of the sample indicates problems at school.</p>
<p>Three measures of the juvenile’s previous legal history included the number of prior contacts with the juvenile justice system (interval), the severity of the prior referral (<italic>less than adjudication</italic> = 0, <italic>adjudicated</italic> = 1), and whether the youth was under court authority at the time of the current referral (<italic>no</italic> = 0, <italic>yes</italic> = 1). Characteristics of the current offense were the number of charges against the youth (interval), the type of delinquency, and the seriousness of the offense (interval). Because of the theoretical importance of offense type in juvenile justice decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709345970">Sampson &amp; Laub, 1993</xref>), dummy variables were created to distinguish between property, person, and drug offenses. Referrals consisting of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and so on comprised the reference category. Although detained youths are part of the sample, most cases were still classified as misdemeanors and involved property crimes. Only 19% and 20% of the sample were charged with a person offense or a drug offense, respectively. Overall, the offenses reflect national aggregate arrest statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709345970">Snyder, 2008</xref>) and are somewhat limited in severity.</p>
<p>Although pre- and postadjudication secure detention are treated as independent variables, they are also viewed as dependent variables. As independent variables, pre- and postadjudication detention allow for the assessment of the relative impact on case outcomes as well as insight into possible indirect relationships with detention decisions further in the proceedings and decision making at other stages. As dependent variables, the interest lies in the predictors of pre- and postadjudication secure detention. In addition to detention decision making, four stages are examined and constitute a dependent variable, with the most severe decision outcome representing the reference category for analysis purposes.</p>
<p><italic>Intake</italic> is defined by release, diversion or informal adjustment, and referral to court. The most common outcome at intake was referral to court (57%), followed by diversion (29%), and release (14%). It is important to point out that in Iowa juvenile court officers make the decision to release, to offer an informal adjustment in the form of diversion, or to recommend further court processing at intake.</p>
<p>The decision to seek further formal court proceedings is made by the prosecutor and occurs at the stage of <italic>petition.</italic> A significant majority of the juveniles (86%) were petitioned. Next, the <italic>adjudication</italic> stage is operationalized as dismissed and as the adjudication of delinquency. Eighty percent of the cases reaching this stage were adjudicated delinquent. <italic>Judicial disposition</italic> was measured by differentiating between community-based corrections, a 48-hour-hold secure detention, and out-of-home placement to fully capture the factors that influence this decision-making stage. Forty-two percent of the dispositional sentences involve an out-of-home placement, followed by a 48-hour-hold secure detention at 32%, and community-based corrections at 26%.</p>

<p>Consistent with the first hypothesis, African American youths are more likely than similarly situated Whites to be detained preadjudication by almost 2 to 1 once all factors are controlled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709345970">Table 2</xref>, column 1). A number of race interaction effects on preadjudication detention also appear to be present.</p>
<p>Residing in a single-parent household is statistically significant for African Americans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709345970">Table 2</xref>, column 3) but not for Whites (column 2), and tests comparing coefficients for each model reveal a significant difference. Being in a single-parent household increases the likelihood of preadjudication detention for African Americans by almost 2½ times relative to Whites. Evidence of school problems decreases rather than increases the odds of this type of detention for African Americans by 55%, whereas for Whites, although inverse, it is not a statistically significant predictor of the dependent variable. The last statistically significant race interaction relationship with this dependent variable is with property offending. Youths charged with a property offense inversely affect the detention decision for Whites, while having no influence for African Americans. A White involved in a property offense decreases the likelihood of preadjudication detention by 77%.</p>
<p>Contrary to the second hypothesis, being African American is not a predictor of postadjudication detention due to a court violation once relevant legal and extralegal considerations are controlled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709345970">Table 2</xref>, column 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128709345970">4</xref></sup> Youths previously detained (preadjudication detention) decreased the odds of postadjudication detention due to a court violation by 46%. Although the inverse effect was not anticipated (Hypothesis 3), a closer examination of the relationship shows it to be conditioned by being White (compare column 5 to column 6). For Whites having been detained preadjudication, the likelihood of not receiving postadjudication detention is decreased by 79%.</p>

<title>Detention and Decision Making at Other Stages</title>
<p>In this section, the relative effects of pre- and postadjudication secure detention, race, and other factors on decision making at intake, petition, adjudication, and judicial disposition are examined. As with each type of secure detention, legal and extralegal considerations are predictive of decision making at each stage as is race, individually and in combination with some of the independent variables and detention. In addition, race has an indirect effect on case outcomes through secure detention. Once again, the overall effects of secure detention on decision making are not as linear as expected and involve detained youths’ receiving both severe and lenient outcomes.</p>

<p>A look at race across the models reveals that race is not a predictor of the decision to refer to court relative to release (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128709345970">Table 3</xref>, column 1) and diversion (column 4). Race, however, is inversely related to the decisions to release compared to diversion (column 7). That is, African Americans are less likely to participate in diversion relative to being released by 48%.</p>
<p>Similar to results from prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709345970">Frazier &amp; Cochran, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345970">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>), race has an indirect effect on decisions involving a court referral and release compared to diversion through preadjudication detention. Recall that in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709345970">Table 2</xref> race was a predictor of preadjudication detention. Because race was predictive of detention, and detention, in turn, is a determinant of the intake decision to refer to court for further proceedings relative to diversion, an indirect effect between race, detention, and intake decision making is present. Detention decreases the odds of diversion relative to court referral by 96% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128709345970">Table 3</xref>, column 4). Differentiating the effect of detention on intake decision making by race also shows that among Whites preadjudication detention decreased the likelihood of court referral by 33% (column 5). The effect of detention for African Americans was skewed and omitted from the model (column 6) due to the lack of variation in the preadjudication detention variable involving the outcome of diversion. Not one African American who was detained received diversion but was instead referred to court. Detention is also predictive of the decision to release relative to diversion (column 7). Youths who were detained decreased the odds of diversion relative to release by 0.95. Thus, African American youths through secure preadjudication detention and detention in general significantly increase the chances of being referred on for further proceedings (i.e., petition) and a lack of participation in diversion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011128709345970">
<title>Petition and adjudication</title>
<p>The logistic regression results for decision making at petition and adjudication are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128709345970">Table 4</xref>. Although an additive race effect does not exist with petition, a main effect on adjudication decision making is present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128709345970">Table 4</xref>, column 4). African Americans are twice as likely as similarly situated Whites to be adjudicated delinquent. Tests involving comparisons of the coefficients representing models for Whites and African Americans show a number of race interaction relationships with both petition and adjudication decision making.</p>

<p>At petition, being African American and from a single-parent household and African American under court authority at the time of the initial court referral increase the likelihood of being petitioned (5½ times for the former relationship and more than 4¾ for the latter; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128709345970">Table 4</xref>, column 3).

<p>Preadjudication secure detention is not a statistically significant determinant of decision making at petition or adjudication.

<p>Comparing the decision for a 48-hour-hold secure detention to a disposition involving the community, we can see that race by itself does not affect decision making at this point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128709345970">Table 5</xref>, columns 1, 4, and 7). Race and gender, however, interact to play an influential role in deciding a 48-hour-hold secure detention relative to a community disposition (columns 1, 2, and 3). Being African American and female increases the likelihood of receiving a community-based sanction by more than 8 times relative to a 48-hour-hold secure detention.</p>
<p>Contrary to the fifth hypothesis guiding the study, being African American, individually or in combination with other factors, does not increase the likelihood of receiving an out-of-home placement relative to a 48-hour-hold detention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128709345970">Table 5</xref>, column 4).</p>
<p>Consistent with the fourth hypothesis, both pre- and postsecure detention increase the decision to exercise out-of-home placement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128709345970">Table 5</xref>, column 4) relative to an order of a 48-hour-hold detention. A closer inspection of the relationships of pre- and postadjudication on disposition outcomes also reveals positive statistically significant effects involving the decision to use community-based corrections compared to a 48-hour secure detention (column 1). The effects in both comparisons are not race specific (compare column 2 to column 3 and column 5 to column 6). Joint race relationships, however, exist when decision making is examined involving an outcome of community-based corrections versus out-of-home placement.</p>
<p>For African Americans, postadjudication detention decreases the likelihood of an out-of-home placement when the other case outcome involves community-based corrections. This combination relationship with the dependent variable reduces the chances of receiving the more severe outcome by 88% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128709345970">Table 5</xref>, column 9). Preadjudication secure detention is not a determinant of decisions involving community-based corrections and out-of-home placement (columns 7, 8, and 9). Last, another race interaction relationship is present that exists with school problems. African Americans who have problems at school decrease the odds of out-of-home placement by 80% when the alternative is community-based corrections (column 9). Each of these findings is indicative of African Americans’ receiving a disposition of community-based corrections relative to a change of placement, and detention either augments this decision (postadjudication) or plays no role (preadjudication).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An interpretation of the symbolic threat thesis with the emphasis on race stereotyping was used to address five hypotheses that centered on the interplay between race and secure detention, with decision making throughout juvenile court proceedings. An examination of pre- and postadjudication secure detention decision making and the impact on case outcomes for youths in general and African Americans in particular in one juvenile court jurisdiction, for the most part, yields support for the hypotheses guiding the study. The relationships, however, did not always result in receiving more severe outcomes, nor were they as pronounced or contribute to cumulative disadvantage to the extent anticipated.</p>
<p>In short, the findings lend further credence to the belief that juvenile justice decision making needs to be viewed as a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709345970">Bishop, 2005</xref>). As many stages as possible should be included in researching the factors that affect case outcomes, and this includes taking into account pre- and postadjudication secure detention. The omission of any one of the three types of secure detention examined and the other four stages in Iowa’s juvenile justice system may have resulted in the inability to fully capture both the direct and indirect effects of race and detention on decision making and the varying results of severity and leniency in outcomes.</p>
<p>The inconsistency in the outcomes also reaffirms the need to recognize the complexity of decision making in the juvenile justice system. In contrast to the criminal justice system, juvenile justice proceedings consist of many stages and different actors at each stage (e.g., intake officer at intake, prosecutor at petition, and judge at adjudication and judicial disposition). Furthermore, each actor in the juvenile justice system does not always share similar goals and may even be incompatible with other actors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128709345970">Sanborn, 1995</xref>). Accordingly, the effects of legal criteria, the “best interests of youths,” and racial stereotyping may have more or less of an influence and/or play out differently at one stage as compared to another (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128709345970">Leiber, Brubaker, &amp; Fox, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Jamieson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345970">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>). Support for this statement can be found in the varying effects race and pre- and postadjudication secure detention had earlier in the proceedings.</p>
<p>At the earlier decision-making stages, African Americans, individually or in combination with other variables, received more severe outcomes than those indicative of leniency. At judicial disposition, the opposite is found, where judges appear to be enacting a bias correction factor in the form of giving more lenient outcomes to African Americans compared to Whites. Prior research has reported such practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345970">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>), but rarely has this been reported at judicial disposition (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345970">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>). The task for future research is to conduct more direct tests through interviews and/or observational research to yield further insights into these possible explanations and, in general, a context for the inconsistency in outcomes for African Americans and Whites.</p>
<p>The impetus for this study, in part, was concern regarding the extent and factors associated with pre- and postadjudication detention, especially those involving court violations for African American youths, as well as secure detention as a disposition sentence. The relative impact of each type of detention on decision making at later stages in the proceedings was also a focus of inquiry. Recall that in some jurisdictions, court violations have been reported to be the primary reason for preadjudication secure detention with an overrepresentation of African American youths (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709345970">Rosay &amp; Everett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709345970">Steinhart, 2001</xref>). Of the types of secure detention examined, postadjudication detention due to a court violation was the least frequently used, with detention most often justified on the basis of the crime leading to the initial court referral (preadjudication detention) followed by a 48-hour-hold detention at judicial disposition. Still, and consistent with prior research, technical violations in the form of missing curfew and failing drug urinalyses rather than delinquency comprised a significant percentage of the court violations (not shown here). In addition, of the crimes (<italic>N</italic> = 29) making up the court violations, most involved nonserious activities. The use of qualitative research would also allow for a better understanding of the relationships between race and the use of the various types of secure detention and the interplay between the two with decision making at other stages in the proceedings.</p>
<p>More specific, the finding that postadjudication secure detention for technical violations is not used as often as anticipated is encouraging because underlying the need for its use should be youths who commit a crime or pose a danger to themselves and/or others. The possible negative consequences of unnecessary secure detention for relatively trivial acts, such as technical violations, outweigh the need to simply “teach a youth a lesson” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709345970">Austin et al., 2005</xref>). Interviews with decision makers and especially judges could provide a context as to why and what triggers the decision to use a 48-hour detention as part of the judicial disposition compared to community-based treatment and another type of placement outside of the home. Statutory legislation provides little direction, and the factors employed in this study to understand decision making at this stage failed to yield evidence of many statistically significant predictors, suggesting that judges have a tremendous amount of discretion as to what dispositional outcome should be given. Input from judges would not only possibly provide some insights into this process but could also give further clarity to the findings that African Americans and African American females and youths in detention are less likely to receive a 48-hour-hold detention, whereas a White detained due to the initial crime that led to the court referral is more likely to be placed in a 48-hour-hold detention.</p>
<p>Further research is also needed because only one jurisdiction was studied, limiting the ability to generalize the results reported to practices elsewhere. This suggestion is made more evident by the finding that in this jurisdiction only two incidents were found where youths were detained on technical violations prior to adjudication. Although not permitted by state law in Iowa, research in other jurisdictions has found that it is here where the greatest disparities exist in the use of detention for African American compared to Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709345970">Steinhart, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the need for further research, the study focused on the neglected area of postadjudication detention and, in particular, on the use of secure detention as a judicial disposition. Although legal factors were most often predictors, race individually and in combination with legal and extralegal considerations was still found to explain pre- and postadjudication detention and decision making at other stages. These results are to some extent in line with a conflict orientation and the symbolic threat thesis and the emphasis on racial stereotyping, but these relationships did not always result in disadvantageous outcomes. This latter point suggests there must be an awareness of the multiple stages, actors, and goals involved in juvenile justice proceedings, as well as the overall contexts of the juvenile court (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128709345970">Sanborn, 1995</xref>), before reforms may be effective at reducing the unnecessary secure detainment of youths and ensuring equitable treatment of African Americans relative to Whites. This includes the recognition that secure detention is an option for decision makers at pre- and postadjudication, including as a sentence at judicial disposition.</p>

<p>There was no written detention survey instrument to assist in detention decisions at this facility at the time the data were collected for the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709345970"><italic>Iowa Code</italic>, 2001</xref>, section 232.44). Detention can be used to minimize risk of reoffending while the current delinquent charge (or charges) is determined and the case is settled, to prevent flight and to protect the alleged offender from imminent bodily harm. At postadjudication, if a youth violates conditions of probation, secure detention can be ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709345970"><italic>Iowa Code</italic>, 2001</xref>, section 232.22; 232.52). At judicial disposition, placement in secure detention for 48 hours by a judge is appropriate in view of the seriousness of the delinquent act, the child’s culpability as indicated by the circumstances of the particular case, the age of the child, the child’s prior record, or the fact that the child has received a youthful offender deferred sentence under section 907.3A.</p>

<p>An examination of the data revealed few differences by (a) race and the three types of detention and (b) race and the independent variables when compared to each type of detention. Thus, weighting was conducted rather than propensity matching. Whites constitute 63% of the youths referred, whereas African Americans comprise 37%. To obtain a similar representation, the weight or factor is 1.3406 for Whites and 0.76206 for African Americans. These factors were based on the total of 2,473 referrals for the period of 2003 through 2004.</p>

<p>The size of a change in odds depends on the sign of the coefficient. Negative effects are constrained to be between 1 and 0, whereas positive effects range between 1 and infinity. Therefore, positive effects may appear to be larger than negative effects. To make the comparisons more comparable, the inverse of the odds ratio was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709345970">Long, 1997</xref>). To examine for the possible existence of statistically significant race interaction effects, the <italic>z</italic> score coefficient comparison test was used (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709345970">Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, &amp; Piquero, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>An initial estimation of regression equations showed that the behavior involving a crime or a technical violation was a statistically significant predictor of postadjudication detention due to a court violation. The variable behavior, however, lacked variation, as all but one person was not detained and was dropped from the analyses.</p>

<p>A hazard rate was initially created and included in equations to correct for the possibility of selection bias, but severe problems with multicollinearity were present, and attempts to correct for it through centering were unsuccessful. The decision was made to keep the independent variables in the models and instead exclude the hazard rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709345970">Bushway, Johnson, &amp; Slocum, 2007</xref>).</p>
