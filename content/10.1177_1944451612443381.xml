<abstract>
<p>Emergency preparedness and management has evolved exponentially from the inception of the Incident Command Structure in the 1970s to the tragic events of September 11, 2001. As a result, emergency management is essential for government agencies to private businesses, including hospitals. The events of 9-11 have drastically changed the way individuals think and operate in our health care environment. This report describes an emergency incident that occurred in the author’s medium-sized urban hospital because of loss of power from the power grid due to theft. The emergency that ensued lasted for more than 24 hours and confronted the hospital with unique challenges. This article describes the basic information about the general structure of hospital emergency preparedness and the specific aspect of preparedness that affect the intensive care unit. During the course of the emergency situation great insight into the function of the emergency preparedness plan was gained. In the end, many valuable lessons were learned that have led to improved function of emergency preparedness response and recovery.</p>

<p><italic>It is 1 o’clock in the afternoon at your hospital and with a flicker and then dimming of the overhead lights you suddenly encounter a power outage. The back-up emergency power immediately kicks in. Because power outages occur sporadically you assume that this will only be a temporary situation. You continue to do due diligence and continue to work with the usual self-assuredness that normal power will soon be restored. Hours pass and the only notification you receive is that normal power will not be restored until the next day. Some initial concerns arise. How long can we go on emergency power? Are there patient safety concerns we should be thinking about? What do we do now?</italic></p>

<sec id="section1-1944451612443381" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This scenario did indeed happen at one of our facilities (100-bed) acute care in San Francisco, California in the late summer of 2010. The power outage was quickly determined within a few hours from our local power and electrical company who revealed to us immediately of a copper wire theft from transformers in an underground vault beneath the street in front of the hospital. Our local power and electrical company indicated that full power would be restored within 24 hours, which would disrupt our daily operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612443381">1</xref></sup> To respond, our Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) was subsequently activated and played an integral part in the operational response to the emergency. Coincidentally, the next morning while the hospital’s primary power was still out, a maintenance truck accidently backed into an electrical pole causing an additional temporary power disruption to surrounding medical practices and outpatient clinics of the hospital. This additional incident added to the unique challenges and obstacles of the current emergency situation.</p>
<p>This is just one example of an emergency incident/event that can occur in any health care environment challenging its staff in responding. No matter what size or age of a hospital, many of the same challenges and principles in responding to an emergency incident/event are the same with a few exceptions dependent on resources as well as the situation and circumstances. This article will describe the basic tenets of emergency preparedness and highlight key points of preparedness that helped us respond in a capable and organized way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1944451612443381">
<title>“Emergency”</title>
<p>The term <italic>emergency</italic> as defined by The Joint Commission, is a natural, unintentional, or intentional incident that significantly disrupts the environment of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612443381">2</xref></sup> The term <italic>emergency</italic> may also be defined as an incident that significantly disrupts care and treatment or that results in sudden, significantly changed, or increased demands for the organization’s service. Many other institutions involved in emergency management, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency have very similar definitions for the term <italic>emergency</italic> but inevitably coalesce with other definitions of emergency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612443381">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to have this definition in mind to avoid assumptions or preconceptions of what is an “emergency.” It is also important to specify and determine the scope of the emergency as small scale, large scale, isolated, or hospital wide. In our power outage incident described earlier, what started out to be a seemingly small-scale incident of short duration ultimately evolved into a large-scale hospital-wide event. Accurately defining the magnitude of the emergency response is vital to determine the level of resources needed to ensure an effective recovery from the emergency incident or event.</p>
<p>Each hospital is unique based on relative resources, situation, and circumstance. Certain disruption of functions at one hospital may not be large scale as compared with a smaller hospital, or vice versa.</p>
<sec id="section3-1944451612443381">
<title>Hospital Incident Command System</title>
<p>An important component of an emergency response is command, control, and coordination which are established under the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) specific to health care facilities. HICS was developed to mirror the Incident Command System (ICS), which was a concept that was initially developed in the 1970s responding to the series of devastating wildfires in California; it continues to be used today by private and government entities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612443381">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) was later developed in the late 1980s using the same components of ICS, however, tailored to the specific needs of hospitals; the name later changed to HICS by removing the word “emergency” according to the California Emergency Medical Services Authority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612443381">5</xref></sup> Essentially, HICS could be used for many different types of events that are not traditionally seen as an “emergency” such as planned or special events that may include political rallies or sporting events but could still be applied to hospitals as if it were an “emergency.” HICS helps coordinate emergency response between hospitals and other responding agencies based on a predictable chain of management, defined responsibilities, prioritized response checklists, clear reporting channels for documentation and accountability and a common nomenclature to facilitate communications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1944451612443381">
<title>Hospital Preparedness Programs</title>
<p>The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) enhances the ability of hospitals and health care systems to prepare for and respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. Current program priority areas include redundant communication systems, bed tracking, personnel management, fatality management planning, and hospital evacuation planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612443381">3</xref></sup> During the past 5 years, HPP funds have also improved bed and personnel surge capacity, decontamination capabilities, isolation capacity, pharmaceutical supplies, training, education, drills, and exercises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1944451612443381">
<title>Initial Response to Emergency</title>
<p>Natural, unintentional, and intentional incident/events occur all the time. All these events are approached the same way as an all-hazards (describing an incident, natural or human-made, that warrants action to protect life, property, environment, and public health or safety, and to minimize disruptions of government, social, or economic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612443381">6</xref></sup>) approach, such as assessing the situation and using systems such as HICS to respond and recover. The response changes as the situation and circumstances changes. It is important to use established emergency plans to develop an incident action plan (An oral or written plan containing general objectives reflecting the overall strategy for managing an incident. It may include the identification of operational resources and assignments. It may also include attachments that provide direction and important information for management of the incident during one or more operational periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612443381">6</xref></sup>) in order to address current variables of an emergency. According to Joint Commission Emergency Management Standards, each hospital should have an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). Each EOP should contain a complete Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA) to identify the primary potential hazards that threaten the institution whether they are natural, accidental or intentional disasters. It is encouraged that ICU leadership should be part of the discussion and planning of these documents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1944451612443381">
<title>Human Factors in Emergency Preparedness</title>
<p>Direct and indirect impact to hospitals can be viewed in a number of ways. Most often hospitals focus on the direct impact as it can be quantified such as financial loss, damages to building and equipment, and casualties to name just a few. It is the indirect costs that are unintentionally overlooked; one, for example, is the human factor.</p>
<p>Besides the need for early assurance of the safety of buildings and equipment, there is also the critical need to return staff back to productivity. The most important factor for any hospital dealing with an emergency is its human resources. The indirect human costs, which may not be as easily seen and may take some time to develop, are the psychological toll taken on the human resources of the institution.</p>
<p>Obviously staff members who may be been injured or died in an emergency event will represent a significant institutional loss, but even if physically uninjured staff may be psychologically traumatized by personal losses such as possible destruction of their homes, concern for people they know, and possible disruption of work environment by the emergency event. There needs to be a system in place to assist all staff such as spiritual care or employee assistance programs within your hospital.</p>
<p>Providing a sense of normalcy and routine is establishing where staff can report to work, have the tools, information, and other resources to do their job.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612443381">7</xref></sup> This will aid staff that the hospital is moving forward and providing the necessary means for staff to do so physically and mentally.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1944451612443381">
<title>Role of the ICU in Emergency Preparedness</title>
<p>The amount of ICU resources needed as part of disaster preparedness will depend on the nature, size, scope, and magnitude of the emergency incident. Events such as hurricanes may give sufficient lead time for preparations such as evacuations and prepositioning of response assets, while disease outbreaks may take weeks to develop. However, earthquakes and terrorist events happen suddenly and can swiftly overcome emergency critical care facilities. Based on previously published data from mass casualty events, approximately 16% of survivors will require critical care services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612443381">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first step in preparing the ICU for an emergency response is to identify the types of events that are most likely to occur within your geographical area. The best source for this information is the HVA that is part of the hospital’s EOP (see above). This information should be used to inform a comprehensive written in an emergency action plan (EAP) that should account for optimizing beds and equipment, determine the amount of staffing needed, providing for redundant communication systems and plan for the evacuation of the ICU if need be.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612443381">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of Emergency Mass Critical Care (EMCC) involves the triage of patients, supplies, and equipment. The aim is to maximize the number of patients who can receive critical care services. However, the assumption of such plans is that hospital infrastructure will remain intact following an event; this may not always be the case. Nevertheless, the essential critical care interventions that need to be available for EMCC include (<italic>a</italic>) mechanical ventilation, (<italic>b</italic>) intravenous fluids, (<italic>c</italic>) vasopressors, (<italic>d</italic>) antibiotics, (<italic>e</italic>) sedation and analgesic medications, and (<italic>f</italic>) other standard critical care therapeutics and interventions (nutrition, renal replacement therapy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612443381">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exercise of patient triage is a difficult area of emergency management; these decisions will fall into the hands of critical care providers during EMCC. The basic principle animating triage decision-making is to save the greatest number of critically ill patients as possible. This goal requires making the choice to withhold care from patients who are least likely to survive and would require a high level of critical care resources. However, there is a risk that triage will be applied unequally, subject as it can be to the underlying biases of practitioners. Recent efforts have tried to use ethical principles to inform triage choices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612443381">11</xref></sup> These ethical principles try to balance 3 goals of saving the most lives, saving the most life-years, and saving those who have lived through the least number of life stages (the youngest). This framework may gain acceptance within the emergency preparedness community to help guide future triage situations.</p>

<title>Lessons Learned From Our Own Emergency</title>
<p>We have developed sharper insight into the state of our own emergency preparedness from the power outage incident at our hospital. Even though our hospital emergency did not involve mass casualties or significantly strain hospital operations, it acted as real life situation in which to test the basics of our preparedness and to identify area of organizational weakness. The following elements have emerged.</p>
<sec id="section9-1944451612443381">
<title>Create an Emergency Action Plan for Each Hospital Unit</title>
<p>Each hospital should have an EOP, but departments and units should have a separate but complementary EAP to address specific needs and resources, including, but not limited to, space, additional staff, and capabilities. Plan templates are available online (i.e., Federal Emergency Management Agency) but need to be tailored to each department’s needs based on relative resources and capabilities. At times, EAPs can be lengthy and full of details; in order to access the most essential information during a response it was valuable to create a “Quick Guide” sheet to supplement the plan, for quick reference. However, an EAP is a living document and may not be able to resolve all issues that arise during an emergency. To quote Henry Kissinger, “In times of crisis we must rely on thinking that has already been done.” A good EAP is based on concepts and systems that have been thought through and vetted beforehand.</p>
<p>Once an EAP is completed, staff needs to be trained on the EAP. A seminar is a great way to cover the entire plan. Will staff need to know and memorize everything in the EAP? No, once they are familiarized with the plan they will know where to look to find out the response procedures when needed while referencing the “Quick Guide.”</p>
<p>One key concept to have within your EAP is identifying a person in charge along with orders of succession in the event that the primary person in charge is out to ensure consistent hierarchy of response within your unit.</p>
<p>Case in point, at the beginning of the response there was some communication breakdown between staff and HICS. As units organized themselves on communicating with HICS with a designated person or the person in charge, messaging became more fluid and consistent.</p>
<p>As a result of our EOP and Facilities EAP we had planned the necessary resources, including fuel to ensure our backup generators could be kept running for more that 96 hours. Safety and security of the hospital and surrounding urban area relied on close cooperation with our local power company.</p>
<p>The lesson learned regarding the role of the ICU was that it was not completely integrated into the established HICS structure for responding to power outages. However, preidentified individuals were able to bring to the incident briefings, which enabled them to be able to ask questions, consider different approaches, suggest improvements, and lessons learned. The incident briefings were able to bring the concerns of the ICU and ensure that any anticipated issues would be addressed appropriately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1944451612443381">
<title>Personal Preparedness</title>
<p>Staff should be prepared within the workplace and at home by creating and maintaining a personal Go-Bag, a collection of items in a sturdy, lightweight, and easily accessible backpack. Staff may be asked to stay at work to respond to an emergency and should be prepared. A Go-Bag that is able to sustain a person for 72 to 96 hours should include, but not be limited to, a small supply of water, comfortable shoes, and personal medications. This preparation will enable your hospital to continue operations during an emergency incident and minimize staff absenteeism. However, we learned in our emergency that some staff who was asked to stay overnight did not have personal Go-Bags at work. The hospital was able to supply some essentials, such as scrubs and toiletries, but we learned the necessity of monitoring for this level of personal preparedness.</p>
<p>Personal preparedness is incorporated into many community organizational training through a number of venues, which include, but are not limited to, City Department of Emergency Management, Community Emergency Response Teams, local Red Cross, and online through Ready.Gov.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1944451612443381">
<title>Relationships</title>
<p>The organizational structure within the HICS details organizational relationships, including decision making and reporting hierarchy. Those who knew their role during the power outage were able to streamline the process of response. Throughout the ongoing emergency response these relationships within the organization were strengthened over time. In general, senior staff best knew their role and responsibilities and their experience was an integral part of the response.</p>
<p>However, we came to realize that the HICS structure in place had not been fully developed and was only minimally understood by general staff. As the situation evolved, the HICS structure did become better known, but we realized that more training and drills were needed to narrow that gap in response.</p>
<p>This only highlighted the fact that further training needed to be initiated beforehand through scheduled drills, trainings, and exercises. Furthermore, these relationships, although strengthened during the response, should and could be established beforehand to ensure a rapid response to the emergency incident/event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1944451612443381">
<title>Exercise for Success</title>
<p>There are a number of approaches to discussion- and operations-based exercises. You will have to determine the frequency, the more the better, as well as time frame of each exercise. It is essential to practice plans and test functions in myriad emergency scenarios. Investment in planning and implementing an emergency exercise takes time. Time, staff, and additional resources need to be allocated to the critical task of providing the opportunity for staff to practice and gain experience in their emergency roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, after each exercise, facilitate a “hot-wash” or debrief to dialogue with staff in order to hear what worked, challenges, and areas of improvements. This forum for discussion will allow the facilitator and experienced staff to be able to address questions and possibly new approaches in handing an emergency in the future. The Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation Program outlines a process of progressive exercising starting with discussion-based leading to operations-based exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612443381">12</xref></sup> More advanced exercises incorporate scenarios of increasing complexity to build up competency in a progressive way.</p>
<p>All levels of staff need to participate in exercises but it should be done in the spirit of improving functional response of the system, not of specific individuals. If an individual is unable to complete a task it should not be taken as a failure of that person per se, but rather an opportunity to identify the need for further overall staff development and reassessment in later drills.</p>
<p>We learned firsthand from our emergency that drills, trainings, and exercises needed to be developed specially for the hospital site on all shifts to empower staff with the knowledge to succeed in responding and recovering from an emergency incident/event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1944451612443381">
<title>All Staff Should Be Considered “Essential”</title>
<p>No staff should be classified as “nonessential” within the hospital EOP because it carries a negative connotation. Staff may be categorized as to proximity to the hospital and planning needs to involve staff to take shifts to not only try to maintain business continuity but also to relieve others who are directly responding to the emergency incident/event.</p>
<p>In the power outage, staff was rotated to ensure that no one was overworked. Shift change debriefings and documentation of incident briefings were clear, concise, consistent, and widely distributed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1944451612443381" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Emergency preparedness has evolved greatly from each emergency incident/event. Emergency management is now a concern of everyday businesses, including hospitals and has changed the way individuals think and operate in our hospital culture. Encouraging staff to participate in drills, training, and exercises in the community, and even more important, at your hospital, will build a climate of preparedness. Hospitals must invest in preparing. The cost effectiveness and reputation of every hospital relies on its ability to respond capably in a disaster. Hospital leaders must factor in the time it takes for staff to grasp and understand the tools of emergency preparedness to reduce the fear in responding to an actual emergency with trust, teamwork, and cooperation.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for most hospitals is to remain vigilant about emergency preparedness. News reports of natural disasters usually focus on the police and fire response; the medical or hospital responses to the emergency receive only marginal attention. It is important that your hospital ensure redundant communication with other emergency response agencies within your city. However when emergency situations occur, hospitals must be certain that their emergency infrastructures and systems are current and properly maintained. This level of preparation can be achieved primarily through scheduled emergency drills, trainings, and exercises. Drills, trainings, and exercises improve staff confidence with the knowledge that they know what to do in an emergency. These exercises expose staff to scenarios that may occur and provides an opportunity for staff to problem-solve in order to respond effectively during an actual emergency incident/event. Regular exercises also creates an environment to ask questions and offer suggestions and thus reduce the general fear of the unknown of an emergency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612443381">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a recent study of survivors of the September 11 World Trade Center disaster, an analysis of factors affecting the length of time of evacuation concluded that emergency preparedness and training was essential for efficient responses. The study concluded that</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>worksite readiness is essential, not only in reducing morbidity and mortality related to emergency events, but also for creating a culture and climate of emergency preparedness. . . . This type of culture can support worker resiliency and help reduce long-term mental health consequences of disaster survivorship. Furthermore, a culture and climate of preparedness may empower employees to take responsibility for their own actions. By understanding their role in supporting the safety of the entire population of occupants, employees may be more likely to ensure that they are personally as well prepared as feasibly possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612443381">14</xref></sup></p>
