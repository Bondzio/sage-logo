<abstract>
<p>Structural health monitoring systems integrate novel experimental technologies, analytical methods, and information technologies for a number of objectives such as detecting structural changes and damage as well as assessing the condition, safety, and serviceability of the monitored structure. The objective of this article is to present a correlation-based methodology as an effective nonparametric data analysis approach for detecting and localizing structural changes using strain data under operational loading conditions. While several methods have been explored in the literature, the focus of this article is to explore a practical and cost-effective (in terms of sensor, data acquisition, and analysis) methodology to identify structural problems. The methodology presented here is based on tracking correlation coefficients between strain time histories at different locations. After discussing the background, the effectiveness of the methodology is first demonstrated on a laboratory test structure. A unique contribution of this study is the validation of the methodology on a real-life bridge, which was monitored before damage was induced, during the bridge was damaged, and after damage was repaired. It is shown that structural changes can be detected and located for both the laboratory test structure and the real-life bridge using the variations in the correlation matrices. Since the real-life bridge was monitored under different conditions, the effectiveness of the bridge repair is also presented in comparative fashion with respect to before damage conditions. Some of the critical issues such as signal processing, data length, and level of data separation for change detection are also discussed. The correlation-based data analysis methodology is computationally efficient and easy to use, especially for handling large amounts of monitoring data. The results show that this methodology has the potential to be easily applied by engineers to different kinds of civil infrastructure for condition monitoring and maintenance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the need for better assessing the condition of existing structures is increasing, researchers and practitioners are investigating effective implementations of structural health monitoring (SHM), which is becoming more feasible with the advances in sensing, computational, and information technologies. These needs and advances in SHM concepts have been reviewed by several researchers during the last decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921712451955">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921712451955"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921712451955">4</xref></sup> Application of SHM to civil infrastructure systems such as buildings, roads, dams, and bridges is relatively recent compared to applications to aerospace and automotive structures. For civil infrastructures, main focus has been on monitoring bridges for identifying damage existence as well as assessing the condition, safety, and serviceability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475921712451955">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921712451955"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921712451955">8</xref></sup> The main reasons for bridge health monitoring are that bridges are critical components of the transportation network, and that there is a need for better means of inspecting the aging and deteriorating structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475921712451955">9</xref></sup> As a result, many researchers have been investigating new technologies and methodologies to evaluate the condition of bridges by means of SHM for decision making such as as-is use, repair, or strengthening of damaged and deteriorated structures. Therefore, an expected outcome of monitoring is to detect changes related to damage for taking preventive actions and understanding the root causes of the problems.</p>
<p>Sensing and data acquisition can be considered as important components of an SHM system, where the type, spatial and temporal conditions for the sensors, and data acquisition systems are generally application specific based on the need and objectives. A structure can be monitored to obtain its global (such as vibration) and/or local (such as strain) responses. For global condition monitoring, a variety of studies utilizing vibration data can be found in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921712451955">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921712451955"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921712451955"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475921712451955">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, local condition assessment such as monitoring using strain measurements has also been explored by many researchers such as Bakhtiari-Nejad et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475921712451955">17</xref></sup> Omenzetter and Brownjohn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475921712451955">18</xref></sup> Catbas et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475921712451955">19</xref></sup> Philips Adewuyi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475921712451955">20</xref></sup> Li et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475921712451955">21</xref></sup> and Catbas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921712451955">22</xref></sup> In summary, the objective of local and/or global monitoring is to extract useful information for tracking the responses, identifying the deviations from the “normal” operational conditions, and/or detecting damage. The monitoring data can be analyzed for decision making in four levels that can be outlined as detection, localization, assessment, and prediction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475921712451955">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>To obtain useful information about the structure and its performance, SHM data analysis approaches can be categorized as parametric and nonparametric methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475921712451955">24</xref></sup> In an attempt to mitigate confusion about different nomenclatures, one should be aware that parametric methods are also given as model-based or physics-based methods. Nonparametric methods as, on the other hand, may be referred as model-free, data-driven methods, novelty detection, or anomaly detection methods in the SHM literature. While parametric methods can be useful for better physical conceptualization and also for predicting future behavior, the level of expertise and time to develop such models sometimes make this approach impractical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475921712451955">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475921712451955">26</xref></sup> Fortunately, nonparametric methods, which are alternative to parametric methods, can be very efficient when utilized only for diagnostics (i.e. detection and localization). The idea behind such methods is that only training data from the normal operating condition of the structure or system are used to establish the diagnostics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475921712451955">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, nonparametric methods may not provide a physical understanding or predictive analysis; however, they are shown to be very practical to use, computationally efficient in handling large amounts of data, and efficient in detecting changes in structures in a timely manner. Among several data-driven applications, some of the studies that are closely related to the contents of this article can be given as follows: Other methods such as moving principal component analysis, moving correlation analysis, and regression analysis were demonstrated on a numerical study to be useful for damage detection during continuous static monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475921712451955">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475921712451955">29</xref></sup> An overview of such methods was recently presented by Smith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475921712451955">30</xref></sup> in a comparative fashion. The applicability of any parametric or nonparametric method needs to be shown first with laboratory demonstrations and then, if possible, on real-life structures with damage scenarios to test the approaches and methodologies more reliably.</p>
<sec id="section2-1475921712451955">
<title>Objective and scope</title>
<p>The objective of this article is to employ cross-correlation/moving correlation analysis method for detecting and localizing the changes in the structure due to damage and/or change in intrinsic stress distribution using strain monitoring data under unknown loading conditions. This approach can be applicable to any type of structures, such as bridges, buildings, and wind turbine blades, where the structure is monitored over a period of time. For example, structural strain response at critical locations due to operating traffic on a bridge or response of a building structure due to ground excitation or wind-induced loading can be employed for detecting structural changes. It should also be mentioned that strain monitoring is the least expensive and the most commonly utilized measurement on bridges as well as other structures. While strain measurements can provide data that can be used in a number of ways (e.g. in relation to the yield strain levels), tracking the strain response for change/damage detection makes it essential that the loading creating that particular strain is known. A novelty of the approach in this article is in employing the strain responses to detect and localize the changes and damage without the need for the input information, as this would be required for most cases with strain data.</p>
<p>Detection and localization are achieved by applying the proposed approach to track the cross-correlation matrices between the strain measurements that are spatially distributed on the critical elements of the structure. The change in the correlation coefficient between two measurement channels is related to the change in the structural behavior. For localization, the correlation matrix for the measurements from all channels is employed. Previously, cross-correlation or moving cross-correlation has mainly been evaluated with numerical models and simple test structures. In this study, a phenomenological laboratory structure is employed for the analysis of different damage conditions that are induced to the structure first separately and then simultaneously. A critical contribution of the study is that the method is then demonstrated on a real-life bridge in a similar fashion to the laboratory tests, that is, damage conditions are induced first separately and then simultaneously. As being an operating structure, the bridge is also repaired shortly after damage, which allows the researchers to monitor and assess the response of the bridge after repair as well.</p>

<title>Theory and methodology</title>
<p>For long-term SHM applications, extracting useful information from large amounts of data is a critical task for engineers and researchers. The data can be analyzed using a number of ways to obtain different features, including the most common statistical properties of the data, such as maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, and correlation. The statistical analyses help the engineer/researcher interpret the data and understand the structural behavior.</p>
<p>In this study, correlation of the strain measurements is employed for damage identification and localization. In theory, correlation coefficient is a measure of similarity of two data sets and may take a value between +1 and −1. Having similar behavior in data sets gives high magnitude correlation (values close to +1 and −1) while low magnitude correlation (values close to 0) indicates either low or no correlated response. For continuous monitoring, the new data are appended to the raw data set, and a moving window is used to obtain the correlation coefficients between sensors for each window with the following formulation</p>

<p>where ρ<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) is the correlation between the sensors <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> at the time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, only for the last <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> measurements from the identified window size; <italic>n</italic> is the total number of time observations during the monitoring duration; <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) are the values of the sensors <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, respectively, at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>; and µ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and µ<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> are the mean values of data from the sensors <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, respectively. The moving data can be employed in such a way that there can be an overlap in the data windows selected, or the moving windows can be consecutive with zero overlap with a similar analogy that is employed in digital signal processing (e.g. averaging of ambient vibration data using the Hanning windows). The window overlap can be determined based on the initial inspection of the data characteristics, monitoring duration, sampling rate, and data availability.</p>
<p>For illustration purposes, some scatter plots of the different strain channels from a real-life application, which will be explained in the following sections, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712451955">Figure 1</xref>. Different correlation levels between sensors are illustrated with low-to-high correlation coefficients between them when compared as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712451955">Figure 1</xref>. The correlation between the first and second strain gages (SGs) is very low, or in other words, there is almost no dependence between these two data sets. On the other hand, the correlation is higher between the first and third SGs, and the highest correlation is seen between the first and fourth SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712451955">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The methodology is based on the premise that the correlations ρ<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) between two sensor signals ideally should be “constant” or “stationary” until a change or damage occurs in the structural configuration. The schematic representation of the methodology is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712451955">Figure 2</xref>. As shown in this figure, continuous monitoring data are collected from the structure. At one point, damage occurs while the monitoring data are still being collected. First, dynamic components of the strain data set for each channel are filtered out for the correlation analysis. A sufficiently long window size is selected for the length of signals (data sets). Afterward, the correlation coefficient of each channel is calculated against all the channels to form the correlation matrix for each data set.</p>

</fig>
<p>The same procedure is repeated to obtain the correlation matrices throughout the monitoring of the structure. During undamaged and damaged periods, several sets of experimental data are collected to create a population of matrices from each data set. Finally, set of matrices are averaged for undamaged and damaged cases, and the difference matrix is obtained by subtracting mean matrices obtained from two cases. This difference matrix will show whether there is a change in the correlation coefficients in each cell. After observing the changes in the cells, the whole matrix is used to detect the damage location easily by identifying sensors that have the significant changes.</p>

<p>For this study, a two-axle radio-controlled vehicle, which has 68.7 N and 78.5 N axle loads with a spacing of 45 cm, is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712451955">Figure 5(a)</xref>).

<p>Before starting the correlation analysis, another important step of the study is to create a filter to eliminate the dynamic effects of the traffic since this is observed to adversely affect the correlations. This may be mainly due to the dynamic strain effects being local responses as observed in strain signals and the fact that noise is also mostly observed in the higher frequency bands. After investigating different filter options, we decided to use a low-pass filter with the third-order fit, which decreases the computational time without any loss of accuracy required from the data. In addition, the cutoff frequency of the filter is decided based on the frequency of the first vertical mode of the structure. This way, the dynamic effects are eliminated, and the data are reduced to include only the static response. Moreover, zero phasing and peak matching are also very important to catch the peak locations and amplitudes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712451955">Figure 5(b)</xref>, typical raw strain data collected at 250 Hz and filtered strain data from the four-span bridge are presented. As observed from the figure, each test run took around 50 s. The average vehicle speed was approximately 0.2 m/s during the tests. It should be noted that the duration of the signals used for correlation is many multiples of the highest period of the bridge. Although there is a decrease in the peak values of the filtered data, it is seen that the peak locations before and after filtering are matching while the dynamic effects and noise in the strain data are eliminated.</p>

<title>Damage simulations and results</title>
<p>The damage scenarios on the four-span bridge model are determined based on the feedback from Department of Transportation (DOT) bridge engineers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475921712451955">31</xref></sup> These damage cases involve changes in boundary conditions corresponding to a case usually found when rollers or pinned supports of a bridge become corroded or blocked, and the structural configuration of the bridge changes. These changes may cause stress redistribution, and consequently, the structural members will be subjected to unexpected additional forces caused by this redistribution. This kind of problem is simulated on the four-span bridge model by fixing the supports as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921712451955">Figure 3</xref>. Baseline (Case 0) and three different damage cases (Cases 1–3) for the laboratory structure can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712451955">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Data collection for baseline and damage cases, which yields to a total of 60 tests with 15 tests per case, is followed by the data analysis for applying the proposed methodology. First, the designed low-pass filter described earlier is applied to all the data sets to eliminate the dynamic effects on the strain channels. The cutoff frequency is chosen to be less than the first vertical mode of the four-span bridge that is around 4.9 Hz to observe the static behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475921712451955">32</xref></sup> Next, the correlation matrices are generated for each test. For the laboratory demonstration of the methodology, a 19 × 19 correlation matrix is obtained using the 19 SGs attached on the structure (SG20 malfunctioned during the experiments). First row of this matrix consists of the correlation coefficients between the SG1 and the rest of the SGs. The other rows are calculated in the same manner. The correlation matrix is symmetric, and the diagonal terms should be unity because the correlation of each channel with itself is one. Fifteen matrices are generated from the 15 test runs to create a population of correlation matrices for the baseline case monitoring. The mean correlation matrix is obtained using these 15 matrices. In the same manner, the mean matrices are also obtained for the three damage cases. Consequently, these four matrices are employed to determine changes and change locations in a comparative fashion. Finally, the difference matrices are investigated to better understand and interpret the changes in these matrices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712451955">Figure 7(a)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712451955">(c)</xref> illustrates the damage locations for Case 1; difference matrix between Cases 0 and 1 in an <italic>n</italic>×<italic>n</italic> matrix form, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of sensors, that is, 19; and sample from the correlation data used for the cell for correlation difference between SG1 and SG7, as well as for SG11 and SG6, respectively. The correlation data clearly indicate a change/damage, and the location of the change can be identified easily as the darker areas show the maximum change in the correlation coefficients for the SG1 and SG11. The change can be observed more clearly in SG1, since the vehicle is moving on Girder 1. In addition, the damage was induced by tightening the bolts at the supports manually. The final effect of this damage cannot be expected to be identical at both supports. As a result, the change at two different supports is observed at different levels. In fact, similar results are also reported by Zaurin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475921712451955">33</xref></sup> using completely different data analysis methods using the same data. To better represent the changes in the correlation coefficients, some of the elements in the difference matrix are closely investigated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712451955">Figure 7(c)</xref>. For instance, the correlation coefficient between the SG1 and SG7 was around −0.25 for the baseline tests, but it became 0.65 for Case 1 tests. The changes in correlation coefficients are also illustrated between SG11 and SG6. The change in the correlation coefficients between different sets of data is an indication of structural change (in this case due to simulated damage) since the correlation coefficients are assumed to be “constant” or “stationary” under normal conditions. It is seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712451955">Figure 7(c)</xref> that the difference between the mean values of the correlation coefficients is several times the standard deviation of the data, giving a confidence in change detection. This approach is demonstrated with 15 sets of data before damage and 15 sets of data after damage for the illustration of the efficacy of the method. A moving window of strain time histories can be employed to obtain the correlation coefficients for the identification and location of damage as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712451955">Figure 7(b)</xref>.</p>

<p>The other damage cases are also clearly identified and located for Case 2 (bolts over middle support tightened) and Case 3 (combination of Cases 1 and 2), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712451955">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712451955">9</xref>, respectively. In Case 2, the middle supports are fixed; therefore, the changes in the difference matrix are observed for SG5, SG6, SG15, and SG16, which are near the middle supports. When compared to Case 1, Case 2 did not introduce significant changes in the structure because the difference matrix is showing relatively lower changes for Case 2. These changes can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712451955">Figure 8(c)</xref>. Furthermore, the new methodology can identify and localize the damage for Case 3, which is a combination of Cases 1 and 2.

<p>For the validation of the methodology on a real-life structure, Sunrise Boulevard bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712451955">Figure 10</xref>) is employed, and the data with and without structural changes are presented. The selected movable span of the bridge is the westbound span of two parallel spans on SR-838, crossing a canal in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. This span was constructed in 1989. It has double bascule leaves, with a total length of 35.7 m and a width of 16.3 m, carrying three traffic lanes.</p>

<p>For this bridge, an instrumentation plan is designed by the authors to monitor the most critical electrical, mechanical, and structural components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475921712451955">34</xref></sup> The current installation consists of an array of 160 sensors, which add up to 200+ channels. The monitored structural components include main girders, floor beams, stringers, live load shoes (LLSs), and span locks (SLs). For this study, data from the dynamic SGs (Hitec weldable) at the bottom flanges of the main girders (a total of 12 sensors) are used. The data collection rate is 250 Hz. The locations for the SGs and corresponding nomenclatures are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712451955">Figure 11</xref>. For example, WN refers to West North and ES refers to East South. In a 24-h period, three prescheduled time slots (morning and early and late afternoons), corresponding to peak hours of operation, are selected for data collection. Each data set is collected for 5 min continuously for each data set.</p>

<title>Structural changes on Sunrise Boulevard bridge and analysis results</title>
<p>In this section, methodology is demonstrated on the movable bridge. As discussed previously, long-term monitoring of bridges also provides an excellent opportunity to mitigate problems and issues related to maintenance and operation. Critical issues that create maintenance problems on the bridge are discussed and simulated on the Sunrise Boulevard bridge based on the detailed investigation of the bridge inspection reports and interviews with the bridge engineers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475921712451955">34</xref></sup> Some of the most common structural maintenance problems are identified as LLS shim removal and SL shim removal, and these problems are subsequently implemented on the movable bridge. Moreover, a combined damage scenario is also applied to the structure where both LLS and SL shims are removed. First, the West South LLS (WS3) shims are removed (Case 1), then the West South SL (WS1) shims are removed (Case 2), and finally, shims from LLS and SL of West South side are removed for the combined damage scenario (Case 3).</p>
<p>LLSs, which are the support locations of the main girders in closed position, are one of the critical structural components of the movable bridges. Main operational concern of LLS is the loss of contact that makes the shims crucial at these locations. Small gaps due to deterioration of the shims lead the girders to pound on the LLSs, which results in further misalignment, additional stresses, stress redistributions, fatigue damage, and excessive wear. LLS and shim removal operation can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712451955">Figure 12</xref>. Case 1 is the creation of a gap (around 0.3 cm up to 0.5 cm) between the WS3 and resting support pads, which corresponds to nonfully-seated LLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712451955">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>SLs, which are one of the members that fail the most due to deterioration or incorrect operation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475921712451955">35</xref></sup> are used to connect the tip ends of the two cantilever bascule leaves in double-leaf bascule bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921712451955">Figure 13</xref>). Consequently, both leaves are forced to deflect equally preventing a discontinuity in the deck during operational traffic. Two main components of the SL are the receiver and the lock bar. These elements are located in different leaves. During operation, the lock bar slides with a hydraulic system across the bronze shoes, mounted in the rectangular guide and receiver housings. The main concern for the SL is that the coupling has to be loose enough to allow a proper opening operation, but at the same time, the gap between the bar and the receiver has to be small enough to ensure the adequate connection with minimal bouncing while vehicles cross from one leaf to the other. This is achieved by placing metallic sheets (or shims) to adjust the spacing. Case 2 is the creation of a gap (around 0.3 cm up to 0.5 cm) on the WS1. The last structural alteration on the Sunrise Boulevard bridge is Case 3, which is the combination of Cases 1 and 2.</p>

</fig>
<p>The concept given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712451955">Figure 2</xref> is also applied to these data sets in terms of filtering signals, obtaining mean correlation matrices for five conditions; before damage was applied, when three damage cases were induced (Cases 1–3) and after damage was repaired. Then, the difference matrices are obtained for each case. These results will be discussed in the later paragraphs of this section. For the validation of the methodology, 10 different data sets were collected through October 11-October 20 for the baseline case (or the before damage case) with the data collection scheme presented in the previous sections. Then, the structural changes were implemented on the structure on October 21. On this day, five data sets were collected for each damage case (Cases 1–3). Afterward, the shims were replaced on the structure, and again 10 data sets were collected between the periods of October 22 and October 31 for the after damage case to see whether the correlation coefficients are restoring to the same level when compared to the before damage data sets. It should also be emphasized that the data collected from the monitoring system are based on operating traffic, and no special trucks or lane closures are required. From an operational point of view, this input-independent analysis is also desirable for real-life applications since it reduces the cost of load test, minimizes extra manpower, and also eliminates traffic interruptions.</p>
<p>Representative 5-min WS3 strain time histories before, during, and after damage are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1475921712451955">Figure 14</xref>. This figure illustrates that it is quite difficult to identify and locate damage from the strain measurements as raw strain data are highly dependent on the loading. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1475921712451955">Figure 14</xref> shows that the strain levels under the same fire truck for damaged and undamaged conditions are very close, and the raw time histories do not indicate any obvious damage. It is obvious that under random operational traffic, identification of damage from raw time histories become very difficult by just inspection, if not impossible.</p>

<p>Additionally, damage is also identified and localized for SL shims removal (Case 2) and shims removal at LLS and SL simultaneously (Case 3), which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712451955">Figures 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712451955">17</xref>, respectively. Correlation coefficient change for Case 2 is illustrated for WS1 and WN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712451955">Figure 16(c)</xref>), and the change for Case 3 is illustrated for WS3 and ES2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712451955">Figure 17(c)</xref>). It is observed that the variation of the correlation coefficient for Case 2 is not as low as seen in Cases 1 and 3. Since the tip locations are exposed to lower strain levels due to a cantilever type behavior, the variation in the correlation coefficients for this location is a little bit higher. Nonetheless, the darkest colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712451955">Figure 16(b)</xref> indicates the maximum change is at WS1 where the SL shims were removed. When both LLS and SL shims are removed, it is seen that two rows and columns corresponding to WS1 and WS3 simultaneously indicate the maximum change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712451955">Figure 17(b)</xref>). In a real-life case, this is clear evidence that these locations need attention by engineers for further action.</p>

<p>One of the important issues to be discussed is the separation of the mean difference levels for a substantial change that can confidently be attributed to a structural change. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921712451955">Table 1</xref> shows representative cases from the three different damage cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712451955">Figures 15(c)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712451955">16(c)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712451955">17(c)</xref>. It is seen that in most of the cases, the separation is very high (as high as Δµ = ~;11σ), indicating there is virtually zero overlap between the correlation coefficients between different cases. This separation can be confidently attributed to a change between the observed conditions. The lowest separation observed is ~2.5σ, which also indicates that almost 99% of the data points are separated. This can be considered to be a sufficient separation to consider a structural change.</p>

<p>In real-life cases, the temperature-induced effects can also be considerable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921712451955">11</xref></sup> In the data sets presented in this article, the monitoring system was operated over long term intermittently under operating traffic using high-speed, dynamic strain sensors. As a result, the effects of temperature are only for the approximately 21-day monitoring duration. However, if continuous monitoring data are acquired with vibrating wire type sensors as discussed in Ref. 11, it is anticipated that strain-related temperature-induced stresses will be captured. This would also provide valuable information as to how temperature-induced effects create structural changes at different times and seasons. Another interesting observation from this study is that the maintenance effectiveness can also be tracked from the results. When the LLS and SL are fixed, it is seen that the correlation levels are restored back to the previously observed levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712451955">Figure 17(c)</xref>. All in all, the new methodology based on strain correlations can identify and localize the damage not only for the laboratory structure but also for the real-life application.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, the authors present an effective nonparametric data analysis methodology, which is based on the correlation of the strain time histories from different sensor locations for detecting structural change/damage. The proposed methodology is first demonstrated on a laboratory test structure, which is monitored under normal and damaged conditions. A main contribution of the study is the validation of the methodology on a real-life bridge, which has unique characteristics due to its movable components. First, the bridge was monitored for 10 days under normal traffic conditions. Then, some of the bridge components were damaged, and the damaged bridge was monitored under operating traffic. Finally, the bridge was again monitored for 10 more days after it was repaired. The research presented in this article leads to the following conclusions:</p>
<list id="list1-1475921712451955" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cross-correlations of the strain measurements indicate a level of correlation among different sensor pairs, and the correlation coefficients are tracked for extracting the information about structural change. It is shown that structural change can be detected and located using this approach for the laboratory bridge model and the real-life bridge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Correlation analysis considerably reduces the data size to provide useful information from large amounts of strain data, thus offering an efficient data handling capability. In addition, it is easy to implement into monitoring systems, and these indices can be tracked over time during long-term SHM applications for structural changes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presented approach eliminates the need for loading information (magnitude and placement) for strain monitoring applications. Strain time histories used for the data analysis are obtained from arbitrary operating traffic conditions. If the correlation analysis is not employed, raw strain data may lead to false negatives and/or false positives since the levels will depend on the operating traffic. For example, the strain levels in a damaged bridge may not be very high depending on the operating traffic. At the same time, an intact bridge may produce high strain measurements under heavy traffic, which are not necessarily indicator of damage. As a result, the structure can be monitored over a long period of time without any special loading considerations, and this is one of the strengths of the method that any loading can be used to detect damage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the real-life bridge case, it is also shown that the method can be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance (including repair) by checking the variations of the correlation coefficients before and after the maintenance application. Consequently, this methodology has the potential to be easily applied by engineers to different kinds of civil infrastructure for condition monitoring and maintenance.</p></list-item>
