<abstract>
<p>A rational-theoretical approach to scale development was employed to develop and evaluate a scale to measure submissive communication in personal relationships. A <italic>convergence communication</italic> pattern compels submissive relational partners to interpret the world around them in ways consistent with dominant partners. This study was guided by two aims: (1) to develop a valid and reliable measure of convergence communication – the Convergence Communication Scale – and (2) to conduct a preliminary examination of the effects of convergence communication on submissive partners’ mental health. A measurement instrument was developed (α = .95) and tested in two separate administrations (<italic>N</italic> = 379; <italic>N</italic> = 373), revealing associations between convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness for both males and females, predicting depression specifically for females.  </p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512443617">Rand (1943</xref>),“second-handers” are people who do not judge for themselves, who just repeat what others close to them say, embrace it, and make it their own. This submission to others’ realities may seem odd to those who value independent and critical thought, but is routine for those who struggle to manage cognitive interdependence with dominant relational partners. When there are relational consequences for resisting a relational partner’s dominance, one quickly learns to submit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>Dominance and submission are fundamental dimensions of personal relationships and define the very nature of these relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512443617">Burgoon &amp; Hale, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512443617">Rogers &amp; Farace, 1975</xref> ). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512443617">Dillard, Solomon, and Samp (1996</xref>) pointed out, dominance is central to understanding human behavior; consequently, relationship researchers from a variety of fields have sought to understand the implications of enactments of dominance and submission in close personal relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512443617">Berger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512443617">Burgoon &amp; Dillman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512443617">Burgoon &amp; Dunbar, 2000</xref>). Dominance is a dyadic variable in which control attempts by one individual are accepted by the interactional partner. According to the interpersonal principle of complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512443617">Leary, 1957</xref>), dominance invites submission and submission invites dominance, and complementary relational communication patterns combine to exert control in a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407512443617">Courtright, Millar, &amp; Rogers-Millar, 1979</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512443617">Millar &amp; Rogers, 1976</xref>). In keeping with this approach, much of the scholarly research on interpersonal dominance has conceptualized dominance as relational, as an interactional state that reflects control of one person over another (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512443617">Dillard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512443617">Dunbar &amp; Burgoon, 2005b</xref>). Interpersonal submission might also logically be conceptualized as relational and as an interactional state that reflects deference to a more dominant other via communicative actions; however, very little research has examined the communication actions that occur during interpersonal submission. A few notable exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512443617">Dunbar and Burgoon’s (2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512443617">2005b</xref>) studies, which examined verbal and non-verbal control attempts used by dominant relational partners and Miller-Day’s (2004) theory of necessary convergence, which focused on how social cognitions might be affected in interpersonal submission.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512443617">Dunbar and Burgoon’s (2005b)</xref> work focused almost exclusively on enactments of dominance in control attempts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2004</xref>) addressed how submissive interaction patterns in close personal relationships influence cognitions. Miller-Day’s necessary convergence communication (NCC) theory offered an explanation for how “meanings can be hijacked” in interpersonal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>, p. 210) and how chronic submission to others’ construction of meaning in interactions, at the expense of one’s own, may lead to depression and learned helplessness.</p>
<p>NCC is a grounded theory that emerged from research on close personal relationships. Central to this theory is the construct of c<italic>onvergence communication</italic>. Convergence communication was defined as a communication pattern where submissive partners are compelled to interpret the world around them in ways consistent with dominant partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>). This <italic>communication</italic> pattern reflects an uncritical acceptance of or conformity to a dominant partner’s point of view, with the submissive partner appropriating the social meanings of the dominant partner for relational maintenance purposes.</p>
<p>The theory itself argues that chronic convergence communication over time may place submissive partners at risk for a variety of internalizing disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512443617">Miller-Day &amp; Fisher, 2008</xref>) and Miller-Day invited researchers to test the propositions of NCC theory and challenged researchers to “develop an instrument to measure convergence communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>, p. 225). To our knowledge, no measure of convergence communication has been developed. This prevents the possibility of testing NCC theory and limits scholarly understanding of interpersonal submission. We believe that NCC theory has the potential to explain a great deal about how communication routines shape interpersonal judgments in close personal relationships. </p>
<p>NCC theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>) and communication accommodation theory (CAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512443617">Giles, Taylor, &amp; Bouris, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512443617">McCann, Ota, Giles, &amp; Caraker, 2003</xref>) both address issues of convergence in interpersonal interactions; however, CAT, to date, has not accounted for the phenomenon of submissive partners’ sacrificing their own interpretations of the world in order to privilege a dominant partners’ interpretations. The emphasis in NCC theory is less on behavioral convergence that might occur in an interaction (e.g., adapting non-verbal cues) and more on cognitive convergence (convergence of meanings). In this sense, NCC theory could be conceptualized as extending both CAT and social constructionism to explain how chronic submission to a dominant partner’s construction of meaning might place submissive partners at psychological risk. </p>
<p>Recent reviews of interpersonal theory and research emphasize the need for communication scholars to provide theories that address the negotiation of social knowledge in the context of relationships, as well as the relational outcomes of those constructions (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512443617">Berger, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512443617">Wood (2001</xref>) discovered that submissive partners in emotionally abusive relationships often sacrificed their own interpretation of events and deferred to their partners interpretations so as not to lose the affection of the partner. Clearly, knowledge is a social product with meanings and understandings emanating from communication with other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512443617">Leeds-Hurwitz, 2006</xref>), yet scholars know little about how social knowledge is manipulated in close relationships. Understanding more about convergence communication may allow researchers to examine the processes and outcomes of this manipulation. </p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a measurement instrument that will validly and reliably assess convergence communication. Toward that end, we assume a rational-theoretical approach to scale development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512443617">Lanyon &amp; Goodstein, 1971</xref>). A rational-theoretical approach begins with previously developed theory and the primary goal of this approach is to develop an instrument that measures the constructs of a particular theory. In addition to establishing reliability, validity, and utility of the measure, evaluation is based on the degree to which the instrument accurately assesses the theoretical constructs. The specific aims of this study are to (1) develop a measure of convergence communication as conceptually defined in NCC theory and (2) conduct preliminary psychometric testing of the convergence communication measure (the Convergence Communication Scale [CCS]).</p>
<sec id="section1-0265407512443617">
<title>Conceptual definition of convergence communication</title>
<p>To develop an instrument that accurately measures convergence communication, it was first necessary to review the conceptual definition of convergence communication presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512443617">Miller-Day and Kam (2009</xref>). Convergence communication was conceptualized as a construct including three dimensions: disequilibrium, interpersonal deference, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265407512443617">1</xref>
</sup> Disequilibrium refers to the inequality of an individual’s participation in and contribution to meaning in the interaction. NCC theory argues that when convergence communication occurs, one person in the dyadic interaction is afforded more power to determine social meanings; that is, the construction of meaning in the interaction is dominated by one person, while the other person submits to that construction. Convergence communication requires disequilibrium rather than equilibrium in interactions, with the dominant partner exerting more control over conversational interactions than the submissive partner. Interpersonal deference occurs when a submissive partner defers to a dominant partner, uncritically accepting or conforming to the dominant partner’s point of view. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2005</xref>) argued that this dimension of convergence refers to when people do not judge for themselves, but they merely repeat what the dominant partner says, embrace it, and make it their own. The last dimension is motivation. The theory suggests that convergence communication requires the submissive partner to perceive a relational motivation for interpersonal deference. When a submissive partner perceives that the dominant partner has the power to manipulate emotional resources within the relationship (e.g., affection, approval, support), then the promise of reward and the threat of loss will provide motivation for the submissive partner to defer. </p>
<p>In the general population, family hierarchy may dictate a certain level of deference and submission to mothers, fathers, and grandparents. In fact, formative testing of the theory was based on mother–daughter relationships. NCC theory, however, specifically predicts that a high degree of convergence in adult relationships, whether those relationships are hierarchical or non-hierarchical, would predict negative psychological outcomes. That is, according to NCC theory, a high degree of convergence communication over time (chronicity) may increase the risk for submissive partners to develop internalizing disorders regardless of the social hierarchy of the relationship. So, in this current study we were interested in the type of relationship partner participants would identify as being dominant, requiring their submission. Hence we posed the following research question, “What personal relationships are identified as dominant–submissive?” </p>

<title>Item development</title>
<p>In addition to an extensive review of relevant literature and Miller-Day’s (2004) original research, content analysis procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512443617">Krippendorf, 2004</xref>) were used to evaluate observational and interview data from an earlier study of dominant–submissive relationships conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407512443617">2012</xref>). The primary analysis documents included individual interview transcripts, joint interview transcripts, and detailed field notes, including researcher notes and the direct transcription of dialogue between relational partners that had been captured during in-situ conversations. Analyses of the documents were conducted to identify comments, dialogue, examples or illustrations of interpersonal deference, motivation, or disequilibrium. The following questions were used to guide the analysis procedure. </p>

</list>
<p>After completing the analyses, the authors generated scale items using the study participants’ own words whenever possible to enhance item validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512443617">DeVellis, 2003</xref>). Audiotapes of interviews were used to verify specific quotes, which were translated into scale items. Thirty-two items were originally developed for inclusion in the initial development of the CCS. On the basis of independent reviews by two experts pertaining to face validity, 28 items were selected for inclusion in the scale; two items were omitted based on perceived lack of relevance and two due to lack of clarity. Each of the 28 items was evaluated for readability, using the Flesch–Kincaid reading level, which is reliable even with the entry of few words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512443617">Graesser, McNamara, Louwerse, &amp; Cai, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0265407512443617">
<title>Instrument evaluation</title>
<p>In this study, a web-based questionnaire consisting of two sections was administered to 379 students at an Eastern university: male (48.5%), female (51.5%). The modal age was 20–23 years old (60.8%), with 16.3% aged 17–19 and 22.1% aged 24–25, with .8% not reporting. The sample was 84.1% White, 7% Asian, 3.3% Black, and 3.1% Latino.  </p>
<p>The questionnaire was web-based using a secured network. The first section of the questionnaire included items on demographic information, including gender, age, and ethnicity, and the second section included the 28 items assessing convergence communication and 5 items assessing relational quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265407512443617">
<title>Convergence Communication Scale</title>
<p>The 28 scale items were preceded by an introduction and respondents were asked to identify one of the following individuals with whom they are interpersonally submissive, and indicate their relationship to that person: mother, father, grandparent, sibling, friend, opposite-sex friend, same-sex friend, romantic partner, or other (see the Appendix for exact instructions). The respondents were then instructed to “Think about your interpersonal interactions with the person” when answering the questions. All items were prefaced by the phrase, “In my interactions with him or her…” and items included statements such as “I fear consequences if I do not defer to this person,” “This person’s dominance requires my submission,” or “I tend to embrace this person’s point of view as my own.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0265407512443617">
<title>Relational quality</title>
<p>The scale that assessed relational quality was used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512443617">Beatty and Dobos’s (1992)</xref> study to measure relational quality between fathers and sons. This scale contains five seven-point bi-polar items: satisfying–dissatisfying, fulfilling–disappointing, rewarding–punishing, positive–negative, and good–bad. Responses to the five items were summed and averaged to create an index of relational quality. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0265407512443617">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To assess the underlying or latent dimensions of convergence communication, a principal components analysis with Varimax rotation was conducted on all scale items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512443617">Sapnas and Zeller (2002</xref>) reported that a sample size of approximately 100 is sufficient for performing exploratory factor analysis of instruments in the social sciences. Therefore, our sample (<italic>N </italic>= 379) was more than adequate for this analysis. Initial factors were extracted based upon a scree plot and eigenvalues greater than one.</p>
<p>To assess the internal consistency of the scale items, Cronbach’s alphas were computed for each subscale (motivation, disequilibrium, and interpersonal deference) and for the entire scale. Individual item analyses were conducted and items were retained based on an alpha-if-item-deleted analysis. </p>
<p>Finally, frequencies were calculated for relationship type and correlations were computed to assess the associations among convergence communication, gender, and relational quality.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0265407512443617">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The principal components analysis of the 28 items using Varimax rotation produced four factors with eigenvalues greater than one that collectively accounted for 62.3% of the variance. Factor loadings greater than .5 were used to determine the placement of items within a specific factor (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407512443617">Table 1</xref>). These factors were conceptually consistent with those postulated by NCC theory (disequilibrium, motivation, and interpersonal deference); however, an emergent factor structure reflected two possible separate (dis)equilibrium dimensions: disequilibrium participation (e.g., we both initiate conversations, <italic>reverse scored</italic>) and (dis)equilibrium consideration (e.g., both of us respect each other's opinions, even if we disagree, <italic>reverse scored</italic>). After closely examining the items in factors 3 and 4, we interpreted that the separation into two factors may have been an artifact of the parallel wording used in the factor 4 items (e.g., “we both” instead of “this person”). </p>

<p>Given this interpretation and following the guidelines posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512443617">Victora, Huttly, Fuchs, and Olinto (1997</xref>) stating that a decision on which factors to include should be based on a conceptual framework, not purely statistical associations, we determined that the items in factors 3 and 4 were <italic>conceptually</italic> similar – all assessing disequilibrium in conversations. Therefore, we concluded that a three-factor structure best explained the data in this exploratory analysis. We do concede that a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is needed to further examine this factor structure. This will be completed in study two below.</p>
<p>A standardized alpha reliability coefficient of .93 was obtained for the 28 retained items in the CCS. All 28 items were retained based on an alpha-if-item-deleted analysis, with deletion of any item resulting in a lower reliability coefficient.</p>
<p>Respondents self-selected the following relational partners they perceived as “having influence in my life”: mother (<italic>N</italic> = 111, 31%), romantic partner (<italic>N </italic>= 73, 20.4%), father (<italic>N </italic>= 61, 17%), same-sex friend (<italic>N</italic> = 48, 13.4%), opposite-sex friend (<italic>N</italic> = 36, 10%), sibling (<italic>N</italic> = 22, 6.1%), and grandparent (<italic>N</italic> = 7, 1.9%); less than 1% selected “other” (<italic>N</italic> = 2) . Nine percent failed to identify the relationship type (<italic>N</italic> = 19). Significantly more females (<italic>N</italic> = 67) identified mothers as their dominant relational partner than did males (<italic>N</italic> = 44), with 47 males but only 14 females identifying fathers (<italic>X</italic>
<sup>2</sup>[1, <italic>N </italic>= 172] = 23.68, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01.). For subsequent analyses we separated relationship categories into two composite groupings – non-voluntary relationships and voluntary relationships – since we did not know if the respondent was married. Non-voluntary family relationships consisted of mother, father, sibling, and grandparent, while voluntary relationships consisted of romantic partner, same-sex friend, opposite-sex friend, and other.</p>
<p>The 28-item CCS had a total mean score of 2.01, with scores ranging from 1 (low convergence) to 5 (high convergence) (<italic>SD</italic> = .60). There was a significant difference between gender and convergence communication, with males (<italic>M</italic> = 2.1, <italic>SD</italic> = .60) reporting significantly more convergence communication than females (<italic>M</italic> = 1.9; <italic>SD</italic> = .67; <italic>t</italic>[359] = 2.77; <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01), but no significant differences for ethnicity or age. Moreover, there was no significant difference between non-voluntary family relationships and voluntary relationships, with non-voluntary relationships (<italic>M</italic> = 1.87, <italic>SD</italic> = .61) eliciting slightly lower scores on convergence communication than voluntary relationships (<italic>M</italic> = 2.0; <italic>SD</italic> = .61; <italic>t</italic>[354] = 1.73; <italic>ns</italic>). </p>
<p>Convergence communication was negatively related to relationship quality for both non-voluntary family relationships (<italic>r</italic> = –.62, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) and voluntary relationships (<italic>r</italic> = –.55, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01). When looking only at relationship quality, participants reported better relational quality in their non-voluntary family relationships (<italic>M</italic> = 6.4, <italic>SD</italic> = .90) than their voluntary relationships (<italic>M</italic> = 5.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.09, <italic>t</italic>(212) = 3.08, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Based on the findings from study one, the aims of this second study were to (a) further refine the CCS, assessing the scale for factor structure, reliability, and construct validity, and (b) test the association of convergence communication with depression and learned helplessness as posited by NCC theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to developing a valid and reliable measure of convergence communication, this study also provides a preliminary test of the NCC theoretical model posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2004</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265407512443617">Figure 1</xref>). This study endeavors to test the associations predicted in this model and to assess if convergence communication is positively associated with depression and learned helplessness in a non-clinical, college student sample.</p>

<title>Learned helplessness</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2004</xref>) posited that convergence communication would be positively associated with <italic>learned helplessness</italic> for submissive partners participating in convergence communication routines with dominant others. Learned helplessness, initially founded on the animal model of human depression, references a psychological condition where an animal has learned to believe that it is helpless; it believes that it has no control over its situation and that whatever it does is futile. As a result, the animal will stay passive in the face of an unpleasant, harmful, or damaging situation, even when it does actually have the power to change its circumstances. In humans, learned helplessness theory suggests that helplessness results from a perceived lack of control over the events in one's life, which may result from prior exposure to uncontrollable negative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512443617">Maier &amp; Seligman, 1976</xref>). Learned helplessness is linked to perceptions that the individual has little to no control over their lives. </p>

<title>Depression</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512443617">2005</xref>) also predicted that convergence communication would be positively associated with depression for submissive partners in convergence communication routines with dominant others. She and her colleagues have since reported support for this claim in subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512443617">Miller-Day &amp; Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512443617">Miller-Day &amp; Fisher, 2008</xref>). According to the <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</italic> (4th ed.) (DSM-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512443617">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>), depression in both women and men is a debilitating internalizing disorder that disrupts relationships and daily lives and affects nearly 10 percent of the population. Once a person has a single episode of depression, the chances of recurrence are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512443617">Hammen, 1991</xref>). Men and women report similarities in degree of impairment, length of episodes, chronicity of the illness, time to first recurrence, or number of recurrences, but women are much more likely to report seven or eight symptoms of depression. Pure depression – in which the person has no other psychiatric illness – is more common in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512443617">Simonds, 2001</xref>). Aaron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512443617">Beck (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512443617">1974</xref>) hypothesized that part of the basis of human depression is internal attribution for bad events. This is in contrast to learned helplessness, which posits that helplessness results from a perception that events are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Depression can have serious consequences for individuals and their relationships. Exploring the link between convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness may provide valuable information about parent–adult child convergence communication as a potential risk factor. If there is an association, as predicted, and if convergence communication has a direct effect on these mental health outcomes, the findings will have implications for interventions and treatment. </p>

<sec id="section14-0265407512443617">
<title>Aim #1: Refining the instrument</title>
<p>Refinement of the convergence communication instrument is important to ensure that the measure is both valid and reliable so that it may be used in empirical research. In addition, since convergence communication is a relatively novel concept, understanding its factor structure and verifying the construct validity of the measurement instrument are important tasks. The theoretical expectation, supported in study one, was that the factor structure of convergence communication would include interpersonal deference, motivation, and disequilibrium. This will be further tested in this study. </p>
<p>Moreover, since convergence communication is described as an interaction routine that demonstrates interpersonal submission to a dominant other, the construct validity might be assessed by examining the association of convergence communication with a measure of the target other’s dominance. Conceptually, then, the respondent should characterize the target interactional partner as a dominant other and the CCS should be significantly related to a measure of the target other’s interpersonal dominance. </p>
<p>In summary, the first aim of this second study was to refine and test the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the CCS. Specifically, we sought to test the following.<disp-quote>
<p>H1: Convergence communication will comprise three factors: interpersonal deference, motivation, disequilibrium.</p>
<p>H2: Convergence communication will be positively related to perceptions of others’ behavioral dominance.</p>

<sec id="section15-0265407512443617">
<title>Aim #2: Convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness</title>
<p>NCC theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512443617">Miller-Day, 2004</xref>) posits that convergence communication is positively associated with internalizing disorders such as depression and learned helpless for submissive partners. However, this previous research posited effects for females only. Hence, the following hypotheses will be examined.<disp-quote>
<p>H3: Convergence communication will be positively associated with depression and learned helplessness.</p>
<p>H4: Convergence communication will be a significant predictor of depression for females.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To accomplish the aims of this research we took the following steps: (1) evaluated the factor structure and reliability of the CCS; (2) assessed the construct validity of the CCS; and (3) tested the theoretical relationships among convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness. </p>
<sec id="section17-0265407512443617">
<title>Scale refinement</title>
<p>To refine the existing instrument, we made changes in the following areas: (a) altering the valence of disequilibrium items and (b) including additional items to assess interpersonal deference. In the initial scale testing, all eight of the items that assessed disequilibrium were reverse coded, and these were the only reverse-coded items in the entire scale. Since convergence communication is concerned with disequilibrium within the relationship, it made sense that these positively worded items were reverse coded; however, since all of the items were positively valenced, there could have been a potential bias. In order to assess this, four of the eight disequilibrium items were re-worded to be more negatively valenced to see if this altered the factor structure.</p>
<p>In addition, we included further items to assess interpersonal deference. In the first study there were only six items that measured interpersonal deference. Conceptually we believed that deference was central to measuring overall convergence communication. Hence, to strengthen the measure we added 13 additional items to try to enhance the reliability of this dimension. To create these items, additional analysis was conducted with the qualitative data from study one. Using the method put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512443617">DeVellis (2003</xref>), after completing the qualitative content analyses, the authors generated scale items using the study participants’ own words whenever possible to enhance item validity. Audiotapes of interviews were used to verify specific quotes, which were then translated into scale items. These new items were then added to the original CCS that was developed in study one.</p>

<sec id="section19-0265407512443617">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample (<italic>N</italic> = 373) comprised college students currently enrolled at an Eastern university. These students were enrolled in the basic communication course and received course credit for completing the survey. Students who preferred not to take part in this research were able to complete an alternative assignment as provided through the standard subject pool procedures. Students were assigned to a research project and received an email with a link to the online study, along with instructions for the completion of the survey.   </p>

<sec id="section20-0265407512443617">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>For this second study, students completed a web-based survey. When students accessed the website, they were first directed to a consent page. If they consented to participate, they were then directed to the survey. After answering items in the demographic information section, they were asked to complete the four measures detailed below, which were displayed in random order to reduce any order effects. Finally, when responding to the questionnaire items, it was necessary to ensure that respondents focused on a relational partner who was perceived as dominant in their relationship. So, in keeping with the initial scale-development study, respondents were provided with the same directions that were used in study one (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0265407512443617">Appendix</xref>).</p>

<title>Convergence communication</title>
<p>The CCS administered in this study was a 42-item scale. There were several changes from the scale administered in the first study, namely, the valence of four equilibrium items was changed from negative to positive and 13 additional interpersonal deference items were added. Each item was designed to assess the degree to which the statement characterizes communicative interactions with the relational partner (e.g., “My partner insists I agree with him/her” and “My partner’s opinion is usually considered the ‘right’ one”) and is rated using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (Very much”).  </p>

<title>Depression</title>
<p>The <italic>Beck Depression Inventory-II</italic> (BDI-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512443617">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) is a 21-item self-report scale of depressive symptoms (including sad affect, apathy, disappointment/guilt, and physical symptoms) as listed in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV (1994). A total score is computed by summing symptoms. For research purposes, scores above the mean are considered at high risk for depression. The Beck Depression Inventories (I and II) have been used for 35 years to identify and assess depressive symptoms, and have been reported to be highly reliable regardless of the population. BDI-II has a high coefficient alpha (.80), its construct validity has been established, it was found to differentiate depressed from non-depressed patients, and it has been found to be effective in accurately assessing depression for both outpatients (.92) and for college students (.93) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512443617">Beck et al., 1996</xref>). The Cronbach’s alpha was .89.</p>

<title>Learned helplessness</title>
<p>The <italic>learned helplessness scale</italic> assesses how often a person engages in prototypically helpless behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512443617">Peterson, 1993</xref>). Learned helplessness is a psychological condition in which a human has learned to act or behave helpless in a particular situation, even when it has the power to change the circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512443617">Peterson, 1993</xref>). This 11-item instrument asked how frequently, in the last month, a person had engaged in certain behaviors (e.g., “I didn’t stand up for myself,” “I let someone take advantage of me”). The items are assessed on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“0 times this month”) to 5 (“more than 21 times this month”). Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .89.</p>

<sec id="section26-0265407512443617">
<title>Behavior-based dominance scale</title>
<p>To assess convergent validity, others’ behavioral dominance was measured with the <italic>behavior-based dominance scale </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512443617">Burgoon, Johnson, &amp; Koch, 1998</xref>). The <italic>behavior-based dominance scale</italic> allows participants to think of a focal person and answer a set of questions about the focal person’s dominant or submissive behavior (in the context of this study, participants answered these items on the same focal person they were thinking of when completing the CCS). Given that participants were directed to choose a focal person who they perceived was dominant in their relationship, it seems likely that a person rating themselves high in convergence communication will also rate the focal “other” as more dominant.</p>
<p>The behavior-based dominance scale is a 31-item scale. Each item is designed to assess a person’s dominant or submissive behavioral tendencies (e.g., “This person has a natural talent for winning over others” and “This person is more of a follower than a leader”) and is rated using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly Agree”). Although the scale comprised five subscales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512443617">Burgoon et al. (1998</xref>) concluded that “[the behavioral-based scale] can be used unidimensionally, if the objective is to obtain an overall assessment of actual enacted dominance” (p. 329).</p>

<title>Hypotheses and research questions</title>
<p>A CFA was employed in an attempt to see if the data gathered from each item in the scale fit with the proposed theoretical model of a three-factor solution. The original model predicted by NCC theory indicated that convergence communication would comprise three factors: motivation, disequilibrium, and interpersonal deference. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512443617">Noar and Morokoff (2002</xref>), “A model has good empirical fit if the CFI is .90 or above and the Average Absolute Standardized Residuals (AASR) is &lt;.06. The factor loadings should generally be &gt;.50, and path coefficients and explained variance indicate the strength of the relationship between constructs” (p. 48). In order to evaluate test–retest reliability with results from study one, with the data from this administration we conducted a principal axis factor analysis with Varimax rotation.  </p>
<p>To test the second hypothesis we conducted a correlation analysis of convergence communication and other’s behavioral dominance. To test Hypotheses 3 and 4 we conducted a correlation analysis, independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, and a multiple regression analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 373 respondents, including 178 males (47.7%) and 195 females (52.3%). The age range of the subjects was from 18 to 38 (<italic>M</italic> = 20.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.97). The ethnicity of the sample included 10 African American/Black students (2.7%), 19 Asian students (5.1%), 18 Hispanic students (4.8%), 11 Native American students (2.9%), 11 Multiracial students (2.9%), and 303 White/Caucasian students (81.2%).  </p>
<p>Relationship types targeted as most dominant included: mother (<italic>N</italic> = 105; 28.2%), father (<italic>N </italic>= 77; 20.6%), romantic partner (<italic>N</italic> = 69; 18.5%), same-sex friend (<italic>N</italic> = 48; 12.9%), opposite-sex friend (<italic>N</italic> = 38; 10.2%), sibling (<italic>N</italic> = 24; 6.4%), other (<italic>N</italic> = 10; 2.7%), and grandparent  (<italic>N</italic>  = 2; .5%), with examples of “other” relationships including relations such as ex-girlfriend and aunt.  </p>
<sec id="section30-0265407512443617">
<title>Factor structure and convergent validity of the Convergence Communication Scale</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 posited that the CCS would comprise three factors. For our analyses we used the following criteria for the CFA fit: (a) due to the large number of participants we will be using the chi square to degrees of freedom ratio rather than the chi square; b) in addition, we will be using the normed fit index (NFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). After running the initial model, items were dropped one at a time due to the modification indices indicating cross-loadings between subscales. After a total of six items were dropped, the three-factor model fit the data. The chi square to degrees of freedom ratio is 2.53 (χ2 = 1231.40, <italic>df</italic> = 486, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00); NFI = .850, CFI = .903, RMSEA = .064. In sum, the structure of the NCC model was confirmed by the CFA performed on this data.  </p>
<p>Because the subscales were highly correlated, we tested a second-order factor model with convergence as an overarching construct leading to all three factors (motivation, disequilibrium, and interpersonal deference). This model was almost as good a fit as the previous three-factor model (chi square to degrees of freedom ratio = 3.00, NFI = .826, CFI = .876, and RMSEA = .074). This means that when interested in convergence as a whole, a composite measure comprising the average of the subscale means could be used.</p>

<sec id="section31-0265407512443617">
<title>Construct validity</title>
<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted that convergence communication would be significantly related to perceptions of the target others’ behavioral dominance. Convergence communication was positively associated with perceptions of the target other’s dominance (<italic>r</italic> = .276, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) and others’ dominance was correlated with interpersonal deference (<italic>r</italic> = .303, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) and motivation to defer (<italic>r</italic> = .284, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01), but not disequilibrium.

<sec id="section32-0265407512443617">
<title>Convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness</title>
<p>As predicted in Hypothesis 3, convergence communication was positively related with depression (<italic>r</italic> = .336, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) and learned helplessness (<italic>r</italic> = .347, <italic>p </italic>&lt;.01). To investigate gender differences, we computed the differences in the means for males and females on both convergence communication and depression. While there was no significant difference for men (<italic>M</italic> = 2.14, <italic>SD</italic> = .59) and women (<italic>M</italic> = 2.05, <italic>SD</italic> = .68) for convergence communication (<italic>t</italic>(371) = 1.37, <italic>p</italic> =.17), there was a significant difference between men (<italic>M</italic> = 1.3, <italic>SD</italic> = .31) and women (<italic>M</italic> = 1.44, <italic>SD</italic> = .43) for depression (<italic>t</italic>(365) = –3.47, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01), with women reporting higher levels of depression than men.</p>
<p>To further examine this relationship, a multiple regression was employed to examine gender and convergence communication as a predictor for depression.

<title>Discussion of studies one and two</title>
<p>The purposes of these two studies were to (1) develop, refine, and evaluate a measurement instrument to validly and reliably measure convergence communication and (2) conduct initial theory testing of the associations among convergence communication, depression, and learned helplessness.</p>
<sec id="section34-0265407512443617">
<title>Convergence Communication Scale</title>
<p>Through these two studies, a new instrument was developed to measure convergence communication – a pattern of communicative interaction enacted in dominant–submissive relationships where submissive partners are compelled to interpret the world around them in ways consistent with dominant partners. The original scale used in study one comprised 28 items, but in the final CCS there are 32 items. The additional items contributed significantly to the reliability of the measure as a whole and made the subscale measuring interpersonal deference more robust. For the final CCS see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0265407512443617">Appendix</xref>. Our findings confirmed three underlying factors for convergence communication: interpersonal deference, motivation, and disequilibrium.</p>
<p>Interestingly, mothers, fathers, and romantic partners were most frequently identified as dominant partners in both studies (mothers (study 1 = 31%; study 2 = 28.2%), romantic partners (study 1 = 20.4%, study 2 = 18.5%), and fathers (study 1 = 17%; study 2 = 20.6%) . This was followed by same-sex friend (study 1 = 13.4%, study 2 = 12.9%), opposite-sex friend (study 1 = 10%, study 2 = 10.2%), and sibling (study 1 = 6.1%, study 2 = 6.4%). Grandparents were rarely selected as dominant partners (study 1 = 1.9%, study 2 = .5%). Although some might suggest that these results can be explained by mother and father relationships requiring socially prescribed submissiveness, this does not account for the high percentage who selected romantic partners or the low levels of reporting grandparents. Romantic partners were identified even more frequently than fathers in the first study. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in convergence communication (i.e., submission) between the identified voluntary and non-voluntary relationships in study one. Participants seem to select dominant relational partners that cut across voluntary and non-voluntary (e.g., family) relationships, based on interpersonal interaction rather than socially prescribed norms for submission.</p>

<title>NCC theory</title>
<p>Convergence communication itself was negatively related to relationship quality for all relationships in study one, with males reporting more convergence communication than females in both studies. However, in study two, our findings demonstrated higher levels of depression among women than men, with convergence communication significantly predicting depression for females. Higher levels of depression for females reflect national trends in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512443617">Piccinelli &amp; Wilkinson, 2000</xref>), but this study contributes new information about the role of convergence communication in depression. These findings are important to the present research goals for several reasons. Firstly, since depression is a disorder only affecting a small percentage of the population, finding significant relationships between convergence communication and depression in a non-clinical, general sample suggests that convergence communication may have an even more powerful association in clinical samples. Secondly, since whole model testing for the NCC theory has not yet been conducted, this is an important first step in demonstrating the potential and need for research in this area. This set of studies provides some preliminary support for the theoretical model presented by Miller-Day in 2004, arguing that convergence communication is an important communication phenomenon that is consequential for understanding depression and learned helplessness, specifically for females.</p>
<p>Convergent validity of the CCS with the behavioral dominance scale was not as robust as expected. We were expecting the correlation between these two measures to be higher because dominance and submissiveness seem to be complimentary constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512443617">Leary, 1957</xref>), but the low correlations suggest that perhaps they are not. Yet, given there was no association between perceptions of other’s dominance and disequilibrium, this suggests that the dominance measure itself may not have captured interpersonal dominance in the way it is conceptualized in NCC theory. Further research with perhaps a larger sample is needed to understand these associations. </p>
<p>These findings have contributed to both the study of convergence communication as a communication construct and the study of necessary convergence as a communication theory. We now have a more valid and reliable measure of convergence communication, so whole model testing can begin for the NCC theoretical model. In addition, the CCS shows promise for application in both non-clinical and clinical settings. In a clinical setting, it might be beneficial to have a shorter measure in order to isolate the population either for further study or treatment. Theoretically, we would argue that interpersonal deference could be a proxy measure for convergence communication and serve to assess individuals that could be prone to convergence. However, since the entire convergence scale is not that long, the ideal would be to use the whole measure rather than one of its parts.</p>
<p>These studies were not without limitations. The study sample was not diverse in terms of culture or age. This could potentially limit the generalizability of the findings to more diverse populations. There was little variation in age, so most of what we know thus far about convergence communication has come from college-aged students. If this phenomenon varies with age, further research among a larger age range is needed to better understand that.</p>
<p>In addition, the sample was a general population of students. The results suggest that a greater understanding of convergence communication might come from a more specific clinical sample (such as people who are depressed) to achieve greater variability within the mental health measures, although it is encouraging to find some significance among just a general population.  </p>
<p>In summary, the CCS has been developed, refined, and validated. This instrument comprised three subscales, interpersonal deference, motivation, and disequilibrium, and all three scales should ideally be included when assessing convergence communication. We believe that the construct of convergence communication has great potential to contribute to the understanding of interpersonal submission. There is a marked lack of research into this, with most research focusing on interpersonal dominance. As study two in this series reveals, convergence communication as an interpersonally submissive communication pattern was significantly related to depression and learned helplessness, and it directly predicted depression for females. As stated in our introduction, dominance and submission are fundamental dimensions of interpersonal relationships and define the very nature of these relationships. It is imperative that we understand both dimensions to capture the complexity of both voluntary and non-voluntary relationships.</p>

<title>Description</title>
<p>The CCS is a 32-item instrument designed to measure perceptions of required convergence needed in communicative interaction between parent and offspring. Factor analysis revealed that the CCS has three subscales: Motivation (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23); Interpersonal Deference (items 9, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32); and Disequilibrium (items 5, 6, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section39-0265407512443617">
<title>Scoring</title>
<p>The CCS is easily scored by first reverse scoring the following items (7, 8, 20, 21), then summing items on the five-point Likert-type scale for each subscale and then for the total score. Higher scores indicate low equilibrium, high motivation to converge, and high convergence by the respondent.</p>
