<p>In her latest book, Judith Stacey extends her legacy as one of sociology’s chroniclers and defenders of family diversity. Drawing on several articles Stacey published over the last decade, <italic>Unhitched</italic> might at first be seen as an edited-volume retrospective. In fact, Stacey has revised, supplemented, and synthesized these primarily ethnographic pieces into a coherent and innovative monograph that reads like a twenty-first-century companion to her earlier touchstone, <italic>Brave New Families</italic> (1991). Where the earlier book explored two demographically mainstream, white, working-class kin networks to argue that the United States was transitioning through a period of recombinant and unresolved family structures, <italic>Unhitched</italic> turns to three demographically atypical groups—gay men in Los Angeles, polygynists in South Africa, and the marriage-less Mosuo ethnic minority of western China—to suggest, and hope, that contemporary family diversity might be less a transitional way station than a destination in its own right.</p>
<p>Opening with the most familiar of her cases, Stacey suggests that gay men are “among . . . the most creative petitioners for family recognition and rights around the globe today” (p. 9). This creativity encompasses not only the monogamous, two-parent families foregrounded by the marriage equality movement of recent years but also a protean assortment of other arrangements. Devoting her first chapter on this case to caring relationships among gay adult men themselves, Stacey introduces us to a self-described “sex pig” who, by agreement with his largely celibate partner, pursues erotic pleasure outside their relationship, as well as a sexually exclusive and economically integrated conjugal triad. Much as she argued about divorce in <italic>Brave New Families</italic>, Stacey suggests that the putatively antifamily thrust of nonmarital eros can in fact become a resource by which gay men forge creative and extensive kinship networks. The following chapter on gay parenting similarly celebrates the coparenting relationships her participants sustain not only with their romantic partners but with close friends or with the genetic and surrogate mothers of their children.</p>
<p>For her second case study, Stacey travels to South Africa, which she rightly argues “sets the gold standard for pluralist family law, including recognition for both same-sex and plural marriage” (p. 93). She first explores the intricate politics that have produced this “vanguard” legal agenda, using the United States as her foil. While South African law has quickly expanded, patriarchal norms and economic deprivation restrict many people’s ability to exercise those new rights. In the United States, by contrast, de facto family diversity flourishes despite a far less hospitable legal environment. For Stacey, this demonstrates that the relationship between family practice and family policy is far more complex than both family sociologists and political ideologues commonly assume, mediated by “complex social forces and political alliances” (p. 120). Her next chapter turns to the actual practice of polygyny, finding not only African but also white polygynous families (the latter ineligible for state recognition) whose reasons for the practice, and experience of it, confound the un-nuanced narratives of feminists and conservatives alike. While plural marriage is difficult to sustain in contemporary wage economies, contemporary life can also produce trying circumstances that a co-wife’s helping hand and comforting heart may mitigate.</p>
<p>The last of Stacey’s case studies is undoubtedly the most eye-opening. Marriage has been but an occasional exception throughout the Mosuo’s two millennia of tumultuous history. Instead, men visit women at night for sex—typically but not necessarily the same woman over a number of years—while children are raised in matrilineal households by their mothers, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. By decoupling eros from domesticity, this structure seems to prevent many pressures that bedevil the marriage-based families of other societies. Stacey observes a generally relaxed attitude toward women’s sexual autonomy and markedly convivial home environments, as well as zero “fatherlessness,” this problem having been predefined out of existence. A thriving tourist industry has emerged around these globally novel family practices, enriching the families but, paradoxically, undermining the economic and ideological basis on which their family forms are built.</p>
<p>Thus sounds the cautionary note lurking within the book’s ode to family joys. While the globe is not converging, as predicted by modernization theorists, onto the “normal family” model of married parents with children, nor even onto the more voluntary and egalitarian intimacies diagnosed by Anthony Giddens, neither is it a utopia of unbounded family diversity. Many have noted that the economic pressures of late, global capitalism undermine family structures, but Stacey suggests that these ravages are magnified by the enduring centrality of the normal family ideal in a context where few can attain it. For this she blames not only conservatives but also liberals, whose notions of family diversity encompass same-sex couples but still promote marriage without acknowledging that social forces have increasingly rendered marriage neither sustainable nor even suitable for many individuals.</p>
