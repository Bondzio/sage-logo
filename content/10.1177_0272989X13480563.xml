<abstract>
<p>The UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a world leader in health technology assessment (HTA), sits at the interface of a policy environment where everything is urgent and consensus between policy makers and stakeholders is sometimes difficult to attain. The majority of stakeholder challenges to NICE’s use of HTA concern the interpretation of evidence and the methodological rules applied by the appraisal committees. We discuss the most significant issues: choice of comparators; evidence synthesis and indirect comparison; parameter selection, especially for the valuation of quality of life; extrapolation beyond clinical trial data; and the level of the cost-effectiveness threshold.</p>

<p>Health care policy has many elements, including: the development of overall funding strategies and major capital investment decisions, clinical training programs and information systems, expenditure prioritization, clinical decision guidance, and quality maintenance. Health technology assessment (HTA) and its sister disciplines of evidence-based medicine and health economics barely existed before the 1970s but have since become powerful tools for informing at least the latter three of these policy elements.</p>
<p>The UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), founded in 1999, has established itself as a world leader in the use and translation of health technology assessment into health care policy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X13480563">
<title>Historical Perspective on Health Technology Assessment</title>
<p>HTA can be seen as the modern application of a deep-rooted scientific approach to delivering health care, dating back at least to the Age of Enlightenment with James Lind’s small controlled trial of scurvy treatments in 1745 and Pierre Louis’ demonstration in the 1830s that blood-letting did not improve pneumonia outcomes. The work of 20th century pioneers such as Ernest Codman, who called for detailed follow-up of patient outcomes (Boston 1920s), and Glover, who demonstrated wide geographical treatment variations (England 1930s), exposed the uncertainty in the appropriateness of health care delivery. In the 1970s, a skeptical view of the real impact of medicine emerged in Thomas McKeown’s <italic>Role of Medicine</italic>, now considered a classic in medical policy commentary, coupled with an unequivocal call for more and better clinical effectiveness research in Archie Cochrane’s <italic>Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services.</italic> The latter embedded the use of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), pioneered in the famous streptomycin trial of 1946, into health services research. The systematic review (typically of RCTs) had to wait for the emergence of evidence-based medicine in the 1980s. Meanwhile, health economics had emerged in the late 1960s as a distinct discipline and has blossomed since then. Health economics provides the tools for assessing value for money in health care and emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost, a fundamental underpinning principle of NICE Health Technology Appraisals.</p>
<p>HTA, a term coined in the US Congress’s Office of Technology Assessment, has become the internationally accepted acronym for the scientific evaluation of elements of health care with or without an embedded economic assessment.</p>

<sec id="section2-0272989X13480563">
<title>Current Use of Health Technology Assessment</title>
<p>Two things have happened to HTA in the 21st century. First, its use has become essential as many health systems struggle to ensure the effective use of the interventions available. Second, the methodology of HTA has become hugely complex.</p>
<p>The use of HTA has become essential for 3 reasons. First, the conventional wisdom is to be cautious about the use of new (and continuation of the use of old) technologies until evidence-based information is available. Enthusiasts and those needing hope in the face of devastating disease may, understandably, be loath to share that caution. But since the thalidomide tragedy, the public, most health professionals, and nearly all policy makers take this view. Second, the cost escalation of health care in general and of new technologies in particular, accompanied by growing numbers of new interventions that <italic>are</italic> effective, has made the need to prioritize inevitable, even in the world’s richest health care systems. This applies not only to high-tech diagnostic machinery and surgical equipment but also to new, targeted medicines, which are often an order of magnitude more expensive than the previous generation of technologies. These and other health care cost pressures are crashing into budget ceilings. Third, many health economies have set up arrangements where there is a clear imperative to commission health care through structured mechanisms. For example, in the UK, the purchaser-provider split established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1991 survived the 1997 transition to Labour and all government changes since. This purchaser-provider split provided the imperative for purchasers to develop mechanisms to ensure that they were spending money wisely. This provided the basis for the establishment of regional HTA producers in the UK, the Development and Evaluation Committees, set up before NICE was established to inform technology adoption policy. From 1999, this function moved to a national institute, NICE.</p>
<p>HTA has become increasingly complex partly because of its use to inform health policy decision making. Policy can be contested, and if it claims a scientific base, that base needs to be rigorous. It has also become complex because the HTA and health economic academic worlds are attracting significant budgets and able practitioners in numbers. We are witnessing a spiral of growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X13480563">
<title>NICE</title>
<p>NICE is at the heart of this spiral in use and complexity of HTA. NICE provides guidance for the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. In 2000, its programs were limited to technology appraisal (cost-effectiveness of technologies) and clinical guidelines (covering whole diseases). By 2013 its scope had extended to a program on the safety and efficacy of surgery (and other interventional procedures); additional cost-effectiveness programs on public health and on diagnostic procedures; a fast-track cost-minimization evaluation program on medical devices; and programs on quality indicators (for reimbursement in primary care), quality standards in health care generally, appraisal and quality standards in social care, an Internet evidence service, and an international advice service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">http://www.nice.org.uk/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Even with this extension of activity, technology appraisal remains NICE’s most well-known and also its most contentious activity. The coverage of the technology appraisal program, although open to all technologies, comprises predominantly new drugs, many for cancer and many very expensive. NICE’s technology appraisal recommendations are accompanied by directions to NHS commissioning bodies to make funding for the technology available for the appraised indication if clinically appropriate. Technology appraisal documents are widely read and used beyond the UK, and they matter enormously to the life sciences industry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta/index.jsp">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta/index.jsp</ext-link>).</p>

<title>NICE’s Technology Appraisal Process</title>
<p>The process by which the recommendations are made is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X13480563">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The essence of this process is to ensure 1) thoroughness and quality through HTA, critical review, and formal appraisal; 2) independence of the Appraisal Committee, where conflicts of interest are not permitted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/website/glossary/technology_appraisal_committee.jsp">http://www.nice.org.uk/website/glossary/technology_appraisal_committee.jsp</ext-link>); 3) transparency through meetings attended by stakeholders and the public and through documents viewable on the Web; 4) contestability through a manufacturer’s right to: critique the HTA (in those cases where the manufacturer didn’t provide it), be consulted on the preliminary recommendations of the appraisal committee, and appeal against the outcome of the appraisal; and 5) timeliness. Timeliness is a critical objective of the appraisal program, and, in the single technology appraisal (STA) process, the appraisal can commence in parallel with the medicine’s licensing process because the manufacturer produces the HTA submission.</p>

<title>NICE’s Evolving HTA Methodology</title>
<p>Our experience of using HTA to inform policy making is one of discussion and challenge. Although some challenge has concerned the fairness of and the degree of strict adherence to NICE’s processes, the majority of the challenge from stakeholders concerns the use of evidence, the methodological rules applied, and the interpretation of the evidence and the rules by the appraisal committee.</p>
<p>Whenever NICE says “yes” to a new technology, our general experience has been that the degree of challenge has been slight. When NICE, at least initially, says “no,” the challenge is frequently fierce. In these challenges, the most significant methodological issues have concerned the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0272989X13480563" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The choice of comparators</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evidence synthesis and indirect comparison</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Parameter selection, especially the valuation of quality of life</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Extrapolation</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The level of the cost-effectiveness threshold</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>NICE’s position on each of these methodological issues is set out in the Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/howwework/devnicetech/guidetothemethodsoftechnologyappraisal.jsp">http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/howwework/devnicetech/guidetothemethodsoftechnologyappraisal.jsp</ext-link>). This guide undergoes periodic review in consultation with stakeholders, drawing on advances in HTA methodology and on NICE’s experience. The latest review took place in 2012, and an updated version of the guide will be published in the first half of 2013.</p>
<sec id="section6-0272989X13480563">
<title>Comparators</title>
<p>Choosing the appropriate comparator is crucial for all HTAs. Any technology can be modeled to demonstrate impressive cost-effectiveness if it is compared with a product that is both expensive and ineffective. But choosing appropriate comparators is contentious. It is often extremely difficult to determine what is the established clinical practice for the condition. Even when current practice is identified, it is rarely uniform and often not optimal. Our current approach to choosing comparators favors inclusiveness at the analysis stage and committee pragmatism during their appraisal, influenced by the degree of comparator use in clinical practice in the NHS as well as whether the comparator is, itself, cost-effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X13480563">
<title>Evidence Synthesis</title>
<p>The rules for evidence synthesis through systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials lie at the heart of the methodology of evidence-based medicine and HTA. However, experience in NICE appraisal of new pharmaceuticals has shown that the clinical development program for most products is not ideal. Many important evidence gaps exist at the time of product launch, limiting the assessor’s ability to apply these techniques. As a result, for many technology appraisals, there is usually a need to apply methods of indirect comparison (comparison of two technologies via a third, with which each has been compared) and to accept a penumbra of nonrandomized data as evidence in order to derive some inference about the comparative effectiveness of the new technology. But the methodological rules and best practice for indirect comparison via network meta-analysis and for the incorporation of nonrandomized trial evidence into HTA are much less mature and respected than for the meta-analysis of concordant RCTs. This is an important area for methodological research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272989X13480563">
<title>Parameter Selection</title>
<p>All elements of economic modeling should, ideally, follow the same systematic review and other methodological rigors expected of evidence synthesis. However, the tools available to ensure that this systematic approach is easy to apply are not well developed. For example, NICE particularly needs a database of health status and utility values for the conditions it reviews and, where there are multiple values, a guide to allow technology assessors to choose between them. But this type of evidence is accumulating very slowly. This and other important components of evidence-based health economics seem to be less favored as methodological research topics and to attract less notice in HTA than is the case for evidence synthesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272989X13480563">
<title>Extrapolation</title>
<p>Clinical trials typically span weeks or months, but seldom years. Most economic analyses, and certainly those with any mortality component, take a lifetime perspective. Although this disconnect is inevitable, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) consequent on selecting, for example, a log-normal extrapolation function as opposed to, say, a Weibull can be very different. NICE’s position is to insist on clinical plausibility in the resulting survival curves produced by the chosen approach, but important uncertainties in crucial evidence of this type are present in nearly all chronic disease appraisals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272989X13480563">
<title>The Threshold</title>
<p>Two crucial health economic numbers, one derived from each economic evaluation, the other fixed, are used in each technology appraisal: 1) the ICER of the appraised technology versus its comparator and 2) the cost-effectiveness threshold with which the ICER is compared. The significance of the threshold is that it reflects the opportunity cost of health care foregone when funding is transferred away from other health care activities in order to fund the new technology. There is an ongoing and important methodological debate on whether, at a point in time, the threshold is correct, that is, whether what is displaced is more or less valuable than what is introduced; and on whether the threshold should rise or fall over time, depending on the balance between technology adoption and rising health care budgets. Until better evidence emerges, the £20,000–£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold range that NICE has been using, albeit derived from consensus, has gained acceptance as reflective of the opportunity cost of health care expenditure in the UK NHS. The use of a cost-effectiveness threshold range by NICE has given the appraisal committees discretion to reflect and incorporate benefits beyond those captured in the ICER.</p>
<p>A significant number of other methodological topics have arisen over NICE’s 13 years of appraising new technologies. These include the extent and robustness of subgroup analysis, QALY weighting, discounting, adjusting for crossover, surrogate outcomes, costing issues, comparing treatment sequences rather than single interventions, patient experience evidence, and when to make “only in research” recommendations. All these areas have been explored in the current review of NICE’s methods guide.</p>
<p>In addition, the UK coalition government’s health reforms included proposals for changing the scope of NICE technology appraisals because of its relationship to value-based pricing. Key methodological elements include proposals for valuing nonhealth elements such as productivity and innovation and varying the valuations of impact of technologies on health status according to burden of disease. The degree to which these will affect the core NICE methodological approach to technology appraisals is unclear, but undoubtedly these reforms will require further discussion and their implementation will not be without controversy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>NICE’s appetite for the use of HTA and health economics is voracious and undiminished. NICE sits at the interface of a policy environment where everything is urgent and consensus between policy makers and stakeholders is sometimes difficult to attain. Making robust decisions based on scientific principles that are also sensitive to the policy environment requires the use of sound scientific methods pragmatically applied. NICE sets the benchmark for the use of HTA placed at the center of a transparent and consultative decision-making process. What NICE and the academic world need to continue is their vigorous and dynamic dialogue. In doing so, NICE needs to be influenced by methodological advances, but it also needs to contribute to the methods agenda if the research that stems from it is to be maximally relevant in a policy context.</p>
