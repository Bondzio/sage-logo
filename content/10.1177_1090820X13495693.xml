<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I was extremely excited to be invited to review <italic>Plastic Surgery: Volume 1: Principles</italic>, the first volume from what I consider to be the authoritative series of plastic surgery textbooks published over the past 48 years. This series has evolved over the years into the current 6-volume integrated set, edited by Dr Peter Neligan. In fact, I was asked only to review Volume 1 and found it difficult to limit my comments to only that volume, but I would like to preface this review with a few comments about the entire series. It delves into almost every aspect of plastic surgery, including precise details of many procedures along with potential risks and complications as well as patient and procedure selection tips for a variety of clinical scenarios. I believe its content is as all-inclusive and up-to-date as any plastic surgery text could be. In fact, the set actually contains much more material than just the 4500 pages of text and extends into the digital sphere with supplemental online features. The entire series includes high-quality photographs, diagrams, algorithms, flowcharts, and the supplemental online video content, which most surgeons would find useful regardless of the number of years they have been in practice. Volume 1 provides a broad overview of the entire field of plastic surgery—with emphasis on current concepts, classifications, research, history, and evolution within subspecialty areas—which allows the other volumes to delve into the details of specific surgical procedures.</p>

<title>Strengths</title>
<p><italic>Volume 1: Principles</italic>, edited by Dr Geoffrey Gurtner, consists of 874 pages separated into 36 chapters. As mentioned above, most of the references and additional text content can be found online (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ExpertConsult.com">www.ExpertConsult.com</ext-link>). Online supplemental content not only increases the size of this volume but allows readers to access this information anywhere in the world from a computer, smartphone, or tablet.</p>
<p>I especially liked the fact that each chapter began with a synopsis summarizing key points in the chapter, followed by a slightly lengthier introduction outlining the contents. I found all of the information to be current, especially the 3 chapters on wound healing and scar formation/prevention. These chapters included the latest knowledge on the complicated interaction of growth factors, immune modulators, and the role of microRNA, which has changed significantly since the previous edition of this series was published. The 3 chapters on skin lesions were separated into vascular anomalies, benign and nonmelanocytic tumors, and melanoma, with minimal overlap of material among the chapters. The melanoma chapter was particularly well written and comprehensively covered the topic, including nonsurgical aspects of management and treatment algorithms. Other chapters included burgeoning fields such as robotics, evidence-based medicine, and stem cell manipulation in tissue engineering. These chapters served as short, concise summaries of key concepts.</p>

<title>Weaknesses</title>
<p>This volume was not designed as a standalone text, and none of the chapters in this particular volume featured supplemental video content (although other volumes do, and that is a strength of the overall series). While I thought the chapters on psychological issues, business aspects of plastic surgery, and ethics in plastic surgery featured a good sampling of key concepts, they lacked depth. Unlike many other chapters in Volume 1, for which the information was expanded upon in the other 5 volumes, the reader would need to find some of the many referenced texts in these chapters for additional information and detail on these subjects. I found certain chapters to be lacking in up-to-date information, including the chapter on local anesthesia in plastic surgery. This chapter failed to mention the latest in liposome technology to prolong local anesthetic action and also the use of intravenous lipids for treating lidocaine toxicity. The chapter on implants and biomaterials was informative but lacked depth and detail on some of the current issues regarding skin substitutes and acellular tissue matrices.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, even though this volume was not designed as a standalone text, it contains such a plethora of valuable information for plastic surgeons of all experience levels that I would recommend the volume as an excellent reference. The true strength of the first volume is when it acts as a prelude to the other volumes of this 6-volume set, utilizing the comprehensive and concisely written 36 chapters to provide the foundation of information for the other 5 volumes. I would rate this individual volume a 4.5 but a 5 if considered as part of the larger series.</p>
