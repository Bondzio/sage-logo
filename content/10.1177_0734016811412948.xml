<p>Ethics and philosophy merge to form the confluence where Michael Skerker tackles the issue of interviewing and interrogation and the ethics surrounding the activity. Most academic personnel know from firsthand experience that the media play host to a myriad of issues, the least of which surround contemporary crime dramas where the general public is deluged with “ripped from the headlines” fodder for television. These fictional accounts as they are described do little to expand our knowledge regarding the practice of either interviewing generally, or interrogation specifically. Additionally, the oft-noted “war on terror” colors the discussion reproducing images from the attacks against the United States creating a bias and further convoluting the discussion.</p>
<p>The purpose of the book, <italic>An Ethics of Interrogation</italic>, is to unravel the complexities of the biases espoused either through the media and their entertainment formats and move us into an area where we can recognize those biases inherent in our own ideas of what actions we can take with regard to obtaining information, that is, interrogate. There are a numerous areas to delve into: law, philosophy, politics, theory, interviewing, interrogation, arrest, detention, right to privacy, right against self-incrimination to list a few. These are the fundamental points discussed and questions posed for those individuals and agencies required to oversee our domestic and overseas duties, rights and responsibilities and should therefore extend our understanding regarding our duties to people.</p>
<p>Skerker’s substantive questions are critical in providing the reader with a direction for his arguments. He asks, under what circumstances is a state entitled to know a person’s thoughts and how information can be procured from a person against his will in a morally upright manner? Key questions begin to break the book into salient sections while offering a roadmap of where he is going. He provides the reader with a framework for police ethics and lets us know how different rights overlap with each other. We can revisit the political philosophy of the state through an examination of the social contract tradition of liberal democratic principles and see how the government may force people to behave in certain areas. These discussions may be easier to follow if a diagram of sorts could be incorporated to allow some readers to follow, maybe in the form of a table or chart. He does a good job of describing and discussing the primary goals of the chapter content while performing a fluid transition from one topic to the next.</p>
<p>Skerker outlines the “hybrid status” of individuals caught between different types of offender in terms of their rights leaving us to consider what the condition may look like if he were to incorporate a discussion on the differences between hybrid military actions. For instance, the United States' involvement in South Korea dubbed a “conflict” or Vietnam with its “police action” and the current military actions yet to be dubbed “official” declarations of war leave us wanting for a framework relating to a discussion pertaining to the political state and its treatment of rights offenders in such a context.</p>
<p>The section on police-style interviews and interrogations seems to be recapitulated from the standpoint of the trainers advocating the Inbau and Reid manual. Granted, the spate of studies on police-style interviewing and interrogations in the United States is dismal; caution should be exercised when coming to conclusions when making determinations on who is lying. As the author notes, people who are “medicated, physically or mentally ill, or poorly educated” coupled with cultural differences could send different messages vis-à-vis, both verbal and nonverbal communication thus lending itself to wrongful confessions. This fact is an inherent component of the Reid Technique of Interviewing and Interrogation and could overemphasize what people say. Additionally, a vast majority of criminal justice professionals such as police officers, probation/parole officers, attorneys, and judges may claim to be better at catching people lying than they really are in their official roles. Finally, most training by law enforcement is conducted in very short, incremental techniques with the most notable system used in domestic law enforcement circles utilizing the Reid model leaving little room for alternatives to choose.</p>
<p>The author discusses noncoercive interrogation and states the U.S. Army and CIA manuals from 2005 are “striking for its focus on preventing abuse of detainees.” Couched in these terms, I felt I had to depart company, so to speak, with the statement because it seems it protests too much. What I mean to say is that if the focus is that we need to prevent detainee abuse, the logic premise is that abuse of detainees has, will or shall be conducted. While the military makes every attempt in making the claim and exercising the practices against abuses during interviews and interrogations we must remember that these practices are extremely fluid in nature. It is at best difficult to account for each and every circumstance while in the field but we cannot delineate with certainty where to draw the line when it comes to obtaining information. Additionally, if the lines are unclear in terms of the manual, chain of command, and the relative information, subordinate soldiers may take a specific action and run the risk of becoming ostracized from both the command staff structure. These actions are akin to a female soldier crying foul when she may accuse another soldier of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Concerning post-interrogation outcomes, he provides for three possible outcomes. First, prosecute without military gained information through information gained; second, prosecute in military tribunals without due process standards and, third; refrain from prosecution, use the information, and hold without sentencing. I would add a fourth option, which would be to hold fair, open trials. Granted, the gathering, sorting, and accretion of evidence are difficult, and trials for show tend to undercut progress of the occupied country, the nation-state cannot hold people indefinitely. Furthermore, a sticking point occurs between the linkages between civilian and military training because they are different, with these differences exacerbated in their differences in overarching goals and objectives of each “jurisdiction” with the attendant overarching difficulty in weighing, measuring, or in some other way quantifying the level of evidence and what constitutes a level of validity of that evidence in order to infringe on the area of people’s thoughts. I would argue that when the opportunity arises, the interrogator must revert to the role of protector of the person being interrogated once less harmful alternative present themselves to avoid rights violations.</p>
<p>Overall, Skerker takes on the task of tackling a hybrid of issues and does an outstanding job. The topics and materials flowed from section to section in a very logical, readable format. I did find myself asking questions in some areas, but the author was able to recover nicely and was able to answer them as I read along. He maintains that we cannot know with certainty information some people possess, which he demonstrates through his discussion on coercive techniques such as isolation or sleep deprivation that occur in clinical settings. As interrogators, we can never really know the validity, reliability, and veracity of an interrogatee information and that to advocate a system where coerced, institutionalized torturous activities occur would result in deleterious effects for governments and their respective entities in the long run.</p>
