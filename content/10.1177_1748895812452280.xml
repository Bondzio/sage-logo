<abstract>
<p>Crime prevention standards in housing have for a long time been limited to target hardening, and in that respect European Norms were developed as guidelines for ‘burglar resistant’ doors, windows and shutters (EN1630). Recent developments include a set of supplementary crime prevention standards in the building sector, which are not limited to technical products but focus on the layout and management of urban environments and their impact on public safety. This article focuses on the problem of systematic Europe-wide implementation of crime prevention standards in urban planning. The attempt to implement common guidelines for design-led crime prevention through the development of a European Norm has failed. In this article I will first introduce the system of standardization and then examine the particular European Standard for Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design (CEN/TR14383). Instead of a harmonious application of that standard in Europe, a variety of policies have been negotiated, including national standardization, consulting schemes and liaison systems based on rewards. Moreover the standard has been re-interpreted in some jurisdictions as ‘gender mainstreaming’, and it has been adopted by police to organize national training for local governments. I will present and compare examples from Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland to show the divergent ways of interpretation and practical implementation of guidelines in design-led crime prevention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Governance through standardization is a special form of policy making that can be distinguished from both authoritarian directives by law, and active democratic procedures of community involvement in decision making. In contrast, governance through standardization is neither a clear top–down policy, nor a bottom–up policy, but rather enters the political arena through the side-door via economic competition for quality standards. Governance through standardization also seeks to draw upon scientific expertise for the development of products and policies. In Europe, norms and standards are developed and published by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN - Comité Européen de Normalisation), which is a non-profit-making administrative organization set up under Belgian law in Brussels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895812452280">1</xref></sup> The development of European standards is motivated by politics <italic>and</italic> the economy. First, the Council of the European Union together with the European Parliament can give CEN a so-called ‘mandate’ to develop a quality-assurance standard to support certain EU policies and EU regulations. For example, it may be of interest to determine the quality standards for helmets if the use of helmets for cyclists were to become compulsory. Second, businesses and industries send their experts into existing CEN Technical Committees (CEN/TCs) to determine quality standards for particular industrial developments. Here, industrial developers that produce cycling helmets may have a strong interest in participating in the norm-making process to promote their products in a wider market. This combination of political and economic interest has empowered the process of standardization to become a dominant form of governance, as it provides a state-of-the-art quality assurance system to support European and national legislation in many economic sectors such as energy, environment, healthcare and mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>In most sectors standardization is dedicated to the promotion of safety and the management of risk, in particular this means risk assessment and prevention of accidents and (natural) disasters. Similarly, the recent ‘preventive turn’ in criminal justice policy during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895812452280">Edwards and Hughes, 2009</xref>), that is, the transformation from a welfare model of punishment to a pragmatic model of risk management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895812452280">Garland, 2001</xref>), has encouraged an extension of conventional security standards in the building sector. In addition to target hardening techniques like mechanical locks, electronic CCTV and alarm systems, strategies to change the physical and social environment in order to reduce the risk of crime were introduced. Criminologists in Europe started to focus on urban planning, environmental design and social area management to tackle the increasing number of crimes in urban areas. Inspired by critical debates in the United States on urban planning and architectural design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895812452280">Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895812452280">Jacobs, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895812452280">Jeffery, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812452280">Newman, 1972</xref>) a small number of security consultants – architects, urban planners, police and public administrators – gathered in 1995 to work on a ‘European Standard for Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design’.</p>
<p>A recent comprehensive research project has reviewed the work of these consultants and the operation of the CEN Technical Committee TC325 more generally. The study sought to identify the aims and backgrounds of the consultants themselves, while also studying the management, development and implementation of the European Standards on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design. The research examined extensive documentation produced by the Committee (including its resolutions, voting patterns and administrative structures and procedures) but also involved researchers observing and participating in TC325 meetings, interviewing former and current convenors of the working groups, and participating in police training programmes provided for Crime Prevention Design Advisers at the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) in the UK. It is through this detailed account of the processes (and obstacles) through which these standards were actually implemented around Europe that this article will offer insight into their active and negotiated character. In brief, European Standards did not provide a framework that would determine local practice in a ‘top–down’ way, rather it provided a framework against which different nations could negotiate their own crime prevention and urban planning standards in particular and distinctive ways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1748895812452280">
<title>The European Standard on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design</title>
<p>The development of a ‘European Standard on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design’ was encouraged by two political events: first, in February 1997 the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895812452280">2</xref></sup> held an international conference in the City of Erfurt (GER) on ‘Crime and Urban Insecurity in Europe’. The final declaration stated that ‘crime, fear of crime and urban insecurity in Europe are major problems affecting the public’, and that ‘finding satisfactory solutions for them is one of the main keys to civic peace and stability’. The declaration further recommended that ‘local and regional authorities in Europe develop integrated crime reduction action plans, with continuing public involvement, in which crime reduction is included as a policy in all aspects of the responsibilities of local authorities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748895812452280">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, in 2001 the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the European Union politically underlined the conclusions of an EU-experts conference ‘Towards a knowledge-based strategy to prevent crime’ (Sundsvall, Sweden, 21–23 February 2001). This conference concluded that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), or Designing out Crime (DOC), has proven to be a useful, effective, very concrete and feasible strategy to prevent crime and feelings of insecurity, integrated in a multidisciplinary approach. Best practices regarding CPTED/DOC should be collected, evaluated and made accessible for stakeholders. This process should utilise a common framework of concepts and processes, and transferable principles should be identified.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The work in TC325 at CEN was launched by experts in the Netherlands, the UK and Denmark, who had personal contact with proponents of CPTED principles in the United States. Rather than reforming individuals and their criminal dispositions, CPTED aims to modify the physical and social situations where crime may occur. It is argued that ‘the proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in the fear and incidence of crime and to an improvement in the quality of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895812452280">Crowe, 2000</xref>: 46).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748895812452280">4</xref></sup> Experts in the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) were convinced that the development of a European Norm (EN) was the most promising way to promote and implement CPTED Europe-wide, as this included all European countries in the development and implementation of guidelines on a voluntary basis. It was hoped that crime prevention would finally become a state-of-the-art feature for quality assurance in the building industry in the same way as fire protection, energy efficiency and environmental protection are considered as self-evident requirements for planners and builders. Moreover, a harmonized standard for design-led crime prevention that is valid in all European countries should facilitate international contracts in the building sector and avoid the development of separate regulations in the various European building laws.</p>
<p>Also, throughout the development of the European Standard the European experts were inspired by a growing number of manuals and guidelines that were developed in countries around the world to support officials in safety audits, urban planning and spatial management: the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895812452280">National Crime Prevention Council in Washington, DC (1998)</xref> published <italic>Creating a Blueprint for Community Safety</italic>; the Canadian Department of Justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895812452280">Justice Canada, 1996</xref>) distributed <italic>Building a Safer Canada: A Community-Based Crime Prevention Manual</italic>; the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895812452280">National Crime Prevention Council in Singapore (2003)</xref> circulated <italic>The Crime Prevention through Environmental Design Guidebook</italic>; the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895812452280">National Crime Prevention Centre in South Africa (2000)</xref> published <italic>Making South Africa Safe: A Manual for Community Based Crime Prevention</italic>; the Queensland government in Australia issued booklets on CPTED practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895812452280">State of Queensland, 2007</xref>); and the International Security Management and Crime Prevention Institute ISMCPI (based in Australia and Canada) was running training courses around the world that were based on CPTED-principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748895812452280">5</xref></sup> These manuals served as inspirations and as role models for the European work on standardization for design-led crime prevention.</p>
<p>The European Standard for Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design (CEN/TR14383) was developed between 1995 and 2007 as a manual for policy makers and practitioners in Europe who are concerned with crime prevention in terms of architectural design and urban management. Since its launch in 1995 the Technical Committee TC325 has produced a series of standards in five Working Groups on several forms of urban environment. Until today only the ‘definitions and specific terms’ (part 1) are stipulated in a European Norm (EN14383-1, 2006), other parts of the standard specify guidelines for urban planning (part 2), dwellings (part 3) and shops and offices (part 4). They are published as Technical Reports (TR) and need to be reviewed by experts in National Institutes for Standardization. In addition, similar guidelines for security of petrol stations (part 5), safety in schools (part 6) and in public transport facilities (part 7), and guidelines for the ‘protection of buildings and sites against criminal attacks with vehicles’ (part 8) are currently in progress.</p>
<p>Part 2 of this set of European Standards focuses on urban planning and represents the most comprehensive document in that series. Here, urban planning and design guidelines are given for specific <italic>types of environments</italic> (refurbishments and new housing projects), <italic>security issues</italic> (violence, vandalism, burglary, social disorder, fear of crime) and a number of <italic>potential stakeholders</italic> who can be involved in the process (economy, industry, police, social work, planning authorities, etc.). For example, it was considered that dark and isolated walkways, parks or passages can generate fear and create opportunities for robbery and theft, whereas lively, multi-functional and well-lit spaces with clear visibility can help prevent crime and create environments where people feel safe. The support for orientation in public space, having a good overview, visibility, lighting, accessibility, taking responsibility and good maintenance of the environment are only some of the principles that should guide planning and design practice in all planning authorities in Europe. This concept of crime prevention also intends to support ‘natural control’ of social norms of behaviour through informal guardians such as newspaper vendors, cleaning and maintenance staff and a number of urban design and spatial management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895812452280">Wortley and Mazerolle, 2008</xref>). Moreover, it is suggested that a certain managerial procedure should be followed in which, at first, a thorough crime review in existing neighbourhoods or a crime assessment for new housing projects should be conducted, before certain design- and management strategies are discussed and implemented in a local multi-agency network.</p>

<title>The European Standard and Its Implementation Failure</title>
<p>Despite serious efforts by experts in the European Committee for Standardization, to date there has been no common European implementation strategy for the Standard CEN/TR14383-2 on design-led crime prevention. In part this may be attributed to the fact that the European Standard on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design has not reached the status of a European Norm (EN), which would mean a strong recommendation as state-of-the-art for all national building laws, equivalent to norms for fire protection or energy saving technologies. In the end the consultants in TC325 published the guidelines in form of a Technical Report (TR), which merely counts as an informal recommendation for interested administrations. There is no formal obligation for national policy makers to demand that developers consider this European Standard in urban planning projects. This has severe consequences for implementation. Not one planning project in the building industry could be found which had explicitly applied the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2 as a planning guideline over the past decade in Europe since publication of the document. In contrast to other topics like energy saving, climate protection and sustainability, crime prevention through environmental design has not succeeded in gaining a lasting place in the building professions. According to national experts selected for interviews, no references to the concept CPTED or the European Standard CEN/TR14383 can be found in architectural biddings or master-plans for urban development in Europe.</p>
<p>Instead of a common European way, some national administrations have developed separate strategies of implementation that better fit their administrative, economic, social, political and geographic conditions. The research demonstrated that several national standards have been developed, and training schemes were established in national police forces (UK, Poland, the Netherlands, France). But most countries in Europe lack expertise in the field of design-led crime prevention and the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2 is mostly ignored. The following brief description of national examples will demonstrate how national authorities deviate from the European Standard and what administrative and political concepts they apply instead.</p>
<p>Some countries in Europe have developed their own ways to integrate security issues in the building and planning professions, in other countries CPTED principles have been ignored altogether. Two categories of countries were identified in an in-depth analysis: ‘pioneer countries’ and ‘follower countries’. Denmark, England and the Netherlands count as ‘CPTED-pioneers’ in Europe, not only because experts from these countries started the development of a European Standard, but also because in these countries some fundamental work had been accomplished prior to the European collaboration in the framework of the European Committee for Standardization. ‘Follower countries’ are those that have developed expertise and respective practice in design-led crime prevention later in the process of standardization. Austria and Poland will be presented below, although other countries like Switzerland, Italy, France, Estonia, Spain and Belgium also show some reference to CPTED principles.</p>
<p>The following description will highlight the fragmentation of implementation policies to demonstrate the diversity in administrative settings and differences in interpretation of design-led crime prevention strategies in Europe. I will first describe the administrative conditions for the work on design-led crime prevention for each country represented in the study, and then discuss the relationship to the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2 and to the particular crime prevention concept of CPTED. We will see that countries in Europe have established very different administrative systems for security issues in urban planning with some deviations from the CPTED principles.</p>

<title>Denmark: Soft Target Hardening</title>
<p>Set up in 1971 as an independent institution under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice the Danish Crime Prevention Council is composed of 42 private and public member organizations representing many different trades and professions:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Danish Crime Prevention Council has a central advisory and consultative role in society as a whole. On request and/or based on trends or acute problems, the Council offers advice and guidance to professionals as well as to the general public. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812452280">Danish Crime Prevention Council, 2002</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Altogether five Standing Committees and a think-tank form the core of the Council’s work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748895812452280">6</xref></sup> The Committee for Crime Prevention by Planning Residential Environments (MPU) is one of the five committees. This committee has recognized a connection between the physical environment in the local area and factors that can lead to criminal behaviour as an important principle in their work towards the reduction of crime by urban planning and building design. Experts in that committee are dedicated to developing and supporting the application of methods and initiatives to improve the physical, cultural and social conditions in housing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812452280">Danish Crime Prevention Council, 2002</xref>: 9). In total 16 organizations are represented in this committee, including representatives from local government, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, tenants associations, the National Federation of Social Educators, engineers, town planners, architects, the Danish Youth Forum, the Danish Criminal Police Association, the University of Copenhagen and others.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Danish Crime Prevention Council and experts from the Federation of Danish Architects participated in the work of the Technical Committee CEN/TC325 from the beginning (1995) and provided an English translation of two Danish Standards: the documents on ‘Technical prevention of violence and vandalism’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>) and the Code of Practice for ‘Technical prevention against burglar attack’ (DS 471; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1994</xref>) were already published in Denmark before the work in the European Technical Committee in CEN had started, and both Danish Standards served as a basis for the development of a European Standard. The work on these two documents was launched by the Danish Society of Engineers. Therefore, the Danish Standards on crime prevention originated in the promotion of security technology but included a number of social and environmental design features. This included accessibility to the area, traffic density at night, attraction to different user-groups, as well as residents’ needs for privacy or desires for community, and a clear division into private, semi-private and public space. Very early in the Danish process of standardization the concept of crime prevention shifted from technical target hardening towards psychologically and socially effective design-strategies.</p>
<p>In particular, the Danish Standard on ‘Technical prevention of violence and vandalism’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>) was developed between 1986 and 1991 in a working committee composed mainly of members of the Federation of Danish Architects. This working committee prepared a standard which comprises:
<disp-quote>
<p>the functional demands, relevant to the prevention of vandalism and other destructive behaviour, for the technical design of buildings and building parts, their arrangement and use as well as their location in relation to each other, the environment and their fitting into larger areas and districts. (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The main purpose of this recommendation was to ‘give planners and project designers/managers a better chance of shaping the physical environment so as to minimize violence and vandalism’ (1991: 9). It was widely acknowledged that violence and vandalism, besides their material costs and human harm, have consequences in producing deep-seated fear and insecurity which indirectly tend to change the behaviour of local citizens in terms of isolation or even migration. Therefore, architects and planners were required to consider and follow the guidelines in these documents in their daily routine of planning and design.</p>
<p>The Danish Standards contain a number of references to the US-American CPTED concept: a certain level of crowding during day and night time, integration of traffic systems and the provision of common areas for social contacts remind us of writings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895812452280">Jane Jacobs (1961)</xref>. The principle of good maintenance and above all ‘a clear demarcation between different kinds of areas and buildings in our urban districts and housing areas to increase the attachment and to increase the sense of individual responsibility’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>: 15) are both component parts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812452280">Oscar Newman’s (1972)</xref> concept of territoriality. Also, the call for ‘a visually distinctive character of buildings … to strengthen recognition and attachment and to reduce anonymity’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>: 18) refers to Newman’s concept of ‘image’. The call for ‘rapid repair of any damage’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>: 15) refers to the Broken Windows Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895812452280">Wilson and Kelling, 1982</xref>). The possibilities for participation and for residents to have an influence on the appearance and use of the physical environment remind us of the more recent CTPED literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895812452280">Saville and Cleveland, 2008</xref>). In these ways the Danish Standards on ‘Technical prevention of violence and vandalism’ (DS/R470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1991</xref>) and the Code of Practice for ‘Technical prevention against burglar attack’ (DS 471; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895812452280">Dansk Ingeniorforening, 1994</xref>) promoted and introduced many CPTED principles to the European Standard CEN/TR14383.</p>
<p>Denmark has given clear priority to ‘soft measures’ such as stressing mixed functions in public space, supporting bustling streets, having good overviews of car parks and so on. Technical target hardening should only be applied as a last resort in special cases. However, this clear hierarchy in the Danish Standard that places social prevention and ‘soft target hardening’ first, could not be exported to the European Standard. The ideas have been adopted, but are regarded as equal to other crime prevention measures such as formal surveillance by the police and the use of technology for target hardening. The European Standard provides a ‘tool-box’ for planners to select ‘tools’ for crime prevention in urban planning but rejects a clear normative recommendation for social intervention.</p>

<sec id="section5-1748895812452280">
<title>United Kingdom: ‘Police Architectural Liaison Officers’ and ‘Crime Prevention Design Advisers’</title>
<p>In contrast to the Danish example, where CPTED principles were introduced and pushed by the building industry, the particular approach towards crime prevention through urban planning and building design in the UK was born out of criminal justice politics. The UK is probably the country with the longest and most profound history in crime prevention and criminological research in Europe. However, in contrast to the Danish example, where design-led crime prevention was an offspring of engineering and planning departments in the Danish Crime Prevention Council, the growth of crime prevention policies, and academic research and theorizing in Britain was driven by the Home Office, the police and academic criminological research at universities. The UK has had a long experimental phase starting in the mid-1980s when various politically driven and academically assessed crime prevention initiatives such as the ‘Five Towns Initiative’, the ‘Safer Cities Programme’ and the ‘Crime Reduction Programme’ were tested as to their suitability for translation into large-scale strategies and programmes. In this climate of experimenting with strategies and programmes for crime prevention in local developments one major scheme, Secured by Design, has been established as the major national police initiative that has prevailed until today. Founded in 1989, Secured by Design (SBD) is a police initiative which employs a group of police specialists – Architectural Liaison Officers and Crime Prevention Design Advisers – who are trained to consult local authorities, architects and the construction industry. Also, Secured by Design is a unified certification scheme for housing developments that follow the recommendations given by these expert police officers. The scheme started with 2500 registered new homes in south-east England in 1990, and is currently a requirement in many building tenders. While social housing developers have generally adopted Secured by Design standards, there have also been significant difficulties in getting private developers to do so.</p>
<p>Today the principles of CPTED are taught as a major component in professional police training for crime prevention, in particular in regular ‘Designing out Crime’ courses provided by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA). Design-led crime prevention is carefully integrated in the policies for sustainability in urban planning. References are made to relevant consultation documents such as Planning Policy Statements and dedicated manuals and handbooks for the consideration of security issues in the planning process, published by the Home Office and other authorities (Safer Places, Code for Sustainable Homes, etc.). The training for Crime Prevention Design Advisers is dedicated to police officers who take special responsibility for liaison with architects and planners about future planning projects or to join local crime prevention partnerships. Their expertise and knowledge about modus operandi can be a valuable contribution to community safety. The particular training on ‘Designing out Crime’ is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895812452280">Oscar Newman’s (1996)</xref> ‘defensible space principles’, which stress the effects that housing designs have on residents’ capacities to control areas around their homes. The training provides officers with skills to recognize planning mistakes that may facilitate opportunities for criminal offences and social disorder.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the recent financial stringency in the UK and the continual reorganization of police training has meant both severe loss of experienced Crime Prevention Design Advisers from police forces and limited means of maintaining the knowledge pool among such practitioners as remain. Likewise the current UK administration’s major revision of the planning system in line with a policy of localism is certain to alter radically the operating context for police CPTED work.</p>
<p>However, experience with guidelines that were developed for the Secured by Design scheme was also valuable during the development of the European Standard in the Technical Committee TC325 in CEN. Secured by Design is applied as a national quality assurance scheme for design-led crime prevention, which clashes with the European Standard on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Design CEN/TR14383. In fact, the British Standardization Institute (BSI), which after years of active involvement and substantial contribution to the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2, abstained from voting in 2007 and instead sent the following comment: ‘Planning Policy Statements, which are specific and applicable to the UK, and prepared by UK Government, apply. These are more relevant and focused at UK needs than the prCEN/TR14383, which may be more applicable to other countries.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748895812452280">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Netherlands: Certificates for ‘Secure Housing’</title>
<p>Another CPTED reward scheme in architecture and urban planning, that matches the British Secured by Design scheme, has been developed in the Netherlands by security consultants. The Dutch ‘Police Label Secure Housing’ started in 1994 and was introduced nationwide in 1996. In 1998 the experimental period was finished and the Police Label became an official national standard. Although the development of the Dutch Police Label followed the British model Secured by Design, there are some striking differences both in conceptual and administrative terms.</p>
<p>The Dutch Police Label Secure Housing was initiated by the governmental policy plan ‘Society and Crime’, issued in 1985, which gave three directions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895812452280">Van Soomeren and Woldendorp, 1996</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-1748895812452280" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>modifying the physical design of urban environments to ensure that surveillance of potential offenders is facilitated and opportunities for crime are reduced;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>re-introducing in all vulnerable environments (e.g. shopping malls, public transport and high rise buildings), persons who, as part of their job, exercise surveillance (shop assistants, train and bus conductors, janitors, park wardens and others);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>strengthening the bond between the younger generation and society, particularly through the family, the school, leisure activities and employment.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These directives initiated the study of the British model Secured by Design and the further elaboration of an own Police Label. The Dutch proposal followed the British model in its aim to improve communication between housing associations (developers), architects and planners, and the police. Through an introduction of CPTED principles, policing strategies were to turn away from repressive action by the police and individual target hardening of home owners in Dutch towns and cities.</p>
<p>In 1998 the Dutch Home Office decided that the Police Label Secure Housing was sufficiently developed for use by all local authorities, who now must co-operate with Architectural Police Liaison Officers. The Dutch government adopted the Police Label Secure Housing in its planning policy guidelines in 2004, which meant that local government authorities became responsible for issuing the certification for developers who complied with the guidelines. From that time onwards, building under the Police Label Regulation became part of the Dutch Building Regulations, linking the Police Label Secure Housing to the building law. To date, more than 1000 new estates have been awarded a Police Label Secure Housing.</p>
<p>One of the most important features that distinguishes the Dutch model from the British Police Label is the more explicit and wider scope of the former. Using Christopher Alexander’s ‘Pattern Language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895812452280">Alexander et al., 1977</xref>) the Dutch model focuses on urban planning and landscaping, whereas the British model looks at details in the building construction and immediate surroundings of an object. The Dutch Police Label Secure Housing is constructed as a manual of 55 patterns of design elements arranged from large to small-scale levels. In expert interviews the metaphor of a ‘parachute jump’ was used to explain the concept: in the beginning one has a good overview of the area; later more and more details appear. In the manual security patterns are distinguished as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-1748895812452280" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>urban planning and design (size of the district, density, height and scale, access to the district by car and bicycle, etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>public areas (public lighting, open air parking, private garages, playing facilities, tunnels and subways, bus stops, rear passages, including neighbourhood management, maintenance, supervision, etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>layout (back yards, rear paths etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>buildings (estates, semi-detached houses, layout of single-family terraced houses, interior courtyards, enclosed squares, etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>dwellings (orientation of living rooms, low roofs, main entrance, target hardening, etc.).</p></list-item></list>
<p>While ‘parachute jumping’, police officers (Architectural Liaison Officers) can use the ‘Secure Housing Label manual’ as a safety device that forces them to open their parachutes at the earliest moment possible. Acting too late – for example only checking target hardening of the houses – makes it impossible to gather enough points to award the police label, because in descending through the five levels and 55 patterns, each pattern has to be checked (okay: 1 point; not okay: 0 points). Having landed on the ground, a minimum number of points need to be scored.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Dutch standard for design-led crime prevention shows a broader theoretical scope than the British model. It is not limited to the original ‘Defensible Space’ concept by Oscar Newman (territoriality, natural surveillance, boundary definition, image and milieu) and therefore is compatible with other concepts and measures proposed in CPTED such as maintenance, street neighbourhood, community involvement, precipitators of crime (noise, smell, provocation) and management tasks in the whole district or town.</p>

<title>Austria: ‘Gender Mainstreaming’</title>
<p>In 1992 the Vienna City Council established the ‘Frauenbüro’, the ‘Municipal Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’. In 1998 this department started to focus on the realization of women’s interests in the planning process. Since then the office has defined its mission as being to guarantee that new housing projects meet particularly women’s requirements for a feeling of safety in public and semi-public space. It is assumed that in everyday life women are likely to be exposed to situations that cause insecurity and an intrusion of privacy, which lead to the need for appropriate planning and building standards. The booklet ‘Richtlinien für eine Sichere Stadt (Guidelines for a safe city)’ was developed in 1995 on the grounds of CPTED principles in a feminist perspective and intends to inform builders, architects and the housing associations throughout the planning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895812452280">Stummvoll, 2004</xref>). The core issues for designing buildings and public space are defined in the ‘Guidelines for a safe city’: orientation; good overview; visibility; lighting; accessibility; vibrant urban environment; and multiple social functions, responsibility, avoiding conflicts and ensuring maintenance. These issues were translated into the concept of Gender Mainstreaming, without any explicit reference to the original CPTED concept of crime prevention through environmental design. In fact, crime prevention is only implicitly considered, which seems to reflect the general moderate concern about crime in the Austrian society. For example, terms like crime, crime prevention, security, policing or safety management are not mentioned in the current version of the Urban Development Plan (Stadtentwicklungsplan STEP). Most recent administrative re-structuration within the Vienna City Council meant the closure of the ‘Department for the Promotion and Coordination of Women’s Affairs’. However, the respective experts from that department continue their consulting jobs in various planning councils and juries for urban planning and housing in the city of Vienna.</p>
<p>Gender Mainstreaming principles enter the urban development process in various ways and on several stages: on the level of urban development as well as on the level of single architectural projects.</p>
<list id="list3-1748895812452280" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Urban Development Plan from 2005 is the highest and most general document for urban design and the major plan for long-term urban development in the city of Vienna. It contains Gender Mainstreaming, as one of five principles beside ‘quality of life’, ‘sustainability’, ‘participation’ and ‘diversity’. Gender specific perceptions, living conditions and demands shall be considered in all planning and decision-making processes in order to prevent discrimination and to foster equality (STEP 05, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812452280">Vienna City Council, 2005</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>However, the team which established the Urban Development Plan was primarily constituted of administrative officers at the planning department in the Vienna City Council with support from the ‘Austrian Institute for Regional Studies and Spatial Planning’ and a private institute concerned with planning and communication (‘PlanSinn’). No representatives of the police or crime science (crime prevention, crime mapping, criminology) were considered as external advisers for public safety. Consequently, security and crime were not relevant topics for the future urban development process. Instead, Gender Mainstreaming was defined as a comprehensive concept of urban safety as an important pillar in the Urban Development Plan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Experts from the former ‘Municipal Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’ are still represented as advisers in selected local projects for the establishment of master-plans from the very beginning. These efforts to integrate Gender Mainstreaming on the level of master-plans of city development is fairly new as for a long time the ‘Municipal Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’ was restricted to conducting reviews of single housing projects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One specific feature of all housing policies in the country is the possibility of applying for governmental subsidy for the erection and reconstruction of houses, apartments and homes according to the law (e.g. Wiener Wohnbauförderungs- und Wohnhaussanierungsgesetz – WWFSG 1989). This opportunity is used extensively by builders, housing associations, private developers and home owners, and it presents the third opportunity to examine new housing developments for their compatibility with Gender Mainstreaming principles. This process of examination for governmental subsidy can be described as a comprehensive check as it involves the participation of several magistrates that represent the department of housing law (MA 50), the department of urban design (MA 19), the department of building inspection (MA 37), the department of designation of urban areas (MA 21), the department of real estate management (MA 69), the department of urban renewal (MA 25) and finally experts from the former ‘Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’ (MA 57). The experts from the former ‘Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’ are also represented in the advisory board for housing and in the jury with the right of rejection.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The Department for Urban Planning in the Vienna City Council does not get informed by the police and has no access to respective data on crime hot-spots or other security problems. They focus primarily on aspects of social work and conflict resolution in public parks and urban places. Empirical research on crime hot-spots or crime prevention is rarely requested.</p>
<p>At the time when the ‘Department for the Promotion and Co-ordination of Women’s Affairs’ was established and most active, experts also participated in the European Committee for the development of the respective European Standard. Since the closure of the office, however, Austrian experts have merely taken the position as silent observers to the European standardization process. The European Standard CEN/TR14383-2 is not recognized or applied, neither in the Austrian planning authorities nor in the building industry. The police only very recently showed an interest in the guidelines.</p>

<title>Poland: Starting with CPTED Training</title>
<p>In the year 2000 the vice-chancellor at the National Police College in the town of Szczytno participated in a European conference on Security at the Jagellonian University in Cracow, where a representative from the Dutch police spoke about CPTED and crime prevention through urban design. Subsequent to that conference a security project was set up with support from the European Commission at the Police Headquarters in Warsaw in co-operation with the National Police College in Szczytno, and the vice-chancellor visited colleagues in the Netherlands. This was the starting point of design-led crime prevention policies in Poland.</p>
<p>More recently, police training on design-led crime prevention was set up at the National Police College. This training was informed first by the conceptual input from other countries like the Netherlands and the UK, and second, by practical experience from implementation of the concept in local crime prevention projects. Until that time crime prevention in Poland was understood only to involve the locking of doors and windows the securing of areas by access control. With the new concept the focus shifted towards aspects of psychology, sociology, environmental design and pedagogical solutions to influence deviant behaviour. This new police training was supported by the Ministry of Interior and the police headquarters, and was first introduced in 2004. In a test period training was provided as a three-day course to representatives of the local committee for public security situated in each Poviat (smaller political districts within regional districts). In the first conception representatives for the local government in the Poviat and the representative of the local police were taught at the National Police College in Szczytno. Later it was also directed towards lower local government authorities, and today the training is given to small groups of police and local government officers in all regions in Poland. Between January and June 2010 a team of experts consisting of five officers from the National Police College Szczytno travelled to different cities in Poland to provide CPTED training to a number of officers in the police and in local planning departments.</p>
<p>However, the European Standard on Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design (CEN/TR14383) is not known to Polish police, although at first it may seem that the training concept clearly follows its principles. The police have learned about CPTED principles, but an introduction to national building standards has not yet been accomplished. Security standards are still limited to technical standards for the building structure and fire protection. This once again shows the difficulties of establishing in practice the nexus between policing and urban planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1748895812452280">
<title>One Concept – Different Practice</title>
<p>Taken together, design-led crime prevention is followed in a minority of countries in Europe. Denmark, the UK and the Netherlands have been identified as ‘pioneer countries’ who took the lead in efforts for standardization of CPTED principles, whereas Austria and Poland (and other countries) count as ‘follower countries’ in the process. Although experts in these countries are familiar with CPTED principles and although they have been dedicated to a process of European harmonization in practice, we find very different circumstances in terms of (1) initiators of the process on a national level, (2) concepts of implementation and (3) leading institutions in practice. I will compare the countries according to these aspects.</p>
<sec id="section10-1748895812452280">
<title>Initiator of design-led crime prevention</title>
<p>An initiator is an institution that first supported the idea of crime prevention through environmental design in a country. We can clearly see that in Denmark the Federation of Danish Architects co-operated with representatives from the Danish Crime Prevention Council to foster crime prevention in the building profession. In contrast, in the UK administrators in the Home Office together with local police authorities took the lead. In the Netherlands, the national police was interested in the British model and developed the concept further. In Austria administrators in the Vienna City Council with a feminist background had an interest in CPTED principles and introduced them to the planning process in terms of ‘gender mainstreaming’, without any connection to the police. In contrast to that, in Poland it was the National Police College who first learned about CPTED from colleagues in the Netherlands and the UK, but no reference is made to the European Standard in planning authorities of city councils.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1748895812452280">
<title>The concept of implementation</title>
<p>Concepts of implementation vary significantly in Europe. Denmark has introduced a set of national standards for the building professions that particularly focus on security guidelines. The UK and the Netherlands have introduced a system of advice-and-rewards for housing associations and building companies to urge them to comply with guidelines in schemes like Secured by Design (UK) and Police Label Secure Housing (NL). In Austria, ‘Guidelines for a safe city’ have been prepared with special focus on women’s needs. CPTED principles have been integrated in the wider concept of ‘gender mainstreaming’, which should be considered in all kinds of decisions in urban development. In Poland the police headquarters has collected information and experience from colleagues in the Netherlands and the UK and developed an initiative for national police training to distribute the ideas on design-led crime prevention in all police constituencies in the country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1748895812452280">
<title>Leading institution in practice</title>
<p>For CPTED to be successful, an institution is required to take control over the implementation process. In Denmark the proper adherence of national standards is examined by building inspectors at the National Crime Prevention Council. In the UK Secured by Design is a police initiative, and the local police can give the certificate to public and private housing developers for following crime prevention standards. The Police Label Secure Housing in the Netherlands was initiated by the police, but responsibility for issuing a certificate shifted to local authorities after an examination through the police. In Austria, compliance with security standards is examined by ‘gender mainstreaming’ experts in the Vienna City Council in the process of checking for financial housing subsidy. And finally, Poland does not know any form of coercive implementation of security issues in architecture, but the police are trying to pursue the principles in design-led crime prevention in their own range of responsibility.</p>

<p>In <italic>Italy and France</italic>, where experts have been involved in the more recent development of the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2, the ‘Safety Audit Framework’ (guideline in Annex D in the European Standard) has been developed into a handbook for national implementation. This handbook was developed in a consortium together with experts in France as part of another EU-project (SAFEPOLIS – funded by the European Commission, DG Freedom, Security and Justice). This handbook was produced as an explanatory document to Annex D of the Technical Report ‘Prevention of crime by urban planning’. It is promoted only on a local level by some city councils in the region Emilia Romagna, in Milan in Italy and the City of Lyon in France.</p>
<p><italic>Germany</italic> has explicitly rejected the European Standard for Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Design. Nevertheless, single pilot projects in urban planning in Lower Saxony have made references to the European Standard CEN/TR14383-2, in particular to the step-by-step process for implementation (chapter 6, pp. 22–28 in the Standard). In most other planning authorities in European cities the European Standard is unknown or plays a subordinate role both in crime prevention and urban planning politics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The world-famous normative concept of CPTED has not been applied in practice as a common European Standard. Instead of a harmonization of practices, countries with CPTED expertise and understanding in design-led crime prevention have negotiated different strategies and have gone their separate ways in implementing principles. Some of the reasons for this development have been identified:</p>
<list id="list4-1748895812452280" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The ‘pioneer countries’ with the longest tradition in CPTED (the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark) have simultaneously developed national standards and guidelines for consideration of CPTED principles. These are however considered incompatible with the European Standard in terms of systems of administration and quality assurance. This may, in part, be attributed to the fact that the European Standard has a format that is not suitable for practitioners in the building industry. It is considered to be too academic and too theoretical, i.e. focused on text rather than illustrations. Authorities in several cities have started to transform the European Standard into national guidebooks that contain many examples and photographs to illustrate the topics. For example: ‘Handboek Veilig Ontwerp en Beheer’ (2008, NL); ‘Städtebau und Kriminalprävention’ (2006, GER); ‘Sicherheit planen und gestalten’ (2004, GER); ‘Richtlinien für eine Sichere Stadt’ (1995, A); ‘Safer places’ (2004, UK); ‘Building for life: Evaluating housing proposals step-by-step’ (2009, UK); ‘Guidance on local safety audits’ (2007, CAN/F).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The European Standard on design-led crime prevention is characterized as a <italic>policy-norm</italic> and differs fundamentally from <italic>product-norms</italic> that are usually developed in the European Committee for Standardization CEN. In contrast to product norms, which are simple to install, policy norms are thought of as general directives for creative thinking in a certain direction, namely to consider issues of crime prevention and community safety in policing, architecture and urban planning. The usability of policy-norms may be a general problem in the field of standardization, which should be investigated in future research in the political sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748895812452280">8</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other than simple test norms for security products, such as alarm systems and security doors, the guidelines in this standard represent a variety of recommended ‘tools’ in one and the same document: target hardening through security technology; CCTV; extra lighting; supporting orientation; informal surveillance and a good overview; territoriality; social work; conflict resolution and community involvement. Consequently, the European Standard represents a tool-box of instruments that need specific place-sensitive selection on the basis of comprehensive local research. In contrast to technical security norms for doors and locks, the correct implementation and respective guarantee for positive effects (success) of standards for crime prevention by urban planning and building design are subject to interpretation and therefore remain a vague concept for many practitioners. The problem is that the same crime prevention measures are not always applicable or even necessary in different settings. In other words: The European Standard requires support through expert consultants to be applied in accordance with local circumstances, in terms of crime level, social structure, infrastructure, management structure and the morphology of the built environment. It is in relation to these features of local problems and existing professional practices that European Standards will be interpreted and potentially recast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This specific quality of a policy norm also entails that there is little interest from businesses. Since this standard is published as a ‘Technical Report’ and simply represents a recommendation – in contrast to European Norms (EN) – there is little demand from stakeholders like the police, developers and architects. Governance through norms and standards is usually based on hard competition for economic hegemony on the free market in the way of world-wide quality standards: a company that sets quality standards has the power to control the market. The particular standard on design-led crime prevention does not fit into that competitive economic system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The standardization CEN/TR14383 does not replace efforts of promotion for CPTED principles. If proponents of design-led crime prevention wish to see the CPTED concept in use Europe-wide, their work must not stop with the publication of the standard. They also need to promote it in a variety of professional institutions concerned with architecture and urban planning, in particular in training to the police, public administrations, social work and architecture and urban planning. Training for a better understanding of the complex crime-space-nexus has been developed by the European Forum of Urban Safety<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1748895812452280">9</xref></sup> in co-operation with several universities in Europe, but the curriculum does not consider the European Standards for Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design as a policy guideline. There is exchange of CPTED expertise in academic networks, but very little between practitioners in the police or in planning professions.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This research has made clear that the top–down approach to the development of a common European implementation strategy has failed, whereas a bottom–up approach that gives recognition to the local negotiation of practice is more promising. Such an approach would seek to raise the general awareness of CPTED standards and practices in local professions of policing and urban planning and would be sensitive to the political, administrative and wider legal contexts within the different countries of Europe. In the future proponents of CPTED will have to take the issue of negotiated implementation into account. CPTED has to allow for variety in terms of local problem definition, political economy and administrative infrastructure in urban planning and policing. Advocates of design-led crime prevention will have to follow more traditional ways of promoting CPTED on a <italic>local</italic> level through professional training of staff in the police, public administration, among architects and in the building industry. A comparative study of training activities in these countries, and the fostering of co-operation between training institutions with regard to teaching CPTED principles in Europe clearly emerge as promising ways forward.</p>
