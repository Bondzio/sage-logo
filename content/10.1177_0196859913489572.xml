<abstract>
<p>Chaz Bono’s appearance on <italic>Dancing with the Stars (DWTS)</italic> marks one of the first primetime, network appearances of a postoperative transgender person. This article deconstructs the mediated gender subjectivities of Bono as constructed by the show itself via prerecorded segments, costume and song choices, dance partner interaction, and judges’ commentaries as well as those projected by Bono during the live, unscripted portions of the show. Combining notions of the normalization of taboo sexual subjectivities through mediated contexts with lens of gender performativity, we demonstrate how transgender subjectivities are presented to a mainstream audience via such mediated choices, but also how Bono welds some agency to resist such normalization through his live performances. Bono’s appearance on DWTS stands as an important step toward acceptance of transgendered persons in mainstream society, however through a neutered, sex-free rhetoric as projected by the mediated portions of the show, his appearance is not without controversy. Additionally, we posit that Bono represents a transnormativity of a White, upper-class postoperative heterosexual male, which <italic>others</italic> all transgendered persons who fall outside of those hegemonic parallels of <italic>safe</italic> subjectivities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dancing with the Stars (DWTS) has been one of the American Broadcasting Company’s (ABC) most consistent and highest rated performers since its inception in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859913489572">The Nielsen Company, 2011</xref>). The reality competition show recruits a dozen celebrities each season from all walks of fame. These <italic>stars</italic> are each paired with a professional dancer and then compete in a 12-week dance off, with one star eliminated each week. One of the main draws of the show has been its diverse cast—mixing races and professional backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859913489572">Lloyd, 2010</xref>). Even with the show’s noted diversity of cast, the 13th season of DWTS, which aired from September until December 2011, marked the first appearance of a transgender contestant with Chaz Bono.</p>
<p>Bono is no stranger to the spotlight. Born as Chastity, the daughter of the hit pop duo Sonny and Cher, many of his formative years were spent with and captured by the media. The pull of heteronormativity was felt early when in his teens Bono came out as a lesbian and Cher kicked him out of the house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859913489572">Sachs, 2011</xref>). As these familial wounds healed, Bono reached out to the GLBTQ (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer) community, becoming a spokesperson for various gay rights organizations. His work as an activist continued as he went through the process of gender reassignment, a journey about which he produced a book and a documentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859913489572">American Broadcast Company [ABC], 2011</xref>). In 2009 Bono completed the last surgery of his gender reassignment and <italic>officially</italic> became a man.</p>
<p>Bono’s participation on DWTS represents one of the first portrayals of a transgendered person on national TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859913489572">Morrison, 2010</xref>). To our knowledge, Bono is the first transgendered person to appear on a network show, adding importance to his decision to dance with the stars. This article explores Bono’s time spent on DWTS, examining both the apparatus of the show and its framing of Bono, and Bono’s gender performances.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Mediated representation of persons who fall outside of the heteronormative binary has become more common in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saavedra, 2009</xref>); however, the portrayals of transgendered people are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859913489572">Morrison, 2010</xref>). When transgendered persons do become mediated they are done so in marginalizing ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop, 2000</xref>). Transgendered individuals fall outside a heteronormative construction; therefore marginalization becomes a tactic to restabilize gender binaries.</p>
<sec id="section3-0196859913489572">
<title>Heteronormativity—Hegemonic Masculinity</title>
<p>A heteronormative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859913489572">Warner, 1991</xref>) worldview comingles gender with biological sex and asserts heterosexual practices as ideal and natural. The assumptions of heteronormativity (gender is defined by the masculine) pervade society, and orders social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489572">Butler, 1990</xref>). Therefore, that which is not masculine is defined by the absence of masculinity. This artificial linkage between sexuality and gender creates a world where transgressive sexuality is viewed as negative and unnatural; however, homosexuality is necessary to maintain heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489572">Eguchi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A heteronormative world is a petri dish for hegemonic orderings of gender, specifically hegemonic masculinity, because it creates an artificial binary with <italic>natural</italic> and <italic>unnatural</italic> ways to be. This binary is a heirarchy of sexual practices with heterosexual males at the top: “An overt endorsement of the heterosexual model includes, by default of necessity, a covert endorsement of a patriarchal system of male domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saavedra, 2009</xref>, p. 13). In this paradigm, the key tenets of hegemonic masculinity are those that perpetuate the domination of women and subordinate masculinities. Hegemonic masculinity functions within a heteronormative world, as well as many homosocial worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913489572">Arxer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489572">Eguchi, 2009</xref>). However, even with this construction, it is clear that transgressive constructions of gender, such as transgendered subjectivities, are necessarily abject, as they are not necessary to define the norm.</p>
<p>Gender is fluid, as there are “multiple hierarchies . . . interwoven with active projects of gender construction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489572">Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>, p. 830). Even with the absence of transgendered subjectivities within normative discourse, these subjectivities are still subject to these discourses, inhabiting other, subordinate hierarchies. Bono’s participation on DWTS is an opportunity to watch what happens when an abjected subjectivity is given a powerful mediated stage to be acknowledged. As transgendered, Bono challenges heteronormativity, but as demonstrated in the analysis, he reifies much of hegemonic masculinity. However, this reification is still a challenge to the dominant form of hegemonic masculinity, which is inextricably linked to heteronormativity. With the prominance of the stage, Bono’s mediated challenge to hegemonic masculinity has “the potential to destabilize the heteronormative gaze” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489572">Cooper, 2002</xref>, p. 48). This challenge is set against another reinscriber of both hegemonic masculinity and heteronormativity: ballroom dance.</p>
<p>Dance is a cultural force that supports a heteronormative worldview, typically pairing partners of different sexes with the male as the lead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859913489572">Payne, 2009</xref>). Despite its heteronormative undertones, dance blurs the lines between acceptable and taboo behavior on the gender binary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489572">Lieb &amp; Bulman, 2009</xref>). The blurring of these lines speaks to the fluidity of gender. However, dance can also be seen as a reification of gender norms, specifically ballroom dancing where there are rigid traditions of scripted gender performances.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859913489572">Hanna (2010)</xref> posits that dance can be interpreted as a struggle between normative gender roles. However, ballroom dancing—especially as constructed by DWTS—is less transgressive. The reasons for this reification of gender roles through ballroom dancing include the social stigmatization of participation for boys, homophobic stereotypes, and heterosexist justifications for participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859913489572">Risner, 2007</xref>). DWTS perpetuates these constructions of dance, as evident by assignment of opposite gender partners, even when same gender partners are requested by the stars (e.g., Carson Kressley wanted a male partner; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859913489572">Kressley, 2011</xref>). Despite these reifications of heteronomativity, Bono’s participation in DWTS further blurs the lines of gender performance.</p>

<sec id="section4-0196859913489572">
<title>Gender Performativity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489572">Judith Butler (1990)</xref> posits that gender is habitual, reiterative performance of social scripts. And while there are multiple gender identities available to perform, those that fall outside the heteronormative frame are taboo and therefore socially punished. Transgendered people present an interesting case of gender performativity, as many of them do not wish to veer from the gender binary, instead they merely wish to change which side of the binary from which they act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859913489572">Dietert &amp; Dentice, 2009</xref>). This desire for change does not fit within the heterosexual matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859913489572">Ray, 2004</xref>); and while the taboo of homosexuality has gained some acceptance, transgendered subjectivity is still openly ridiculed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489572">Riggs &amp; Patterson, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0196859913489572">
<title>Normalizing Taboos</title>
<p>It is important to note that “gender inequality takes place not only <italic>between</italic> men and women, but also <italic>among men</italic> and <italic>among women</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913489572">Arxer, 2011</xref>, p. 392). Hybrid masculinity posits that the key feature of hegemonic masculinity is the subordination of women and that subordinate forms of masculinity are in a negotiation with the hegemonic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489572">Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>). This negotiation includes the hegemonic form co-opting elements from subordinate forms that do not threaten the subordination of women and also the subordinate forms moving toward the hegmonic form. This understanding of hegemonic power falls in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859913489572">Condit’s (1994)</xref> ideas of concordance. In this understanding there is room for multiple masculinities, including multiple hegemonic forms. With this view of hegemony, we can understand how and why “hegemonic masculinity may appropriate aspects of nonhegemonic masculinity that are consistent with the larger project of domination over women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913489572">Arxer, 2011</xref>, pp. 397-398).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489572">Shugart (2003)</xref> illustrates, the acceptance of taboos into heteronormativity is achieved through marginalization and the separation of taboo performances from their originating discourses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489572">Shugart (2003)</xref> elucidates this process through the analysis of mediated dyads of openly gay males and heterosexual females. The gay characters are cast as stand-ins for heterosexual partners. These men have heterosexual access to their counterparts and are rarely shown in sexual contact with other men. These factors make the portrayals of gay men safe because they are either unsexed or sexed in a heterosexual way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489572">Shugart, 2003</xref>). Avila-Saavedra also notes this type of normalization, with the removal of most “erotic connotations” (p. 8) from gay characters on TV and the inclusion of “traditional family values like family, monogamy and stability” (p. 8). This normalizing viewpoint is vital to understanding how it is possible for a mainstream show to star a transgendered contestant without fear of audience fallout.</p>

<sec id="section6-0196859913489572">
<title>Public Discourse and Transgendered People</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop (2000)</xref> posits that the deconstruction of gendered norms through Butler’s performative paradigm is a powerful tool, but it is also just that, a tool. The mediated portrayals and public discourse surrounding gender do not view the world in performative terms and has “so many institutions and individuals” who “work to stabilize sex, to reiterate sexual norms, rather than to encourage/explore gender fluidity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop, 2000</xref>, p. 168). His view necessitates the belief that rhetoric creates gender instead of the inverse. In the case of Bono, we examine the public discourse that seeks to stabilize sexual norms via DWTS. But, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489572">Cragin (2010)</xref> demonstrates with talk shows: “guests, fully aware that they are entering the mediated, rhetorical space, are ‘pragmatic’ or ‘tactical’ rather than naively confessional” (2010, p. 167). Therefore, Bono’s awareness of the socially constructed nature of gender allows us to examine his mediated self through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489572">Butler’s (1990)</xref> performative lens more readily. Bono understands that his appearance on DWTS is mediated, and therefore can use his time tactically. Sloop acknowledges that because transgendered people seek to reorient their birth sex to that of the opposite, they are still subjects of the gender binary, even though, as illustrated above, they are abjected by this binary. However, although transgender people, in one way, adhere to the gender binary, they are still feared by more <italic>pure</italic> followers of the binary and are subject to ridicule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489572">Riggs &amp; Patterson, 2009</xref>), negative stereotypes, and even violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop, 2000</xref>). Bono’s case adds an additional layer since DWTS does not frame him in an overtly negative way and the show is mostly live and unscripted. Furthermore, Bono has agency in his own actions and therefore controls some of how he is portrayed. Bono’s agency, then, allows him a potential platform to take gender discourse into a new, more robust, direction.</p>

<title>Artifact</title>
<p>This project uses critical, cultural deconstruction and discourse analysis via a comprehensive review of the visual and oral utterances of Bono during his full run on DWTS. Bono was a contestant until the final third of the DWTS season, offering 13 shows for analysis. The portion of each DWTS show used for analysis contains a 10 to 15 minutes feature of Bono’s dance, including a live introduction, prerecorded vignette, dance performance, judges’ live critiques, and post-performance interview. Following in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop’s (2000)</xref> footsteps to deconstruct the mediated discourse instead of comment on the subjectivities of transgendered persons, the research explores both the calculated choices of the producers (e.g. song, dress, and editing of prerecorded segments) and the live judges’ commentary. Finally, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489572">Butler’s (1990)</xref> theory of performativity, the unscripted segments of DWTS are viewed as performative opportunities to analyze Bono’s choices. The reading offered here is not purported to be the only or dominant reading or as a sort of truth, but instead, concurring with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489572">Cooper’s (2002)</xref> framing of media criticism, used to offer “a process of argumentation whereby the general goal is to convince readers that their own insights into a text may be enhanced by reading the text similarly” (p. 49). This type of reading “can be useful to uncover the normative themes of the narrative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saavedra, 2009</xref>, p. 10), functioning as an oppositional reading to uncover some of the mechanisms of normalization and power beneath the text.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<sec id="section9-0196859913489572">
<title>Mediated Chaz Bono</title>
<p>The prerecorded DWTS vignettes offer a fully produced arena for the producers’ preferred framing of Bono, while the judge’s commentary allows for a more spontaneous arena. However, since the judges are the constant, public face of the show, their spontaneity embodies the show’s goals. Additionally, the choices of songs, outfits, and guest stars for Bono’s segments offer other tools used to craft Bono’s gender subjectivity. DWTS presents Bono, and in turn transgender subjectivities, cautiously so as not to ostracize the audience. This is accomplished by offering Bono as unsexed and through a subtle transphobic lens.</p>
<sec id="section10-0196859913489572">
<title>Unsexed</title>
<p>Bono is one of the least sexed stars on DWTS; displaying a consistently platonic connection with Lacey, his dance partner. During his elimination on Episode 13, Lacey says: “When I first met Chaz, he was so sweet, and I knew I would be friends with him from that moment on.” Lacey suggests that she enjoyed him as a friend but consistently avoided mention of Bono’s looks and masculinity. This summation of their time together fits with their relationship on screen, as Lacey maintains professional distance and only engages in platonic banter. Even Carson Kressley, an openly gay contestant, is sexualized in a heteronormative way through playful teasing and innuendo. This rhetoric of the platonic is unique to Bono and is a theme throughout his airtime, with the prerecorded segments serving as reminders from DWTS that Bono is not a sexed being. Bono’s dances reinforce this unsexed narrative. At the start of the second dance, the quick step, Lacey sits in the lap of another man, making kissing faces at him (Episode 4). Bono stands off to the side prepping for the dance; neutered by DWTS.</p>
<p>This unsexed subjectivity is reified by the judges’ comments, costume selection, and song choices. Carrie Ann, the sole female judge, oftentimes flirts with male contestants. During Bono’s season she consistently makes suggestive comments to many of the other male contestants and even discloses her crush on JR Martinez. In contrast, Carrie Ann refers to Bono as if her were a small child, describing him as “cute,” “cuddly,” or “someone to root for” (Episode 8). Additionally, she gives him the nickname “Chaziboy” in the first episode; reinforcing this childlike construction. This platonic framing could be attributed to Bono’s physique, as he has a larger body that does not fit the traditionally attractive mold. However, other contestants do not fit this mold, such as Rob Kardashian, Carson Kressley, and JR Martinez, yet Carrie Ann still flirts with them. For instance, Martinez does not fit the mainstream attractive mold due to the pronounced scars on his face from an Iraqi IED (improvised explosive device) explosion. And yet, Martinez is an object of sexual desire for Carrie Ann. Carrie Ann’s construction of Bono, in contrast to the rest of the cast, is that of less than a man, more an adolescent, not fully formed, and definitely without sex.</p>
<p>The judges reinforce this unsexed narrative through the framing of Bono’s personal life. Oftentimes, the stars have family and friends in attendance, to who both the judges and hosts reference. Bono’s female fiancé came to every show and his mother, Cher, came to one (Episode 8). Cher, a star in her own right, was a main focal point during her visit. The unsexing of Bono occurs not due to the elevation of Cher, but instead through the downplaying of his fiancé’s attendance. Other contestants’ guests come into focus whether or not they are famous. For example, Nancy Grace’s family attends every show. Nancy’s family has no claim to fame, but they are still shown and talked about each episode. This allows a narrative to develop that grounds Nancy as a mother and wife. In other words, since Bono’s fiancé does not generate a heteronormative narrative like the other contestants’ families, she is downplayed. DWTS instead highlights Bono as primarily a son, and therefore juvenile and unsexed. This portrayal is interesting in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859913489572">Smith’s (2009)</xref> work demonstrating how heterosexual relations are used in other forms of media as a way to gloss over the more socially and politically charged aspects of the narrative. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saarveda’s (2009)</xref> analysis of queer representations of network television demonstrates this same type of framing, where “the assignment of gender-appropriate characteristics of husband/wife roles to gay couples . . . is a recurring motif” (p. 12). In Bono’s case, highlighting his heteronormative relationship is an opportunity to normalize him in the heteronormative paradigm—postoperative heterosexual male; however, it is also an opportunity to highlight his differences. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saavedra (2009)</xref> suggests, mainstream shows with queer characters are successful because “their discourse of gay identity is not disruptive of the heterosexual order” (p. 19). One way this is accomplished is through the presentation of queer characters in traditional, monogamous relationships where both genders (even with the absence of both sexes) are represented. This scholarship foregrounds queer subjectivities of gay and lesbian characters, omitting transgender subjectivities. Therefore, perhaps the stark difference between Bono and previously represented queer persons on TV can be attributed to Bono’s transgendered subjectivity. The absence of his fiancé, in this reading, means that Bono does not fit the typical gender roles of a man to make the man/woman dyad possible.</p>
<p>DWTS also ensures an unsexed portrayal of Bono through attire. Many of the performed dances are traditionally sexualized dances, such as the tango; as such, the costume selection can be quite revealing. The men are often shirtless or at least have part of their shirt open. However, in all six of Bono’s dances he is fully clothed. This costuming could be attributed to his weight, but when coupled with the ways in which he interacts with Lacey, it adds up to a completely sex-free projection. Furthermore, in past seasons, contestants who were like-sized to Bono wore more revealing clothing. Both comedian Jeffrey Ross (Season 7) and magician Penn Jillette (Season 6) had costumes featuring open shirts—and both men are of comparable size to Bono.</p>
<p>One final way Bono is unsexed on DWTS is through choreography choices. In four of Bono’s six dances the ending pose had him away from his partner. The most blatant example of this comes during Episode 8 when Bono portrays <italic>Rocky.</italic> For the coda of his dance, he climbs the stage steps and thrusts both hands in the air, leaving Lacey at the bottom of the steps, alone. The final week, Episode 12, of Bono’s appearance includes a <italic>Phantom of the Opera</italic> dance, where once again Bono’s partner lay sprawled on the ground away from Bono while he raises his fists in victory, a rejection of the woman and a celebration of self. The ending poses of most of the other dancers involve a hold between star and dancer which amplifies the heteronormative act of dance. Bono is unique in the separation from his partner, furthering his unsexed portrayal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0196859913489572">
<title>Transphobic</title>
<p>DWTS also projects a transphobic viewpoint of Bono. As contestants advance in the competition, they are afforded the opportunity to be trained by other professionals or celebrities during the week. Bono’s celebrity session occurs during movie week (Episode 8) and is supposed to help Bono embrace the underdog role of <italic>Rocky</italic>. His celebrity trainer was 62-year-old weight-loss guru Richard Simmons. The choice of Simmons by DWTS is transphobic because it places Bono in a position of ridicule. Simmons’s appearance has no substance and no actual utility in the training of Bono. Instead, Simmons embodies his flamboyant workout leader persona to push Bono in a staged montage mimicking the <italic>Rocky</italic> training montage. Simmons is presented as a foil to be ridiculed, mainly due to his flamboyant behavior that can be classified as buffoonery and negatively stereotyped homosexuality. This type of framing is a common media-device to regulate heteronormativity, with gender transgressors oftentimes depicted “as comic, weak, or as evil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489572">Cooper, 2002</xref>, p. 46). Essentially, Simmons is there to push Bono to act more flamboyantly; since Bono does not fit the buffoon role that would be the perfect comic foil to allow mainstream consumption of a transgendered person. Furthermore, for movie week the contestants were allowed to choose their own theme. Bono chose <italic>Rocky</italic> for its overcoming adversity themes, as well as the underlying masculinity of the movie. DWTS uses Simmons to counter these stated reasons for the choice, specifically masculinity, through ridicule; thereby twisting Bono’s intensions.</p>
<p>This transphobic lens is furthered in the judges’ commentary, specifically Bruno. Bruno is openly gay and therefore has greater ability to chastise Bono’s gender subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859913489572">Tan, 2001</xref>). While all three judges are guilty of making Bono unsexed, Bruno is the only judge to dehumanize him. In one instance Bruno compares Bono to a penguin (Episode 12). Bruno stands up from his chair, thrusts his hands to his sides, flares his fingers, and waddles, mimicking Bono’s penguin-like qualities. In a separate instance, Bruno references <italic>Star Wars</italic>, saying that Bono looks like “an Ewok dancing with Princess Leia” (Episode 12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859913489572">1</xref></sup> Through these characterizations Bruno questions whether Bono is a person, and subsequently questions the same of other transgendered people.</p>
<p>This questioning of personhood is furthered by producer chosen songs and costumes. Specifically, for Broadway week, Bono’s last week on the show, he is given <italic>The Phantom of the Opera</italic> as his theme (Episode 12). Bono plays the Phantom, complete with mask. In the play, the Phantom wears the mask to hide his deformed face. By casting Bono as deformed, DWTS furthers the rhetoric of transgendered persons as not fully human. None of the other contestants are asked to play a demeaning role, instead they are given upbeat and light fare like <italic>Luck be a Lady</italic>. Furthermore, Bono wears the mask throughout the routine, only removing it at the end of the dance, after discarding his dance partner to the floor. Metaphorically casting away the female, or perhaps embracing his identity as other. This is the last time the audience sees Bono as he is eliminated after this dance signifying that once his mask is removed and the audience sees his true identity, he is ousted from the cast of DWTS in a final denial of his acceptance.</p>

<sec id="section12-0196859913489572">
<title>Performative Chaz</title>
<p>Since DWTS has a live component, Bono has a stage to offer contrasting narratives to those being told by DWTS. As an activist, Bono is well-practiced in empowerment and makes the most of his live airtime. His performative acts have two primary functions; first, he reifies himself as hegemonically masculine and second, he acts as an advocate for transgendered people.</p>
<sec id="section13-0196859913489572">
<title>Reinforce Hegemonic Masculinity</title>
<p>In his post-dance interviews Bono is often asked how he deals with the criticism. His responses are consistent with hegemonic masculinity, as he refers to his work ethic as his way to overcome this criticism and perhaps change it in the future. Physical force/control and occupational achievement are two defining tenets of Trujillo’s conceptualization of hegemonic masculinity. The defiance shown by Bono fits the control tenet and the desire to work hard and overcome fits occupational achievement, as the stars’ occupation on DWTS is dancing.</p>
<p>Counter to the frame of Bono as unsexed, he uses his screen time to reinforce his subjectivity as hegemonically masculine. He references his female fiancé as <italic>fiancé</italic>, instead of using the progressive <italic>partner</italic>. Furthermore, Bono’s references his relationship with Lacey in hegemoniccaly masculine ways. While, as discussed earlier, Lacey clearly frames the relationship as platonic, Bono avoids such unsexed framing. Instead, he casts their relationship in traditional terms: “I think Lacey and I have amazing chemistry” (Episode 1). <italic>Chemistry</italic>, here, brings to mind sexual compatibility. Bono furthers this dynamic through the live looks-ins on practices, where Bono calls Lacey “Babe” on multiple occasions (Episode 6). The demeaning of women places Bono at the top of the Lacey/Bono dyad and therefore references the familial patriarchy tenet of hegemonic masculinity. Bono reminds the audience of the subjectivity he chooses and embodies: heterosexual, male. The use of sexist language fits with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489572">Shugart’s (2003)</xref> conclusion that “the price of privilege is sexism, a fact that necessarily defines them by their heteronormative sexual relationships with women” (p. 89). While Shugart spoke about the privilege of specifically Gay men, we extend the implications of her work to male transgendered persons. Bono has been granted privilege by being placed on a primetime, network show, and as such he must act the part. By demeaning Lacey through patriarchal discourse, Bono follows heteronormative scripts, reinscribing sexism. Furthermore, this patriarchal labeling is at the heart of hegemonic masculinity as its ends include the subordination of women.</p>
<p>Each week on DWTS contestants dance to generally recognizable music, as the selections are modern and typically have words. Four of the six songs that Bono danced to were chosen by the producers of the show. The two songs that Bono chose afford him a performative platform to further his ideal projection of himself. In Episode 8, Bono’s movie-themed song choice was the anthem of <italic>Rocky</italic>. Bono said of the choice: “It was one of the first movies that I saw that I related to being an underdog . . . I loved <italic>Rocky</italic>, I wanted to be just like him.” Despite his disadvantages, <italic>Rocky</italic> (like Bono) proves himself and therefore overcomes the expectations and obstacles thrown his way. The overt selection of <italic>Rocky’s</italic> theme music is a performative act aimed to reify Bono’s masculinity; demonstrating Bono’s belief in his power to overcome and also alluding to the frontiersmanship tenet of hegemonic masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859913489572">Trujillo, 1991</xref>). It is important to note that the songs selected by the producers had two projection goals, the positive reinforcement of Bono’s performed identity and neutering Bono. The positive songs came in Episodes 1 and 10. Episode 1’s song was <italic>Dancing in the Streets</italic> and calls attention to the risk Bono takes in just being on the show and, in turn, the risk DWTS takes in having Bono on the show. <italic>Dancing in the Streets</italic> focuses on the risk Bono takes in participating in DWTS, exemplified by the opening line “Callin’ out around the world, are you ready for a brand new beat?” The audience assumes the position as the world and Bono represents the new beat. The second positive, producer-selected song came in Episode 10 and is <italic>Get Down on It.</italic> The song implores listeners to “Get your back up off the wall”; once again emphasizing Bono’s view of himself as a fighter.</p>
<p>The songs that potentially neuter Bono come in Episodes 4 and 12. In Episode 4, the producers make Bono dance to the <italic>Mary Tyler Moore</italic> theme. This song is positive and implores the subject of the song, in this case Bono, to keep fighting because “You’re gonna make it after all.” What makes this song potentially neutering is that Bono has made a conscious choice to become a man and this song is written about a woman. Given the iconic nature of the song, and the show of its origin, it invites the audience to imagine <italic>Mary Tyler Moore</italic> and therefore associate Bono with a female. This counters the work Bono puts into performing masculinity. One line that is particularly telling says “This world is awfully big, girl this time you’re all alone.” The producers changed the word “girl” to “and,” but the change is so subtle that it took us multiple listens to comprehend it. While the producers may have viewed this song as a positive choice, one that showed their support for Bono, the public memory of the song also allows for this alternative, neutering narrative.</p>
<p>The other neutering song choice comes in Episode 12, <italic>The Phantom of the Opera</italic> theme, and was discussed above. As shown with the <italic>Rocky</italic> theme song selection above and as will be shown in the next section with the <italic>Laugh at Me</italic> selection, when Bono was given the opportunity to pick his own music, he did so with his ideal subjectivities in mind.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0196859913489572">
<title>Advocate</title>
<p>In his first vignette Bono goes into full advocate mode: “I’m Chaz Bono, I’m the first transgender star on DWTS, which means that I was born with a female body, but I have transitioned and I am now a male” (Episode 1). By plainly stating his gendered subjectivity with his first opportunity to speak, Bono confronts the audience, immediately putting them on the defensive if they feel threatened by his subjectivity. He makes no apology and instead plainly states the facts, leaving no room for argument. Additionally, he takes pride in his trailblazing, illustrating this pride by highlighting the historic nature of his appearance. By confronting the audience from the start with a finite statement that ends with no ambiguity, as he is “now a male,” Bono takes control of his time and the controversy of him appearing on the show. This control reifies Bono’s current masculine subjectivity, matching his performative gender with his exterior appearance. By fitting the heteronormative frame visually, Bono demystifies transgendered persons. This type of plain talk and reaffirmation of masculinity is constant throughout the show and serves to advocate for transgendered persons.</p>
<p>Bono’s advocacy is on full display in the first song he was allowed to choose. In Episode 6, contestants were asked to choose songs that highlighted their “Best Week.” Bono chose <italic>Laugh at Me</italic>, a song written by his father, Sonny Bono. Bono explains his choice saying: “It’s kind of like a theme song for me. Cause it’s about, if you have a problem with me, that’s your problem not mine.” This defiance in the face of criticism is apparent in both the title and the lyrics.</p>
<p>Dancing to a song of defiance and specifically calling attention to the fact that it is a “theme song” for him, Bono points the audiences’ attention to the words of the song. The opening paints a picture of an oppressed and bullied person who questions the motives of his oppressors: “Why do they try and make me run/Son of a gun/ Now what do they care/About the clothes I wear/Why do they get their kicks from making fun/.” These lines construct the culture of fear that transgender people face for just being themselves. Bono stands in for the oppressed and “they” stands in for those who seek to intimidate and marginalize trangendered persons. As the song continues it moves toward a path of defiance: “Yeah the world’s got a lot of space/ And if they don’t like my face/It ain’t me that’s going anywhere, no/So I don’t care/Then Laugh at me.” Bono embodies these lines, as he follows this path by appearing on DWTS. Instead of running from the oppressors, Bono has put himself in the spotlight, opening himself to laughter, ridicule, and hate. However, by opening himself to these attacks and not hiding from them, he assumes a position of strength. Bono has become the person who says “Laugh at me” and therefore welcomes his oppressors, mitigating their effectiveness. That Bono uses a song written by his (late) father, a known conservative Republican and performer, adds a layer of significance, in that Bono indirectly addresses the problem his father might have had with his transgendered subjectivity. Bono suggests that his father might approve of the decision, per his own words, after his death, living through song for an oppressed person just wanting acceptance. This song choice invites more conservative viewers who may identify with Sonny Bono to consider his son in a larger context via Sonny’s own words of approval of those who are different and derided.</p>
<p>As the song ends its messages morphs form one of defiance to one of acceptance and forgiving: “I have to beg to be free/Then baby laugh at me/And I’ll cry for you/And I’ll pray for you/.” Instead of reacting to his detractors with hate, Bono embraces them. On DWTS Bono is even-tempered and thankful for his supporters. This thankfulness comes through in every interview he does. Additionally, his temperament remains calm and even despite the negativity and demeaning rhetoric from the judges. Bono’s disposition embodies the “turn the other cheek” mentality of his self-proclaimed theme song. “And I’ll do all the things/That the man upstairs says to do/I’ll do them for you/I’ll do them/ I’ll do them all for you.” These lyrics further the forgiveness angle, but also add an angle of criticism. Here the song, and in turn Bono, point-out to his detractors that they embody the values that the detractors claim to stand for. From his mediated perch, Bono asks those who hate him to question from where their hate derives. At the same time he empowers the hated and implores them to be the bigger people, thereby highlighting the hypocrisy of the haters.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section16-0196859913489572">
<title>A Graceful Exit</title>
<p>After his elimination Bono was given a chance to speak about his time on DWTS. His unscripted, live speech gives valuable insight into his awareness of what his appearance means to the transgender community:
<disp-quote>
<p>I came on this show because I wanted to show America a different kind of man. And I know that if there was somebody like me on TV when I was growing up, my whole life would have been different. So I dedicate everything I did to all the people out there like me and especially the kids and teens who are struggling. You know, you can have a wonderful and great life and be successful and happy (Episode 13).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bono’s awareness of the effect his portrayal has on the public, and specifically on kids who grow up with his same or similar subjectivities, is evident in this speech. This lends evidence to the performance of gender outlined earlier in the analysis as Bono acknowledges that he is in front of an audience: “America.” Additionally, this feeds into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop’s (2000)</xref> position that subversive gender portrayals in the media inform culture and challenge the gender binary: “when a subjectivity is either not represented (symbolically annihilated) or represented negatively, those people, including adolescents, who are developing similar subjectivity are more likely to do so alone” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489572">Sloop, 2000</xref>, p. 183). By growing up with access to subversive gender performances, adolescents are forced to reconsider the traditional gender binary. While Sloop emphasizes that negative portrayals are also detrimental, the negatives outlined above are far milder than previous media portrayals, such as the news coverage of Brandon Teena that Sloop deconstructs. Therefore, despite the sometimes regulatory comments and set pieces of the gender binary to which Bono is subjected, the mere fact that he is portrayed and given access to a popular mediated stage is a positive for the acceptance of transgendered people in society. Thus, for the inherent subjective complexities, including many negative portrayals of Bono on DWTS, the ultimately flawed show offers a platform to invite rethinking stereotypes of transgendered persons.</p>

<sec id="section17-0196859913489572">
<title>Implications</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489572">Shugart (2003)</xref> concludes in her gay man/straight woman dyad article positing that the normalized version of male homosexuality being broadcast in mainstream media is one of White, middle-to-upper socioeconomic status. Those marginalized few who have privilege via their race-class combination are normalized for mainstream consumption as a way to demarginalize this particular subset of gay males while renormalizing heteronormativity. These gay male characters are stand-ins for a heteronormative, ideal male (minus their sexual practices, which are not shown to the audience), and also embody hegemonic masculinity, and therefore this sect of gay men are privileged via their inclusion in these mediated venues. Chaz Bono is a White, upper-class citizen, and as such is already privileged. Transnormativity, as defined through Bono, is a subjectivity that privileges White, middle-to-upper socioeconomic status, postoperative male transgendered persons who aim to reinforce hegemonic masculinity and heteronormativity. We must view Bono’s appearance on DWTS with cautious optimism. While it represents a positive step toward a more accepting society, the ways that Bono is neutered on DWTS promote a particular transgender subjectivity. Despite some resistance to the unsexed, neutered version of himself that DWTS desires, Bono reinforces other aspects of this transnormativity through his unabashed embodiment of hegemonic masculinity.</p>
<p>Despite the negative aspects of Bono’s appearance on DWTS, it seems that the only way our society can progress is through this type of normalization of people who do not fit the obvious, heteronormative binaries. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489572">Avila-Saavdra (2009)</xref> showed with mediated gay subjectivities: “the perceived progressiveness of gays’ sudden appearance on American television could be undermined if it responds to traditional norms of social interactions” (p. 5). Therefore, while Bono himself does not stand-in for all transgendered subjectivities, his inclusion on primetime network television tips a cap toward the existence of those subjectivities, <italic>symbolically reviving</italic> those subjectivities in the mainstream, while also othering or abjecting those subjectivities as different and lesser from the transnormativity Bono himself embodies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0196859913489572">
<title>Hegemonic Masculinity and Heteronormativity</title>
<p>While society has become more accepting, it is still stuck in the paradigms of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity. Although these are separate constructs, they feed off each other due to the way heteronormativity has been embedded within society: “The most basic assumption of heteronormativity is that gender is natally ascribed, natural, and immutable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489572">Cooper, 2002</xref>, p. 46). With a static view of sexuality linked to a static view of gender, masculinity becomes tied to the penis instead of to a collectively constructed set of performatives. However, despite this kiasmic relationship, masculinity is actually fluid. “Masculinity is usally understood as ways of organizing maleness and practising” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859913489572">Dowsett, Williams, Ventruneac, &amp; Carbollo-Dieguez, 2008</xref>, p. 121) and hegemonic masculinity embodies “the current most honored way of being a man, it require[s] all other men to position themselves in realtion to it, and it ideologically legitimate[s] the global subordination of women to men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489572">Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>, p. 832). These discourses are linked through normative scripts, where even men and women who fall outside of the heteronormative paradigm are encouraged by society “to communicate with others according to the symbolic performance of hegemonic masculinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489572">Eguchi, 2009</xref>, p. 194). This type of pressure and conformity is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489572">Eguchi’s (2009)</xref> analysis of <italic>straight-acting</italic> among gay men, where he shows that “Gay men are not considered masculine enough because they break the boundary of heteronormativity-heterosexuality as normal” (p. 194). Bono displays this same kind of acting through his embodiment of hegemonic masculinity. This is especially evident in his demeaning behavior toward Lacey. Furthermore, DTWS provided a stage for both Bono’s negotiation of these discourses and as well as their own mediated negotiation.</p>
<p>While society has continued to allow for varied displays of sexuality and masculinities, they generally still fall along heteronormative lines. DWTS’s multifront attack on Bono’s self-constructed hegemonic masculinity, upon first glance, defies this type policing of gender conformity, as the show repremands Bono for his perceived lack of masculinitiy. However, the policing that is enacted is that of a system trying to figure out how to normalize a newly recognized subjectivity. This normalization includes multiple strategies to reify heteronormativity that oftentimes contradict, as well as strategies that highlight percieved deficiencies in Bono’s hegemonic masculinity: casting Bono as male through partner choice and some song choices, while casting him as female through judges commentary, set pieces, and other songs. As the first mainstream mediated portrayal of transgender subjectivities, DWTS has set the stage for future portrayals, which may produce more of this uneven staging.</p>
<p>Finally, like mediated portrayals of transgendered subjectivities, scholastic explorations of these portrayals are sparse. Given the potential that transgendered subjectivities offer in complicating and combating heteronormative systems, this seems especially troubling. This power of transgendered subjectivities can be seen through the very construction of the heteronormative binary: as Euguchi notes, the heterosexual matrix allows for transgressive sexualities in “that the heteronormative system of gender cannot be defined without gay and lesbian identities” (p. 196). In closing: where does this leave transgendered subjectivities? Abjected, but with the potential to reorient heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity.</p>
