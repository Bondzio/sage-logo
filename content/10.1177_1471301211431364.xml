<abstract>
<p>This article describes the development of a Values History project helping people with early stage dementia to prepare a statement of the things that are important in their lives in anticipation of when they are no longer able to articulate their views. The experience of preparing a Values History has been positively evaluated by people with dementia and their family carers, and other professionals have found them to be useful in ensuring that wishes about future care are met.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211431364" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade there has been increasing emphasis on early diagnosis of dementia, led largely by the Alzheimer’s societies and by the availability of medical treatments for the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer’s disease. There is also an emphasis on helping people to make advanced statements or living wills to help influence future care needs when they might be no longer able to take decisions for themselves. But how people with an early diagnosis of dementia are supported and in particular how they are helped to plan for the future is inconsistent, rarely evidence-based and often not well signposted. Here we describe one way of doing this through a Values History. This has been enabled by a project set up in 1999 – the Rutherglen Early Diagnosed Dementia Support Group – involving joint working between the voluntary sector and an Older People’s Community Mental Health Team, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211431364">White, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211431364"><title>Purpose behind Values History</title>
<p>The Values History was originally developed at the Centre for Health, Law and Ethics, University of New Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211431364">University of New Mexico Institute of Medical Ethics, undated</xref>) to assist people diagnosed with a terminal illness to have their values and care preferences represented in the latter stages of their illness. Since then it has been successfully used for a wide range of long-term conditions and more recently for people with dementia.</p>
<p>According to Doukas and McCulloch:
<disp-quote>
<p>The validity of Values History is based on a basic ethical consideration; the Values History enhances the autonomy of the patient in a way that advance directives do not, by clarifying for the health care team the patients’ expressed values, underlying decisions to be carried out when decision-making by the patient is no longer possible.</p>
<p>(1991, p. 145)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211431364">Gibson (1990)</xref>, although an advocate of an advance directives, suggests that while they deal with hypothetical situations which may arise, the Values History deals with who the individual is now. She therefore feels that the Values History should be completed to complement the advance directive, allowing health care professionals to know the underlying attitudes of the person, and thus empathise with their situation.
<disp-quote>
<p>Whereas such formal directives ask for a series of medical conclusions, the Values History form targets value premises that are not medical in nature but are always considered (consciously or not) when making medical decisions. Other advance directives require one to anticipate medical conditions that might arise and to decide in advance what medical treatment one would choose or not choose. No mention is made about who the individual is now, what matters to the individual, or why the individual has made the choices he has – in short, no attention is paid to the only information that is real and not hypothetical.</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211431364">Gibson, 1990</xref>, p. 452)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211431364"><title>Rutherglen and Cambuslang Values History project</title>
<p>Rutherglen and Cambuslang Values History Project is based on a PhD thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211431364">Boyd, 2011</xref>) entitled ‘The Values History: An Empowering Approach for People with Dementia.’ As part of this work, a Values History document was developed. Once produced, this document is placed, with the patient’s consent, in their medical and psychiatric case notes. The document is produced along with the person with dementia and their carer or relative, following both joint and individual discussion. The opportunity to take part in this is offered to members of the early dementia support group.</p>
<p>The purpose of the document is to give people with dementia a voice in anticipation of when they are no longer able to articulate their views and give them the opportunity to record their views on aspects of their life that they feel are important to them. Sections include the role of family and friends, the importance of religion and faith, and fears and hopes for the future. The process of producing the Values History can also be used to improve communication between the person with dementia and their family. Experience has shown us that some people with dementia and their families find the process very therapeutic. One participant has stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for completing the Values History for my husband, copies have been given to all his family and all have been impressed. It really gives a personal insight into the person’s feelings and principles that they hold dear. The document will be a great asset to professionals whenever the time comes when the person is unable to communicate clearly to those around them and provide these people with the means to see the ‘patient’ as a real person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A strong case could be made, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211431364">Kitwood’s (1995)</xref> model of person-centred care, that by prizing each individual’s unique life story and accentuating their past values and characteristics, the person’s self-concept will be enhanced and the care they receive from others will be more personal as the illness progresses. The Values History for people with dementia is a way of ensuring that care is certainly person-centred.</p>
<p>One social worker commented that until reading the person’s Values History she had not fully understood what they and their family had started to lose, and the grieving process they had gone through as a result of the dementia. She also felt that it ‘was a privileged position to be allowed into the archives of someone’s life. It encourages us to look beyond the diagnosis of that person and see them as an individual’.</p>
<p>Another social worker stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The more information we have about that person, the greater understanding we will have of the many ways in which we will be able to promote their choices and preferences, avoid any unnecessary distress, and provide the best service. I cannot think of any greater way to ensure that individuals are included and recognised for who they are, rather than who they have become.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the participants who had stated in her Values History that her ‘goal’ was to ‘stay at home [un]til the Good Lord took her’ died peacefully in her sleep, at home. Both her son and minister referred to and quoted her Values History at her funeral.</p>
<p>The importance of the person assisting an individual to complete their Values History is pivotal to its success or failure. The project began with one of the authors (RB), who was also a member of the local Community Mental Health team, doing the work as part of a PhD. Following completion of this work it has been continued by another of the authors (JP), an advocacy worker who is employed by the voluntary group involved.</p>
<p>Interviews by the Advocacy Worker take place at the person’s home and are very informal. There is no time limit regarding how many interviews will be required, but usually four or five are necessary until a person is happy with the content.</p>
<p>The experience of supporting individuals with a dementia in our Early Diagnosed Dementia Support Group over the years and listening to what is important to people, has demonstrated that the Rutherglen and Cambuslang Values History Project promotes independence, serves to empower people with dementia and challenges the myth that people with dementia are incapable of making decisions.</p>
