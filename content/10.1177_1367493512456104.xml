            <p>The concern about obesity in children has increased worldwide. The question arises, whether this trend to obesity already starts during the prenatal period and to what extent the increase of weight is related to a secular trend in height.</p>
            <p>For neonatal data, three studies, performed in The Netherlands, with neonatal data of birth weights were compared. For postnatal data, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) of two nationwide studies, performed in the Netherlands, were analyzed.</p>
            <p>No differences between birth weights were found between 1970 and 2007. In postnatal data a trend of increasing weight and BMI in both boys and girls starts from five years onwards. The secular trend in height starts from the age of two and a half years onward in both boys and girls. The increase in weight is more pronounced than the increase in height.</p>
            <p>No prenatal secular trend could be detected in The Netherlands. Postnatal, the secular trend is obvious for weight, height and BMI. The increase in skewness of the weight distribution may be ascribed to a metabolic disturbance of the population.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>There is rising concern about the increasing incidence of overweight and obesity, not only in adults but also in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512456104">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512456104">Seidell et al., 1995</xref>). Obesity is one of the most serious present and possible future health problems, because of co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus type II, cardiovascular diseases, joint problems and psychosocial problems. During the last 30 years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in The Netherlands has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512456104">van den Hurk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512456104">Fredriks et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>
         <p>The question arises as to whether this increase in weight may be attributed to or aligned with a secular trend in height? A secular trend describes the change in physical development from one generation to the next and can be interpreted as a ‘mirror of conditions in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512456104">Tanner, 1990</xref>). The improved physical and psychological condition of the population over the last 100 years in Western society, due to improved foods, living conditions and less disease, has led indeed to a tendency for children to become progressively larger and heavier at all ages. The aim of this study was to examine whether this secular trend in height and weight is already visible during intrauterine growth. Secondly, the realtionship between height and weight expressed by the Body Mass Index (BMI) as weight divided by squared height, during this secular trend was examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512456104">Quetelet, 1835</xref>). To compare growth data of children in the Netherlands concerning prenatal and postnatal growth, we analyzed two data sets. Specifically, a secular trend in prenatal growth with respect to the population of the Netherlands has not been investigated before.</p>

            <title>Prenatal growth curves</title>
            <p>All the available nationwide data for prenatal growth in the Netherlands were used; these include two sets of growth data: the Kloosterman study from 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512456104">Kloosterman, 1970</xref>) and the Perinatreg study from 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512456104">Stichting Perinatale Registratie Nederland, 2008</xref>). The large time span between these studies can offer insight into a possible trend in growth. In the Kloosterman study, birth weight data of 80,000 infants were presented. All children were born at gestational age between 25 to 40 weeks in two Amsterdam clinics. The infants were subdivided by gender and those born from primiparae and multiparae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512456104">Kloosterman, 1970</xref>).</p>
            <p>The Perinatreg study consisted of a nationwide birth weight registration of 176,093 infants of the gestational age between 25 to 40 weeks, gathered in 2001. The total group is subdivided into infants born from primigravida and multiparous women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512456104">Stichting Perinatale Registratie Nederland, 2008</xref>). To compare the two studies, the mean weight value for each gestational age in weeks of the Kloosterman registration was subtracted from the Perinatreg data.</p>
            <p>The neonatal data of the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC) were added, because these data are collected in one specific region. The above-mentioned studies are from different regions: Amsterdam and the whole of The Netherlands. The azM registration between 1988 and 2007 is divided in two groups: the first of 1988 which consists of 679 newborns, the second of 2007 consisting of 1,109 newborns, all born at gestational age of 24–40 weeks. Unlike the other described studies, these data included length measurements. Therefore, the relation weight to length was evaluated as well. The oldest data from 1988 were compared to the recent ones from 2007.</p>

            <title>Postnatal growth curves</title>
            <p>With respect to the postnatal growth, the nationwide growth studies performed in The Netherlands by van Wieringen and Fredriks were compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512456104">Fredriks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512456104">van Wieringen, 1972</xref>). The van Wieringen study collected data from a nationwide survey of 55,000 children and adolescents between 1964 and 1966. The data pertained to height and weight of respondents being recorded at weekly intervals until 52 weeks and at 26-weekly intervals thereafter (van Wieringen, 1972).</p>
            <p>The nationwide study of Fredriks on weight and height was performed from 1996 to 1997: a total of 14,500 children, 7482 boys and 7018 girls, were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512456104">Fredriks, 2004</xref>). Until the age of one year, the measurements were presented in weekly intervals and after the age of one year in yearly intervals.</p>
            <p>In our study we calculated the body mass index (BMI), expressed as weight (in kg) divided by the squared height (in meters) from the given percentile values of the different studies. We compared the data of the study of van Wieringen (1972) with the more recent data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512456104">Fredriks (2004</xref>).</p>

The maximal difference between the two studies is 187 grams for boys at gestational age of 29 weeks and 221 grams for girls at gestational age of 31 weeks. In the period before 34 weeks the more recent data show lower birth weights. Because these results were independent of the parity, the mean values of the data of primiparae and multiparae are not presented separately.</p>

The maximum difference in this time period between both studies is -0.9 cm for girls and -0.7 cm for boys. At the age of two and a half years and beyond the height in the more recent study is increased, with a maximal difference between both studies of 4.3 cm in girls and 3.4 cm in boys at the age of 10 years.</p>

            <p>For weight a similar pattern is seen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512456104">Table 1</xref>). Until the age of four years the children from the more recent study of Fredriks had a lower mean weight compared to the children from the study of van Wieringen. After the age of four to five years there is a turning point. The children from the more recent study have a higher weight and this difference is increasing with the age. The differences in height and weight between the two studies are given for 3 percentiles (P<sub>3,</sub> P<sub>50</sub> and P<sub>97</sub>). These percentiles give an indication of the percentage of the population concerned that is below a certain value. For example, a P<sub>3</sub> value for height of 92 cm means that 3 per cent of the concerned population has a length below 92 cm. The P<sub>50</sub> value is the median; 50 per cent of the concerned population has a length below and 50 per cent a length above this value. At the P<sub>3</sub> the difference in weight starts at 108 grams, ending up with a difference of 1071 grams for girls. At the P<sub>50</sub> the difference in weight starts at the age of five years, with a difference of 300 grams, ending up at the age of 10 years with a difference of 3200 grams. In boys the difference mean weight also starts at the age of five years beginning with 400 grams and ending up at the age of 10 years with 2400 grams. At the P<sub>97</sub> curve the deviation starts at the age of four years with 797 grams, to a maximum difference of 7447 grams at 10 years for girls.</p>

Between the age of one year and five years, the boys and girls of the Fredriks group have a lower BMI compared to those of the van Wieringen group. After the age of five years the data of the recent study show a higher BMI compared to the data from van Wieringen.</p>

At the P<sub>3</sub> there is hardly any difference shown between both studies. The curves at the 97th percentile on the other hand show an obvious deviation by increasing height. The children of the more recent study of Fredriks show a trend in which they have a higher weight for height compared to the data of van Wieringen. The deviation becomes visible at a height of approximately 113 cm in both boys and girls.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The increase in weight in children is obvious. Therefore, we examined whether this phenomenon is actually related to the secular trend in height and thereby also in weight, or is a phenomenon beyond the expected increase fitting the height. We first examined whether a secular trend already exists during intrauterine growth. To answer these questions, we compared different growth studies, performed in The Netherlands, within a time span of several decades.</p>
         <sec id="section9-1367493512456104">
            <title>Prenatal growth studies</title>
            <p>Comparison of the neonatal curves unexpectedly revealed a lower birth weight in the more recent data in boys born between 26 and 33 weeks and in girls between 25 and 33 weeks. The observed weight difference could be explained by the fact that gynaecologists currently do accept or induce delivery at an earlier gestational age in case of a threatened and/or growth retarded infant. At the time of the Kloosterman study, there was no intervention in such an early stage of pregnancy, in the absence of modern postnatal medical support. In general, it must be remarked that reference intrauterine growth curves are based on measurements of premature born infants with possibly an abnormal intrauterine growth pattern. For children born at 34 to 39 weeks onwards, no difference in weight is visible, in both boys and girls between 1970 and 2001. Therefore a secular trend in prenatal growth in this time span can be excluded. We conclude that the process of a secular trend is only expressed after birth. The assumption can be made that the intrauterine environment and the placental nutrition supply prevent the foetus from becoming overgrown.</p>
            <p>The two above-mentioned populations not only differ in time span but also in their socioeconomic background. The Kloosterman population concerned the low socioeconomic classes of Amsterdam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512456104">Kloosterman, 1970</xref>) in contrast to the Perinatreg study, which is nationwide and includes all socioeconomic classes in the Netherlands. For that reason we compared two populations with the same socioeconomic background in the MUMC population. This population is more homogeneous than the other examined populations. Besides, in this study group length values were also available, so we could compare weight in relation to length. No difference was found between the measurements of weight and length, nor in the interrelation between these two measurements, measured at birth in 1988 and 2007. Therefore, it is assumed that the socioeconomic differences between the two populations of Kloosterman and Perinatreg do not affect the results.</p>

            <title>Postnatal growth studies</title>
            <p>To evaluate a postnatal secular trend in weight and height, the growth curves from the studies by van Wieringen and Fredriks were compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512456104">Fredriks, 2004</xref>; van Wieringen, 1972). Both height and weight were higher during the first years of life in the older study. An explanation could be that food composition for infants has changed during the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512456104">Jonxis, 1974</xref>). The energy intake of the population of 1964 during the first three years of life exceeded the energy intake of the population of 1996 due to differences in feeding habits, while the energy expenditure is probably equal at this age. After the age of five years the energy expenditure has apparently decreased during the past 30 years. An explanation could be that energy expenditure is decreasing in childhood, for example because of lack of movement due to watching television or playing computer games.</p>
            <p>By analysing the BMI, there is a remarkable increase of the BMI visible from the age of approximately five years. However, it has to be realized that the increase of the BMI is highly dependent on the increase of height. As an example, the height weight and BMI of a 10-year-old boy is shown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1367493512456104">Table 4</xref>) in which the BMI is calculated by the measures of height at a given percentile with corresponding weight. As is illustrated in this table, at the same age, the BMI varies widely depending on the height.</p>

            <p>Although the BMI is the usual ratio to express weight for height related to age, weight plotted against height independent of age is a more reliable comparison in children.

This is even more pronounced when realizing that in the latest growth study, performed in The Netherlands, the secular trend in height has stopped.

            <p>As is illustrated in the examples shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1367493512456104">Table 4</xref>, the BMI also shows a skewed distribution, in contrast to the original BMI data of Quetelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512456104">Quetelet, 1835</xref>). Both data sets are based on pre-pubertal data. The normal distribution as found by Quetelet has changed into a skewed distribution at the present time. Realizing that the BMI is defined as weight divided by the squared height, the secular trend must be more pronounced for weight than for height.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>During the last decennia there is no secular trend of height and weight visible during the intrauterine period, in contrast to the postnatal growth curves. However, the phenomenon of increasing BMI can be partly explained by the increase in height. Evidently the increase in skewness of the weight distribution must be ascribed to a metabolic disturbance of the population. According to these data, it is of great importance to take the described trends in weight and height in children into account in general practice. The increase in weight and BMI is obvious, but the increase in height has stopped recently. If height increases, BMI also increases. Taking into account the information that height is no longer increasing, the increase in BMI means a higher increase in weight. The BMI may be misleading in interpreting children’s growth.</p>
         <p>Another limitation of the anthropometric approach of overweight is that the BMI as well as weight for height does not distinguish between fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512456104">Freedman and Sherry, 2009</xref>). In adipose children it is reasonable to ascribe the weight gain to an increase in FM, but at the same time in relatively lean children a lower weight is largely due to a shift from FM to FFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512456104">Freedman and Sherry, 2009</xref>). Therefore Fredriks stated that waist circumference can be used as a better tool to screen for increased abdominal fat in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456104">Fredriks et al., 2005b</xref>).</p>
         <p>It is of great importance to detect and treat children who are already overweight at an early age. Detection and prevention at an early age is necessary in reducing the problem of obesity or malnutrition and its co-morbidities, which will be a threat for the population in the future.</p>
