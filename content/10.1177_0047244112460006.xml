<p>This essay explores Magris’s extensive reflection on the nature of homeland, dwellings and borders in the construction of individual and European identity. Through an analysis of Magris’s major works, the essay claims that it is in the tension between dissolution and the comfort of temporary housing that Magris locates the new possibilities of a European project and of the self’s home.</p>

<body>
<p>Claudio Magris’s ‘hydrophilia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047244112460006">Magris, 2008</xref>: 21) is well known, and has inspired numerous critical analyses on the question of individual and collective identity in his works through the motifs of the sea and of the metaphorical fluidity of travel, especially in connection with the ambivalence of the frontier. The transversal reading I propose here (although inevitably synthetic for reasons of space) intends to emphasize, instead, Magris’s domestic topophilia. As I hope to show, notions like threshold, identity and homeland as temporary houses, or literature as relocation, authenticate a consistent theoretical and aesthetic reflection which, through the treatment of the self as a moving and mutable abode, gradually leads Magris to reconceptualize Europeanness as a geographical and temporal process of lodging and dislodgement, in a tension between the local and the global spheres. I suggest that, in Magris’s writings, home (actual dwelling or a symbolic domestic dimension) is the site of a tug-of-war between rootedness and distance, utopia and disenchantment, which recodifies personal and collective identities, histories and memories as uncertain and provisional, but, at the same time, not as unfeasible or unattainable. Neither hopelessly tragic nor euphorically nihilistic, Magris does not, physically or symbolically, vacate all dwellings, erase every frontier and traverse any homeland. Rather, with his narratives and plays he substantiates and enriches pivotal standpoints that emerge from his essays, calling for a paradoxical, ironic domesticity transcending both obsessive closure and nomadism <italic>tout court</italic>.</p>
<p>Magris offers us a way of thinking critically and poetically about being and belonging not in terms of originary loss but rather of alterity as an integral part of self-sameness, which makes any form of absolutism not just morally unacceptable but even conceptually untenable. His politics of home converges in what I define as a poetics and ethics of Europeanness founded precisely upon the positive value of the temporary as a promoter of multiplicity and mutability, yet simultaneously as a custodian of limits, which still makes it possible to think ‘affectionately about home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047244112460006">Said, 1991</xref>: 116) as Edward Said claims, without falling into idolatry of the self or of the homeland.</p>
<p>For Claudio Magris, the house summons images of intimacy as a creative force. However, attachment to the human value of the abode does not generate non-negotiable inclusions and exclusions which set up ideological or emotional differences with what is not home. In the contemporary world, according to Magris, the traditional, circular model of odyssey – in which the return to the domestic place consolidates the traveller’s identity, allowing him to recover his faultless repertoire of memories and feelings – is in tension with the so-called rectilinear odyssey, which does not take the individual back home, but rather makes him lose himself on the road towards the infinite or nothingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">Magris, 2001b</xref>: 59). Yet, as we read in <italic>Lontano da dove</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047244112460006">1989b [1971]</xref>; ‘Far from Where’), it is precisely the failed prospect of a return that can divest the individual of any falsifying garment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047244112460006">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The protagonist of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047244112460006">Magris’s 1988</xref> play <italic>Stadelmann</italic>, for instance, looks in vain for self-consistency and integration in the spatial nooks and crannies of former dwellings that he retrieves through flashes of memory from a poorhouse, a pathetic surrogate for a private home. He often clings to female figures and their abodes as illusory embodiments of stability and intimacy, but they turn out to be misleading substitutes for those permanent emotions that a domestic hearth is expected to generate. By idealizing Steffì’s house ‘from the old days’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047244112460006">Magris, 2007</xref>: 44),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047244112460006">2</xref></sup> in search of a protective shelter of familiarity, Stadelmann cannot offset the destabilizing geographical and emotional displacement of his journey to Frankfurt. A subsequent hallucinatory scenario of pseudo-domesticity – that of Madame Schnips’s brothel – further degrades the almost sacred cosiness of the home to the experience of a vulgar intimacy, mere consumption of transitory and superficial sensations.</p>
<p>The lacerating conflict that Stadelmann can only solve by putting an end to existence itself – namely, that between the ‘stiffening’ (‘irrigidimento’) and ‘dissolving’ (‘dissolvimento’) of the self, as Magris claims in <italic>Utopia e disincanto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">2001b [1999]</xref>: 60; <italic>‘Utopia and Disenchantment</italic>’) – is what Magris’s critical essays present in a positive way as the intrinsic feature of the ‘I’ and of identity in its various forms: that is, uncertainty, indeterminacy. Identity, Magris observes, seems to exist in the very doubt about itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047244112460006">Magris 2003</xref>: 519) and should always be declined in the plural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047244112460006">2003</xref>: 522) because the ‘I’ itself is a multitude, a fluctuating entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047244112460006">2003</xref>: 520): process, not possession. Likewise, the home – the central place of life, where we put our entire self at stake – is not an idyll, as we are reminded in <italic>L’infinito viaggiare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">2005b</xref>, xix; <italic>‘Infinite Travelling’</italic>). It is the riskiest, most difficult adventure, which can expose us to conflicts and failures. Even more radically, therefore, home cannot even be attained or owned, precisely because its supposed intimacy is inseparable from the experience of the unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005b</xref>: x) along a precarious trail in which loss and disaggregation alternate with glimpses of a recognizable reality. If love of domesticity can only coexist with nomadic escape, only a ‘casa provvisoria’, a temporary home, can host the self, as Magris asserts in <italic>Utopia e disincanto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">Magris, 2001b</xref>: 61), in a process of becoming that resembles that of the son who leaves his parents’ home while coming back to it in his thoughts and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">2001b</xref>: 69). Significantly, Magris’s ironic attitude towards identity is the one he himself adopts in the conception of his own fictional characters, who, in contrast with what his essays declare, seem unable to accept their ‘imperfect biographies’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047244112460006">3</xref></sup> made only of fragments and splinters in the absence of the reassuring, albeit illusory, order of a household of the self.</p>
<p>A poignant instance of this dialogical relationship between character and the narrator’s critical voice is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460006">Magris’s 2006</xref> theatrical monologue <italic>Lei dunque capirà</italic> (<italic>You Will Therefore Understand</italic>, 2011), where the existential value of the topos of the home as the meeting point of transience and eternity emerges from the semantic overdetermination of the ‘Casa’ with a capital C – apparently a nursing home where a woman is waiting for her companion’s visit, but ultimately in fact the locus of an afterlife where a Eurydice figure prefers to thwart her own return to Earth rather than allow her Orpheus to discover the lack of difference between the two worlds separated by the doors of the House. The condition of transience and uncertainty affecting the self’s two dwellings turns those spatial and temporal scenarios into one ‘immense labyrinth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047244112460006">Magris, 2011</xref>: 23), the site of loss and estrangement par excellence.</p>
<p>But Magris’s recurring reflections on a plural and mobile yet unitary identity symbolized by temporary housing transcend the personal and existential level to provide the framework for questions of national consciousness, cultural spaces and belonging. Already in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112460006">1984</xref> short novel <italic>Illazioni su una sciabola</italic> (<italic>Inferences from a Sabre</italic>, 1990), provisional domestic walls surround the private site of the self as much as geographic and political landscapes, working as a prelude to Magris’s more explicitly European works. Here the notion of ‘illazioni’ (arbitrary suppositions) applies not only to the multiple and conflicting conjectures about the half-buried sabre next to the alleged body of the Cossack leader Krasnov, but also more extensively to the speculative conceptualization of individual and collective identity alike, from a private home to a people’s national homeland or nationalistic <italic>Heimat</italic>. From a stable geographic and emotional symbolic space, homeland turns into the hypothetical object of a quest that the Cossack leader traces on different maps as ‘a perpetual flight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112460006">Magris, 1990</xref>: 56) across numerous territories. The role of the map as the creator, rather than a product of collective identity, geography and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047244112460006">Anderson, 1991 [1983]</xref>: 164), here confirms Anderson’s idea of nation-ness as a construction instead of a natural sense of belonging, but also transcends it, insofar as individual and national identities are in this case not only <italic>virtual</italic>, but also <italic>mutable</italic> artefacts. Recollecting the debris of the dwellings burnt down by the Germans and presided over by the Cossacks, Don Guido, the narrator, thinks that ‘every house is a familiar space patiently carved out of the universal void’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112460006">Magris, 1990</xref>: 58). However, the Cossacks, who had supposedly settled in the Italian region of Carnia ‘to build themselves a house and to take shelter from the indeterminacy of nothingness’ had instead ‘destroyed the hospitable order enclosed by these walls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112460006">1990</xref>: 58). The predominance of transience – the homeland constantly displaced on the map – finds its ultimate material correlative in the tent, described as Krasnov’s most authentic homeland and state because, as a temporary dwelling literally and metaphorically without foundations, it embodies the nomadism to which the rootless Krasnov aspires.</p>
<p>Magris therefore initiates his fictional production with the idea of home locatable only in the very search for it, either as an abode within ourselves or as a land that one never possesses but rather leaves or seeks – a mobile space constantly displaced between the memory and the promise of an illusory dwelling, which remains central to the European question that Magris develops in his later works <italic>Danubio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112460006">1986</xref>; <italic>Danube</italic>, 1989), <italic>Microcosmi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047244112460006">1997</xref>; <italic>Microcosms</italic>, 1999) and <italic>Alla cieca</italic> (2005; <italic>Blindly</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">2010</xref>). Magris’s Europe exists in a constant process of dislocation that, far from absolute drifting, is in fact conceived in terms of a ‘trasloco’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047244112460006">Magris, 1999</xref>: 15)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047244112460006">4</xref></sup> – a relocation to a new home that, although never the same, offers temporary comfort each time.</p>
<p>The conceptual fluidity of the Austrian and central European river par excellence in <italic>Danubio</italic> and <italic>Microcosmi</italic> not only challenges the idea of origin as self-sameness but also represents ‘the image for the questioning of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">Magris, 1989a</xref>: 21), symbolizing the acceptance of the world’s heterogeneities and contradictions, against the facile belief in human universals or the idealization of the ‘harmony between different people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 29). The ironic identitarian approach recurring in Magris’s poetics is here presented as an invitation to tolerance and openness to the difformity of life, with the belief that a vision of individuals not as sedentary dwellers but as ‘guests’ in transit ‘across the face of the earth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 15) also means that ‘every nation is destined to have its day, and that there are not, in any absolute sense greater or lesser civilizations, but rather a succession of flowerings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 32–3).</p>
<p>Significantly, soon after the narrator endorses Sigmund von Birken’s interpretation of our earthly homeland as the locus of imperfection and precariousness, the first of the many homes that the Danubian traveller visits is that of the young Martin Heidegger, whose dangerous yet enlightening aporias in his view of domestic intimacy are highlighted by the narrator. For Magris, the German philosopher’s attachment to the most symbolic components of his immediate community (woods, dialect, hearth) shows the limits of the cult of <italic>Heimat</italic> when it is not tempered with equal consideration for other people’s love of their own dwellings. Precisely the recognition of ‘other soils and other lands’ should moderate the exclusive ‘monopoly of authenticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 45) to which Heidegger in fact clings in order to preserve his hope for a non-alienated life. However, meditating upon the symbolic value of that veneration for the abode, Magris observes that Heidegger can also refute the rhetoric of rootedness the moment he understands the necessity of displacement, the need to ‘leave home far behind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 46). This paradoxical coexistence of <italic>Heimat</italic> and wandering, of love for one’s native ground and for the adventure of loss synthesizes for Magris not only the experience of identity but also the possibility of a European consciousness as temporary domesticity with no difference between travelling and staying at home because – as we later read in <italic>Danubio</italic> – moving ‘between Troy and Ithaca [or] between kitchen and dining-room’ implies, nonetheless, being ‘poised between two worlds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 85).</p>
<p>In line with his contingent dwellers open to an elsewhere, to diversity and alterity, Magris recodifies the border as a threshold. He preserves the ‘need and ability to give oneself limits and form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 98), but problematizes the many defensive barriers that, ironically, a Eurocentric past erected in the attempt to protect its self-proclaimed eternal universality, starting from the <italic>Limes</italic> with which the Roman Empire tried to keep off the despised barbarians who ultimately became ‘the artificers of the new Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 98) nonetheless. Far from diminishing the importance of the European cultural heritage, Magris invites us to reappropriate historical memory not so much with visceral idolatry as with critical appreciation of the past’s heterogeneity, learning to think ‘with the mind of several peoples’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">1989a</xref>: 291), as in the literary practice of Reiter Robert, the Hungarian poet who, under multiple pseudonyms embodying different ethnic identities, gives voice, in German, to the German minority of the Romanian Banat region.</p>
<p>The ‘pathos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112460006">1999 [1986]</xref>: 459)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047244112460006">5</xref></sup> of the complex Danubian border (and of the European dimension it symbolizes) – at once bank and bulwark – hence also allows us to grasp the intrinsic otherness of the self by debunking the myth of the other side, showing, as Magris claims in <italic>Utopia e disincanto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">2001b</xref>: 52), that everybody sometimes resides on this side and sometimes on the other side. <italic>Microcosmi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047244112460006">1997</xref>) further elaborates on the role of the border in enclosing and defining temporary dwellings, evoking simultaneously the necessity and the vanity of geographical and conceptual frontiers through other apparently circumscribed places like the café, the garden, the city or the forest – small households of memory and emotions which, while preserving their autonomy, also expand in the narrative, overlapping and merging with more extended sites, just as locality and globalism intersect in the making of Europe. The city is a big ‘café’, the café is a house outside one’s home, ‘a sort of hospice … a temporary refuge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047244112460006">1999b</xref>: 13) for those in need of warmth and cosiness, and at the same time is the triumph of life’s variety, the epitome of those transitional loci that materialize the very idea of Europeanness as a ‘trascolorare’ – a shading of different identities and cultures into one another. In contrast with the more worrisome Europe of ethnic particularisms and municipal nationalisms like that of Tyrol, where the ‘Land’, the region and the boroughs are cemented within the compact walls of an ‘us’ that excludes all others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047244112460006">1999b</xref>: 205), the doors of a ‘common European home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005b</xref>: 26) should be like the perceptible yet invisible gates of the forest of Mount Nevoso, because ‘the woods are at once the glorification and the nullification of borders: a plurality of differing, opposing worlds, though still within the great unity that embraces and dissolves them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047244112460006">1999b</xref>: 107).</p>
<p>But those very habitats that in <italic>Danubio</italic> and <italic>Microcosmi</italic> are founded upon alterity as an intrinsic component of the individual and collective self, reveal their most shocking side in the identitarian and cultural babel of Magris’s most recent novel, <italic>Alla cieca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460006">2005a</xref>). Here key images and ideas of Magris’s poetics return, but twisted and debased by the global tragedy of History in the absence of limits against ideological fanaticism and unbridled power.</p>
<p>No more a lively, hybrid space, the city is here ‘founded on blood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">Magris, 2010</xref>: 16). From a ‘felice dimora’, a ‘happy dwelling’ as in <italic>Microcosmi</italic>, the sea turns into the sacrificial image of ‘a sudarium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">2010</xref>: 366). But precisely as it stages the tragic loss of home and homeland to plunge us into a destabilizing globality, <italic>Alla cieca</italic> reinstates with a vengeance the vital need for an abode as the space of the human and of <italic>humanitas</italic> in the very act of mourning its destruction. And although the novel’s emphasis does not seem to be Europe as a philosophical and institutional project, but rather a more universal perspective on history, this literary tour de force in fact suggests equally forceful implications for the European legacy. Despite the need to distinguish between regressive and emancipatory forms of nationalism, Magris states in an interview that, just as the idea of nation is a product of European culture, every nationalism has a European origin, including those that react to European colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047244112460006">Magris, 1992a</xref>: 60). The universality of <italic>Alla cieca</italic> can hence be seen as a powerful attack on the horrors of the European past and a warning against the equally dangerous risk of new physical and psychological sufferings that new ‘blind’ political and institutional designs could cause not only outside but also inside the borders of Europe: what Étienne Balibar calls a ‘self-racization of Europe against itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460006">Balibar, 2002</xref>: 44) – a rejection of the ‘other’ through an exasperation at intra-European differences.</p>
<p>The temporality of the home is here embodied by alienating, makeshift dwellings, grotesque doubles of the condition of temporary housing as openness to novelty and enrichment, which rather underscore the tragic aspect of precariousness, loss and exile: Newport prison, the mental hospital of Barcola, Dachau, Stalin’s gulag on the barren island of Goli Otok, and, in the best-case scenarios, hovels, holds of ships, improvised beds, cellars, basements –horrifying sites from which the multivocal ‘I’ (of Salvatore and of all the other tormented Argonauts he impersonates) denounces his status as a ‘displaced person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">2010</xref>: 44, 131), ‘transplanted to live and survive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">2010</xref>: 44). In the protagonist’s perpetual escape, with ‘every move’ – ‘trasloco’ in the Italian original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005a</xref>: 105) – something is lost, taken away, not according to that positive logic of subtraction that in Magris’s identitarian theory provides a contingent simplification to the self’s multiplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047244112460006">Magris, 2003</xref>: 520), but rather as evidence of the character’s condemnation to a destructive wandering. The ‘pathos of the border’ around which <italic>Danubio</italic> and <italic>Microcosmi</italic> revolve is here more central than ever. The Iron Curtain, ‘like a guillotine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">Magris, 2010</xref>: 347), dissects Salvatore’s heart. The protagonist defines his very body as ‘a violated border’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">2010</xref>: 229) in a catastrophic literalization of what Étienne Balibar has conceptualized as the shift in the new Europe from the nation-states with borders to the citizen being a border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460006">Balibar, 2002</xref>: 83–4), from the static idea of fixed lines of territorial demarcation to a protean status inseparable from the citizen’s own mobility and self-alienation. Significantly, Magris’s writings also offer positive counterparts to Balibar’s rather cynical speculations about the subject’s embodiment and internalization of the border, namely, the Oriental Jew mentioned in <italic>Utopia e disincanto</italic>, who, apparently deprived of a land and of frontiers, ‘has his own homeland in himself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">Magris, 2001b</xref>: 61), and the ‘I’ of <italic>L’infinito viaggiare</italic>, who in his journeys takes his entire life with him, ‘like a tortoise that travels with its own house’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005b</xref>: xii). In <italic>Alla cieca</italic>, although Salvatore/Jorgensen arrives at the epilogue of his recollection as the spokesperson of all the other tormented and displaced Argonauts, he seems to find an apparent shelter in a providential homecoming, which, however, is immediately perturbed by the recognition of fear: ‘I’m afraid to go home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460006">Magris, 2010</xref>: 341).</p>
<p>The challenge with which <italic>Alla cieca</italic> leaves us is to create what, in the essay ‘Patria e identità’, Magris defines as a liveable dwelling in life, a reality in which to feel at home in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460006">Magris, 2006b</xref>: 160). The existence and the dignity of Europe lie in its ability to become that changing, provisional, plural but unavoidable home in which – as Magris recalls through Ernst Bloch’s claim about a real homeland – nobody has yet been, because the real birthplace [<italic>casa natale</italic>] of life is a world delivered from injustice and oppression, a world that so far does not exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460006">2006b</xref>: 160).</p>
<p>There is always a shore lapped by Magris’s sea, and there is always a land that makes border-crossing possible in his literary travels. Above all, there is always an abode where the self feels temporarily at home while travelling or yielding to the sea tide, but it is a home where love of distance and love of the hearth coincide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005b</xref>: xx). As a warning against the danger of endogamy and the defence of pure identity, Magris reminds us that blood is always ‘meticcio’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">Magris, 2001b</xref>: 69) – hybrid, the result of crossbreeding. However, he does not endorse a diasporic identity akin to a levelling globalization or to the sort of generalized <italic>métissage proposed by</italic> Édouard Glissant, <italic>among other postcolonial critics</italic>, for whom hybridization and creolization without frontiers become a ‘self-conscious, general principle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047244112460006">Glissant, 1997</xref>: 46) involving the entire world. As he rejects the vision of a European space and consciousness dissolved into a universal bazaar, Magris also provides a powerful counter-discourse to the denunciation by other contemporary intellectuals of the impossible ambivalence of what I would call a European post-national hetero-identity. For Jacques Derrida, the cultural identity of a new Europe whose borders are no longer predetermined has to answer to a ‘double injunction’: ‘not to reconstitute a centralizing hegemony but also not to multiply the borders … and margins, not to cultivate for their own sake minority differences [or] untranslatable idiolects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460006">Derrida, 1992</xref>: 44). Confronted with this complex scenario in which frontiers ask the European identity to be ‘equal to itself and to the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460006">1992</xref>: 45), Derrida presents this new European crisis and simultaneously responsibility as the ‘experience and experiment of the impossible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460006">1992</xref>: 45). Along the same lines, Étienne Balibar concludes that ‘there is no more Europe’ or ‘less and less’ of its ‘essence or substance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460006">Balibar, 2002</xref>: 100). For his part, Magris accepts the challenge of this alleged impossibility. Even without neglecting the problems and contradictions in this project (as he eloquently explains in his compelling essay ‘The fair of tolerance’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460006">2001a</xref>), he supports a united Europe on the basis of the specificity of its legacy, which for him brings the individual to a ‘progressive self-interest in which the “I” also encompasses the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047244112460006">Magris and Zucchini, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>If in the contemporary intellectual panorama Europe’s self-theorization seems to have reached a conceptual dead end, because to devise a new Europe able to shun both monopoly and dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460006">Derrida, 1992</xref>: 41) means <italic>to think what it is difficult to imagine</italic>, as Balibar claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460006">2002</xref>: 88), Magris then shows us that it is more productive <italic>to imagine what it is difficult to think</italic>: that is, to entrust to the creative power of literature to construct what abstract speculation fails to accomplish.</p>
<p>Magris’s poetics and ethics of Europeanness ultimately urges us to accept the frontiers of identities, territories and cultures but with the awareness of their relativity, just as, in the ‘vagabond impermanence that is our destiny’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460006">Magris, 1989a</xref>: 215), we accept the borders of our temporary and mobile dwelling-place between the window of our own home and the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460006">Magris, 2001b</xref>: 61, 67), without renouncing projectuality yet knowing that one can never really possess a home, a space carved out of the universe’s infinity, but only stop there for a night or for a whole lifetime, with respect and gratitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112460006">Magris, 2005b</xref>: x).</p>
