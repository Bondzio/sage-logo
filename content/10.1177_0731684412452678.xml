<abstract>
<p>In this study, short carbon fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites with three different initial carbon fiber lengths were prepared by using extrusion compounding and injection molding techniques. The physical and morphological properties of the prepared short carbon fiber-reinforced composites were investigated by means of tensile test, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Final fiber length distributions of composites were also determined by using an image analyzing program. It was found that the maximum number of fibers was observed in the range from 51 to 100 µm. Number average final fiber lengths were calculated between 230 and 280 µm. Regardless of the used initial carbon fiber length, tensile strength and modulus values of the composites increased with the increasing carbon fiber content. It has been concluded that the initial fiber length at the studied range did not have any significant effect on the properties of composites.</p>

<p>Composite materials provide an opportunity to combine different properties of industrial materials. These materials are light in weight and are better alternatives to metallic components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452678">1</xref></sup> The possibility of modifying properties of polymeric composites with reinforcement fillers makes them very promising materials for industrial applications. It has been found that short fiber reinforcements can generally improve mechanical properties of polymer composites and they have been widely used and studied for a long time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452678">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412452678">5</xref></sup> Short fiber-reinforced polymer (SFRP) composites are very attractive for industrial applications because of their ease of fabrication, cost and superior mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carbon fibers (CF) are widely used in polymer matrix composites, since they provide strong, stiff and low density reinforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412452678">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412452678">9</xref></sup> Processing techniques such as extrusion compounding and injection molding are often used to prepare short carbon fiber (SCF)-reinforced polymer composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412452678">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412452678">11</xref></sup> However, fiber breakage takes place during extrusion and injection molding processes. Fiber breakage results from fiber–polymer, fiber–fiber and fiber-processing equipment surface wall interactions. The fiber breakage is related not only to the types of equipment, the processing conditions and the types of matrix but also to the fiber content. It was observed that the mean fiber length generally decreases with an increase in the fiber content of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412452678">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it is very important to control the processing parameters for improvement of the composite properties since fiber breakage is very critical during SFRP composites production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412452678">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412452678">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polypropylene (PP) is a commodity polymer, which is also used in engineering applications when reinforced with the functional fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412452678">14</xref></sup> It is one of the most successful thermoplastic polymers, characterized by its excellent cost-to-performance ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412452678">15</xref></sup> Fillers and reinforcements are added to PP in order to reduce its cost or enhance its mechanical properties. These fillers and reinforcements are talc, calcium carbonate, mica, glass fiber, CF, etc. PP is widely used in flexible packaging, containers, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412452678">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412452678">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are a few studies on the effect of fiber length in the SCF-reinforced PP composites in the literature. Fu and Lauke studied two probability density functions that are used for modelling the fiber length and orientation distributions, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412452678">18</xref></sup> They used their model for predicting the elastic properties of SFRPs. The strength of SFRP was derived as a function of fiber length and fiber orientation distribution. Their results showed that the strength of SFRP increases rapidly with the increase of the mean fiber length. In another study, Fu et al. investigated tensile properties of short glass fiber and SCF reinforced PP (SCF/PP) composites by taking into account the combined effect of fiber volume fraction and mean fiber length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref></sup> They found that mean glass and CF lengths decrease with increasing fiber volume fractions, and the combined effect of fiber volume fraction and fiber length determines the final tensile properties of the composites. Rezaei et al. investigated the effect of fiber length on thermomechanical properties of SCF/PP composites. They showed that longer CFs show better thermomechanical properties than shorter CFs in SCF/PP composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412452678">9</xref></sup> In another study of Rezaei et al., SCF/PP composites were prepared by melt blending and hot-pressing techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412452678">17</xref></sup> They formulated and characterized SCF/PP composites for replacing steel car bonnet. In this study, the formulation was improved by investigating the effect of length and composition of CF on the mechanical properties of the composites. They found that properties of the SCF/PP composite, which contains 10% SCF, was comparable with the properties of steel bonnet.</p>
<p>In the present work, CF-reinforced PP was prepared by extrusion compounding and injection molding techniques. The effects of fiber length and distribution on the properties of the SCF/PP composites were investigated. Mean fiber length and fiber length distribution of SCF/PP composites were determined by using Image J® analyzing program.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412452678"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>PP (Petoplen MH 418, PETKIM) was used as matrix material and SCFs (AKSACA supplied by AKSA Yalova-Turkey) were used with 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 cm length as reinforcement. The CF loading level was varied as 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 20% by weight. The compounding of PP and SCF was performed in a laboratory scale co-rotating twin-screw microextruder (15 mL Micro-compounder, DSM Xplore, The Netherlands). In this equipment, the processing temperature can be adjusted in three separately controlled heating zones and the mixing time can be varied via recirculation of the melt to find optimum composite properties. Materials were fed from the top of the microextruder by a specially designed injector type feeder. The screw speed and mixing time were kept constant at 100 r/min and 3 min. The barrel temperature was kept constant at 230°C from top to bottom. The compounds were subsequently injection molded with a laboratory injection molding machine (12 mL Micro-injection Molder, DSM Xplore, The Netherlands). Injection molding machine used in this study consists of a mold on the left side and a pressure cylinder on the right side. Compounded material was injected into the temperature-controlled mold using a plunger powered by compressed nitrogen. The mold was then removed from the machine and opened by hand. For this process, the barrel temperature, mold temperature and injection pressure were varied in order to find optimum composite properties. The injection conditions were set to 230°C barrel temperature, 25°C mold temperature, 8 bars injection and holding pressures.</p>
<p>Tensile tests of the composites were conducted by using an Instron 4411 universal testing machine. Tensile strength, modulus and strain at break values were measured according to ASTM D 638-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412452678">19</xref></sup> Average results obtained from five dumbbell-shaped samples were reported for each composite. Rockwell hardness test of composites were performed using Brooks Model MAT 10/250 Hardness Testing Machine, according to the ASTM D 785-08.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412452678">20</xref></sup> Rockwell R scale was used with 12.7-mm diameter ball indenter, 10 kg minor load and 60 kg major load.</p>
<p>The melting temperature and melting enthalpy of the composites were measured by performing differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis (Mettler Toledo DSC 1) under nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC analysis was carried out in the temperature range from -30 to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The relative degree of crystallinity (percent improvement in crystallinity compared to as received polypropylene) of the samples were calculated with the following expression
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0731684412452678"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where Δ<italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> and Δ<italic>H<sub>f</sub></italic> are the heat of fusion of as received polypropylene and the heat of fusion of composites, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412452678">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412452678">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Morphologies of SCF-reinforced composites were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6335F). Tensile fracture surfaces of composites were sputter coated with gold and palladium prior to analysis.</p>
<p>In order to determine fiber length distribution, CFs were isolated from the composite materials by burning in an ash oven for about 10 min at 550°C. The residual ash from burned composite was dispersed in water and then the CFs were transferred to glass slides and placed on the observation stage of an optical microscope. Fiber images obtained from the optical microscope were then analyzed by Image J®, and fiber length distributions and mean fiber length were determined.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0731684412452678" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Final CF length distribution in the PP composites was investigated by Image J® analyzing program. The color threshold stages of this program are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412452678">Figure 1</xref>. Final fiber length distribution curves on the number average basis for three different initial CF lengths are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412452678">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412452678">Figure 2</xref> that the measured fiber lengths were in the range from 50 to 950 µm. On the other hand, the maximum number of fibers was observed in the range of 51 to 100 µm. Number average fiber lengths were calculated between 230 and 280 µm. It was observed that no matter the initial fiber length was, it resulted with the same distribution trend. These results show that significant fiber breakage occurred during compounding by extrusion and injection molding, and this effect should be taken into consideration for process optimization.

<p>The tensile strength and modulus values of SCF/PP composites are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412452678">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452678">4</xref> as a function of CF weight fraction (wt.%) and fiber lengths. It was observed that initial fiber lengths at the studied range had no effect on the tensile strength and modulus values of PP composites. The reason of this was probably due to the fiber breakage during processing. The fiber lengths reached to the same final level at the end of our process. This is in accordance with what was found in distribution analysis. It was observed that, regardless of the studied CF length, the tensile strength increased slightly with increasing CF content, whereas modulus of the composites increased dramatically. This case can be explained by using rule of mixture theory. This is the most commonly used theory for modeling the modulus of composites and it was developed by Cox.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412452678">23</xref></sup> According to this theory, the modulus of a composite is given in the equation below
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0731684412452678"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>E</italic> is the tensile modulus, <italic>V</italic> is the volume fraction and the subscripts <italic>c</italic>, <italic>f</italic> and <italic>m</italic> represent composite, fiber and matrix, respectively. For a unidirectional composite, a correction factor (<italic>η</italic><sub>1</sub>) must be introduced when lengths of fiber not fully contributing to the modulus of the composite because of shear stress transfer between fiber and matrix. As a result, the modulus of the unidirectional fiber reinforced composites can be given in the equation below
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0731684412452678"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
<fig id="fig3-0731684412452678" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effect of CF content and length on the tensile strength at break values of composites. CF: carbon fiber.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-fig3.tif"/></fig>

<p>Krenchel contributed to this theory by taking the fiber orientation into account via adding a fiber orientation factor <italic>η</italic><sub>0</sub> into the rule of mixture equation. So the rule of mixture equation can be written as below<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412452678">5</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0731684412452678"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The rule of mixture equation can be also used to predict the tensile strength of short fiber-reinforced composites by assuming a perfect interfacial bond between fibers and matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412452678">18</xref></sup> For our study, fiber orientation factor <italic>η</italic><sub>0</sub> can be assumed as 1 because the fibers are aligned along the flow direction for all specimens during the injection molding process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412452678">24</xref></sup> The CF alignment in our test specimens can be also seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452678">Figure 5</xref>. So, the correction factor <italic>η</italic><sub>1</sub> for the strength and modulus values of the composite are mainly affected by the change in fiber length. Due to the increased fiber–fiber and fiber–equipment interaction, fiber length decreases with increasing fiber content, and this reduction in fiber length reduces the correction factor. On the other hand, the interfacial bond between fibers and matrix is not perfect as assumed for using the rule of mixture theory to predict tensile strength. This is the reason why the increasing CF content does not affect the composite strength significantly.
<fig id="fig5-0731684412452678" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>SEM micrograph representing the fiber orientation. SEM: scanning electron microscopy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Strain at break values of the prepared composites are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412452678">Figure 6</xref>. It was observed that strain at break values decreased with increasing CF content regardless of the used initial CF length. Similar findings have been shown in literature and were explained by a failure mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452678">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412452678">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412452678">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412452678">25</xref></sup> According to this mechanism, under loading of tensile stress, the microcracks initiate at the fiber ends because of the higher stress concentration at these points. Then, the cracks propagate along fiber length and spread across the matrix. When the cracks grow to a critical size, final fracture of the composite takes place. This result shows that the failure is closely related to the number of fiber ends. This explains why increasing CF content decreases strain at break values.
<fig id="fig6-0731684412452678" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Effect of CF content and length on the strain at break values of PP composites. CF: carbon fiber; PP: polypropylene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412452678-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The Rockwell hardness test results of SCF/PP composites are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412452678">Figure 7</xref> as a function of CF weight fraction. It was seen that the hardness of composites ascended tremendously with the increasing CF content while the increasing CF length increased it slightly. When compressive force is applied to the composite, thermoplastic matrix phase and fiber phase are pressed together, they touch each other and a resistance occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412452678">4</xref></sup> Because of this fact, the interface can transfer load more efficiently even if interfacial bond is poor. Therefore, the hardness of the composites increases with this mechanism.

<p>The melting temperature (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>), heat of fusion of composites (Δ<italic>H<sub>f</sub></italic>) and the relative degree of crystallinity Δ<sub>χ</sub>(%) values of all composites are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412452678">Table 1</xref>. <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> values of PP composites were not altered significantly with increasing CF content and used CF length. It was also observed that heat of fusion and the relative degree of crystallinity of the composites decreased with increasing CF content. It is expected that fibers generally affect the degree of crystallinity by increasing the numbers of nucleation sites and crystal growth rate at low fiber concentration. But, as concentration of fibers is increased, fibers start to act as restriction sites for the matrix and prevent the mobility of polymer chains and degree of crystallinity of composites decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412452678">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412452678">26</xref></sup>

<p>SEM was employed to observe the tensile fracture surfaces of SCF/PP composite samples based on 8% fiber content with different CF lengths. The SEM micrographs of the fracture surfaces of SCF/PP composites are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412452678">Figure 8</xref>(a)–(f). It can be seen from the SEM micrographs that most of the fibers were pulled out and left dark spots occurring between the fiber and the matrix. The reason of those dark spots is most probably local deformation of the matrix around the fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412452678">25</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412452678">27</xref></sup> It has been also seen that fiber surfaces were clean. This can be considered as the evidence of there was no considerable adhesion between fiber and matrix.

<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of initial fiber length and final fiber length distribution on the properties of SCF/PP composites. CF length distribution in the PP composites was determined by Image J® analyzing program. It was observed that, no matter the initial fiber length was, it was resulted with the same distribution trend. According to tensile test results, regardless of the used initial CF length, increasing CF content increases the tensile strength and modulus while decreases the strain at break values. Rockwell hardness test results showed that the hardness of composites increased tremendously with the increasing CF content while the increasing CF length increased it slightly. While <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> values of PP composites were not altered significantly, the heat of fusion and the relative degree of crystallinity of the composites decreased with the increasing CF content. It was seen from the SEM micrographs that most of the fibers are pulled out from the matrix. When all results were evaluated at the meantime, it can be concluded that initial fiber lengths at the studied range did not have any significant effect on the properties of composites due to fiber breakage down to a final fiber length depending on processing parameters. Therefore, the controlling of processing parameters during extrusion and injection molding process such as screw speed, mixing time, injection and holding pressures are important for improvement of the SCF composite properties.</p></sec>
