<p>The editors of <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing</italic> (<italic>JHN</italic>) are soliciting manuscripts for a special issue focused on “Nurse-Herbalism—Global Tradition.”</p>
<p>The submission deadline is July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Guest Editor: Dr. Martha Mathews Libster, RN, CNS, AHN-BC</p>
<p>The focus of this special issue is nurse-herbalism: practice, education, and inquiry. Partnership with plants is a nursing tradition. It is not a complementary therapy to nursing. Rather, historical evidence suggests that herbal remedies, like touch and communication, are “nursing.” This issue seeks to illuminate the current state of nurse-herbalism. It offers a forum for the exploration of new dimensions in nursing and the emergence of personal and professional relationships with plants that support the creation of healing environments, the promotion of health and comfort, and the expansion of caring community.</p>
<p>All articles submitted should address the question: “How does this article contribute to holistic nursing?”</p>
<p>Submissions should follow the <italic>JHN</italic> publication guidelines for “Articles on Botanical Therapies”.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112446929">
<title><italic>JHN</italic> Guidelines for Submission of Articles on Botanical Therapies</title>
<p>Like touch, presence, and communication, botanical therapies represent an enduring, centuries-old healing tradition in holistic nursing. This guideline is provided to demonstrate JHN’s commitment not only to excellence in scientific writing but also to the fostering of respect for the plants that partner with nurses and clients in promoting care and comfort.</p>
<list id="list1-0898010112446929" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Include the plant perspective</p>
<list id="list2-0898010112446929" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Botanical names should include scientific name if known. If not, explain why.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Format for botanical name: Common name (<italic>Scientific name</italic>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Include relevant information on the historical and traditional applications of the plant or plants discussed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be sure to distinguish whole plant from plant constituents and their applications when discussing botanical therapies. Examples:</p>
<list id="list3-0898010112446929" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>i. Identify Botanical <italic>Application</italic>: In citing an article on St. John’s Wort (<italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>) for Mitigating Episiotomy; state that <italic>the infused oil</italic> of St. John’s Wort was massaged on the perineum. Other applications include capsule, pill, liquid extract, tincture, poultice, compress, smoke, tea, bath, plaster, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ii. Plant Constituent: If discussing risks of oral doses of St. John’s Wort for mild depression, quote article, and be sure to state if risk is related to <italic>Hypericum</italic> whole plant or a constituent such as hypericin.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p>Control bias—Health sciences literature in which plants are discussed should follow guidelines for professional scientific writing:</p>
<list id="list4-0898010112446929" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Discuss the data and avoid gross generalizations from unsupported data, which imply or state a risk from using botanical therapies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Call for further research as is customary in scientific writing rather than debunk a plant, its use in health care, or herbalism in general.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be fair to plants and cultural traditions and rituals that include them. Just as scientific writing calls for sensitivity to marginalized humans respect should be shown to plants and associated cultural traditions. Slurring of any plant, botanical therapy, or cultural tradition is not acceptable.</p></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p>Include a literature review from a plant perspective</p>
<list id="list5-0898010112446929" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Demonstrate that botanical literature has been reviewed. See publications in phytopharmacy, ethnobotany, botany, folklore, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider including international research publications particularly if a plant is indigenous and well known outside the United States.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use botanical databases such as NAPRALERT and HERBCLIPS (American Botanical Council).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Include book publications—Some of the plant expertise, such as on medicinal mushrooms, for example, is well documented in experts’ book publications.</p></list-item></list></list-item>
