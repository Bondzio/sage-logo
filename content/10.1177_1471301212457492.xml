<p>The articles in this issue of Innovative Practice deal with three important issues in providing person centred care to people with dementia. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301212457492">Manthorpe, Samsi and Rapaport (2012 online first-a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301212457492">2012 online first-b)</xref> have shown, the importance of advance planning for day to day decisions is as important to people’s quality of life when they no longer have capacity as is planning for major life decisions, such as making financial arrangements. In the first article, Jacqueline Pearce and colleagues describe a Values History Project in Scotland which helps people with dementia record the record their views on aspects of their life that they feel are important to them. The themes of recognising ‘aspects of people’s lives that are important to them’ could also apply to the second article by Chiara Solari and Luke Solomons. Writing at a time when the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship has just finished, the extent to which football plays a major part in many people’s lives has been obvious. How does this get integrated into activities with people with dementia? Chiara and Luke report on how they used a football quiz to engage people attending a memory clinic in south east England which showed that there was a core group of people, both men and women, who would like to take part in reminiscence activities around football. The final article by Tamra McLeod and colleagues describes the Kuranya/‘Rainbow' project for Indigenous Australians in New South Wales. Although the importance of culturally acceptable dementia services is widely recognised, we still lack sufficient examples of how this can be achieved. Taken together, while the contexts in which all three of the services described here vary from country to country, these are topics that have a wider global resonance for improving dementia care services.</p>
