Our original article was framed as a reflection on the set-theoretic status of the relatively novel technique of mvQCA, which had been introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X13478134">Cronqvist (2004</xref>) to deal with the problem of analyzing multichotomous nominal variables, such as religion or types of welfare states. While recognizing the potential of mvQCA, we were unconvinced by Herrmann and Cronqvist’s (2009) argument that mvQCA would be particularly suitable for “genuinely middle-sized” data sets. Further, we observed with some surprise that insofar as mvQCA had been applied, this has been virtually never done to accommodate the use of multichotomous nominal conditions, as originally foreseen. Most importantly, we argued that in set-theoretic terms, these conditions were different from either crisp-set or fuzzy-set conditions. We observed that mvQCA users had so far applied this new technique in a rather unreflective manner.</p><p>We welcome Thiem’s contribution to this discussion. All in all, however, we see his contribution supporting our main argument on the set-theoretic status of mvQCA, rather than contesting it. We respond below to Thiem’s comments on our five claims on the use and misuse of multi-value QCA.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Claim 1:</italic> The observation that mvQCA applications mostly continuous base variables have been calibrated into multi-value sets indicates, first of all, a misuse of mvQCA and, second, puts doubt on the need for mvQCA.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In our article, we observed that multi-value QCA had been misapplied in most existing mvQCA applications, calibrating not nominal but continuous base variables as multi-value conditions. Thiem argues that this “only concerns data transformation issues, but it is unrelated to mvQCA as a method.” In our view, Thiem understates the problem as evidenced by the joint synopsis of the mvQCA literature by ourselves and by Thiem (see Table 1 in both articles). Of the 31 multi-value conditions included in the 12 publications from our joint literature synopsis, only 7 multi-value conditions were originally measured at the nominal level. The remaining 24 multi-value conditions were based on either ordinal-level data (5) or interval-ratio level data (19).</p><p>By way of justification, Thiem argues that the use of mvQCA for continuous base variables must be set in relation to the base variables of the additional explanatory conditions. When any of the explanatory conditions is based on a categorical base variable, which can only be meaningfully calibrated as a multi-value condition, he argues that scholars have no choice but to calibrate all variables as either a crisp-set or multi-value condition, even if their measurement level is interval or ratio. We are not convinced by this argument for two reasons. First, even if we go along with Thiem’s proposed rule that mvQCA should be applied as soon as the data set includes at least one nondichotomous categorical base variable, we find that 6 of the 12 mvQCA publications do not even adhere to that minimal rule. Second, more importantly, we do not see why it would be logically impossible to combine multi-value sets with fuzzy sets in a single analysis, if indeed multi-value sets are conceived as multiple crisp sets, as Thiem proposes (see below), or as multiple fuzzy sets, for that matter.</p><p>In our view, the question of when and how mvQCA should be applied, and when and how not, concerns a discussion on the proper scope of application of the method of multi-value QCA. The fact that in most applications mvQCA is not used to address the issue that it was originally designed to address (the measurement level of the base variables) expresses not only a misuse of mvQCA but also a misunderstanding of the method.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Claims 2 and 3:</italic> Crisp-set QCA can be used as an alternative to multi-value QCA by creating a binary condition for each category except one, as long as the impossible logical remainders are set to “don’t care” or are excluded from the truth table.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We argued that even in the case of multicategorical nominal conditions, a crisp-set solution is available by creating dummies for <italic>c </italic>– 1 categories (where <italic>c</italic> is the total number of categories). Thiem comments that the multi-value solution provides a more “efficient” solution compared to the crisp-set alternative of introducing a separate set for individual nominal categories. He provides two main reasons for this: Multi-value analysis avoids the use of impossible logical remainders and the crisp-set alternative provides a larger truth table that increases coding work and probability of errors.</p><p>On the first point that impossible logical remainders must be made available for reduction to derive a similar minimal solution, we do not see the problem with doing so. Because these logical possibilities could never be represented by an empirical case, <italic>if they are included in the truth table</italic> (see below), they should not be allowed to stop the minimization. Thiem’s example shows precisely why excluding these remainders would lead to an unnecessarily “complex” minimal solution. For that reason, we argued in our original article (p. 271) that these impossible remainders should be indicated as “don’t care” rows. Logically, this means that they should be included, if and when they contribute to parsimony.</p><p>On the second point, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X13478134">Schneider and Wagemann (2012</xref>:262, see note 12 for a formal proof) who argue that mvQCA and the creating of <italic>c</italic> – 1 crisp or fuzzy sets produce exactly the same number of possible truth table rows. Their argument is that if multi-value truth tables only include “plausible truth table rows,” the same should apply for crisp-set truth tables. This is not a trivial point, because one could argue that “impossible logical remainders” are just not visible in a multi-value truth table, but are nevertheless there. After all, if multi-value conditions are a composition of multiple crisp sets (see below, under Claim 5), then it follows that for each category not only the presence but also the absence should be included. In the example of the colors of the traffic light, if we include next to red, yellow, and green, also not-red, not-yellow, and not-green, this would lead to meaningless truth table rows because we would not know whether not-red would imply yellow or green. Hence, there are good reasons not to include such rows in a multi-value truth table. From Thiem’s example in table 2, it shows clearly that removing rows 7 and 8 from TT<sub>cs</sub> would lead to a similar number of truth table rows as in TT<sub>mv</sub>.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Claim 4:</italic> There is no need to include a condition for each category of a multichotomous nominal variable; theoretical expectations about the relation between some condition and an outcome should determine which category should be included in the analysis.</p></list-item></list></p><p>More important, the problem of impossible logical remainders can be avoided at all by using one crisp-set variable representing a single category of a multicategorical nominal condition. We claimed in our article that theory should guide us as to the question which multi-value category should be included in the analysis. This is essentially similar as in a crisp-set and fuzzy-set analysis, where researchers also need to determine which set they are theoretically interested in. The additional advantage of such a strategy is that this avoids the increase of the truth table caused by the use of additional categories and thus minimizes challenges related to limited diversity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X13478134">Schneider and Wagemann 2012</xref>:260–63). We used Cronqvist’s example of the colors of a traffic light to illustrate our point that researchers often have theoretical expectations about specific categories: A researcher interested in traffic accidents would, in particular, look at cars crossing the light when it is red.</p><p>Thiem argues that this claim is a prisoner of Cronqvist’s simplistic traffic light example because many researchers would have difficulties with formulating directed hypotheses. He argues that<disp-quote><p>daily experiences … provide us with strong theoretical expectations about the connection between accidents and traffic light color… . However, it is improbable that many researchers have daily encounters with different toll-rate approaches and could easily formulate directed hypotheses about the connection between average-cost pricing, marginal social-cost pricing or revenue-maximizing pricing and the degree of road congestion.</p></disp-quote></p><p>While a discussion on the origin of social science theories goes beyond the scope of our short reply, in our view few scholars would agree with Thiem that daily experiences are <italic>necessary</italic> for the formulation of directed hypotheses for academic research problems. In contrast, in the example cited by Thiem, expectations about the relation between toll-rate approaches and the degree of road congestion may be logically deduced and do not require “daily experience” at all. So, we are unconvinced by Thiem’s reasoning on this point.</p><p>In our article, we brought up a related point on the importance of formulating explicit theoretical expectations: Multi-value QCA does not only potentially increase the number of logical remainders, thus increasing the number of potential counterfactual statements, but these counterfactual statements become, as it were, more “difficult” (referring to Ragin’s distinction between easy and difficult counterfactuals). The reason for this is that while a statement on the expected causal direction of a crisp-set condition provides information both on the presence and on the negation of a condition, in multi-value conditions a causal statement needs to be made for each category. In our 2009 article, we observed that mvQCA applications so far still relied on “binary” theorizing and had failed to formulate explicit multi-value theoretical expectations.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Claim 5:</italic> The set-theoretic status of mvQCA differs from both csQCA and fsQCA because set membership scores in multi-value sets refer to membership of multiple, instead of two set categories; in mvQCA, every category is a set in itself.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Following up on the previous point, we argued that users of mvQCA had so far not well understood the set-theoretic implications of this new technique, particularly in relation to the changed meaning of membership scores in a multi-value set. Whereas in crisp-set and fuzzy-set QCA membership scores indicate membership of a particular set (e.g., the value [1] might indicate full membership in the set of democracies or in the set of former colonies), in multi-value QCA a membership score always indicates membership of one of several qualitative <italic>categories</italic>. Thiem calls these “multi-value crisp sets,” but in set-theoretic terms they are best understood as supersets: Multi-value categories are thus subsets of the multi-value superset, just like the set of former British colonies is a subset of the set of former colonies. In that manner, we suggested that multi-value sets can be viewed as multiple sets within one set (p. 272).</p><p>One important consequence is that whereas in crisp-set and fuzzy-set analysis the value {0} always indicates the “absence” or the “negation” of a condition, in multi-value analysis, the value {0} has lost this meaning and just indicates membership of one of the qualitatively different sets. This is clearly illustrated in Thiem’s Table 3, wherein table DT<sub>2</sub> set membership of crisp-set and fuzzy-set conditions <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>3</sub> varies between 0 and 1, but set membership scores in multi-value condition <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> are constantly 1.</p><p>While we appreciate the generalizability of Thiem's proposed notational scheme, the need for what he terms a “set-value indicator” underlines exactly our point about the composite aspect of what he terms a “multi-value crisp set”: Set membership scores in multi-value conditions refer to membership of multiple set categories, which should be understood as subsets of the multi-value superset. In other words, while Thiem convincingly shows how mvQCA can be formalized in a generalized QCA notational system, his proposed notational system precisely illustrates our point that membership in a binary crisp-set or fuzzy-set is essentially different from membership in a multi-value set. In the latter case, we would argue that set membership in multi-value sets should be conceived as a subset relation: as membership in a crisp or fuzzy set that is a subset of a multi-value superset.</p></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Carsten Schneider and Claudius Wagemann for valuable feedback.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1525822X13478134"><citation citation-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cronqvist</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group> <year>2004</year>. <article-title>Presentation of TOSMANA.
