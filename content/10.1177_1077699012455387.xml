<abstract>
<p>Grounded in an agenda-building framework, this experiment manipulated two dimensions of affective attributes—valence and arousal—from a corporate blog message to examine their influence on corporate reputation and stakeholder engagement. Overall, the findings showed significant valence effects on reputation and engagement, while arousal effects were only present on corporate reputation. This study adds empirical evidence to the explication of agenda building by focusing on affective attributes and by testing the compelling-arguments hypothesis concerning the role of affective attributes’ (second level) impact on object salience (first level).</p>

<p>Numerous studies have found supportive evidence for both agenda setting and agenda building;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012455387">1</xref></sup> however, not much scholarship has explored linkages between the two different explicated levels of these processes (the object and attribute levels of salience). Object salience has been used to explore “what” issues or political figures have been discussed in messages, while attribute salience has been used to study “how” the issues or political figures have been discussed. Attribute salience has been conceptualized along two dimensions: substantive (i.e., frames) and affective (i.e., tone). Compared to substantive attributes, research examining the role of affective attributes has not received much attention in agenda-building scholarship. Hence, the current study aims to test the role of affect in the relationship between the object and attribute levels of salience and to demonstrate causal relationships in an experimental setting that is grounded in the agenda-building tradition. In particular, this study conducted a three by three factorial experiment, manipulating the two dimensions of affective attributes: valence and arousal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012455387">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Agenda-building theory</title>
<p>Media effects on public opinion are one of the areas most widely studied by communication scholars. Public opinion is shaped through the media, and the media (i.e., news media) have played a role in affecting the public agenda by selectively directing attention to certain political topics while ignoring others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012455387">3</xref></sup> Agenda setting is one of the most widely used theories to explain the transfer of salience between media coverage on certain topics and extent of public concern about topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012455387">4</xref></sup> Prior scholarship has provided support for a positive relationship between the salience of the media and public agendas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012455387">5</xref></sup> This framework assumes a significant impact on public opinion by the media—Cohen, for example, argued that the media tell the public “what to think about,” as opposed to what to think.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012455387">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Expanding from agenda-setting theory, an agenda-building perspective focuses on who sets the media agenda in the first place. This perspective has been used to explore the transfer of salience between external sources and media, and between external sources and public opinion. Public relations materials and activities (i.e., news releases, speeches, and newsletters) are major forces shaping the agenda-building process. Similar to agenda setting, several studies have shown positive agenda-building associations among public relations messages (i.e., information subsidies), media, and public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012455387">7</xref></sup> Miller explained that information subsidies provided by public relations practitioners can easily be utilized by journalists to reduce the cost and effort of finding information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012455387">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Traditionally, the agenda-building effects of public relations campaigns have been largely explored in a political communication context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012455387">9</xref></sup> However, the scope of this study extends its application to an international business communication context. International organizations, for instance, strive to promote positive images to a global society through a large variety of public relations campaigns, and corporations try to build positive reputations using public relations or media relations strategies. In the context of a corporate takeover, Ohl, Pincus, Rimmer, and Harrison found the agenda-building effects of a company’s press releases and news media coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012455387">10</xref></sup> Carroll and McCombs also suggested that corporate portrayals in news media influence public opinion about corporations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012455387">11</xref></sup> These previous studies show that the object and attribute levels of agenda building can be found in business communication. The object level of agenda building refers to the salience of the issues that the organization is communicating about (or the organization itself), while the attribute level refers to the salience of attributes that the organization emphasizes regarding the issue (or the organization).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077699012455387">
<title>First- and second-level agenda building</title>
<p>Scholars distinguish between two levels of agenda building. According to these scholars, the salience of objects refers to the first level of agenda building, and the salience of attributes refers to the second level of agenda building.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012455387">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first level of agenda building focuses on the transfer of object (i.e., issues, political figures, or organizations) salience among public relations messages, media coverage, and public opinion. Past empirical work has found that media and public concern for certain objects increases when public relations practitioners provide messages about the same objects. Also, at the second level of agenda building, prior research has observed that that media and public concern with certain aspects of objects is affected by how public relations practitioners frame objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012455387">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Attributes have been defined as “the set of perspectives or frames that journalists and the public employ to think about each object,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012455387">14</xref></sup> and scholars have stated that attributes, such as frames, draw media and public attention to certain aspects of objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012455387">15</xref></sup> Carroll and McCombs also defined the two levels of salience as the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the first level, agenda-setting effects are on attention. At the second level, agenda-setting effects are on comprehension. These attribute agenda-setting effects on public comprehension can be described in terms of two dimensions: substantive and evaluative (or, cognitive and affective, if you will).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012455387">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a political communication context, Golan and Wanta explained that the attributes of political candidates influence individuals’ overall evaluation of political candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012455387">17</xref></sup> In addition, Carroll tested the influence of attribute salience on object salience in a business context and showed that media portrayals of particular aspects of a firm were associated with public perceptions about the firm as an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012455387">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, scholars have defined two types of attributes: substantive and affective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012455387">19</xref></sup> Substantive attributes of objects refer to the cognitive level of attribute salience based on reasoning, while affective attributes are based on emotions toward the objects. Issue frames, corporate reputation dimensions, and candidate image aspects are examples of the substantive dimension, while the tone (negative, neutral, or positive) of a message is an example of an affective attribute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012455387">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077699012455387">
<title>Substantive and affective attributes</title>
<p>Substantive attributes deal with the cognitive aspect of an object, while affective attributes deal with the affective or emotional aspect of an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012455387">21</xref></sup> Several different aspects can describe an object, and public relations materials can focus on certain aspects more than others. Entman described the process as framing and explained that it can affect how people understand certain objects (i.e., social issues or political actors).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012455387">22</xref></sup> Frames are widely used substantive attribute items in agenda-setting and agenda-building studies. In particular, frames have been studied to explore their impact on public opinion about political figures or organizations. For example, previous scholarship has suggested several substantive attributes of a candidate, such as ideology, qualifications, and personality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012455387">23</xref></sup> In a business context, Carroll and McCombs also suggested reputational substantive attributes of corporations, such as familiarity, value, capability, corporate citizenship, performance, leadership, and credibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012455387">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, affective attributes have been explored as another essential aspect of an object. Affective attributes refer to the emotional responses to an object that influence the overall appeal of an organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012455387">25</xref></sup> Sheafer emphasized that the tone of news media coverage may affect voters’ overall judgment of a politician and a political issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012455387">26</xref></sup> Prior studies have found that the tone of news coverage affects public opinion about candidates, issues, and organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012455387">27</xref></sup> In a gubernatorial election context, scholars have found that the positive/negative portrayals of a candidate in the news affect positive/negative evaluations of a candidate by the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012455387">28</xref></sup> Also, previous studies have shown that the tone of news influences whether foreign publics perceive foreign nations positively or negatively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012455387">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-1077699012455387">
<title>Affect in communication</title>
<p>Historically, affect has been emphasized in research because of its critical role in communication and in influencing cognitive or overall thinking of an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012455387">30</xref></sup> In agenda-setting and agenda-building studies, scholars have stated that affective attributes would lead to emotional responses that shape the overall evaluation of an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012455387">31</xref></sup> The valence (tone) of a story is the most commonly used dimension of affective attributes in agenda-setting and agenda-building studies. The valence (tone) of a message has been used to refer to affective attributes in agenda-setting and agenda-building studies; however, the influence of affective attributes has been less developed in previous studies, compared to the effect of substantive attributes.</p>
<p>Scholars have explained affective attributes as referring to the facets of a message that lead to emotional responses in an audience, such as the tone of a story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012455387">32</xref></sup> Lopez-Escobar et al. found a correlation between the affective attributes underscored in the media and affective attributes stressed by the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012455387">33</xref></sup> The affective attributes of a story shape the overall composition of the story, and this impacts information processing by audiences. Positive stories, for instance, could lead to a positive overall evaluation of the object (issues or candidate) in a message, while negative stories might have the opposite effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012455387">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exploring the impact of the tone of news media coverage, Schoenbach and Semetko suggested that negative news would catch people’s attention more easily than positive (or neutral) news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012455387">35</xref></sup> Sheafer explained that people would perceive an issue to be more important when the issue is portrayed in the news more negatively:
<disp-quote>
<p>A negative object attribute is, therefore, expected to increase object importance and accessibility on the public agenda. A positive tone, on the other hand, is not expected to have such an effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012455387">36</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, studies have explored the impact of the valence of a message on attitudinal consequences of messages, which trigger readers’ evaluations and judgments of the messages. In particular, scholars found that positive messages successfully facilitate favorable views of the sources of messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012455387">37</xref></sup> Kwak, Kim, and Zimmerman said that people generally like messages framed positively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012455387">38</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077699012455387">
<title>Dimensions of affect</title>
<p>Scholarship on emotions and feelings has explored two dimensions of affective and evaluative responses—direction of congruent value (i.e., pleasant or unpleasant) and extremity of arousal (i.e., stimulating or not stimulating).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012455387">39</xref></sup> In addition to the tone of the message, studies have also explored the role of emotions in communication. Lang, Dhillon, and Dong found that emotionally arousing material can increase the effectiveness of advertising, as it helps improve product recall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012455387">40</xref></sup> Also, emotional messages evoke higher levels of cognitive information processing by audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012455387">41</xref></sup> Scholars have explored the role of arousing messages in affecting the overall evaluation of a communication message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012455387">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, Coleman and Wu found that audience emotion had a stronger influence on the overall impression of a political candidate than did cognitive assessments of a candidate’s characteristics, referring to the theory of affective intelligence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012455387">43</xref></sup> According to Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen, affective intelligence is “a theory about how emotion and reason interact to produce a thoughtful and attentive citizenry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012455387">44</xref></sup> Scholars have stated that there are many cases in which people do not think and make judgments habitually.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012455387">45</xref></sup> Emotions can play a significant role in getting people’s attention and increasing the need for in-depth thinking about an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012455387">46</xref></sup> Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen also contended that emotions can enhance people’s rational thinking, which subsequently leads to more thoughtful decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012455387">47</xref></sup> Capota, van Hout, and van der Geest also explored the effects of the two emotional dimensions—value (i.e., pleasant or unpleasant) and arousal (i.e., stimulating or not stimulating)—on website design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012455387">48</xref></sup> Prior research has suggested that visual illustrations of a message can increase the level of arousal among readers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012455387">49</xref></sup> Visual illustrations include color, font, or multimedia features in the media content. Participants in multimedia groups (both positive and negative multimedia groups) had higher levels of arousal than those in the text-only group.</p>
<p>Hence, in addition to the valence (tone) of a message, the current study explores the effects of the arousal dimension of affect on the salience of objects. Valence refers to the tone of a message, and arousal refers to the emotional strength of a message (stimulating or not stimulating). The discussion of the role of affect in cognitive thinking of an object leads us to test the compelling-arguments hypothesis of agenda building and agenda setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012455387">
<title>Compelling arguments</title>
<p>Past empirical work has also paid attention to how attribute salience can contribute to object salience and noted that attention to particular object attributes can help shape public salience of objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012455387">50</xref></sup> For example, news coverage about unemployment (as a subissue of the economy) can affect public salience of the economy, and news coverage about particular candidate attributes (i.e., morality) can affect the overall salience of candidates (object salience).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012455387">51</xref></sup> The effect of attribute salience (second level) on object salience (first level), known as “compelling arguments,” has been explored in regard to issues and political candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012455387">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much literature has contributed to elaborating the role of substantive attributes and their impact on overall evaluations of objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012455387">53</xref></sup> In their experimental study, for instance, Kiousis, Bantimaroudis, and Ban found that portrayals of candidate qualifications influence affective perceptions of political candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012455387">54</xref></sup> However, not many studies have been conducted to explore the effects of affective attributes on overall evaluations of objects, and none, to our knowledge, has been conducted that explored an agenda-building analysis. Hence, the current study aims to examine the compelling-arguments hypothesis in a business context by focusing on affective attributes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077699012455387">
<title>Consequences of agenda building: Reputation and engagement</title>
<p>In the tradition of agenda-setting and agenda-building studies, overall object salience was examined by measuring public perceptions of importance (prominence) regarding the object in messages. The importance judgment refers to how important individuals think a certain object is compared to others: specifically, whether it is more important, more significant, more fundamental, and less trivial than other objects, and whether it has greater concern to them than other objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012455387">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a business context, scholars have examined the perceived importance of objects (i.e., corporations) with individual evaluations of corporate reputation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012455387">56</xref></sup> Carroll applied agenda-setting theory to business communication to explore the influence of news media on corporate reputation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012455387">57</xref></sup> A reputation is defined as “a perceptual representation of a company’s past actions and future prospects that describes the firm’s overall appeal to all of its key constituents when compared with other leading rivals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012455387">58</xref></sup> Wartick defined it as “the aggregation of a single stakeholder’s perceptions of how well organizational responses are meeting the demands and expectations of many organizational stakeholders.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012455387">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars have suggested name awareness or recall to explore the first level of agenda-setting effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012455387">60</xref></sup> In terms of the second level of agenda setting, scholars have examined overall corporate appeal and evaluations of several aspects of corporate traits (i.e., products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, financial strength, and social responsibility) to measure attribute salience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012455387">61</xref></sup> According to these scholars, overall corporate appeal consists of affective attributes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012455387">62</xref></sup> while the others consist of cognitive (substantive) attributes of a corporation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012455387">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Agenda-setting scholars have also focused on priming effects as a major consequence of agenda setting. In the political communication arena, prior scholarship has stated that how media describe particular political issues affects how politicians are evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077699012455387">64</xref></sup> Focusing on the second level of agenda setting in business news, scholars have found the effects of news coverage on corporate reputation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1077699012455387">65</xref></sup> The current study extended second-level agenda building into a business context to see how business issue descriptions shape public evaluations of corporations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1077699012455387">66</xref></sup> When news media prominently cover customer service issues, for example, customer service becomes the major criterion for customers to assess corporate reputation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prior studies have explored the influence of agenda building and agenda setting on a public’s behavioral intention. Weaver found that people engaged more in the issues that they assigned greater importance to than they did in other issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1077699012455387">67</xref></sup> Kiousis and McDevitt also supported agenda-setting effects on publics’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1077699012455387">68</xref></sup> Kiousis mentioned that “since mass media (from an agenda-setting perspective) tend to stimulate more thinking and learning about objects and attributes in people’s minds, one might consequently expect that this increased thinking would lead to strengthened attitudes” to explain the linkage between agenda-setting effects and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1077699012455387">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because online interactive communication tools have improved citizen-to-citizen discussion, past research has explained that participation in online conversations also increases public deliberation of issues, which contributes to improving subsequent public participation, such as community engagement or voting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1077699012455387">70</xref></sup> Hence, public engagement can also be explored in terms of public conversation activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1077699012455387">71</xref></sup> Public conversation activities have been measured by the amount of public conversations that occur in which individuals discuss social issues with friends and try to persuade others to change their behaviors.</p>
<p>Based on the compelling-arguments hypothesis about the effects of affective attributes on object salience and the role of emotions, this study proposes the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012455387" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> A positive tone in messages will affect publics’ evaluations of corporate reputation positively, while a negative tone in messages will affect publics’ evaluations of corporate reputation negatively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> Higher levels of arousal in messages will affect publics’ evaluations of corporate reputation positively.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The next set of hypotheses has been proposed to explore the effects of the two dimensions of affect in a public’s engagement intention. As previously mentioned, the valence of a message has an impact on the attitudinal consequences of messages. Positive messages facilitate favorable attitudes toward the source of messages. Also, arousal of a message evokes more cognitive thinking.</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012455387" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H3:</bold> A positive tone in messages will increase the likelihood that publics discuss the corporation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H4:</bold> A higher level of arousal in messages will increase the likelihood that publics discuss the corporation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, our last hypothesis proposes a relationship between public evaluations about a corporation and their conversational engagement intention.</p>
<list id="list3-1077699012455387" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H5:</bold> More positive public evaluations of a corporate reputation will result in more discussion of a corporation.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study used a 3 × 3 factorial (between-subjects) design for the experiment. It manipulated two independent variables regarding affective attributes of a fictitious corporation, in terms of valence (positive, neutral, and negative) and arousal (high, medium, and low).</p>
<sec id="section10-1077699012455387">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants in the study were undergraduate students at a large public university in the southeastern United States. The student participants were randomly assigned to one of nine treatment conditions, and each participant read a public relations message (a blog message) followed by a survey questionnaire. All messages were provided by a fictitious sportswear brand firm for this experiment, and the messages mentioned the corporation describing its customer service and products, along with a health message (i.e., let’s exercise and energize you).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077699012455387">
<title>Stimulus 1: Valence (tone)</title>
<p>The valence of a message describes how much a message portrayed the corporation positively or negatively. In this study, a positive message described the company’s excellence. Messages from the company included the following content: “the company won a prestigious national customer service award” and “inspirational and stylish graphic prints bring positive energy.” Also, the positive condition had positive comments from customers, such as “representatives are so kind. They get an A+!!!”</p>
<p>A neutral message described factual information about the company’s customer service and product design. For example, the following phrases were included: “the company organizes a customer support contractor team,” “the company introduced exercise clothes,” and “the service team has the answers to my question.”</p>
<p>Finally, a negative message described poor customer service and ugly product design from the apparel company. The following phrases were displayed: “the company was named worst customer service provider ever,” “design is ugly as sin,” and “awful service! They get an F!”</p>
<p>The valence of messages was measured by two 7-point semantic differential scales with the following word pairs: positive–negative and pleased–annoyed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1077699012455387">72</xref></sup> The scores were combined to assess the valence of the message (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = .85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077699012455387">
<title>Stimulus 2: Arousal</title>
<p>The level of arousal of a message describes the emotional appeal contained in messages. In the current research study, we manipulated the level of arousal with the use of emotional words and multimedia cues in the public relations message. Scholars have explained that both verbal and nonverbal expressions can affect the level of emotion. In an advertising setting, for instance, music was employed to manipulate the level of arousal of a message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1077699012455387">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars have stated that visual illustration (i.e., multimedia features, font, and colors) can be a predictor of the level of arousal of messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1077699012455387">74</xref></sup> Hence, high-arousal message groups were exposed to a public relations campaign video, and the messages contained several emotional words (i.e., <italic>energize, prestigious, exceptional, delightful, awful, horrible</italic>). At the medium level of arousal, the message contained emotional words without a video. Finally, the low-arousal message group was exposed to messages with less emotional words without a video. In both a pretest and the main study, the arousal of a message was measured by two 7-point Likert-type scales with the following items: aroused and stimulated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1077699012455387">75</xref></sup> The scores were combined to assess the arousal level of the message (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = .81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077699012455387">
<title>Reputation</title>
<p>After reading the blog message, each participant answered questions about the perceived reputation of the company in the message. Operationally, this study adopted multidimensional reputation items from the Reputation Quotient by Harris Interactive and the Reputation Institute. This indicator evaluates stakeholders’ perceptions about the most visible corporations from the United States and Europe by using six attributes and twenty subattribute items. The six items were vision and leadership, social responsibility, emotional appeal, products and services, workplace environment, and financial performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1077699012455387">76</xref></sup> The subattributes for the six categories are listed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1077699012455387">appendix</xref>, and each item was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077699012455387">
<title>Perceived conversational engagement intention</title>
<p>All participants answered questions about their perceived engagement intention to the corporation after reading public relations messages. Adopted from previous studies, discursive participation was measured by agreement scores with the following statements:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1077699012455387">77</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list4-1077699012455387" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“I would participate in an on-line forum to discuss the corporation in the near future.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I’d like to be engaged at least a few times per month in an Internet or instant-message ‘conversation’ about the corporation.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I would attend a formal or informal meeting to discuss the corporation.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I’d like to persuade someone about how to make purchasing decisions on the product/service of the corporation.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I’d like to persuade someone to alter their point of view on the corporation.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I’d like to have face-to-face or phone conversations about the corporation at least a few times per month.”</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077699012455387">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>Reliability of the dependent variables was measured by Cronbach’s alpha, and all the reliability scores were satisfactory for reputation (.93) and conversational engagement intention (.91). The reliability scores were also satisfactory for all categories of reputation, including product (.92), vision (.89), work (.93), social (.79), finance (.89), and appeal (.96). To increase the level of reliability, one item of reputation in the aspect of product/service was removed.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 204 undergraduates participated in this experiment. Six responses were removed due to the high number of missing values. A total of 198 students were randomly assigned into the nine different conditions. About 81% of participants were female, and about 86% were between 19 and 21 years old.</p>

<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>Nine different versions of messages were designed for the investigation, and manipulation of the independent variables was satisfactory. The two variables were successfully manipulated for valence (<italic>F</italic> = 113.995, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and arousal (<italic>F</italic> = 8.470, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, our findings supported the strong effects of affective attributes on the two dependent variables (reputation and conversational engagement). First, in terms of valence, this study found a significant main effect on overall reputation and conversational engagement intention about the corporation. In terms of arousal, the study found a significant main effect on overall reputation, but not on conversational engagement intention.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that agenda salience has an effect not only on issue importance, but also on other consequences of attitudes and behavioral intentions. Previously, the outcomes of agenda building (or agenda setting) have been explored in terms of priming effects regarding how publics perceive certain issues to be more important than others. In addition to cognitive attention, our results showed that attribute salience relationships have significant meanings in public relations by demonstrating impacts of attitudinal outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current study tried to expand our understanding of affect in communication processes in a public relations context. People do not think rationally all the time; rather, they can make evaluations or judgments habitually, without in-depth thinking. In these cases, emotions and mood play a critical role in affecting evaluations and judgments. The effect of emotions and affect has been explored in the context of educational materials and customer marketing strategies. The impacts of affect on public opinion are also important in public relations. In particular, reputation and engagement intention were explored in the current study as two of the essential outcomes of public relations in a business context.</p>
<p>More theoretical implications of this study involve the following agenda-building process and consequences. First, the current study theoretically aimed to test the compelling-arguments hypothesis about the effects of affective attributes (second level) on object salience and evaluation (first level).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1077699012455387">78</xref></sup> As our results revealed, main effects were found from both affective attributes (valence and arousal) on the perceived reputation of corporations. Prior studies have observed that people feel favorably about subjects when they read positively framed messages and arousing messages. Our results also demonstrated that people’s favorable feelings lead to favorable evaluations of the sources of messages, which, in this case, are corporations in a business communication context. Also, positive evaluations made people more likely to discuss the corporation.</p>
<p>Second, this investigation examined the effect of affective attributes that represent a less-developed area in agenda-building scholarship. Scholars have distinguished between two levels of agenda building and agenda setting. The first level of agenda building refers to the salience of objects, and the second level of agenda building refers to how certain objects are conveyed in messages. The second level of agenda building also has two dimensions: substantive and affective attributes. Even though past research has emphasized the role of emotion in agenda-building and agenda-setting relationships, affective attributes have been examined less compared to substantive attributes (i.e., frames).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1077699012455387">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the current study added to our understanding of the effects of emotions (or affects) in the communication process. As prior scholarship has mentioned, affect in messages influences readers’ memory performance and the perceived credibility of the source of messages. Affect has been explored, in terms of the valence of messages, in prior agenda-building and agenda-setting studies. However, in supporting positive effects on object evaluations (i.e., reputation), this study expanded our understanding of the role of affective attributes in an agenda-building framework by integrating two dimensions: valence and arousal. For example, prior studies suggested that visual illustrations, including multimedia, have stronger message impact than text-only messages by stimulating readers’ feelings. Our results also showed that arousal messages (using embedded media content combined with more emotional words) led to more favorable evaluations of the company in the message and, thus, serve as a relevant springboard for the future study of the consequences of agenda building from a public relations perspective.</p>
<p>Another theoretical contribution of the current study was its exploration of the effects of agenda building using an experimental design. Agenda-building theory has traditionally examined the agenda transfer between external sources and media, and between external sources and public opinion. In particular, public relations efforts, through information subsidies, have been largely studied in prior scholarship as one of the major external resources in an agenda-building framework.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1077699012455387">80</xref></sup> These studies have analyzed communication content (i.e., information subsidies and media coverage) and compared it with public opinion to investigate the correlations among agendas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1077699012455387">81</xref></sup> Kiousis, Bantimaroudis, and Ban conducted an experimental study and found that portrayals of candidate qualifications can shape affective perceptions of political candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1077699012455387">82</xref></sup> However, there have not been many studies that have examined the direct effects of agenda building in an experimental setting. Hence, the present study contributed by adding empirical evidence regarding causal relationships in an agenda-building context.</p>
<p>The significant main effects of valence and arousal help to highlight some practical implications from the current study. Public relations scholars and practitioners have focused on the effectiveness of public relations efforts from the perspective of management. Our results showed that affective attributes of a corporate blog message shape not only affective evaluations of a corporation, but also cognitive and overall evaluations of the corporation. This implies that more positive and stimulating messages should yield favorable public relations outcomes, in terms of corporate reputation.</p>
<p>Another consequence of the agenda-building effects investigated in the current study was the exploration of publics’ conversational engagement intention. Instead of voting intention in political public relations, this study measured the level of engagement by how likely people would be to talk about a corporation and its products/services in a corporate public relations context. This investigation found that participants who read either positive or neutral messages are more willing to talk about the company or its products/services than those who read a negative public relations message. Also, our results showed that public relations materials that include stimulating messages may lead to favorable thoughts or evaluations of the organization; however, the effects were not observed at the attitudinal or behavioral level. In spite of its significant effects on communication process, public relations practitioners need to think strategically when using affective messages.</p>
<p>Although it has theoretical and practical implications, some limitations also exist with this analysis. First, this study used a fictitious business brand to remove the effect of previous brand perceptions; however, such a name makes it difficult for participants to evaluate corporate reputation, due to the lack of information and experience with the organization. Reputation can be developed over a long period, and one-time exposure may be insufficient to explore people’s evaluation of corporate reputation. Also, the participants of this experiment were mostly female and nineteen to twenty-one years old. The media use of this group may fundamentally differ from the use of other age groups, and this difference may have an influence on the results. Hence, future research needs to be conducted with broader groups, in terms of age, gender, and income levels.</p>
<p>Moreover, the present investigation manipulated the level of arousal by using extreme words (e.g., <italic>fantastic, horrible</italic>, etc.) and multimedia content (i.e., YouTube video). Music and images have been used to manipulate emotional appeals of a message; however, due to the lack of prior scholarship about the role of affect, there are no standard methods to manipulate the level of arousal in messages. Hence, we suggest using other approaches for manipulating the level of arousal in future study.</p>
<p>In closing, the nature of the media environment is growing more complex, and the current study contributes to our understanding of how to use affective attributes effectively for better public relations in this ever-changing communication environment.</p>
