<abstract>
<p>Little is known about how a family in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) makes decisions on cross-border study. International marketers and managers in higher education turn to research based on Chinese student preferences. However, such research ignores cultural traditions steeped in Confucian ideals of family and the subsequent roles and influence of parents. Using surveys and interviews with Chinese students our findings indicate that despite exponential financial and social development in contemporary Chinese society, traditional Confucian values are still largely upheld by parents. The influence of these parents extends beyond initial decision making and impacts on the student’s social and academic well-being. To effectively market, manage and provide academic and welfare support for Chinese students studying across borders requires host universities to develop strategies that acknowledge and demonstrate respect for cultural traditions, parental perspectives and related ongoing influences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the People’s Republic of China’s growth in economic prosperity and political influence, the number of PRC students choosing to study overseas continues to increase. Of the 3.3 million internationally mobile students, the PRC was the largest source country. In the academic year 2009-2010 there were more than 127,628 PRC students studying in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311418517">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2010</xref>). The motivations for PRC students seeking education abroad include a belief that it will open opportunities for increased wealth and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311418517">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311418517">Li &amp; Bray, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Hong Kong, with its geographical proximity, high quality of competitively priced education, and shared Confucian cultural heritage, is an attractive option for PRC students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>). Like other Asian governments, Hong Kong is proactively pursuing international and PRC students through a range of policy and educational initiatives. In 2009-2010 there were 9,320 nonlocal students pursuing full-time higher education degrees in Hong Kong, an increase of 200% from 2003 to 2004, and of these, most were PRC students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311418517"><italic>University Grants Committee</italic>, 2010</xref>). Both the HKSAR government and the PRC government see these students as a means of brain gain and future sociopolitical and economic stability and survival.</p>
<p>To understand the international and cross-border movement of PRC students researchers, marketers and recruiters have focused on the perspectives of these students. However, in traditional Confucian societies such as the PRC, major decisions related to education and future employment are very much a family, if not a solely, parental affair. However, we know little about how contemporary PRC families make such decisions. This article reports on a study of PRC higher education student perspectives on the level of personal and parent involvement in the decision to study across the border in Hong Kong. The first section of the article examines the concept of translocal and cross-border study, research on PRC students and study, as well as the effects of transnational study on PRC families. An overview of the study context and design then follows. The final sections present the findings and the implications for international stakeholders who play host to PRC students.</p>

<sec id="section2-1028315311418517">
<title>Background to the Study</title>
<p>PRC parents are prepared to endure financial, social, and emotional hardship to secure high-quality education for their child. Therefore, it is common for PRC children starting elementary school to find themselves living away from home, a practice that may continue throughout their education. To understand the motivations and factors affecting such practice the literature has focused on opportunities that exist for them across borders or internationally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311418517">Gao &amp; Liu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311418517">Knight, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311418517">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311418517">2009</xref>). <italic>Cross-border study</italic> is an accepted term to describe the movement of students to other countries to undertake their studies. Within the context of this study (Hong Kong) it could well be argued that <italic>translocal</italic> study may be a more appropriate term. This is defined as the movement of students beyond the immediate geographical (local) area across provincial and state lines but remaining within the national border (international). However, given the ongoing cultural influences developed under British colonial rule prior to 1997, particularly in the area of education, Hong Kong has in many aspects more in common with Western culture than it does with the PRC itself. Therefore, given the paucity of literature available on translocal mobility for educational purposes, to get a sense of perspectives and the likely influence on familial decision making we need to draw from studies of cross-border education.</p>
<sec id="section3-1028315311418517">
<title>PRC Students and Cross-Border Education</title>
<p>What motivates PRC students to embark on cross-border education? What are they looking for in a study-abroad destination and program? In answering such questions studies have identified push-pull factors that affect student decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311418517">Hung, Chung, &amp; Ho, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311418517">Hung, Shive, Wang, &amp; Diu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311418517">Li &amp; Bray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311418517">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>). “Push” factors are those that operate within a country and initiate a student’s decision to undertake study abroad. These include economic, social, and political forces within the source country and can be factors such as future migration opportunities after graduation, high quality of education, and comparatively low tuition fees and cost of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311418517">Hung et al., 2000</xref>). “Pull” factors are those that make a country attractive to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311418517">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>), such as knowledge and awareness of the institution’s reputation, support for international students, and recommendations from friends, relatives, or parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311418517">Hung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311418517">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>). Of concern in this research is the absence of reference to the culture from which the students are drawn. Inadvertently they characterize the PRC student as a highly individualistic individual, free to make choices pursuant to the factors that influence his or her reported decision making.</p>
<p>PRC students largely grow up in a culture rich in Confucian ideals—one that values education highly, respects family traditions and authority, and one that is steeped in the ideals of “filial piety” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311418517">Salili, Fu, Tong, &amp; Tabatabai, 2001</xref>, p. 129). Filial piety is a cornerstone of Confucian Chinese culture. In essence, it requires of all children that they respect their parents, obey them, take care of them as they age, advise them in later life, and love them.</p>
<p>A Confucian cultural context has a significant effect on the status of the child and the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311418517">Deutsch, 2006</xref>). For the child, cross-border study in Hong Kong may represent an enviable option to be one step closer to the wider, more prosperous Western world and an escape from the rigidity and closed competitive exam–driven system in the PRC. However, for the PRC parent, the choice of study in another country signifies a literal investment in his or her own survival and family’s future. For among all other benefits associated with cross-border study, such study has the potential to lead to high-paid employment opportunities and citizenship status in the destination society. Consequently, attempts to understand the motivations and decision making concerning cross-border education involving PRC must include an understanding of the fact that students must pay homage to cultural traditions and practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1028315311418517">
<title>Cross-Border Higher Education: Benefits and Sacrifices for the PRC Family</title>
<p>The decision to undertake cross-border education is for some wealthier PRC families accompanied by a related decision or desire to relocate the entire family or selected family members to support the child. In doing so, the family undergoes considerable stresses and changes, as they must meet the same family needs in a different cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311418517">Landolt &amp; Da, 2005</xref>). Such practices often result in a “split-household,” with the spouses living in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311418517">Waters, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The exclusiveness of cross-border education facilitates the acquisition of the necessary cultural capital (the use of English as a global language) and social capital (social networks) needed for a top job (increased financial reward). The idiosyncratic path that these Chinese families and/or students choose serves to exclude many compatriot PRC locals from joining their ranks and with that their respective social and financial privileges.</p>
<p>In line with Confucian views of family, PRC parents, and extended family in some cases, are prepared to commit extensive amounts of money and family involvement to their child who is studying abroad, and the risks that these students and their families face when undertaking such ventures are of vital concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311418517">Kell &amp; Vogl, 2008</xref>). With so much at stake for many PRC families, a clear understanding of the needs and expectations of the family, and the deliberations they go through in reaching a decision are facets of cross-border education that the academic community and marketers need to understand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1028315311418517">
<title>Transnational Family, Education, and Translocality</title>
<p>The promise or desire to emigrate is a major factor in PRC parent decision making when it comes to the choice of study abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>). Comparing the migrant families of the PRC and El Salvador, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311418517">Landolt and Da (2005)</xref> discovered that contemporary Chinese emigration occurred in three stages.</p>
<p>First there are individuals and families that emigrate due to the sending and receiving of state incentive policies; a second group of urban and educated individuals, who are able to mobilize information and financial support through their personal networks to take advantage of study abroad programmes . . . to apply as independent class immigrants and, third, there is a growing pool of workers who are willing to risk their lives to exit China through undocumented and unauthorized means. (p. 634)</p>
<p>A number of factors bring about the push or motivation to shift locales for the purpose of education. Translocal migration theorists stress that large-scale mobility within (internal migration) or out of a country (transnational migration) only occurs when there is unevenness endemic within the country. Such unevenness occurs when certain parts of a country are involved in the “circulation of capital, ideas and images, goods and styles, services and diseases,” while others are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311418517">Oakes &amp; Schein, 2006</xref>). Translocality is thought to be encouraged by states so that resolution of contradictory social forces can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311418517">Oakes &amp; Schein, 2006</xref>). The unequal concentration of capital, goods, and images and the imbalance created, rather than just the circulation of people, is seen as important in understanding the boom in translocal activities, such as internal migration for the purposes of education within the PRC. The motivation then for PRC students who choose cross-border or translocal study in Hong Kong may be influenced by such inequalities within the PRC and the perception that the host country is a gateway to the ultimate goal of a life in a more open and affluent “Western” society.</p>
<p>Motivations aside, within the PRC there exists a substantially unequal concentration and access to capital or goods (both private and public). More often than not, this is reflected in the type of <italic>hukou</italic> (household registration) that an individual holds or the province, provincial capital, or cities of one’s <italic>hukou</italic>. Such factors have a potential effect on the type of education available and future employment opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311418517">Chan &amp; Zhang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311418517">Fan, 2008</xref>). The differentiation of educational opportunity within China arises as a consequence of the political and development path the country has taken. These are fundamental overlooked reasons that may well influence decisions to consider cross-border movement in the pursuit of education.</p>
<p>Previous studies on cross-border-education-bound PRC families are sensitive to the gender dimension and focus less on the decision-making process and more on the role of “<italic>pei du ma mas</italic>” or “study mothers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311418517">Chua, 2003</xref>). The families in such studies are portrayed as unified when making education decisions. What is also unclear is whether the child has a say in deciding his or her life and career goals and how such decisions are executed in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311418517">Whyte, 1997</xref>). What happens in Mainland Chinese Confucian families if different interests and ideals surface during the decision-making process? Are students affected by their perceived level of involvement in family decisions? The answers to such questions form the basis of this study.</p>

<sec id="section6-1028315311418517">
<title>Study Context and Design</title>
<p>The mixed-method study design involved a two-phase strategy. The quantitative phase involved 95 PRC students completing a questionnaire. Forty-four students were from the large Mainland Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, whereas 36 were from smaller provincial cities such as Chengdu, Nanjing, and Wuhan. Students from these cities have larger disposable incomes than the final 20 who were from outlying northern and western provinces.</p>
<p>The second, a qualitative phase, involved interviews with 24 volunteer students who had previously completed the questionnaires. Phase 1 generated statistical information, whereas in Phase 2 interviews probed participant thinking and decision making with regard to items provided in the questionnaire. All students involved in the study were enrolled in undergraduate programs in Hong Kong higher education institutions. Employing two methods of gathering data allowed for the convergence and corroboration of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311418517">Golafshani, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1028315311418517">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>Based on a review of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311418517">Fong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311418517">Yau &amp; Smetana, 2003</xref>), the questionnaire involved lists of common information-gathering sources and factors previously reported as influences in family decision making. Since the students were nonnative speakers of English back translation was used to ensure the meaning and responses to each question were conveyed. That is, the English questionnaire was translated into Mandarin Chinese and participants were given the option of which language to use when completing it. Those questionnaires completed in Chinese were translated into English prior to analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1028315311418517">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>In total, 24 students were interviewed. Details of background, demographics, and contact information were recorded. Like the questionnaires, students to be interviewed were given a choice of language. The aim was facilitate their ability to convey perceptions of their role in decision making with regard to the choice to study abroad. The open-ended interactive interview asked students to respond to the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1028315311418517" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Tell me about the choice to study abroad.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What was your role in the decision to study in Hong Kong?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What was your parent’s role?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If differences of opinion arose in the process, how were these differences resolved?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The semistructured approach gave the interviewer and the interviewee space to discuss and explore topics of interest with the participants. Each interview lasted for between 45 min to 1.5 hr. The interviews took place in university coffee shops, meetings rooms, or other public areas around the campuses involved. The interviews conducted in Mandarin Chinese were transcribed into English. Analysis involved noting the frequency of similar responses, drawing connections between ideas or comments presented, and identifying patterns of associations between different items. Interview data were entered into NVivo to assist with the analysis. Transcripts of interviews were returned to the students for credibility and accuracy checks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1028315311418517">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>In the PRC, strong expressions of personal feelings or the divulging of personal information about family have been discouraged by centuries of cultural norms grounded in Confucian ethics. PRC students are taught to respect their elders, their teachers, and their extended families, including parents, grandparents, uncles, and aunts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311418517">Sartor, 2009</xref>). Understanding such cultural beliefs and practices influenced our choice of snowballing or chain-referral sampling as a tool for identifying participants to be interviewed. These methods work on the assumption that peers are better able to recruit members than are researchers and that such sampling techniques assist in maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of participants in difficult-to-access populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311418517">Penrod, Preston, Cain, &amp; Starks, 2003</xref>). Aware of the potential for snowballing to result in similar types of informants, we limited the referrals to not more than two from any one source. The participants interviewed were all working toward undergraduate degrees, and none had worked full-time before coming to Hong Kong to study. All participants were only children in their families—a fact consistent with China’s one-child policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311418517">Chow &amp; Zhao, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the participants sampled 67 (71%) were from large Mainland cities such as Beijing and Shanghai in which households have larger disposable incomes, whereas 25 (27%) were from smaller provincial cities such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Liaoning, and 3 (2%) participants were from outlying provinces.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1028315311418517">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Two general categories of students emerged from the data, those students who raised the idea of studying in Hong Kong and those whose parents first raised the idea of studying in Hong Kong. The general categories were found to affect subsequent issues related to the students’ perceived and experienced level of involvement in the decision-making process.</p>
<sec id="section11-1028315311418517">
<title>Initiating the Idea of Studying in Hong Kong</title>
<p>Of the 95 students surveyed 44.2% (42) indicated that they were the ones to suggest the idea of studying in Hong Kong. Within this group, 100% originated from large PRC cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>For 55.8% (53) of students, it was the parents or a family member who first suggested the idea of studying in Hong Kong. Of this group, 48% (25) were from the larger PRC cities, whereas 52% (28) were from smaller provincial cities or Western “country” provinces.</p>
<p>For those interviewed (24), 42% (10) reported that they initiated the idea of pursuing undergraduate education in Hong Kong. The remaining 58% (14) indicated that it was one or both parents who first raised the idea and subsequently promoted the idea of studying in Hong Kong.</p>

<sec id="section12-1028315311418517">
<title>Factors Influencing Student Choice of Hong Kong as a Study Destination</title>
<p>The decision by students to initiate family discussion of study in Hong Kong was influenced by a number of factors. These included a genuine interest, stories from other students, or family visits to Hong Kong. In all cases this led to a search for information about how they could study in the city.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was secondary two when Hong Kong and Macau opened for individual Mainland [China] travellers. So we came to Hong Kong and stayed for some time and had a look at all the universities and I decided that I would come here to study. We [parents and student] were lost in Tsim Sha Tsui and we drifted into the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It was then I understood that universities can be like this. On the Mainland, all universities have walls and try to keep you out. But there you can just walk as you like and you can get to the centre of the academic buildings. . . . we agreed this was where I wanted to go . . . and I started to look for information. (Mei—student name changed to protect privacy; Shenzhen is the name of home city)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other students were inspired by stories told by alumni in their secondary schools and relatives who had studied in Hong Kong. Home provinces were seen as “lacking opportunities,” whereas Hong Kong was viewed as “a land of opportunity.”</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was in Year 2 at high school, a senior went back to my secondary school to report her experience of studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and briefed us about the university system in Hong Kong. She said that Hong Kong is a very open, international place . . . you get a lot of opportunities if you can grasp them. I think this is the point that attracted us the most. (Lorita—Guiyang)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apart from those attracted by the image of freedom, prosperity, and openness of the city, 25% of the students who initiated discussions about study in Hong Kong did so as a consequence of their public examination scores. Either they had performed less well in their public exams or feared that intense competition for university places in their home cities could result in their not making the quota cutoff in their desired course. Others feared that on graduation they might not be able to find employment.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I never thought about coming to Hong Kong before, I just thought that I would get into a university on the Mainland, then it would be okay, but later I didn’t get into the Mainland university which I had chosen as my first choice . . . so Hong Kong was the next best option. (Cherry—Beijing)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Close friends or relatives in other countries also encouraged families to consider Hong Kong as a transitional step toward an education and life in the West.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted to go abroad, but I also feel that Hong Kong is not bad. . . . My parents agreed to send me abroad, but to Hong Kong first . . . also because if I go further abroad now, I have to rely on my parents for money . . . coming here [Hong Kong] . . . doesn’t not cost so much. (Sophia—Shenzhen)</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section13-1028315311418517">
<title>Influences on Parents’ Choice of Hong Kong as a Study Destination</title>
<p>Survey data indicate that for 55.8% (53) of students it was the parents who first suggested the idea of study in Hong Kong. Of this group, 52% of students came from nonkey cities of the western provinces or provincial capitals of inland China. The remaining 48% came from provincial capitals of the eastern provinces.</p>
<p>The parents of students from these provincial cities expended much effort in putting their child into a key secondary school or private education in their home province. This often involved a split-household family strategy whereby the child, from an early age, was placed in a school far away from his or her family home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311418517">Waters, 2005</xref>). The choice of Hong Kong was seen as an extension of this strategy and confirmation of the parent’s desire for the best education possible. The students’ understanding of why their parents initiated their study in Hong Kong was associated with pragmatic concerns such as the fear that their child’s academic ability would not allow them to get into a good PRC university, considerations about future PRC-based employment prospects, and awareness of the chance to obtain permanent residency.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because unemployment on the Mainland is a real issue and Hong Kong’s employment rate is slightly better my parents pushed for Hong Kong.

<p>Although parents initiated discussion and ultimately made the choice of Hong Kong as a study-abroad destination, for 35% (19) of students this choice came as a surprise, given that their parents were not supportive of study abroad. Studying across the border in Hong Kong study was seen as a much better alternative given its proximity to the Chinese Mainland and its Chinese cultural heritage.</p>

<title>Issues in Confucian Family Decision Making</title>
<p>Four key issues arose or were reported to be used by parents in family discussions and decision making. These included gaining permanent residence, financing study, working and settling in the host country following graduation, and program and university selection. The level of emphasis placed on these issues affected the students’ perceived level of involvement in the process of family decision making. In addition, the parents were found to apply a range of tactics to select their preferred program and university and then convince and cajole their child around to their way of thinking.</p>
<sec id="section15-1028315311418517">
<title>Permanent residence</title>
<p>Gaining permanent residence (PR) in Hong Kong and settlement were perceived by 50% (48) of all students as a major motivating issue in parental support or push for study in Hong Kong. PR was viewed by parents as a very attractive option, allowing more mobility to travel to other foreign countries without [PRC] visa requirements and entitlement to social services and welfare.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t really thought through it yet, but I am thinking that I want to continue to study after graduation, but I am not sure where. My mother said that it would be better to get the permanent residency since I am here and so I have to stay for seven years. I also think this is right, because it is more convenient for you to go abroad if you belong to Hong Kong [rather] than the Mainland. (Lai Pui—Beijing)</p>

<title>Financing cross-border study</title>
<p>Financing the costs of tuition and living costs as indicated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>) was a factor discussed by their families in relation to cross-border study. For 89.5% (85) students surveyed in this study, one or both parents remained the major provider(s) of finance for their cross-border study. The remaining 10.5% (10) students were on a range of academic scholarships but also reported that their parents provided supplementary finances as needed.</p>
<p>Of the group of students who initiated discussion of study in Hong Kong, 100% reported in our survey and during interviews that finance was not an issue in family discussions. Of those interviewed from this group the common response was that they did not believe that financing their cross-border study would impose any real financial pressure on their families. Another general sentiment expressed was that costs of study in Hong Kong are much less than those in the United Kingdom, Australia, or the United States.</p>
<p>For the students whose parents initiated study in Hong Kong, 75% (40) of students indicated that finance was not used as a major factor but was a factor discussed. However, for 25% (14) in the same group the students reported that their parents used the issue of finances to convince them of the value of Hong Kong over other countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1028315311418517">
<title>Working and settling</title>
<p>Several interviewees whose parents made the decision for them to study in Hong Kong became emotional as they recounted their decision-making process and the actual process of relocation. Others recalled how their parents worked to have them “internalize the benefits” of their (the parent’s) decision making. For some, the parents indicated a willingness to relocate themselves to the province of Guangdong, the closest PRC province to Hong Kong, to be closer to their child. Others expressed a preparedness to shuttle the student (their child) or themselves between Hong Kong and their home for visits. However, having a choice to return to their home following graduation was not a realistic option for 25% (24) of students.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My parents gave me no choice about staying in Hong Kong to work. My grandparents don’t want me to be too far away. My parents are concerned about the expenses of studying abroad. . . . So they want me to be somewhere they can make visits. . . . They say when you are here, you are still near home, you can go back whenever you want . . . and there are more guarantees for jobs. The unemployment rate is low there. We (PRC people) have our small edge in Hong Kong; we can speak both Mandarin Chinese and English. (Winnie—Beijing)</p>

<title>Applying pressure: Parent tactics</title>
<p>Of all students studied, 100% reported and described parents using strategies ranging from gentle cajoling to heavy-handed coercive approaches during family discussions. Students of the group whose parents made the decision to study in Hong Kong expressed more grievances against their parents and more disaffection about their studies than the group of students who initiated study in Hong Kong.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have my own interest. I want to study design. But he (father) feels that English is better, more practical. My interest cannot link to this reality. I cannot do what I am interested in. Most of my fellow students are like me and basically cannot choose their interested subject as major. They choose for me a practical path to support the family. I do not love what I am doing, 90 per cent of them [PRC friends] do not, which is a real concern. (Cherry—Chongqing)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tactics used included parents intervening in discussions and applications, imposing suggestions, and manipulating the application process. For one student, the parent (a father) insisted that his child enter a program of study based on what he believed was an “appropriate” choice for a female.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My father was very enthusiastic about me going away to study. After failing to persuade me to stop talking about study locally he switched to arguing about what was “proper” and “appropriate” for a women. Then when my local [PRC] university called home to notify me about getting a place, he deliberately withheld this piece of information. I was thereby compelled to accept the offer of the program in Hong Kong instead (Xuan—Ningbo).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Some parents’ participation in the decision-making process involved “skillfully shaping and moulding” the aspirations of their child. Students who experienced such parental involvement expressed an “understanding” of their parent’s motivations and were amenable to the parents’ persuasion; however, not all were happy with the outcome.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted to study in Hong Kong, but wasn’t sure about being a teacher. I was afraid that it would be very boring and exhausting.

But I was bullied and pushed, so how could I disagree. (Angel—Suzhou)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section22-1028315311418517">
<title>Translocal Study—Making Choices</title>
<p>Our findings identified two main types of students, those who initiated the idea of studying in Hong Kong and those whose parents initiated the idea. In the process of initiation and making decisions, Confucian cultural roles of child and parent were largely followed. The findings also suggest that though the factors that motivate students and parents to pursue translocal or cross-border study may be different, all pay homage to Confucian ideals and in so doing ensure greater security for the family and family members.</p>
<p>The students were motivated by the employment and study opportunities offered by cross border education, the personal experience of visiting the country, the influence of family and friends, and stories by peers who had returned to give school talks. The influencing factors that “pushed” them to seek cross-border study are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311418517">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>). The students viewed Mainland Chinese higher education as limited educationally and felt that a degree from Hong Kong or from overseas generally would lead to enhanced language proficiency and the development of networks that would help secure higher-paid employment either in China or in Hong Kong. The exclusive nature of cross-border education increases the student’s perceived educative and social status over students who elect to study for a local degree in Mainland China. Added to this are perceptions that a local Chinese degree may not be as well recognized internationally as a degree obtained from a nonlocal institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311418517">Lin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents, on the other hand, considered the competition for university places, future employment prospects, and the longer-term prospects of immigration as the main motivating factors. The desire for the child to emigrate is consistent with PRC parent decision making when it comes to the choice of cross-border study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311418517">Bodycott, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>No matter who initiated the discussion about cross-border or translocal study, there was evidence that students did feel they had a say in the decision making process. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311418517">Xia et al. (2004)</xref> study that found that Mainland Chinese parents listened more and involved their adolescent children more in family decisions. However, for the majority of students in this study (65%) the eventual decision on choice of country, program, and/or university was made by the parents. What the research does not provide is information about the actual family communication processes that occurred during such discussions; that is, the roles played and resources used by individual family members. Such information is important to an understanding of the influence of culture and cultural change in Chinese family processes brought on by political and social change and increased economic prosperity.</p>
<p>What the study demonstrates is the crucial role PRC parents play in the decision to undertake cross-border higher education study. This role is shaped in part by their financial status, their personal education, and their Confucian culture. Those parents who were more supportive or open to their child’s choices more often came from the wealthier city provinces and/or who had had personal experience of international study themselves. Although some parents initiated or took subtle control of the decision-making process, others overtly shaped and manipulated the aspirations of their child according to gender stereotypes and the longer-term needs and values of the family. Such practices are consistent with traditional Confucian traditions and the values associated with filial piety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311418517">Deutsch, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Ninety-eight percent of students expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of the decision-making process and/or with the outcome. However, all obligingly or somewhat reluctantly accepted the decision. For a small number of participants (15%), the parents were perceived by their child to totally ignore their preferences. This behavior is consistent with Confucian roles and expectations of the child—respect for family authority and unquestioning obedience to parents. From a Western perspective many of the tactics used are consistent with an authoritarian approach to parenting in which parents make decisions and tell their children what to do. However, discussions with students revealed that they believed their parents were acting in their (adolescent child’s) interests and their behavior was consistent with being supportive and responsive to their needs. This is consistent with the tradition of authoritative parenting—parenting that provides rules and guidance with concern for the child but without being overbearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311418517">Baumrind, 2005</xref>). Our findings indicate that despite exerting considerable psychological and literal control over aspects of translocal study decision making, there was evidence that the cultural traditions were softening, with adolescent children having somewhat greater involvement in the decision-making process though not controlling much of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1028315311418517">
<title>Hong Kong as a Study Destination</title>
<p>The choice of Hong Kong as a translocal study destination was like all decisions to undertake cross border study, that is, a literal investment in the family’s survival and future. In many ways it provided a safe alternative. Its shared Confucian Chinese heritage was seen as an advantage as were the British colonialists’ influences on government infrastructure, including higher education. It provided a metaphoric bridge to the wider, more prosperous Western world and an escape from the rigidity and closed competitive exam–driven education system in the PRC. The more open financial, education, and immigration systems combined with cost-effective high-quality higher education and related opportunity were viewed as advantages over study in more distant study locales. Changes in HKSAR government immigration legislation are consistent with the factors that influence parent decision making. The period of full-time study counts as time accrued toward achieving the 7- year mandatory period to achieve permanent residency. In addition, Mainland Chinese students are permitted to remain in Hong Kong following graduation to seek employment.</p>
<p>An examination of Mainland Chinese decision making about cross-border or translocal study in Hong Kong provides a unique insight into the influence of Confucianism and the family. On the one hand, we see the adolescent child, often in contradiction to his or her own desires, adhering to the cultural values, expectations, and choices of his or her parents. On the other hand, we see how parents use their culturally derived status and power to manipulate decisions in order to achieve what they believe is the very best education for their child and in so doing ensure their own and their family’s longer-term status and security.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1028315311418517">
<title>Consequences of Decisions Made</title>
<p>We found that in Hong Kong, many PRC students banded together in groups with other such students, with many of them sharing similar feelings of frustration with family decision making and the translocation experience. The students reported that though these groups, often established by host institutions, acted as supports, they also fuelled a level of resentment and an ongoing antagonism toward parents.</p>
<p>The perceived level of participation in family decision making was found to have ongoing effects on student well-being and their approach and attitude toward their studies. With the support of Mainland Chinese group and society members, a kind of subversive noncommunicative planning had begun for future work and study. On the surface, the students continued to live their lives in a practical manner, to complete assignments diligently and maintain a relatively positive attitude. However, they admitted to suffering high levels of anxiety brought on by ongoing parental pressure, control over decisions and finances, and the fact that they were studying in a locale, a university or program not of their choosing. The organization and functioning of these ethnic enclaves and support groups that readily appear on university campuses is an area worthy of future study</p>
<p>For some students in this study, 15% (14), there was the added stress that the future security of their families hinged on their achieving certain specific outcomes and that the cost of funding their cross-border study was an ongoing issue for the family. The pressure to succeed in the shortest amount of time possible was a major concern for this group. This stress led to frequent bouts of sickness and depression.</p>
<p>Differences in academic systems, while a reason stated for pursing translocal study in Hong Kong, also resulted in challenges for PRC students. Language barriers were noted as a barrier to social inclusion. Hong Kong’s higher education system is largely conducted in English, and the language of the street is a mix of English and Cantonese dialect as compared to Mandarin on the Mainland. The students also experienced issues related to interacting with professors, levels of cultural difference, discrimination, and challenges of personal adjustment. These findings highlight the need for universities in Hong Kong as elsewhere to consider the effects of sociocultural adjustment and acculturation associated with study across borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311418517">Yoon &amp; Portman, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1028315311418517">
<title>Limitations and Future Studies</title>
<p>All students involved in this study are currently studying in Hong Kong higher education institutions, and the study draws on students who are largely from Mainland Chinese “Tier 1” cities; those with the highest income per family, the largest population base, and the largest gross domestic profit, with the largest amounts of disposable income. The results from this study may not be generalizable to Chinese students studying in other countries or those from regional or lower-tier cities and the rural provinces of China. Future studies should examine the views of these groups as well as incorporating methods that ensure that greater numbers of students are surveyed and interviewed. Also future studies should include the views of all family members involved in the cross-border decision-making process, such as mothers, fathers, and grandparents. Similarly future studies should consider a broader range of factors such as parent education, family income, <italic>hukou</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311418517">Fan, 2008</xref>) and the resources used in making decisions. Although this study focused on nuclear families, future studies could involve a broader spectrum of family and family members to include, for example, single-parent families and extended family members. Longitudinal case studies of PRC family decision making and influence throughout cross-border study would provide a more complete causal picture of culture, cultural change, and the power of individuals as issues are encountered and respective decisions made.</p>
<p>What the study does provide are insights into the changing nature and influence of Confucian culture in contemporary Chinese families. It also provides information invaluable to international higher education institutions in China, international higher education marketers and agents who recruit Mainland Chinese adolescent students, and the institutions who play host to increasing numbers of them. Individuals in this study were affected by the cultural practices related to role and decision making in the home and by sociocultural adjustment in the selected host country and institution.</p>
<p>Although not the focus of this study, students reported experiencing a myriad of emotions, including feelings of isolation and even hostility to peers and family. These feelings were compounded by related decisions made in the home and were fuelled by involvement in organized groups and societies on campuses. The expectations of PRC parents as indicated are intense and can lead to some students imagining a lack of control of their own destiny, emotional distress, and at times, an inability to cope. Future studies need to examine the establishment, role, and outcomes of organized ethnic societies on university campuses. In recognition of the cultural and social needs and goals of PRC and all international students and their acculturation processes, there needs to be a closer study of the policies, strategies, and services provided to support their inclusion, involvement, and integration. Failure to do so will lead to ongoing confinement and isolation from the wider university community, similar to that reported by Xu Zhiyuan in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311418517">Yee (2011)</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study takes a mixed-method questionnaire-and-interview approach to examine the influence of culture on Mainland Chinese family’s decision making about study outside their home country. Drawing on the perceptions of students, significant differences were found between the role and focus of children (students) and their parents at the first and final stages of decision making. Furthermore, the roles identified during and following decision making were found to be consistent with Confucian family traditions, roles, and the related values of filial piety.</p>
<p>When combined the family decision-making experience and cultural heritage as reflected in the decision-making process were found to inflict significant social and emotional impacts on the students and their coping ability while studying translocally in Hong Kong. Such an impact is viewed as having the potential to affect the ongoing success or otherwise of the student’s acculturation into the host culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311418517">Padilla &amp; Perez, 2003</xref>). As such, universities who recruit and play host to increasing numbers of PRC and international culturally diverse students need to develop comprehensive international student strategies.</p>
<p>Findings also indicate that traditional Confucian familial values are being somewhat relaxed with adolescent children having a greater say in the decisions related to cross-border study. There is then a need to further understand the level of PRC parental influence, the levels of student (child) involvement, and to monitor the changing roles and influence of traditional familial values and ongoing influences throughout cross border studies. Such culturally derived understandings should inform the development of host institution program and support mechanisms that are more relevant to the student’s unique experiences and problems and stimulate campus community engagement in and enhancement of intercultural understanding and respect for the international student’s cultural traditions.</p>
