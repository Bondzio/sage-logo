<abstract>
<p>Despite the known risks and the widespread administration of PRN (pro re nata or “as needed”) psychotropic medications in inpatient settings, little is known about their use with hospitalized older adults. This exploratory descriptive study examined the use of PRN psychotropic medications and nonpharmacologic interventions to manage symptoms in older adults hospitalized in two acute care geropsychiatric settings. A retrospective chart audit was conducted. A major finding was the lack of documentation regarding PRN administration. In 81.3% of cases at Site A and 55.3% of cases at Site B, no reason for administration was documented. No medication response was documented in 92.4% of cases at Site A and 47.5% of cases at Site B. No nonpharmacologic interventions were documented for 69% of Site A patients or 64% of Site B patients. To ensure patient safety and to inform best clinical practice, the lack of documentation surrounding administration of PRN medications and nonpharmacologic interventions must be resolved.</p>

<body>
<p>By 2030, the number of older adults aged 65 years and older with a major psychiatric illness is expected to reach 15 million, the majority of whom will require mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390312438768">President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003</xref>). In response to the increasing numbers of older adults with mental illness and the complex medical and psychiatric needs of this population, specialized geropsychiatric units were created. Patients commonly treated in geropsychiatric units include those with Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, delirium, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390312438768">Smith, Specht, &amp; Buckwalter, 2005</xref>). In addition to scheduled medications, psychotropic medications are commonly administered PRN (pro re nata or “as needed”) by mental health nurses on geropsychiatric units to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms include depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions; behavioral symptoms encompass wandering, relentless pacing, agitation, aggression, and alteration in sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390312438768">Smith, Specht, &amp; Buckwalter, 2005</xref>). “Inappropriate use or excessive dosing of psychotropic medications in the elderly is common and can lead to a variety of adverse events including falls, oversedation, and cognitive impairment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438768">Peterson et al., 2005</xref>, p. 802).</p>
<p>The majority of empirical research investigating the use of PRN psychotropic medications to manage symptoms and behavior with patients in psychiatric settings has been conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312438768">Baker, Lovell, &amp; Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis, Baker, &amp; Reid, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390312438768">Stein-Parbury, Reid, Smith, Mouhanna, &amp; Lamont, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390312438768">Usher, Lindsay, Holmes, &amp; Luck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390312438768">Usher &amp; Luck, 2004</xref>). These studies have focused primarily on general psychiatric units rather than specialized geropsychiatric units. Much of the literature that has examined the use of psychotropic medications specifically with older adults is limited to nursing home settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390312438768">Snowden, Sato, &amp; Roy-Byrne, 2003</xref>). There is a paucity of research examining the use of psychotropic medication on inpatient geropsychiatric units.</p>
<p>Because psychotropic medications have numerous potential adverse effects, nurses are encouraged to first use nonpharmacologic interventions to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). A number of studies have examined the use of nonpharmacologic interventions with older adults, but these studies have been limited primarily to patients with dementia who are living in long-term care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390312438768">Avalon, Gum, Feliciano, &amp; Arean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390312438768">Bower, McCullough, &amp; Pille, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390312438768">Cohen-Mansfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390312438768">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Mintzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390312438768">Hermann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390312438768">Siders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390312438768">Snowden et al., 2003</xref>). Similar to psychotropic medication use, little research has examined the use of nonpharmacologic interventions on inpatient geropsychiatric units.</p>
<p>As the population ages and an increasing number older adults are in need of inpatient psychiatric services, empirical evidence is needed to better understand the use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. Despite the known risks and the widespread administration of PRN psychotropic medications in inpatient settings, we know little about their use with hospitalized older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the use of PRN psychotropic medications and nonpharmacologic interventions to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in older adults hospitalized in two acute care geropsychiatric settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078390312438768">
<title>Specific Aims</title>
<p>The aims of this study were to examine the following in older adults who were hospitalized in two acute care geropsychiatric units: (a) the use and documented effects of PRN psychotropic medications and (b) the use and documented effects of nonpharmacologic nursing interventions.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1078390312438768">
<title>Design, Settings, and Sample</title>
<p>An exploratory descriptive design was used to address the research aims because little information exists on the use of psychotropic medications or nonpharmacologic interventions with elders hospitalized in geropsychiatric units.</p>
<p>A retrospective chart audit of 108 (Site A = 52 and Site B = 56) medical records was conducted for all patients 55 years or older who were consecutively admitted to two inpatient geropsychiatric units over a 3-month period (October through December 2007). The two geropsychiatric units were located in the Midwest. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, no effort was made to match the two units on any clinical or patient characteristics. Site A was a 760-bed academic medical center with a 14-bed geropsychiatric inpatient unit, and the average length of stay reported prior to this study was approximately 11 days. The unit employed 28 direct care staff with approximately 50% of them being registered nurses. Site B was a 613-bed academic medical center with an 18-bed geropsychiatric inpatient unit with an average daily census of 16. The average length of stay reported prior to this study was 16 days. The unit employed 28 direct care staff, with approximately 60% of them being registered nurses. The two sites were selected based on their representativeness of geropsychiatric inpatient units nationally (e.g., location, average size, length of stay, census, staff, etc.), making results more generalizable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390312438768">Smith, Specht, &amp; Buckwalter, 2005</xref>) and the small number of units sampled more reasonable. On both units, the decision to administer PRN medications or nonpharmacologic interventions was based on the nurse’s assessment and clinical judgment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078390312438768">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Chart information was collected on a standardized patient record audit form developed by the first author (PL) and reviewed for content validity, prior to use, by the coauthor (KCB), an expert in geropsychiatric nursing, as well as by a geropsychiatrist. The following information was collected from each patient record: sociodemographic information (age, gender), admission and discharge date, medical diagnoses, psychiatric diagnoses, reason for admission, home medications (name, type, frequency, dose, route), new scheduled medications (name, type, frequency, dose, route), change in scheduled medications (name, type, increase or decrease in frequency or dose, route, documented side effects), PRN medications administered (name, type, dose, time given, route, reason given, response, documented side effects), discharge medications (name, type frequency, dose, route), nonpharmacologic interventions documented, reason for intervention, and documented effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078390312438768">
<title>Protection of Human Subjects</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval for the study was obtained at both sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078390312438768">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The entire record for each patient admission was audited by the first author (PL). Chart audits included a thorough examination of electronic and paper chart documents for each patient, including the admission and discharge summary, medication records, daily nursing flow sheets, and progress notes. A random sample of three records was also audited by the coauthor to ensure interrater reliability of data, which resulted in 100% agreement. No changes to the chart audit form were indicated. Data were gathered and documented on the chart audit form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078390312438768">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data from the chart audit forms were entered into an SPSS database. The data were analyzed using PASW 17.0 statistical software.</p>

<title>Demographic and Diagnostic Results</title>
<p>The demographic and diagnostic features of the sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390312438768">Table 1</xref>. The percentage of female patients was 67.3% at Site A and 66.1% at Site B. A greater percentage of females received PRN medications at both sites. At Site A, a greater percentage of the younger age group (aged 55-65 years) received PRN medications, whereas at Site B, a greater percentage of older patients (aged 76-85 years) received PRN medications. The length of stay for patients was similar at both sites—Site A ranged from 2 to 46 days with an average length of stay of 15.27 days and Site B ranged from 1 to 36 days with an average length of stay of 12.98 days. The most common diagnostic groups at both sites were depressive disorders and dementia disorders; depressive disorders, however, were more frequent at site A and dementia disorders at Site B. Patients with dementia or depression received a greater percentage of PRN medications at both sites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aims of this exploratory study were to examine the documented use and effects of pharmacological and nonpharmacologic interventions used by nurses to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in older adults hospitalized in two acute care geropsychiatric settings. Although not intended as a comparative study, the findings reveal similarities and differences between the two units as well similarities and differences to findings from past studies that also looked at PRN medication use in psychiatric settings. These preliminary data allow us to begin to develop a profile of older patients for whom PRN medications are most often used: female, between 55 and 65 years or 76 and 85 years, and with psychiatric diagnoses of depression and/or dementia. Older adults who exhibit the following symptoms are at greater risk for receiving PRN medications: restlessness, agitation, anger, aggression, anxiousness, or being “upset.” Older patients more commonly receive PRN medications on the first or second day of admission, and PRN medications are more frequently administered in the afternoon or evening hours.</p>
<p>In prior studies of general psychiatric inpatient units, there have been mixed findings in terms of whether patient’s age, gender, or diagnosis influence administration of PRN administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312438768">Curtis &amp; Capp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390312438768">Usher, Lindsay, &amp; Snellen, 2001</xref>). In this study, the frequency of PRN medication administration was greater for females. Although in the study reported here all patients were aged 55 years and older, differences were noted between the two sites in that younger patients (aged 55-65 years) were more likely to receive PRN medications at Site A than at Site B. This might be explained by the fact that Site A admitted a greater number of patients in the younger age range. In terms of diagnosis, those patients with dementia or depressive disorders were more likely to receive PRN medications, which can be explained by the fact that both units were dedicated to care of older adults and most often admitted patients with these two disorders.</p>
<p>Although the risk for adverse effects from psychotropic medications is greater in older adults, it appears that there is a high reliance on their use. These findings are similar to those of previous Australian studies of PRN medication administration on general psychiatric units, which found that between 63% and 82% of patients received PRN medications, but are higher than prior reports of rates in Canada and the United Kingdom (50%) and in the United States (23% to 50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312438768">Curtis &amp; Capp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). The average number of PRN administrations per patient per stay was similar at both study sites but less on average than those reported in studies of PRN use in general psychiatric settings in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with means that ranged from 10 to 12 administrations per patient per admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312438768">Baker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The two sites used the same types of PRN medications (benzodiazepines and antipsychotics). These finding are comparable with prior studies in the United Kingdom that have shown that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are the most frequently administered psychotropic PRN medications in general psychiatric units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312438768">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al., 2007</xref>). One study revealed that lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) accounted for 51.8% of all PRN medications administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312438768">Baker et al., 2008</xref>). In this investigation, lorazepam accounted for 32.1% of administrations at Site A and 26.7% of administrations at Site B. Both sites reported high doses of Haldol in comparison with recommended dosing for older adults, which is 0.25 to 0.5 mg for initial dosing and a maximum of 4 mg per day for maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390312438768">Lindsey, 2009</xref>). As previously noted, the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics with older adults to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms has been questioned because of concerns regarding efficacy, significant side effects, and potential serious adverse effects. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued “black box” warnings against prescribing atypical antipsychotics for patients with dementia in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312438768">2005</xref>, followed by an extension of the warning in 2008 to all categories of antipsychotic medications, conventional as well as atypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312438768">FDA, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390312438768">2008</xref>). Adverse effects of antipsychotics include hypotension, sedation, dysphoria, acute dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, restlessness, agitation, and more rarely, neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Benzodiazepines use can result in adverse effects such as sedation, amnesia, ataxia, confusion, cognitive impairment, paradoxical disinhibition, cognitive slowing, and changes in equilibrium, which can result in increased risk for falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390312438768">Mott, Poole, &amp; Kenrick, 2005</xref>). Despite the known risk for substantial side effects, these drugs are still commonly prescribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of documentation regarding the reason for administering PRN medication common at both sites has also been noted in prior studies in Australia in which failure to document indications for PRN use ranged between 38% and 63% of administrations. When the reason for administration was documented in the current study, the target behaviors were comparable with prior studies of general psychiatric units in which the most common reasons for PRN administration were agitation, distress, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312438768">Curtis &amp; Capp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). There were differences between sites in terms of reason for administration such as “patient request” at Site A and “wandering” at Site B. This difference is likely because of those in primary diagnoses between the two sites (depression at Site A and dementia disorders at Site B). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton and Whiteford (2008)</xref>, failure to document the reason for administration of a PRN medication raises the question of what clinical assessment and judgment took place in choosing to administer the medication and whether it was clinically indicated.</p>
<p>There was also a lack of documentation at both sites about the effects of PRN medications administered. Lack of documentation of PRN medication effects has also been found to be an issue in prior studies, ranging from 23% to 61% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). In the current study, when outcomes were documented, both sites most commonly noted that the medication had the “desired effect.” A prior study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al. (2007)</xref> reported similar vague evaluation of medication effects. Lack of documentation regarding medication effects is of concern with regard to failure in tracking clinical outcomes that should be used by prescribers to plan future treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). In addition, a lack of documentation about when PRN medications are not effective means that other pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions that may have been tried are not revealed and nor is their effectiveness.</p>
<p>The two sites were similar in terms of the day of hospitalization that PRN medications were more commonly administered. These finding are analogous to a prior study, which found that the day of admission was the most common day for PRN administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312438768">Curtis &amp; Capp, 2003</xref>). Although it may seem logical that more problematic behaviors requiring PRN medications might occur in the first few days of admission, it can also be argued that the least is known about the patient during the initial period of their stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312438768">Curtis &amp; Capp, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The timing of PRN medications was similar to previous studies, which also found increased PRN administrations on evenings and nights. Because of the lack of documentation regarding the indications for administration, it is unknown whether there was a greater need by this older population during this time period or whether other factors, such as staffing levels, change of shift, or sundown syndrome, may have contributed to this pattern.</p>
<p>Lack of documentation regarding nonpharmacologic interventions was an issue at both sites. Although it is likely that nurses did provide nonpharmacologic interventions, the lack of documentation raises the question whether there was not an overreliance on PRN medication versus the use of nonpharmacologic interventions. Prior research revealed that less than 7% of nursing time is focused on psychotherapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton and Whiteford (2008)</xref> also noted that a variety of issues may influence nurses to choose PRN medications over nonpharmacologic intervention. These issues include efficiency, staffing levels, organizational culture, skill, and lack of expertise.</p>
<sec id="section18-1078390312438768">
<title>Study Limitations/Strengths</title>
<p>As noted earlier, limitations of this study were that it relied primarily on data collected over a 3-month period at only two somewhat different geropsychiatric units in the Midwest. One could argue, however, that any clinical and patient differences between the two study sites contributed to the external validity (generalizability) of the findings. Another limitation was that the study looked retrospectively at what was documented rather than through direct observation, which was beyond the resources of this exploratory study. A strength of this investigation was that data were based on each patient’s entire admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1078390312438768">
<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Much of the prior research about the use of PRN medication in psychiatric settings has been done in Australia and the United Kingdom. More studies examining PRN medication use are needed in the United States, particularly in geropsychiatric inpatient settings, especially given the greater risk for adverse events in older adults. Psychiatric nurses must ensure patient safety by leading in the development of standardized protocols for PRN administration. Future research should include objective ratings of behavioral symptoms (e.g., agitation), interventions to improve documentation, and development and evaluation of protocols for the administration of PRN medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438768">Hilton &amp; Whiteford, 2008</xref>). Studies are also needed that examine the relationship between the use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines with adverse patient events in older adults. Future studies might examine the percentage of patients receiving PRN medications on a unit per census day.</p>
<p>Future research should also include larger sample size as well as more ethnically and geographically diverse samples, and should attempt to calculate standardized units or doses of PRN medications to make comparisons across sites more meaningful. Future studies should also validate the beginning profile of older adults most vulnerable to the use of PRN medications in geropsychiatric inpatient settings. Additional research is needed regarding the use and effectiveness of nonpharmacologic interventions for patients on geropsychiatric units.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1078390312438768">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>These preliminary findings have important implications for practice. The lack of documentation surrounding the administration of PRN medication administration and nonpharmacologic interventions is quite concerning. At the very basic level of nursing education, students are taught the “Rights of Medication Administration.” When administering a PRN medication, they are taught, among other things, to document the reason for administration and the effect achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390312438768">Elliott &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>). This basic standard of practice is expected to ensure patient safety as well as to provide accurate legal documentation. Yet in this study, there is a troubling lack of documentation. Compounding this issue is the fact that this is occurring in settings caring for a very vulnerable population—older adults. To ensure patient safety and to inform best clinical practice, the lack of documentation regarding the indications for and outcomes of PRN medications must be resolved. This can be achieved through a variety of different strategies.</p>
<p>Nursing curricula should include documentation competencies regarding PRN administration in psychiatric nursing. There have been recent efforts to create recommended competencies and curricular guidelines for psychiatric nursing as well as for the care of older adults. These include the Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing in the BSN curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312438768">International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses and American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 2008</xref>), the American Association of Colleges of Nursing and Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing (AACN/HIGN) Recommended Baccalaureate Competencies and Curricular Guidelines for the Nursing Care of Older Adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312438768">AACN/HIGN, 2010</xref>), and seven Geropsychiatric Competency Enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390312438768">Beck, Buckwalter, &amp; Evans, 2010</xref>). Although some of the guidelines or competencies relate to management of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, none specifically address PRN medication administration, a common part of psychiatric nursing practice. These documents should be amended to include competencies regarding administration and documentation of PRN psychotropic medications. The proposed competencies should include all critical aspects of documentation, including the reason for administration, the effects of PRN medications, and any untoward or adverse effects. There is also a need to emphasize adequate admission or transfer assessment of the patient’s usual behavior or communication patterns. Having this information gathered on a routine basis would allow the nurse to best evaluate the meaning of behavioral symptoms and to intervene more effectively. Competencies regarding nonpharmacologic interventions to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in patients should also be included more specifically in recommended curricular competencies. A commonly accepted standard of care is that nonpharmacologic interventions are preferred over PRN medications, yet there are no specific competencies identified in these recent curriculum guidelines.</p>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al. (2007)</xref>, it is surprising that given the common practice of PRN medication administration in psychiatric settings, there is a near absence of content surrounding this practice in psychiatric nursing textbooks. Most often the content focuses on the types of PRN medications to administer rather than providing guidelines for administration and documentation. Psychiatric nursing textbooks should expand content regarding administration of PRN medications. There is also a lack of emphasis on nonpharmacologic nursing interventions in nursing textbooks despite the variety of resources available. Nursing students should be made familiar with sources such as the University of Iowa College of Nursing’s John A. Hartford Foundation Center of Geriatric Nursing Excellence. The Center has 37 evidence-based guidelines on how to manage a variety of behaviors such as agitated behaviors in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and wandering as well as nonpharmacologic interventions such as individualized music. A variety of nonpharmacologic interventions that can be used to manage psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in older adults have been also described in the literature. These include but are not limited to the following: sensory enhancement, socialization, structured activities, music therapy, pet therapy, dolls, engaging activities, and relieving discomfort (e.g., pain, positioning, hearing disturbance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390312438768">Lindsey, 2009</xref>). As more older adults are in need of psychiatric care, it is imperative that nurses are well educated in the range of interventions available rather than potentially overrelying on PRN medications.</p>
<p>Finally, to fully remedy this problem, the reason for the lack of documentation must be explored. Although limited evidence of the use of nonpharmacologic interventions was found in this study, it is assumed that nurses do incorporate these into their practice; however, there was a clear lack of documentation. As previously suggested, perhaps this is because psychiatric nurses may take their expertise and “know-how” for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438768">Curtis et al., 2007</xref>). Perhaps they do not value the significance or therapeutic benefit of nonpharmacologic nursing interventions. These may appear to them as a routine part of their job. We need to fully understand the practice barriers nurses in geropsychiatric inpatient units face so as to improve documentation, perhaps decrease the use of PRN medications, and increase the use and/or documentation of nonpharmacologic interventions. Although there are numerous possible explanations for lack of documentation, such as understaffing, charting overburden, lack of charting prompts (as exist with pain PRN administration), time constraints, or perhaps a lack of awareness of its importance, until the issues are uncovered, this problem will not be fully resolved.</p>
