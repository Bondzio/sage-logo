<p>Readers of this Journal will be well aware of the fact that fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPs) are now being utilized in a vast and increasing range of engineering applications. Behind the scenes, structural designers have been faced with new challenges requiring major changes and continuous evolution in approach, in order to deploy this versatile class of material to best commercial and technical advantage.</p>
<p>In moving from the metals world to the FRP world, it is perhaps not unsurprising to find that the challenge of predicting the strength of an FRP laminate with accuracy is significantly larger than that in predicting the strength of a conventional metal. It is, perhaps, self-evident that such predictive methods must be accurate and valid in order to extract the maximum structural performance in terms of strength, deformation and stiffness. In most of the early applications of FRPs (typically military, in the 1960s) this challenge was circumvented by a ‘make and test’ approach, which was entirely justified at the time, given the relative novelty of the materials, the absence of proven analytical tools and the relatively poor computation capabilities. Whilst much development work has been conducted since then (and continues to this day) the degree of maturity of the current tools for predicting the strength and deformation of an FRP material, in the general case, remains an open question.</p>
<p>It is against this backdrop, starting in the 1990s, that the international activities, known as the World Wide Failure Exercises (WWFE), were initiated to improve the foundation on which design theories are based, namely the prediction of deformation and failure strength of laminated composite structures. The first Exercise (WWFE-I), that was organized by Hinton, Soden and Kaddour and completed in 2004, proved to be a groundbreaking effort in which invited participants and other interested parties were asked to use their preferred prediction procedures to ‘solve’ pre-defined cases, being shown the actual failure data only after they had submitted the manuscripts with their solutions. The results were widely accepted by the community as the definitive, objective, assessment of the best methods for predicting the response of continuous fiber-reinforced laminates when subjected to under 2D in-plane loads. Furthermore, WWFE-I served as a wakeup call to the community. A wide diversity in the accuracy and applicability of the various theories was exposed, refinements to many of the theories were instigated and demonstrated, and, from a designer’s perspective, clarity was provided regarding the expected level of confidence in the accuracy of the predictive tools.</p>
<p>In the general design situation, 3D stress states are the norm where an extensive use of finite element analysis (FEA) software in the design process should ensure that they are calculated in all cases, even if (commonly), for simplicity, the through thickness stresses are discounted because they are ‘insignificant’. Thus, building on the previous findings, WWFE-II was initiated to assess the level of maturity of methods for predicting the deformation and failure strength of laminated composite materials when subjected to 3D states of stress. Selected leading groups who developed their own failure models were invited to take part. They were provided with a set of problems to challenge their models, the aim being to assess the level of their strengths and weaknesses and hence to identify common and serious gaps. The WWFE-II was set up to run in two parts; Part A and Part B. Part A is devoted to providing full details of the theories together with ‘blind’ predictions of 12 challenging Test Cases, made by their originators. Part B is concerned with comparing the theoretical predictions with experimental results and with drawing a set of recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>This special issue deals with Part A of WWFE-II and contains a total 15 papers, distributed as follows:
<list id="list1-0021998312461469" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A paper that sets the scene and gives details to the background of the WWFE-II.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A paper defining the challenging problems (Test Cases) set for the participants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>12 papers, by participating groups of world experts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A final paper, summarising the results of the above 12 papers.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The guest editors are indebted to all who contributed theoretical and experimental work to this Exercise. This has been a truly collaborative effort, being totally reliant on the great perseverance, intellect and patience of the participants in committing their ideas to paper over a prolonged period of time.</p>
