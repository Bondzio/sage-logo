<p><italic>Background</italic>. The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) has decreased nationally, creating challenges in identifying children at risk. <italic>Methods</italic>. In a community known to have lead hazards, we screened children with a field-administered capillary blood lead test and asked parents to complete a questionnaire about lead risk factors. <italic>Results</italic>. Of the 77 child-parent pairs screened with a blood lead test and a parental questionnaire, 4 had finger stick blood lead levels of ≥10 µg/dL. Of these, one child had a confirmatory venous blood lead level &gt;10 µg/dL (1.3%; 95% CI = 0.0%-4.7%), which is near the US prevalence but less than the historic prevalence for this region. A median of 2 risk factors for each of the environmental, behavioral, and knowledge/awareness domains were noted. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Despite a low prevalence of children with EBLL, parental report suggested that approximately 29% of children had lead-based paint in their home environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood lead poisoning is a well-recognized condition that has potentially devastating neurological consequences. Severe acute encephalopathy was wide spread in much of the 20th century leading to seizures, coma, and potentially death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812464549">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812464549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812464549">3</xref></sup> Fortunately, these severe effects are less common, although children may still present with extremely high blood lead levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812464549">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812464549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812464549">6</xref></sup> However, damaging cognitive effects of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) on the developing nervous systems of children remain a major concern. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set an action level of 10 µg/dL for children ≤6 years of age for defining risk for having significant deficits in IQ and cognitive development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref></sup> Studies available at that time demonstrated a decline in IQ points with every incremental elevation of blood lead levels greater than 10 µg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812464549">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812464549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812464549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812464549">11</xref></sup> Subsequent studies demonstrated that there is no known threshold level for adverse effects from lead. These studies demonstrated that the greatest rate of decline in IQ occurs between blood lead levels of between 3 and 8 µg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812464549">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812464549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812464549">14</xref></sup> Data also suggest that lead poisoning at subacute levels may be a cause of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812464549">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812464549">16</xref></sup> Given these data, the CDC released an announcement in early 2012 that in lieu of the term <italic>blood lead level of concern</italic>, they would adopt a reference value based on the 97.5 percentile of the blood lead level of US children, which is currently 5 µg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812464549">17</xref></sup> Throughout this article, we will continue to refer to the blood lead action level of 10 µg/dL in order to correspond with the time frame when these data were collected.</p>
<p>A primary source of childhood lead poisoning has been lead-based paint, and the resulting dust following paint deterioration over time. Although lead-based paint was banned for home use in 1977 in the United States, the concentration of lead in paint was significantly curtailed in the late 1940s to the early 1950s. Therefore, age of housing plays a major role in the development of childhood lead poisoning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812464549">18</xref></sup> A high degree of disparity exists among lead-poisoned children, with children of lower socioeconomic status and minority children carrying a higher burden of undue lead exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812464549">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812464549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812464549">21</xref></sup> Surveillance data demonstrate that among children in traditional high-risk groups, such as those of black race or living in pre-1950 homes, the prevalence of EBLL was more than double.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The US prevalence of EBLL, still measured by CDC as the proportion of children with blood lead levels above 10 µg/dL, continues to decline. In the early 1990s, approximately 4.4% of US children had EBLLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812464549">19</xref></sup> Subsequent CDC surveillance data from 1999 to 2002 demonstrated a national prevalence of 1.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812464549">22</xref></sup> A subsequent report that included data through 2004 lowered that estimate further to 1.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref></sup> Despite a consistent decrease in the prevalence of EBLL, areas in the community with old housing continue to remain potential sites of risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812464549">23</xref></sup> Identifying these high-risk areas can be problematic, but geographic information systems (GISs) can be a useful method to identify these neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812464549">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812464549">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Charleston South Carolina was one of the first cities in the United States to have a comprehensive lead screening program. In the 1970s, approximately 32% of blood lead levels were above 30 µg/dL. A successful screening and case management program was instrumental in improving the identification and treatment of children at risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812464549">25</xref></sup> In the 1990s, 6.8% of children screened in Charleston County had EBLLs. However, among children living in pre-1950 housing, the proportion of EBLL was 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812464549">18</xref></sup> In 2001, the City of Charleston obtained federal funding from Housing and Urban Development for lead hazard control and repair of the deteriorating housing stock. Since 2001, 385 houses have been repaired (City of Charleston, personal communication, February 2012).</p>
<p>Considerable effort has been expended in developing cost-effective lead screening programs and in identifying those children at highest risk for having lead poisoning. The CDC currently recommends targeted screening programs as the most resource-effective means of identifying children with EBLL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812464549">26</xref></sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics has also upheld these recommendations in their most recent statement on childhood lead poisoning prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812464549">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the percentage of children with EBLL who live in a community that has historically been considered a high-risk area for lead poisoning based on geographic risk factors. We also intended to identify risk factors of children residing in this community that may predispose a child to lead poisoning. Uniquely, compared with other efforts, we used direct household inspection and field blood lead measurements to identify children at risk.</p>

<title>Approach to Identifying Patients</title>
<p>A community health partnership model guided the conceptual framework of this study. Children aged 9 months through 6 years were recruited based on residence in neighborhoods that historically have had a high prevalence of lead poisoning, most of which were located in 1 of 2 ZIP codes in Charleston, South Carolina. Other children were identified as living in a pre-1950 house through the use of a GIS. Two community leaders were identified and asked to assist in recruiting participants for this study. Both were local clergy and were well informed of community members’ needs. The nature of the study was discussed with each of them as well as basic fundamentals of childhood lead poisoning. Both community leaders agreed to discuss the study with families in their local congregations and assist in participant recruitment. In 1 of the 2 downtown church sites, children who went to the daycare center at the church were also screened.</p>
<p>For potential patients identified from the primary care clinic, parents gave verbal agreement for having the research nurse contact them and arrange a home visit. For other patients identified through the community leaders, the research nurse identified them at the community center sites. Written informed consent was obtained in which the parents agreed to a finger stick blood lead screen for their child, completed a written survey, and agreed to an environmental assessment of their home. The visual inspection was not intended to replace a visit by the public health department environmental inspector, which would happen in the event of a blood lead level that was ≥20 µg/dL, but rather to identify potential lead hazards. To prepare for the inspection, the research nurse spent 1 day accompanying an environmental health sanitarian on home visits to learn how to identify the characteristic appearance of lead paint as well as identify the most common locations where it is found.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812464549">
<title>Home Visits: Survey Data and Blood Lead Testing</title>
<p>The parents completed a 3-page questionnaire based on risks in similar populations that have been published in the medical literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812464549">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812464549">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812464549">29</xref></sup> We queried about 3 domains: children’s risk factors, environmental hazards, and parental knowledge of lead risks. With informed consent, the research nurse visited the homes of sampled children to assess the house for visible lead hazards. Successful visitation was determined based on completed home visit appointments.</p>
<p>We used the LeadCare blood lead test kit from ESA, Inc (Chelmsford, MA) for the screening blood lead analysis. The instrument was used for research purposes only. All participants were asked to follow up with their primary provider, regardless of the blood lead value, for routine well-child evaluations and screening tests. In the event that any child was found with a blood lead level of 10 µg/dL or greater, the parent was asked to bring the child to the primary care provider for confirmatory testing. If they had no identified primary care provider, they were referred to the Pediatric Primary Clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>

<sec id="section5-0009922812464549">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered into SPSS for Windows, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Dichotomous variables were evaluated using χ<sup>2</sup> or <italic>t</italic> tests. The proportion of EBLL was calculated for all children. This calculation was also analyzed using the Poisson distribution equation to determine the 95% confidence interval, based on the approach used by Hanley to evaluate a zero or low numerator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812464549">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>

<title>Summary of Survey Data</title>
<p>We obtained written informed consent from parents of 78 children, but 1 parent refused the blood testing. Thus, we have blood lead data on 77 children. Four children (5%) had screening capillary blood levels &gt;10 µg/dL. One parent refused a confirmatory venous sample for the child, and 1 of the 3 remaining children had a venous blood level &gt;10 µg/dL. Thus, the confirmed sample prevalence was 1.3%. When considering the 95% confidence interval from the Poisson distribution, we found the upper limit of children with EBLLs to be 4.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812464549">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Complete information from parental environmental surveys were available from 64 participants (82%) of the sample. The prevalence of environmental risk factors for EBLL is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812464549">Table 1</xref>. Of note, 39% had peeling paint in the home, 20% had peeling paint outside the home, and 31% of children played in soil near an old building. Although nearly all children tested in this study did not have blood lead levels above the threshold of 10 µg/dL, 7% of parents did have another child with an EBLL, and 16% reported having had another family member or child’s playmate with an EBLL.</p>

Of note, 87% or more of parents were aware that lead poisoning could cause learning and/or behavior problems and that it was preventable. Most parents were also cognizant of the fact that washing hands prior to eating and avoiding using a dry scraper or sander on the walls may be protective against lead poisoning. However, they were generally not aware that there was no pill that would prevent lead poisoning and that most children with EBLLs will not appear sick. Most were also not aware that lead may be found in some types of vinyl mini-blinds or in drinking water.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Following enrollment and blood collection, the research nurse attempted to set up home visits to evaluate for lead hazards. In all, 24 parents (of 28 children) kept the appointment for the home visit or had their home visited at the time of the blood lead and survey data collection. It was found that 7 homes (29%) had visual evidence of lead-based paint deterioration. Most of this evidence consisted of peeling or chipping paint on the walls, door frames, or exterior surface. The home of the child with the blood lead level of 23 µg/dL was noted to have excessive dust on the windowsills, dirt on the carpet, and a dirt-covered yard but no evidence of peeling paint.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on this sample, we calculated a prevalence of EBLL of 1.3%. Although this figure was lower than the most recent national average, the estimate from the 95% confidence interval puts the value above the national average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812464549">30</xref></sup> These data indicate that the lead poisoning risk in this community is at least the same as the national average, though less than the previously identified prevalence in this same area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812464549">18</xref></sup> It is possible that the activities of the City of Charleston surrounding the repair of older homes have had a significant effect on lowering the risk of lead poisoning. Despite the relatively low number of children with EBLL, we did identify a substantial proportion of families who, by parental report, had at least 1 risk factor for EBLL.</p>
<p>This study is the first known to the authors to examine effectiveness of questionnaire-based screening, in concert with community-based recruitment using GIS, in identifying individuals at risk for EBLL. Although national-level CDC data have suggested that traditional epidemiological risk factors for EBLL such as race, age, and insurance continue to hold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812464549">29</xref></sup> commonly used survey questions have not been validated among contemporary populations with lower blood lead levels.</p>
<p>Although the percentage of EBLL in this sample is lower than the historical average in Charleston, it is notable that parental knowledge of risk factors is generally good. This suggests that past public health practices have been effective in educating families about lead hazards. However, these findings also imply that despite the targeted enrollment, children at highest risk for EBLL are still not being identified. This study was based on past GIS targeting to identify neighborhoods at risk as a result of age of housing and based on past EBLL. Resource limitations and potential safety concerns prevented a door-to-door approach to screening. Rather, it relied on community leader input and daycare gathering in the ZIP code with the highest historic prevalence. Having some understanding of risk from older housing and knowing which neighborhoods are likely at higher risk is important because parents, particularly those who are renting their home, are unlikely to know if they live in a pre-1950 house.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812464549">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parental knowledge and child behavioral risk factors in this study did approximate levels that have been found in similar populations elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812464549">32</xref></sup> Certain high-risk behaviors were still relatively common, with one-fifth of the sample washing their hands before less than half of meals, and nearly one-third playing in soil around old buildings. Of the subsample of houses visited by the research nurse, all of which were built before 1950, many were noted to have some evidence of lead-based paint or dirt-covered yards. Thus, the low 1.3% prevalence of venous-confirmed EBLL may be related more to local efforts in hazard abatement, education, and surveillance than to a lack of risk factors.</p>
<p>Several aspects of the community-based element of this study were particularly effective in gaining community acceptance and simultaneously providing community education. Parents repeatedly expressed their appreciation of the immediate feedback provided by the handheld lead analyzer and the ease of mind an instantaneous negative result provided. Also, by networking through community organizations such as daycares and church groups, lead poisoning education was provided to both the parents themselves and to community leaders who could further distribute the knowledge and raise local awareness. Using the community sources did appear to have a large impact in terms of identifying additional families and the lead poisoning education that was provided.</p>
<p>This study is subject to several limitations. The relatively small sample size may have an impact on the ability to find statistically significant differences. In addition, logistic difficulties were encountered in trying to arrange home visits in advance, with numerous appointments not being kept. This small sample of home visits may have underestimated the extent of lead-based paint contamination. The cross-sectional nature of the study only allowed associations to be described but prohibited cause and effect determination. Despite our efforts to facilitate community buy-in, working through the community leaders may have established a selection bias. Because of their very involvement with these children by providing a clean daycare center environment, the children we tested may have had a lower risk for lead poisoning compared with some children in other neighborhoods where there was less community service involvement. Likewise, screening through our clinic identifies children with a medical home, but other children in the community may not regularly see a primary care provider and may be at higher risk.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The prevalence of EBLL in this community was found to have decreased since prior studies and is now comparable with the national average of 1.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812464549">7</xref></sup> The value of traditional lead questionnaires for identifying children with blood lead levels between 2 and 10 µg/dL should be reexamined, ideally with venous blood sampling to reduce inaccuracies associated with the lead testing. Similarly, the traditional means of community-based screening may not be effective in identifying children truly at risk based on previous prevalence estimates in this population. Therefore, more targeted, geographic-based screening should be considered. Households in neighborhoods with a high proportion of old housing continue to have environmental risk factors that may predispose the child to lead poisoning. Behavioral risks, especially if in conjunction with the presence of lead in the environment, may further increase the risk for lead poisoning.</p>
