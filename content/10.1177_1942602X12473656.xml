<abstract>
<p>The health of America’s youth is a national priority. With obesity increasing dramatically in adolescents and young children, school lunches have experienced makeovers, and “dieting” and “weight loss” messages have permeated parental concern. Eating disorders among our youth, however, have largely been overlooked despite evidence of its steady increase over the past few decades among younger and younger children. The school nurse can become a resource for parents, students, and teachers in regard to eating disorders and serve in a leadership role advocating for students to live healthy, meaningful lives.</p>

<p>According to a recent analysis by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12473656">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009)</xref>, hospitalizations for eating disorders have increased by 119% from 1999 to 2006 for children younger than 12 years. Fifty percent of 3- to 6-year-old girls worry about being fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12473656">Hayes &amp; Tantleff-Dunn, 2010</xref>) and more than one-half of teenage girls have used unhealthy weight control behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12473656">Neumark-Sztainer, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services reported that 95% of those who have an eating disorder are between the ages of 12 and 25 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12473656">National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12473656">Crow et al., 2009</xref>), so with the increase of eating disorders in children and adolescents, it is critical for school nurses to be familiar with early detection and appropriate management of these illnesses. However, in a culture obsessed with thinness and dieting, it can be difficult to recognize when a young person’s thinking or behavior has turned dangerous. While complicated, understanding the types of eating disorders, outward signs and symptoms, and psychological and environmental factors that can contribute to the development of an eating disorder can mean the difference between death and successful recovery.</p>
<sec id="section1-1942602X12473656">
<title>Defining Eating Disorders</title>
<p>Eating disorders are complex illnesses with biological, genetic, psychological, social, and developmental roots. There is never a single cause but a wide range of factors that can trigger the behavior. The most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>Anorexia (clinically known as anorexia nervosa) is self-imposed starvation. Adolescents with anorexia are often profoundly dissatisfied with their body image and usually express a strong desire to lose weight. One of the key features of this disorder is denial. Although obsessed with food, they continually deny their hunger and are not able to recognize that they are physically and emotionally fragile. They struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem and, in addition to food, may restrict other parts of their lives, such as relationships and social activities.</p>
<p>Bulimia (clinically known as bulimia nervosa) is the repeated cycle of out-of-control eating followed by some form of purging. The purging associated with bulimia may be self-induced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, or obsessive exercising. Adolescents with bulimia are preoccupied with their shape, weight, and body image as a source of self-esteem. With bulimia, they often feel out of control in other areas of their lives in addition to food.</p>
<p>Binge eating disorder (also known as compulsive overeating) is uncontrolled eating or bingeing followed by periods of guilt and depression. A binge is marked by the consumption of large amounts of food, sometimes accompanied by a pressured, “frenzied” feeling. Frequently, an adolescent who binges continues to eat even after becoming uncomfortably full. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder does not involve purging, excessive exercise, or other compensatory behaviors.</p>
<p>The various types of eating disorders are often associated with specific personality or temperament types. Adolescents who develop anorexia, for example, are often anxious and restrained. They tend to focus intensely on details and often impose impossibly perfectionist demands on themselves. In contrast, adolescents with bulimia are more likely to impulsively act on whatever they may be thinking or feeling. Emerging research strongly suggests that such underlying traits can put certain individuals at heightened risk for developing an eating disorder. The onset of the disorder in children and adolescents can often be triggered by a significant or traumatic life event, such as an introduction to a new school or a difficult family issue. Bullying, feelings of competition, envy among peers, remarks about one’s weight and looks, as well as pressures for grades or athletic superiority are also common triggers for eating disorder development in school-age children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12473656">The Renfrew Center Foundation, n.d.-b</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1942602X12473656">
<title>Signs &amp; Symptoms</title>
<p>Research shows that the sooner eating disorders are diagnosed and addressed, the more likely treatment will lead to sustained recovery. School nurses are in a unique position to detect the onset of eating disorders and be a catalyst for early intervention as they have regular contact and interaction with students. In monitoring students’ health, school nurses may identify eating disorders during routine screenings or assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12473656">White, 2000</xref>). Warning signs and symptoms of eating disorders are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12473656">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Despite the warning signs, identifying eating disorders in children may be extremely complicated. Younger patients with eating disorders are more likely to have psychological symptoms such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or other anxiety disorders and less likely to have binge/purge behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12473656">Rosen, 2010</xref>). In the younger population, males and females may be equally affected and experience a more rapid weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12473656">Rosen, 2010</xref>). Looking to the child’s behavior and any sudden changes, such as unwillingness to eat or slow eating, hiding and hoarding of food, obsession with weight loss, and social withdrawal, may be more critical to identifying an eating disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1942602X12473656">
<title>Early Intervention</title>
<p>Once concerns are raised that a child or adolescent may be at risk of an eating disorder or engaging in these behaviors, the school nurse has a responsibility to provide guidance to the student and family. It is recommended that the first step involve assessing the child or adolescent’s eating behaviors, attitudes to weight and shape, and physical, social, and mental health. Baseline weight, height, and other primary physical measures should be taken and reviewed with the student’s history. In addition, the school nurse should engage the student in a conversation about his or her home and school life, as well as any challenges he or she may be experiencing at that time. Once an assessment is complete, the school nurse then should follow school protocol and involve family and outside referral agencies as appropriate.</p>
<p>Early intervention can be highly effective and prevent years of suffering for the young person and his or her family. In conversations with the parents, it is recommended to stick to facts in presenting a case of concern so as not to entice panic or denial. A primary care physician as well as a mental health care provider should be recommended to obtain a full analysis and diagnosis. The school nurse should be familiar with treatment resources in the community. Once the referral is made, it is vital that the school nurse remain in regular contact with the student and family to provide assistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1942602X12473656">
<title>Treatment Options</title>
<p>When deciding on the best course of treatment, it is important for the parents and referring health care professionals to select a program or combination of programs that specialize in treating eating disorders and allow the student to thrive. Treatment for eating disorders is offered in a variety of settings such as inpatient/residential facilities, day treatment programs, and intensive outpatient services.</p>
<p>Inpatient or residential facilities are typically the most comprehensive, structured, and intensive levels of care for the medically and psychiatrically unstable patient. This type of treatment provides stabilization of the patient’s symptoms through monitored weight gain and nutrition education. Most residential facilities provide additional benefits, including a specialized team of experts for each patient, richness in psychotherapeutic services, and a community of like-minded peers.</p>
<p>Day programs are appropriate for adolescents whose clinical condition does not require acute residential care but who can benefit from intense structure and support. In most programs, patients participate in psychoeducation, process and experiential group therapy, meals, and sessions with a therapist, psychiatrist, and nutritionist.</p>
<p>Intensive outpatient services offer a safe and structured community for students to seek treatment in the evening while still pursuing their regular daytime activities. This option of treatment serves as an excellent “step-down” for patients transitioning from residential or day treatment programs or as a “step-up” from individual or group therapy.</p>
<p>Some treatment centers offer a comprehensive range of programs, which allows patients to easily transition from one level of care to another and can help maximize insurance benefits. No matter the level of treatment the student ultimately seeks, when the student is at school, the school nurse can be a constant ally in the recovery process.</p>

<sec id="section5-1942602X12473656">
<title>Preventative Education</title>
<p>In order to stem the increase of eating disorders among children and adolescents, school nurses should be involved in providing preventative education. One of the most important ways school nurses can be advocates for students’ well-being is by providing a guide for healthy eating and positive body image beginning at a very young age. Such educational tips for students include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1942602X12473656" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>No food is “good” or “bad.” Everything from pizza to carrots to peanut butter and candy can be a part of a child’s menu.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Eat when you are hungry. Stop when you are full.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don’t eat because you are bored, sad, or angry. Find someone to talk to or engage in a favorite activity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stay fit by exercising! Join a sport or an extra-curricular class like dance or karate. Playing with friends can also be energizing and fun.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Understand that all bodies are different. Even people who look very different can still be eating well and keeping healthy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teasing hurts. Don’t be part of it, especially if it is about a person’s body or weight.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fat does not equal bad and thin does not equal good.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you’re unhappy with your body, talk to an adult. School nurses can provide information and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12473656">The Renfrew Center Foundation, n.d.-a</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Furthermore, as students progress through middle and high school, school nurses can actively educate and bring awareness to eating disorders. Some ways they can engage students include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1942602X12473656" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Develop health class curricula about size and shape diversity, eating disorders, disordered eating patterns, body image concerns, and why diets don’t work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Plan activities for National Eating Disorders Awareness Week held the last week in February of each year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Help students understand advertising ploys that promote body image dissatisfaction and join in efforts against the cultural idealization of thinness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Establish programs that help students recognize and develop “inner” qualities (honesty, kindness, creativity, etc.).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Train students and start peer support groups to help students talk to those who they suspect might have a body image concern or eating disorder.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don’t allow school activities that promote weight loss or emphasize appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12473656">The Renfrew Center Foundation, n.d.-c</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the school nurse should play an active role in educating teachers and parents on identifying these life threatening disorders as their eyes and ears will be vital in early intervention. School nurses should advocate for training sessions and distribution of educational materials. It is also important to sponsor events regularly for students, teachers, and parents to learn from eating disorder experts as well as hear testimonies of those who have recovered from an eating disorder.</p>
<p>The school nurse is an essential part of the health care continuum for our nation’s youth. With the rise in eating disorders in children and adolescents, it is critical that these behaviors are at the forefront of concern for school nurses at every educational level. Knowing the signs and symptoms, as well as treatment options, will help the school nurse become a resource for parents, students, and teachers who may be worried about an individual. Most importantly, school nurses’ advocacy for greater eating disorder education is crucial to helping our students live healthy, full lives. ■</p>
