<abstract>
<p>This article estimates the national prevalence rate of domestic violence in India and examines the demographic and socioeconomic status of the victims of domestic violence. The study used the Indian National Family Health Survey 3, a cross-sectional national survey of 124 385 ever-married women of reproductive age from all the 29 member states. χ<sup>2</sup> Analysis and logistic regression were used. Lifetime experiences of violence among respondents were as follows: emotional violence, 14%; less severe physical violence, 31%; severe physical violence, 10%; and sexual violence, 8%. Women of scheduled castes and Muslim religion were most often exposed to domestic violence. Women’s poorer economic background, working status, and husband’s controlling behavior emerged as strong predictors for domestic violence in India. Elimination of structural inequalities inherent in the indigenous oppressive institutions of religion, caste, and the traditional male hierarchy in society could prevent domestic violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Violence against women is now acknowledged as a serious global public health and human rights problem that has diverse health, family, social, and economic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref></sup> Violence against women, in all forms, occurs every day in all parts of the world regardless of age, religion, societies, ethnicities, and geographic borders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510384499">5</xref></sup> However, irrespective of its manifestation and forms, most of the domestic violence against women takes place within the family and in close relationships where the women are supposed to be safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384499">3</xref></sup> Domestic violence, that is, violence against women by their husbands or other intimate partners, is most widespread and one of the most common forms of violence against women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384499">2</xref></sup> Many studies have been conducted in industrialized countries to better understand the extent and nature of the problem of violence against women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384499">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510384499">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The WHO Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence against Women reported a prevalence rate of between 15% (Japan) and 71% (Ethiopia) of lifetime physical and sexual violence by intimate partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384499">7</xref></sup> The lifetime prevalence of physical domestic violence among ever-married women ranged from 40% to 52% in South America and from 17% to 48% in Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384499">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510384499">14</xref></sup> However, reports from developing countries on the prevalence of domestic violence at the national level are lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384499">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref></sup> Several experts have advocated for national representative studies to better assess the situation for effective research and policy making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384499">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384499">16</xref></sup> This study estimates the prevalence of domestic violence at the national level in India.</p>
<p>Prevalence rates have been found to be strongly associated with socioeconomic factors rather than with other methodological factors such as response rate or sampling methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384499">17</xref></sup> Along with socioeconomic background, husband’s controlling behavior has been identified as a risk factor for violence against women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>With their diverse culture and social contexts, developing countries demand much more context-dependent studies on domestic violence against women because the effects of domestic violence are relatively unknown in these countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384499">18</xref></sup> Therefore, there is a need to examine the socioeconomic background of the female victims of domestic violence. The current study estimates the national prevalence rate of violence against women and examines the socioeconomic characteristics of the female victims of violence in India. History of family violence has been identified as a risk factor for wife abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510384499">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384499">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384499">19</xref></sup> and is therefore considered in the current study. A small study from northern India (6902 men) indicated that a husband’s controlling behavior toward his wife is strongly associated with wife abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384499">19</xref></sup> The current study also examines the exposure of women to domestic violence in relation to their husband’s controlling behavior using national representative samples from all 29 states in India.</p>

<sec id="section3-1010539510384499">
<title>National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS-3) Sampling and Data Collection</title>
<p>The Government of India (GOI) has completed the NFHS-3 for 2005-2006. NFHS-3 was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund), and the GOI. Technical assistance was provided by Macro International (Maryland, USA), which is experienced in conducting demographic and health surveys (DHSs) in developing countries. A total of 18 research organizations (including 5 population research centers established by the GOI in various states) conducted the fieldwork for NFHS-3.</p>
<p>Interviews for NFHS-3 were conducted in 2 phases from November 2005 to August 2006. In the first phase, field work was conducted in 12 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The remaining 17 states were included in the second phase: Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, and Uttaranchal.</p>
<p>The NFHS-3 targeted a large number of key indicators aiming at monitoring the demographic and health status of ever-married women in the reproductive age group of 15 to 49 years in India. The interview data from ever-married women in the reproductive age group from NFHS-3 were used in the present study.</p>
<p>NFHS-3 used the 2001 population census to determine the sample size for each area. The initial target sample size (for completed interviews) was 4000 ever-married women in states with a population of more than 30 million, 3000 ever-married women in states with a population of between 5 and 30 million, and 1500 ever-married women in states with a population of less than 5 million.</p>
<p>NFHS-3 followed a uniform sample design procedure using probability proportional to population size (PPS). Rural sample selections were made in 2 stages: in the first stage, villages were selected as primary sampling units (PSUs) using PPS, and in the second stage, households were selected randomly within each PSU. Urban sample selections were made in 3 stages: in the first stage, municipality wards were selected as PSUs using PPS. In the next stage, 1 census enumeration block was selected randomly from each selected PSU ward. In the final stage, households were selected randomly within each selected census enumeration block. A total of 116 652 households were selected, and 109 041 households were interviewed (household response rate = 97.7%). In the interviewed households, 131 596 women (15-49 years), including usual residents and visitors who stayed in the household the night before interview, were eligible for the study. However, 124 385 individual women participated in the interview. The response rate was 93% in urban areas and 96% in rural areas, resulting in an overall response rate of 95% for the whole country. A more detailed description of the sampling procedure is given in the NFHS-3 final report 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510384499">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The NFHS-3 questionnaires provide detailed data on women’s background, reproductive history, use of family planning methods, fertility preferences, antenatal and delivery care, child care and nutrition, child mortality, adult mortality, awareness of and precautions against sexually transmitted diseases, marriage and sexual behavior, empowerment and social indicators, and domestic violence. The primary interests for this article were the domestic violence module and the socioeconomic variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510384499">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Domestic violence, or intimate partner violence, was defined as the woman being exposed to one or several of the following experiences:</p>

<sec id="section6-1010539510384499">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Age, urban/rural residency, educational level, religion, and caste were included in the demographic characteristics. The Indian population comprises several racial and ethnic minorities. Some specified ethnic groups are socially and economically deprived and have a miserable lifestyle. To protect the interests of these ethnic groups, the GOI categorized them into scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. According to the constitution of India, peoples of these 3 categories are protected and entitled to positive discrimination in educational, employment, and other developmental opportunities, for their socioeconomic improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384499">21</xref></sup> Other than these castes (uncategorized), most of the population is referred to as forward castes.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic characteristics included a wealth index for assessment of economic status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510384499">22</xref></sup> current working status, sex of head of the family, history of family violence (among parents), and husband residing with respondent (husband lives with the respondent or lives elsewhere).</p>
<p>In the Indian subcontinent, control of wives by their husbands is a salient social custom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384499">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384499">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510384499">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384499">19</xref></sup> To assess the relationship between a husband’s controlling behavior and violence against his wife, the current study included the following 6 variables: husband jealous if wife (respondent of the study) talks to other men, husband accuses wife of unfaithfulness, husband does not permit his wife to meet her girl friends, husband tries to limit wife’s contact with her family, husband insists on knowing where wife is, and husband does not trust his wife with monetary affairs.</p>
<p>To assess violence-related injuries, the following 4 questions were asked: ever had bruises; ever had injury, sprain, or dislocations; ever had wounds, broken bones, broken teeth, or other serious injuries; and ever had severe burns because of husband’s violent acts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539510384499">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to examine differences in proportions of exposure to domestic violence by demographic and socioeconomic variables. Logistic regression was calculated with all the variables included in the model to assess the independent contribution of these variables in predicting exposure to domestic violence. The magnitude and direction of association were expressed using adjusted odds ratios (ORs), and significance levels were expressed as <italic>P</italic> values. For presentation purposes, the model has been split into 3 separate tables. Statistical significance was assumed at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 for a large number of observations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539510384499">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>The standards for ethical and safety recommendations for research on domestic violence set out by the WHO were strictly followed for data collection in the domestic violence module to ensure women’s safety and maximum disclosure of actual violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510384499">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The field workers were trained by experienced experts for conducting interviews. An interviewer’s manual was also provided. Domestic violence is a sensitive issue, and some women may be reluctant to disclose experiences of violence. The training and guidelines were geared to development of the necessary awareness and skills for facilitating disclosure without placing the respondents or the interviewer at risk. Trained women interviewers interviewed the women respondents. NFHS-3 offered adequate training and support to field workers, secured informed consent, and guaranteed the privacy of the respondents.</p>
<p>Ethical approval for the survey was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Opinion Research Corporation, Macro International Incorporated.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>The proportions of women experiencing emotional and physical violence increased with age. However, there was an inverse trend for sexual violence; that is, younger women were proportionally more sexually abused than their older peers. As indicated by the adjusted ORs, older women were less likely to be victims of emotional and sexual violence compared with their teenaged peers. In addition, the likelihood of being a victim of violence (emotional and physical) decreased the higher the woman’s level of education. The prevalence of violence was higher among rural women than urban women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510384499">Table 1</xref>). However, when the ORs were adjusted for other variables, urban residence became a risk factor. The proportion of Muslim women was highest for all types of violence. As indicated by the adjusted ORs, compared with Hindu women, Muslims were more likely to be victims of all types of violence, and Christians were less likely to be victims of less severe physical violence and sexual violence. Scheduled caste women were proportionally most exposed to all types of violence. Compared with scheduled caste women, women of forward castes were less likely to be victims of violence, as indicated by the adjusted ORs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510384499">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Socioeconomic Indicators</title>
<p>Women of higher economic status had a lower exposure to domestic violence in India. As indicated by the adjusted odds ratio (OR), the poorest women are 2 to 3 times more likely to be victims of violence than rich women. Working women were proportionally more exposed to domestic violence than their nonworking peers. Adjusted ORs indicated that nonworking women were less likely to experience violence than their working peers. Women in the households with a woman as head of the household were proportionally more exposed to domestic violence than their peers in households with a man at the head of the household. Exposure to domestic violence for women whose husband lived with them was proportionally not very different compared with women whose husband lived elsewhere. Adjusted ORs indicated that women with a history of family violence were 2 to 3 times more likely to be victimized compared with those with no such family history (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510384499">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study using national data from the 29 member states of India indicated a prevalence of emotional violence of 14%, less severe physical violence of 31%, severe physical violence of 10%, and sexual violence of 8%, and highlighted some important socioeconomic risk factors. Husband’s controlling behavior emerged as an important risk factor for domestic violence against women in India.</p>
<p>Demographic factors such as age, residence, and education showed a common trend established by several earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384499">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510384499">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384499">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510384499">24</xref></sup> Muslim women as victims of domestic violence fared worse for all types of violence. A probable explanation might be found in the facts included in the Sachar Committee Report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510384499">25</xref></sup> which highlighted the social, economic, and educational deprivation of the Muslim community of India and indicated that their status is much lower than that of scheduled castes and tribes when compared with the general average. Women of scheduled castes had the highest exposure to domestic violence. This might be better explained by structural inequalities of gender, caste, and class in the Indian context. They are at the bottom of the caste system and under perpetual huge economic stress, which might lead to marital conflicts and hence domestic violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510384499">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510384499">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor economic status was a risk factor for domestic violence. This finding was in line with that from several previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384499">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384499">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384499">28</xref></sup> The working status of the women also emerged as a risk factor for domestic violence in India. A probable reason might be the superiority complex of the husbands. Historically, according to societal norms in India, the husband was the breadwinner of the family, and the women worked only in the household.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384499">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510384499">10</xref></sup> Women now work for economic benefit, and this might go against the long-nurtured societal beliefs of the husband and the notion of a husband’s empowerment in the family, thereby, inducing domestic violence against women. Women’s empowerment is often reflected by a combined measurement of education, working status, and economic independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510384499">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510384499">30</xref></sup> Therefore, when poor women try to achieve empowerment, it conflicts with their husband’s beliefs of superiority, which in turn induces domestic violence against women. However, in this context, an in-depth study on women’s economic empowerment and exposure to domestic violence is warranted.</p>
<p>That a history of family violence is a risk factor for domestic violence has long been established, and domestic violence is passed on from one generation to other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510384499">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384499">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384499">19</xref></sup> The current study has added further evidence from India using nationally representative samples. Therefore, policy makers should focus more on stopping domestic violence against women to protect future generations as well. A husband’s controlling behavior over his wife has emerged as a significant risk factor for violence. The same logic as used for women’s working status might be used to explain this. In India, the women depend on men for socioeconomic support. As a girl, she depends on her father, as a wife she depends on her husband, and as a widow she depends on her sons or other male relatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510384499">11</xref></sup> In a patriarchal society such as this, husbands might have the notion that as the breadwinner, they should control their wives through the traditional gender hierarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510384499">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510384499">32</xref></sup> Therefore, husbands’ controlling behavior and women’s economic empowerment have emerged as strong predictors for domestic violence in India. In brief, the findings can be explained by the feminist theory, where husbands maintain dominance over their wives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510384499">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510384499">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to studies from developed countries, lifetime exposure to verbal abuse in India is reported to be low compared with physical and sexual violence. A probable reason may be that social and cultural acceptance of verbal abuse in the Indian context may reduce the percentage reported. What is defined as verbal abuse in developed countries may be a normal life phenomenon in India, and for that reason, verbal abuse may not be reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384499">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The NFHS-3 has some important advantages compared with other surveys. First, it is nationally representative, allowing for conclusions to be generalized to the entire nation. Second, the sampling methodology and instruments used adhere to ethical standards for research in domestic violence as approved by the institutional review boards. Data collectors were trained to follow interview regulations based on the WHO’s recommendations for safety precautions for collection of domestic violence data. However, there are also weaknesses in the NFHS-3 domestic violence module that must be acknowledged. NFHS-3 used the same technical facilities as DHS from Macro International, United States. Research based on data from Nicaragua, Kenya, and Colombia suggest that DHS surveys still underestimate the extent of intimate partner violence compared with other surveys such as the WHO’s multicountry survey on gender-based violence and other specialized violence surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384499">18</xref></sup> Thus, the frequencies reported here may represent an underestimation. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow for causal inference; longitudinal study designs are warranted to firmly establish causal links. Studies on partner’s characteristics for perpetuating domestic violence are also warranted. The current study has focused only on domestic violence against women. However, in the patriarchal society in India, women might also face violence from other men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510384499">32</xref></sup> Therefore, another study on gender-based violence is highly warranted.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>The results of this article have some policy implications for prevention of domestic violence in India and in other countries with similar socioeconomic characteristics and cultural values. Bearing in mind that in India there is resistance to elimination of domestic violence by society at large and that society does not recognize that domestic violence is a serious public health problem, policy makers can now use the national prevalence rate from the current study for prevention. The severity of physical violence indicates that almost two thirds of violence-related injury victims had bruises, 18% of victims had sprains and dislocations, 13% had broken limbs, and 4% had burns. These findings should warn policy makers that the victims of domestic violence are suffering immensely as a result of physical violence. Evidence from other developing countries demonstrates that early detection through screening is effective in preventing domestic violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539510384499">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539510384499">36</xref></sup> Therefore, Indian policy makers should also plan for early detection and screening at health care facilities and at women NGOs.</p>
<p>There are large differences in the experiences of violence between women with higher education and uneducated women. Thus, these findings further strengthen the demand for higher education for women. Sufficient public health attention has been paid to educating girls. This has often focused on the provision of primary school education. The current study demonstrates that higher levels of education are increasingly protective against domestic violence against women. Policy makers should note that to reduce violence against women, not only do they have to educate the women, but they also have to emphasize female higher education programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384499">15</xref></sup> For successful educational campaigns against domestic violence, structural changes in society are also warranted because women of some castes and religions are at risk. Evidence from South Africa shows that microfinance-based empowerment programs for women have positive effects on preventing domestic violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539510384499">37</xref></sup> Therefore, instead of improving individual working status, policy makers should prioritize cooperative working facilities based on a microfinance system where women can gain from cooperative approaches to resolving their economic problems and can develop and share awareness of domestic violence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Elimination of the structural inequalities of castes and male hierarchy in society can prevent domestic violence. Muslim women need special attention from the policy makers. Higher education of girls, instead of literacy or primary education, should be emphasized.</p>
