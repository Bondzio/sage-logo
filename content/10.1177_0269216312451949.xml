<title>Background:</title>
<p>Many palliative cancer patients spend much of their last year at home. In the UK, district nurses make frequent support visits to patients and carers at this time, yet surprisingly little is known about their supportive role in palliative care. Current studies are limited to district nurses’ reports of practice, which offer limited insight into their content. Patients’ and carers’ views on district nurse support visits are largely unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312451949">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To present findings of a multi-perspective study that explored how district nurse early support visits are both described and carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312451949">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>Focus groups with district nurses to explore views on the purpose of early support visits. Observation of support visits to identify how they are conducted. Patient and carer interviews to elucidate and verify district nurse data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312451949">
<title>Setting and participants:</title>
 <p>Participants included 58 district nurses, 10 palliative care patients and nine carers from four Primary Care Trusts in contrasting urban and rural locations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312451949">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>District nurses had difficulty articulating early support visits. Observations however revealed a complex role comprising extensive physical and practical assessments, practical interventions, information giving, liaison, facilitation and referral. Patients and carers confirmed that they felt valued, reassured and supported by district nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216312451949">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>A multi-perspective approach provided new insights into district nurse support visits. Monitoring work described appears to have additional psycho-social benefits for patients and carers. The supportive role of district nurses needs to be clearly articulated and recognised so that colleagues, patients and carers access this valuable resource for palliative care patients.</p>

<p>Prolonged time spent with patients and carers during dying trajectories presents ideal opportunities to assess and plan future care, yet surprisingly little is known about the nurses’ contribution. A realist review of district (home care) nurses’ roles in palliative care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451949">9</xref></sup> identified that the importance of ‘relationships’ in palliative home care was frequently reported, but few studies have described how relationships are formed or their impact on care processes and outcomes. In our previous studies, British district nurses had difficulty articulating how they supported palliative patients and carers other than through building relationships by ‘chatting’ about social issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216312451949">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216312451949">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most studies to date have comprised interviews with district nurses, a methodology that offers limited insight into how care is actually provided. Nor have such studies concurrently obtained views of patients and carers on the care received.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451949">9</xref></sup> To address these limitations, we conducted a multi-perspective study which also included observations of practice. Our research question was: how do British district nurses (DNs) construct and conduct early support visits to cancer patients? In this context we defined early support visits as visits to patients early in the dying trajectory to provide physical, psychological and social care. In a previous paper from the study, we analysed one component of district nursing visits: psychological assessment and support. We reported that it was sometimes less than optimal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312451949">4</xref></sup> but noted that this was not the full extent of DNs’ supportive role. Many other activities carried out during visits have not previously been described in the literature. It is these that we report here. We aim to present DNs’ descriptions of the value and content of early support visits, our observations of what actually took place and patient and carer perceptions of outcomes.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>This qualitative study was designed to address limitations of previous studies of reported practice by (a) taking a multi-perspective approach, including views of DNs, patients and carers, and (b) directly observing and reporting on DN early support visits to patients and carers at home.</p>
<p>Focus groups were carried out with DNs to provide an initial exploration of the views of a large group of DNs on the purpose of early support visits to palliative patients. We were interested in obtaining as broad a view as possible of their constructions of early support. Observation was then used to identify how visits were conducted. Patient and carer interviews further elucidated and verified the DN data.</p>

</list>
<p>We met DN team leaders in each area to explain the study, discuss recruitment and hand out information packs for colleagues. DNs wishing to take part replied directly to us, electing to take part in the focus group and/or the observation part of the study.</p>
<p>The sample comprised 58 DNs. Of these, 47 took part in a focus group only, five in observation visits only and six in both a focus group and observation visits. One focus group was attended by just one participant and an individual interview was conducted. Of the participants, 28 were team leaders and 30 were staff nurses. Years of district nursing experience ranged from &lt;1 to 30 years (median 8). Educational preparation for palliative care varied: 28 had taken study days, short courses or other additional training, while nine had completed diploma courses and one a course in advanced practice in palliative care.</p>
<p>In all, six focus groups of 6–12 participants were conducted at DNs’ places of work, three in each location (October 2006–May 2007). Participants provided written consent prior to data collection. Focus groups lasted 60–90 minutes, and were facilitated by two researchers. DNs were asked about the purpose and content of early support visits.</p>

<list-item><p>2) Patients and carers:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>DNs willing to be observed reviewed their caseloads for potential participants using study inclusion criteria: adults with a diagnosis of cancer, at an early stage of palliative care, known to the DN team and for whom ESVs were being provided. When a patient was eligible for the study, DNs passed on a recruitment pack. Each DN team was asked to recruit one patient. Patients replied directly to the researchers, who arranged a home visit to explain the study and obtain written consent. If present, carers were also asked to take part.</p>
<p>A total of 10 patients took part in the observation study (seven women, three men; age range 53–85, median 72). All had advanced cancer (lung (3), breast (3), pancreas (1), vagina (1), throat (1) and oesophagus (1)). There were nine carers (five spouses, four daughters). In all, five patients were from North West England and five from the South East.</p>
<p>Observations of visits began in July 2006 and continued until April 2007, when 10 patients were recruited. We conducted two observations per patient. The first was conducted as close to admission to the DN caseload as possible. DNs made at least one visit to patients alone between observations. During observations we sat at the side of the room, as unobtrusively as possible, adopting a non-participant role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216312451949">32</xref></sup> On no occasion did anyone else enter the setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216312451949">33</xref></sup> Interactions between DNs and patients/carers were audio recorded, and field notes recording non-verbal communication were taken throughout and immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>We interviewed patients and carers before and after observations for background information and views on visits. Final patient/carer interviews took place immediately after second observation visits, or on another day if more convenient for patients. The data collection schedule is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312451949">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The DNs in this study valued palliative care, and all reported carrying out early support visits. The findings presented integrate observations of these visits with interviews from DNs, patients and carers. Four aspects of visits are described: assessment of physical care needs (the largest category), assessment and delivery of practical help, and two cross cutting themes: information giving and enabling talk.</p>
<sec id="section15-0269216312451949">
<title>Assessment of physical care needs</title>
<p>While the DNs reported carrying out early support visits, they had difficulty in articulating the content of these visits. This may be attributable to the early stage of dying trajectories. Only one instance of hands-on care was observed, when a syringe driver was set up to relieve nausea. DNs are associated with physical tasks and are often more comfortable in this domain, which might explain the poor articulation of early support. DNs reported that if possible, they preferred to use a physical task as a ‘lever’ into patients’ homes to enable further assessment:<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve just had a young chap referred, just turned 26, very advanced cancer. […]He’s on [drug] and doesn’t want to do it himself. So it’s been an ideal opportunity for us to go in every day, pick up problems that he wouldn’t bother anybody else with. He’s lost a lot of weight so we’re getting him supplement drinks […]And benefits […]He hasn’t got a penny coming in[… ]Nauseous, you know, just symptom control as well. It’s just picking up things as you go along.</p>
<p>FG 2 Site A</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We observed that most visits had a physical care focus, with assessment of physical symptoms occurring in every visit. Over 50 symptoms were assessed in total, with pain, breathlessness, loss of appetite, nausea and tiredness discussed most. Sometimes patients had one main symptom which was the focus; in other interactions as many as eight were discussed. DNs also reviewed effectiveness of medications and other treatments. Activities of Daily Living were assessed in every observation, including mobility, eating and drinking, sleeping, self care and continence.</p>
<p>Updates on existing support formed a prominent part of these assessments. In most visits patients updated DNs on input from clinicians, including GPs, hospital consultants, Macmillan Nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, and support from carers, family and friends. Carers’ concerns were also discussed, such as patients’ lack of appetite, smoking and pain medication and their own physical needs, including sleeping patterns, tiredness, physical symptoms and ability to move, handle and physically care for patients. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216312451949">Table 2</xref> illustrates the extent of physical assessment activity in one visit.</p>
<p>We observed that although a great deal of assessment activity was happening, it was carried out in a relaxed, conversational style which appeared to belie its complexity. DNs argued that this elicited more information than asking formal questions:<disp-quote>
<p>When I go in it’s a general chat, but I use it as an assessment, I don’t make it formal, I just pick up as I’m chatting along</p>
<p>FG1 Site B</p>
<p>It is sometimes almost like a social visit. You’re just, you know, chatting about general things. And sometimes just doing that other little problems will come out [Agreement from others]</p>

<p>This conversational style of assessment was the crux of their support work. The following extracts from two post-observation interviews suggest that patients recognised the skill involved:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s ways of getting people to talk, isn’t there? To open up to you […] She has the right approach [… ] if (DN) comes in and says, ‘hi how are you?, oh, are you having breakfast, right, I’ll wait a minute then before I do your dressing’, and she starts talking, and while she’s talking she’s asking me questions, but I’m not aware how deep the questions are until she’s gone, and I think, God, that was clever.</p>
<p>504 (4)</p>
<p>I’ve probably done it and let other things be known that I probably wouldn’t normally have said. So she’ll learn that bit more. Which, from her point is going to help […] because she knows that you might have tried doing this and that’s why this is hurting [… ] he’s trying to do something he shouldn’t have bloody done […] you’re just talking generally and you’re letting more out than you would normally.</p>
<p>502 (4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is difficult to capture the relaxed and facilitative style used by DNs because it occurred over the entire visit and was often conveyed through tone of voice, body language or positioning. Another extract from a visit with P502 begins to show how this style of assessment can elicit useful information:<disp-quote>
<p>DN: Have you been out and about in the car in this nice weather, because you used to go didn’t you, out at the weekend and things with friends?</p>
<p>Patient: Yes we did and no we haven’t.Uhm, well, I did something I shouldn’t have done last weekend, I built the extension ladder and put a slate back on the roof, but I didn’t go on the roof, I only went up to it and put, the last slate had come out and there was a hole.</p>
<p>502 (3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The patient provided information about activity levels and mobility in this brief exchange, and possibly motivation too. Another example is presented below. During a brief exchange the patient, who was often breathless, offered insight into activity levels, mobility and motivation to self manage. Use of humour is evident here:<disp-quote>
<p>Patient: I keep myself busy as much as I can […] I try and do things in the morning, like a bit of washing […] I promised myself this afternoon I might have one of my nice soaky baths.</p>
<p>DN: Lovely, very nice. The other week I was aching top to toe and went round to see a patient about four o’clock and she’d had a bath, you know when you have one with all the bubbles? I thought, just what I need (laughter)! I was dead jealous of her!</p>
<p>Patient: You know when you see them on the films you know, and all these bubbles, and I’m bringing them all up, you know (laughter). Being leisurely you see, and I can get my feet flat and then my ears are in it, you know […] and then I sort of slide down and pull the plug out a tiny bit you know (laughter)…</p>
<p>0503 (2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frequent visits enabled monitoring of patients’ conditions. Monitoring was, where possible, organised around patients’ commitments:<disp-quote>
<p>DN: Okedoke. So I’ll come and see you … Probably next Wednesday, but I’ll ring and if you get anything else organised, go and do it […] If somebody says ‘Oh let’s go to that place today’ then don’t say ‘Oh I’ve got to wait for the nurse’.

<title>Assessment and delivery of practical help</title>
<p>Although physical needs dominated visits, DNs also assessed the need for practical help. This was mostly a review of equipment and assessment of any further requirements, including a wide range of mobility aids and specialist equipment, from wheelchairs and walking frames to TENS machines. DNs liked to receive early referrals to install equipment that might prevent further complications:<disp-quote>

<title>Information giving</title>
<p>Information giving was a cross cutting theme throughout assessments, encompassing a wide range of activities.

Enlightenment described general information about help available from, perhaps, social services or DN evening services; Explanation/Education could be about a specific medication; Advice was individual guidance on self care/meeting personal hygiene needs; and Instruction was more imperative, comprising information on taking medications or, for carers, moving and handling. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216312451949">Table 3</xref> captures the range of information provided in one visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216312451949">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Enabling talk</title>
<p>Throughout visits we observed three types of interactions which we describe as ‘enabling talk’: liaison, facilitation and referral. An example of liaison was a when a DN told the patient she would contact the GP about an infected lymph node; facilitation was exemplified when a DN informed the patient she would arrange delivery of medications by the pharmacy. Referral was shown when a DN contacted another service, such as a specialist palliative care team:<disp-quote>
<p>DN1: And we can refer to palliative services if we think […] whatever symptom is not controlled and we think that they need specialist service that would help…</p>

<title>Patient and carer views of visits</title>
<p>When interviewed prior to our observations, patients and carers described visits simply as ‘just a talk’ or ‘a chat’:<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: And what sort of things did she do when she came on that first visit?</p>
<p>Pt and Carer: Merely chatting really {Right}. I mean she could see that we’d got an understanding of what was going on {Aha}</p>
<p>101 (1)</p>
<p>Patient: They just sit and talk really. Nothing else at the moment.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Nothing else at the moment?</p>
<p>Patient: No.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What sort of things do they usually talk to you about?</p>
<p>Patient: Anything really. You know, like we are.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Having a chat?</p>
<p>Patient: Yeah.</p>
<p>203 (1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These descriptions may be due to DNs’ conversational style, because post-observation interviews suggested that some patients were highly aware of the complexity of assessments. There was good evidence that the use of this style in assessing needs and providing interventions had the desired effect of supporting patients and carers:<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: What sort of things do they do that you find helpful?</p>
<p>Patient: Well it’s just talking to them really. {is it?} Yeah. We can talk about everything. {Everything} You know what comes to mind, whatever yeah</p>
<p>Interviewer: What’s the difference that they make?</p>
<p>Patient: It’s just that you feel that you’ve got someone behind you to help you if you need it. That’s the way I look at it.</p>
<p>203 (4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While only one patient described their interactions with the DN as ‘a relationship’, all confirmed that they felt valued, supported and reassured. They also described regard and affection for DNs, and a sense of equality which humour appeared to facilitate:<disp-quote>
<p>Patient: [Hospital nurses] talk down to you as if you’re a child</p>
<p>Interviewer: […]And so you feel that you’ve got more of an even…?</p>
<p>Patient: Yes, yes, like today’s visit, last week do you remember I said don’t please send Dr [name]. So [DN] came today, I said I’m surprised you’ve shown your face after sending that woman. She said well that’s why I kept away for a week (laughing) I didn’t know how my welcome would be. I said, well lucky for you it’s good because she was wonderful […] She laughed and said, am I in your good books or bad books? I said, well I haven’t decided, I’ll let you know by the end of the visit. So at the end of the visit she said, I’m going to send someone to measure you for a stick for your caliper, and they [the person] said, well maybe a zimmer frame, she said, oh no, I don’t want a zimmer frame it’s not for an elderly person this. I said you’re back in my good books (laughing)</p>
<p>504 (4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, patients and carers talked about the ‘reassurance’ and ‘peace of mind’ derived from DNs’ visits, which was what they hoped to achieve:<disp-quote>
<p>Carer: It [the visit] is reassuring as well.</p>
<p>Interviewer: And what do you find reassuring?</p>
<p>Patient: [pause] If she wasn’t happy with me she wouldn’t go out the door.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So is it important that she’s actually a district nurse as opposed to somebody else?</p>
<p>Carer: I think, personally, it’s more reassuring to have a nursing qualification, I feel for peace of mind –</p>
<p>Interviewer: That she’ll pick up something?</p>
<p>Carer: Definitely.</p>
<p>502 (4)</p>
<p>Carer: Yes, because I know my mum gets on with (DN) very well and she’s very supportive…</p>
<p>Patient: She gives you encouragement though as well, doesn’t she?</p>
<p>Interviewer: She’s supporting you as someone who’s supporting your mother?</p>
<p>Carer: Yes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DNs valued their support visits but had difficulty articulating their content. There was little hands-on care at this early stage, and nursing input was less tangible and easily described. Observations revealed, however, that support comprised extensive physical and practical assessments, practical interventions, information giving and liaison, facilitation and referral. This work was carried out in a relaxed, informal and empowering style that belied its complexity. The breadth of assessment and interventions demonstrate DNs’ expertise, requiring knowledge of physical conditions, medications, other treatments and resources available and ability to liaise with colleagues. Patient and carer interview data verified the outcome of visits: they felt valued, reassured and supported.</p>
<sec id="section21-0269216312451949">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>A major strength of this study was our observational approach, which overcame the limitations of previous studies of reported practice and enabled us to identify the complexities of early support visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451949">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216312451949">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216312451949">31</xref></sup> While in-depth, however, it is recognised that the observational study was small scale and the sample self selected. These DNs provided support visits, so may have been skilled. Willingness to be observed may also have demonstrated the value placed on this aspect of their work. However, we believe that the visits observed were typical of the practices of DN participants: the nurses themselves confirmed this, as did the patients observed. This was a small scale study aimed at providing an initial examination of the conduct of early support visits. Further research is required to take this forward and determine whether the range and complexity of assessments and interventions observed is typical, or is practice at its best.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0269216312451949">
<title>What this study adds</title>
<p>This study examines support provided by British DNs in generalist palliative home care through direct observation, and also reports the views of patients and carers on support received. Previous research describing the purpose of support visits as ‘developing relationships’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312451949">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312451949">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451949">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451949"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451949">18</xref></sup> offers only a partial analysis. Relationships appear to develop as a result of, or alongside, provision of complex and skilled nursing care.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that patients and carers can feel supported psychologically and emotionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216312451949">37</xref>-40</sup> through the reassurance gained from informal but skilled assessment and interventions in physical, practical and social domains of care. There are similarities between our findings and those of Mackenzie et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216312451949">35</xref></sup> who found that frequent home nursing visits improved physical well being through regular assessment and interventions that increased patients’ and carers’ self-efficacy. However, their Australian sample provided more hands-on physical care than ours and nurses visited patients daily – unlike our sample, who had weekly visits at most. We found that reassurance was still present without hands-on nursing care and with less frequent visits.</p>
<p>In some nurse–patient interactions power differentials can be problematic;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216312451949">36</xref></sup> we found here that while knowledgeable and in a powerful position, DNs appeared to minimise potential differences in status. Richardson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216312451949">37</xref></sup> has described different types of therapeutic interaction: personal interactions that help patients to feel better psychologically, and professional interactions that provide physical help. In personal interactions the humanistic and egalitarian nature of encounters was perceived to be therapeutic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216312451949">37</xref></sup> Our analysis demonstrates that professional and personal interactions are intricately intertwined. Through the range of assessment and interventions (professional interactions), DNs demonstrated knowledge and expertise and reassured and supported patients and carers. Equally, however, their relaxed and informal style (personal interactions) facilitated full assessment of patients’ needs. DNs conveyed expertise, respect and genuine desire to work with patients and carers. In turn, patients offered information about themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0269216312451949">
<title>Implications for clinical practice</title>
<p>Our findings have a number of implications for practice. Greater understanding of the complexity of the DN role in the early palliative period is important for health care professionals working alongside DNs, as well as for palliative patients and their carers. Greater clarity about what constitutes ‘early support’ from DNs, particularly the contribution of expert monitoring, has the potential to enhance referrals from hospital based colleagues and family doctors. Without articulation, colleagues are unlikely to understand nurses’ full contribution, to articulate this to patients and to refer early in dying trajectories. In turn, if it is not well articulated by colleagues or the nurses themselves, patients may fail to make use of this valuable resource because they do not understand what it is or why they might need it.</p>
<p>In the current climate of financial constraints, early support visits could potentially play a part in reducing costly emergency hospital admissions, enabling a ‘good’ death, and increasing home deaths. Further research is needed to explore such claims. More modestly, however, providing support to patients through skilled assessment and management in physical, practical and social domains, given its impact on the physical and psychological health of patients and carers, should be both recognised and valued as an efficient use of nursing time.</p>
