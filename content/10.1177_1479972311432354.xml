<p>The measurement of physical activity has become a ‘hot topic’ in the field of pulmonary rehabilitation, as reflected in the systematic review in this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479972311432354">1</xref></sup> The assessment of physical activity is not new however, and there is an accumulating literature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The level of activity in COPD seems particularly low in comparison with other significant long-term condition, a comparative review of physical activity revealed that activity for individuals was almost half that of individuals with coronary heart disease or arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972311432354">2</xref></sup> More recently Watz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479972311432354">3</xref></sup> described the falling levels of activity associated with increasing disease severity. This interest in physical activity was consolidated by the data obtained from the interaction between physical activity and hospital admissions reported from the Copenhagen Heart Study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479972311432354">4</xref></sup> although at this time the physical activity was described with data from a questionnaire. More specifically high levels of physical activity seem to protect against subsequent readmissions for COPD, the authors of this article suggested that individuals needed to accumulate 60 min of walking a day to reduce the risk of readmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479972311432354">5</xref></sup> Pulmonary rehabilitation would seem the ideal intervention to improve physical activity; supporting behaviour change to enhance physical activity is an implicit aim of the service. It has often been assumed that a meaningful change in exercise tolerance after completing a course of rehabilitation will translate into a significant improvement in physical activity. Until fairly recently it has been difficult to objectively test this assumption, but with the commercial development of activity monitors and increased availability of pedometers some authors have tested this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479972311432354">1</xref></sup> aimed to evaluate the impact of exercise training upon physical activity. There were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs), this is perhaps not surprising as the monitors are a fairly recent addition to the repertoire of outcome measures and to conduct an RCT where the control group is no intervention would now be considered unethical. Two RCTs were identified; one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972311432354">6</xref></sup> explored the relative value of two different exercise regimes delivered within a rehabilitation programme, one arm being conventional rehabilitation. The second, again used conventional rehabilitation as the control arm, but this time compared the standard programme with the addition of a physical activity counselling programme. There were an additional five observational studies included, all were reasonably small sample sizes, with the exception of the recent study by Steele et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479972311432354">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Overall there was a favourable increase in physical activity observed after a course of rehabilitation but this was felt to be small. There are probably a number of reasons to account for this, most obviously that rehabilitation genuinely failed to provoke a significant increase in physical activity. Changes in domestic activity require a supported and structured approach to supervised and home-based exercise and behaviour techniques should be employed to support increased activity during and after a course of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation practitioners have probably been guilty of not pursuing this aspect of rehabilitation as rigorously as might be required to support behaviour change. The authors of this review suggest that a longer course of rehabilitation might be needed to develop these strategies and reinforce behaviour change.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that there is substantial variability in physical activity as an outcome measure and consequently requires large populations to establish conclusively that rehabilitation improves physical activity.</p>
<p>There may be some subtleties in how the data are expressed. This review included research that expressed physical activity predominately in terms of daily step count, which may be misleading. The quality of the activity is not described in terms of intensity or duration. An important component of rehabilitation is pacing, which almost contradicts the agenda to be more active; perhaps we should be aiming to understand the profile of activity more. Now that we have sophisticated activity monitors, we should be more sophisticated in how we explore the impact of rehabilitation.</p>
