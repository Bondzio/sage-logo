<abstract>
<p>This study proposes a new control strategy, control via self-improvement, in addition to primary and secondary control. This strategy is aimed at an actual external change (primary target), whereas the means to reach the goal is self-improvement (secondary target—the self). A study conducted in Israel and in Hong Kong indicated that the strategy of control via self-improvement exists in the achievement domain and is more prevalent in Hong Kong than in Israel.</p>

<body>
<p>The present study builds upon the distinction between primary and secondary control and proposes an intermediate category that involves basic characteristics of both traditional control strategies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022110388565">Rothbaum, Weisz, and Snyder (1982)</xref>, perceived control over psychological events can be distinguished into two types: primary control, which represents individuals’ perception of their ability and their actual attempts to influence existing realities and to shape their environment so that the external environment will better fit their needs and wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022110388565">Heckhausen &amp; Schulz, 1995</xref>), and secondary control, which represents a tendency to reshape personal attitudes, wishes, and expectations to accommodate them to external circumstances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022110388565">Rothbaum et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the dichotomy is widely used to characterize control strategies, a question of its sufficiency has been raised. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022110388565">Yamaguchi (2001)</xref> argued that the traditional, prototypical strategy is not sufficient to describe all primary control strategies. Thus, the direct-personal control, which reflects direct attempts to shape the environment, is typical only to Western cultures. He suggested three additional forms of primary control, described as follows: indirect-personal control, which allows people to gain control over the environment while they hide their agency; collective control, in which a group of people serves as an agent of control; and proxy control, in which individuals influence others who directly act on the environment. In line with the theoretical claim, direct-personal control was more prevalent in societies that value autonomy, while the other three were more prevalent in societies that value harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022110388565">Yamaguchi, Gelfand, Ohashi, &amp; Zemba, 2005</xref>). The terminology and findings point to the richness of control strategies and suggest that the traditional primary-secondary distinction may not be exhaustive.</p>
<p>In the present study, we go beyond primary and secondary control by proposing an intermediate category of control between them, which includes elements of both but is important enough to be separately defined. This new category, control via self-improvement, is defined as applying a strategy of actual self-improvement that leads to genuine changes in the external situation. Unlike the primary versus secondary control, which involves either the external world or the self as targets for change, this strategy of control involves both targets. In general, control via self-improvement involves working harder and improving self-products that can further affect external reality. Thus, an unsatisfying outcome can motivate self-improvement processes that will improve the self but will also affect the external situation in the long run. In a way, this strategy may present a situation in which “people simultaneously act for change in the environment and accept the environment as it is” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022110388565">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>, p. 293).</p>
<p>For example, a person works harder than before after failing a test in order to retake the test and improve the actual performance; another person may volunteer for extra assignments and execute them carefully to compensate for an unsuccessful outcome; and someone who is turned down for a job may upgrade his or her qualification (e.g., by taking certain courses or gaining experience through voluntary activities) and apply for the same job again. As noted from the above examples, this control strategy includes the target of primary control, external reality, as a superordinate target—and it also includes a target of secondary control, the self, as a subordinate target. All the examples are anchored in the achievement domain, which lends itself to self-improvement more easily than other domains. In the present study, we would try to show that control via self-improvement is used in the achievement domain across different cultures.</p>
<p>It is expected that control via self-improvement would be more prevalent in East Asia. This notion is based on two different existing research lines. First, studies have shown that non-Western cultures are usually marked by lower primary control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022110388565">Kurman &amp; Dan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022110388565">Trommsdorff &amp; Essau, 1998</xref>). This trend does not necessarily indicate low aspirations to change the environment in these cultures but rather reflects cultural norms that prohibit some but not all ways in changing the external entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022110388565">Yamaguchi, 2001</xref>). The other relevant body of literature, supporting the prevalence of control via self-improvement in East Asian cultures, shows that such cultures uniquely endorse effort and self-improvement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022110388565">Heine, Lehman, Markus, &amp; Kitayama, 1999</xref>). Thus, a culturally encouraged way to change the external situation can be through improving the self.</p>
<p>The present study was conducted in Israel, a rather Westernized country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022110388565">Seginer &amp; Halabi, 1991</xref>), and Hong Kong, which is a part of China in East Asia.</p>
<p>In the present study, participants were asked to describe in detail “what they would do” if confronted with hypothetical scenarios, all portraying unsatisfactory situations. The use of each control strategy was estimated according to the reported responses, which were assessed for which kind of control they conveyed. The use of primary control, control via self-improvement, and secondary control was estimated. A preliminary overview of the primary control responses revealed a considerable amount of direct-personal responses, in which actors directly utilize their own psychological resources to control external targets, and of proxy control responses, in which actors activate other people (usually close to them, at least to some degree) to control the external target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022110388565">Yamaguchi, 2001</xref>). Primary control will be therefore estimated in the present study by two categories: direct-personal and proxy primary control.</p>
<p>Two variables were tested as cultural predictors of the use of control strategies. The first is locus of control, based upon its theoretical closeness to control strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022110388565">Rothbaum et al., 1982</xref>). Following Rothbaum, a positive relation is expected between internal and primary control. The newly proposed strategy, control via self-improvement, may be contingent upon internal attributions as well, as self-improvement implies self-responsibility. Face, which is the concern for social reputation and for how a person is perceived by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022110388565">Hwang, 2006</xref>), can also discourage direct-personal primary control. Trying to directly affect others may increase the probability of losing face in the eyes of those others, and imposing one’s goals on others may violate cultural norms. Based on the literature, it is expected that Hong Kong students will reveal a relatively high level of face concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110388565">Chan, Wan, &amp; Sin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022110388565">Hui &amp; Bond, 2009</xref>) as well as a tendency toward external attributions, which are part of the collectivist syndrome (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022110388565">Morris &amp; Peng, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The study’s hypotheses were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0022022110388565" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The use of all control strategies will be evident and statistically greater than zero in both cultures.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022022110388565">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The study included 393 university students, 190 Israeli-born (secular and urban), 48 men and 142 women, ranging in age from 18 to 32 (<italic>M</italic> = 22.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.94), and 203 Hong Kong students, 116 men and 87 women, ranging in age from 17 to 31 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.44, <italic>SD</italic> =1.04). They filled in the study’s questionnaire in groups of up to 10 participants. Fifteen minutes were allocated for the open-ended questionnaire. Participant were asked to list “everything they would do” in each of the described scenarios. A subsample (90 Israeli born, 24 men and 66 women, ranging in age from 18 to 32; <italic>M</italic> = 22.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.36; and 100 Hong Kong students, 66 men and 34 women, ranging in age from 18 to 31; <italic>M</italic> = 19.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15) filled in two additional measures, which were back-translated from English to Hebrew and Chinese (the Face scale had an original Chinese version).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022022110388565">
<title>Scenarios Measures</title>
<p>The scenarios are based on failure events in the achievement domain brought up by Israelis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110388565">Kurman, Yoshihara-Tanaka, &amp; Elkoshi, 2003</xref>), adapted to Hong Kong reality by the Hong Kong research team, and then adapted back to Israel. We have concentrated on the achievement domain (rather than interpersonal relationships) given its relevance to all control categories. An English version was agreed upon by the two research teams. The events, written in English, were back-translated to Hebrew and Chinese to be used in Israel and Hong Kong, respectively.</p>
<p>The scenarios are described as follows: (a) “You were very interested in a part-time job that offered attractive benefits (e.g., discounts for medical service and many paid holidays). After you sent your CV to the company, the company told you it did not need extra workers. A few days later, you heard the company had hired some new part-time workers.” (b) “You attempted to get a part-time job with good benefits from a government agency. You thought you did very well at the interview, but your application was rejected. You discovered that those who were offered the job had connections with leading people in that department.” (c) “You wanted to improve your grades on public examinations. You tried the examination again this year, but you received a poorer grade this time.” (d) “You need to make an oral presentation to fulfill the course requirements, which will count for 50% of the final course grade. You prepared the presentation in detail, but during the presentation you had difficulties expressing your ideas clearly and forgot to present some important ideas. You ended the presentation poorly.” (e) “You belong to a special interest club at the university and currently are working on a proposal for a future activity for club members. You prepared it very well, but the chairman rejected the whole idea.”</p>

<title>Coding Categories of Control Strategies</title>
<sec id="section5-0022022110388565">
<title>Direct-personal primary control</title>
<p>The actor operates directly on people who are involved in the specific unsatisfying situation (e.g., “convince the professor to ignore the presentation”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022022110388565">
<title>Proxy primary control</title>
<p>The actor activates somebody else who can help in the situation (e.g., “ask another club member to talk to the chairman on my behalf”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022022110388565">
<title>Control via self-improvement</title>
<p>The actor applies active and concrete self-improvement strategies by trying to enhance achievements or to improve the impressions of others in order to influence the present situation (e.g., “improve the paper” or “improve self-qualifications before applying to a job following rejection”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022022110388565">
<title>Secondary control</title>
<p>The actor uses cognitive (instead of behavioral) means to self-explain the failure (e.g., “attribute the failure to certain factors”) or uses general positive thinking (e.g., “believe in my ability,” “console myself”). Another subcategory is to accept the situation (e.g., “accept the truth”). The various subcategories were aggregated.</p>
<p>Internal consistencies for the respective four control categories were αs = .55, .64, .69, and .68 for Israel and .50, .72, .73, and .82 for Hong Kong. Note that direct personal control had the lowest internal consistency, reflecting a unique impact of the characteristics of the specific situation on this control category. Higher internal consistencies of primary control were obtained in previous studies that were mostly based on multiple-choice scales, which limit the number of response options and thus contribute to internal consistency. Correlations between the different categories ranged from .11 to .65 (between the two primary control strategies). Because more responses were given in Israel than in Hong Kong, the final measure of preference for each control strategy was calculated as the number of category-relevant responses divided by the total number of answers each person gave across all the scenarios.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022022110388565">
<title>Reliability of Judgments</title>
<p>Reliability for number of responses per respondent was 96% agreement in Israel and 98% in Hong Kong (among two judges of each culture). Interjudge reliability regarding the evaluation of the control strategy used in each response was established. First, the reliability of two graduate judges (one of each culture) was established within culture, with the first and second authors serving as additional judges to establish the reliability of the graduate students as judges. Kappa coefficient was .91 in Israel (252 responses) and .87 in Hong Kong (223 responses). Cross-cultural reliability of judgments was established for the above graduate students, based on the responses of 10 people from each culture. The events were translated into English and assessed by these two judges (Kappa = .88; 188 responses). Each of the judges evaluated all the events of the respective culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022022110388565">
<title>Item Bias Detection</title>
<p>Item bias detection was conducted for each of the four control categories to detect any cultural bias of the items. Log-linear modeling set up according to the Mantel-Haenszel procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022110388565">van de Vijver &amp; Leung, 1997</xref>) was conducted (five levels were defined for each control strategy according to the relevant frequencies). No cultural bias was detected for any of the categories, Pearson χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 5.56, 3.05, 1.27, and 3.18 for direct personal, proxy, self-improvement, and secondary control categories, respectively (all were nonsignificant).</p>
<sec id="section11-0022022110388565">
<title>Attribution style</title>
<p>Each of the scenarios was rated on a 7-point scale regarding the question of the extent to which the main cause of the event was the actor’s responsibility (1) or the responsibility of others (7). The question was taken from the Attributional Style Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022110388565">Peterson et al., 1982</xref>), which measures locus of control (filled in by a subsample).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022022110388565">
<title>Face</title>
<p>The 16-item scale was taken from the CPAI-2 (Cross-Cultural [Chinese] Personality Assessment Inventory–2) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110388565">Cheung et al. (1996)</xref> (a sample item: “Sometimes I pretend I understand a lot, because I do not want others to look down on me.”). Originally a yes/no answering scale was used. A 6-point answering scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) was used in the present study to increase the variance and to achieve a better approximation to an interval scale. Three items were deleted due to alpha considerations. Internal consistencies for the remaining 13 items were α = .76 in Israel and α = .73 in Hong Kong (filled in by a subsample).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022022110388565" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All control categories were evident in both cultures (differed from zero in the two cultures—<italic>t</italic>s ranged from 8.74 to 37.93 in Israel and from 15.01 to 31.90 in Hong Kong; all significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), confirming Hypothesis 1. The newly suggested strategy of control via self-improvement was clearly present in both cultures.</p>
<p>A preliminary analysis revealed no multivariate main effect of gender or of culture by gender interaction (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1 for both). Gender was therefore omitted from further analysis. A cross-cultural comparison conducted by a MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate effect (Hotelling-Lowly trace = .85), <italic>F</italic>(4, 388) = 82.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0022022110388565">

<p>In line with Hypothesis 3a, both external attributions and face were higher in Hong Kong than in Israel (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022110388565">Table 1</xref>). Simple correlations between the control categories and the cultural variables were computed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022110388565">Table 1</xref>). As hypothesized (3b), secondary control was positively related to external attribution and to face, whereas direct-personal primary control was negatively related to both. Proxy primary control was negatively related to face but not to external attributions. Control via self-improvement was negatively related to external control but positively to face, reflecting the intermediate quality of this control strategy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study used an open-ended questionnaire to study the nature of control in achievement settings in two different cultures. The use of an open-ended questionnaire has two important advantages over structured self-reports. First, it closely reflects which control strategies individuals generate to resolve problems. Second, the open-ended questionnaire avoids researchers’ imposed conception of control, thereby more accurately reflecting lay conception of control. In this study, we defined a new control strategy, control via self-improvement. This strategy incorporates characteristics of both primary and secondary control, as it involves changing the external world as the endpoint, via self-improvement, with the self as the target.</p>
<p>The presented data showed that control via self-improvement in the achievement domain is evident and more prevalent in Hong Kong than in Israel. It is related to internal attribution, as is primary control, but it is also positively related to face, as is secondary control. It may be that concerns for face discourage the actor from trying to influence others—either personally or through agents—but a belief in personal responsibility for the outcome prevents the actor from renouncing the external target and encourages self-improvement. It should be noted that the sizes of correlations of the cultural variables were rather low (but not neglectable, given that no common method factor was involved).</p>
<p>The suggested course of attempting to achieve control in the achievement domain pertains to three alternatives following unsatisfying outcomes that encourage change. One is to operate directly on the external environment (primary control), and another is to give up coping. The third option is to operate on the self. Two different processes are suggested. One is changing the long-run goals, attitudes, and expectations (secondary control). The second process is to self-improve, with an expectation for the self-improvement to further affect the environment—to eventually achieve the original goals.</p>
<p>As control via self-improvement primarily aims at changing an external outcome, it could be claimed that it is, in fact, an additional type of primary control. We claim that although control via self-improvement is aimed at external change, which is a primary control characteristic, it lacks another characteristic that is part of the conceptualization of primary control—attempts to achieve effects in the immediate external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022110388565">Heckhausen &amp; Schulz, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, control via self-improvement primarily aims at changing the self; therefore, it could be claimed that it is, in fact, an additional type of secondary control. Although it shares some of the secondary control characteristics, the relevant changes in control via self-improvement are not kept within the individual. Moreover, there is an agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022110388565">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110388565">Skinner, 2007</xref>) that the aim of secondary control is accommodation—that is, to accept the existing reality and to fit into it. Control via self-improvement lacks this central characteristic of secondary control. Self-improvement is therefore considered as a separate, intermediate control strategy.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that proxy primary control, supposedly typical in cultures that value harmony, was less prevalent in Hong Kong, a culture that endorses harmony (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022110388565">Fung &amp; Ng, 2006</xref>), than in Israel. When only responses of primary control were considered (of direct personal and proxy primary control), the percentage of proxy primary control was higher among Hong Kong participants than among Israelis (51% vs. 38%, respectively). These findings may imply that there is indeed a relative preference for proxy control over direct-personal control in East Asian cultures, as was described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022110388565">Yamaguchi, 2001</xref>), but this difference does not disqualify the more prevalent contention that primary control is less prevalent in East Asia than in the West.</p>
<p>The present study is the first to suggest the new control strategy. It clearly showed that in certain cases control via self-improvement is used, and more so in an East Asian culture. Future studies should try to extend our understanding of this control strategy by investigating its frequency and correlates in other domains, such as personal relationships. Future development of a formal scale that measures control via self-improvement can help in achieving that. Even more challenging is to investigate the reflection of the control strategies, and especially of control via self-improvement, in actual behaviors. As reported responses are contaminated to a certain extent by social desirability and self-deception, behavioral manifestations of the control strategies can be illuminating.</p>
<p>The main caveats of the study are that only two cultures were investigated, that it relied on college student samples, and that it was limited to the achievement domain. These caveats call for replications of the study with diverse samples in diverse domains and in more cultures. Nevertheless, the main advantage of the study, of not imposing theoretical constructs on participants and of relying on their spontaneous responses, enabled identification and some understanding of a newly suggested control strategy—control via self-improvement.</p>
