<p>In <italic>Casino Women</italic>, Susan Chandler and Jill B. Jones, both professors of social work at the University of Nevada, Reno, describe the lives of women who have worked in Nevada’s casino industry. Drawing on forty-six interviews with past and current workers, they paint a picture of difficult working conditions but also of mobilization and resistance. During their research, three themes repeatedly emerged: first, the women’s transformation as they worked in the gambling industry and became increasingly conscious of their class, race, and gender oppression; second, how such awareness translated into mobilization, especially through the form of unionization; and third, the conditions under which mobilization was stunted or ceased to occur in the first place.</p>
<p>Substantively, the book is organized into five sections. Part I compares “back of the house” workers (mainly Latina room cleaners) with those who work in the “front of the house” (especially Caucasian cocktail waitresses). The labor of both groups is necessary for the production of a fantasy world for patrons. Part II recounts the impressive history of labor organization in Nevada. While industrial unions elsewhere were focusing on blue-collar men, the service unions of Las Vegas from the start sought to organize women and minorities. Part III centers upon a legal fight waged by a female bartender who was required by her employer, Harrah’s Entertainment, to wear heavy makeup on the job. Eventually the courts decided that the company’s mandate to have women, but not men, coat their faces in chemicals was not an unlawful act of discrimination. Part IV considers the financial allure of casino dealing, but also the heavy costs it entails due to the health hazards associated with prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke. Part V concludes with a case study of women who have “crossed over” to the other side of the worker-management divide.</p>
<p>The majority of data in <italic>Casino Women</italic> consists of life history narratives from past and current casino employees. The benefit of such first-person accounts is that they encourage us to see the world from the point of view of actors themselves. Here Chandler and Jones demonstrate their skill as interviewers, and also as writers able to weave together women’s narratives into a coherent assemblage of themes and experiences. For this reason, the book would be useful for courses on feminist and qualitative research methods (in addition to its obvious interest for scholars of labor history, the American West, and the service economy). On the other hand, some readers may yearn for more systematic summaries of the data. The lack of a discussion of how interviewees were selected for inclusion in the study and of how exactly the interviews were conducted also would have been helpful for evaluating how representative were the experiences of this sample of workers. I also found myself wishing that the authors could have found a way to include more ethnographic evidence, such as photographs of the women, their workplaces, and homes (and with their consent of course). Their stories were so inspirational that I would have liked to have had some visual reference points to accompany the narratives themselves.</p>
<p>One further strength of the book is that it shows how mobilization on the part of casino workers was not so unexpected after all. The Nevada gambling industry possessed a monopoly on casinos during the 1960s and 1970s, and tourists were flooding in to gamble and party. During the 1980s and 1990s, publicly traded firms provided the industry with investment capital. All that was missing was a steady supply of labor, and it was the Culinary Union which stepped in to supply it. As Chandler and Jones recount, the union’s long-time leader Al Bramlet “established a smooth relationship with…owners” and set about “delivering a steady supply of [workers] to…casinos” (p. 51). The service work that takes place in casinos cannot be offshored. Most casinos, furthermore, were not willing to engage in prolonged battles with striking workers (the exception being the family-owned Frontier casino, where workers engaged in the longest strike in U.S. history). In short, this was a classic case in which workers possessed bargaining leverage vis-à-vis employers along multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of Las Vegas is important to recognize, given that the city has become a symbol of hope for the U.S. labor movement. Many have argued that the Culinary Union’s success in organizing low-wage workers, many of whom are female and immigrant, can be replicated elsewhere. The early successes of the Justice for Janitors movement gave momentum to this idea. However, the continued decline of unionization rates suggests that courage is a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustained mobilization and successful organizing. As the Nevada economy continues to stagnate and as casino gambling becomes more widely available across the country, the question will be whether the workers of Nevada can hold on to the concessions that they historically managed to wrest from firms.</p>
