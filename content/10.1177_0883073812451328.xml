<abstract>
<p>Owing to the risk of severe rhabdomyolysis, clinicians advise McArdle disease patients to refrain from strenuous exercise, particularly weight lifting. A 15-year-old male McArdle disease patient performed a 6-week, supervised, light- to moderate-intensity (∼65-70% of one-repetition-maximum) resistance (weight lifting) training program (2 sessions/week). Training resulted in ∼27% and ∼6% increase in one-repetition-maximum bench press and multipower squat performance while inducing no myoglobinuria. The patient changed to a lower disease severity class, that is, he became virtually asymptomatic in terms of exercise limitations. The authors’ preliminary data suggest that supervised, light to moderate resistance training is feasible in children with McArdle disease and has potential clinical benefits.</p>

<body>
<p>McArdle disease (glycogenosis type V or myophosphorylase deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of muscle glycogen metabolism (prevalence of ∼1/167.000 Caucasians).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> Patients have pathogenic mutations in both alleles of the <italic>PYGM </italic>gene, which encodes myophosphorylase, the skeletal muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451328">2</xref></sup> as a result, they are unable to obtain energy from their muscle glycogen stores.</p>
<p>Clinical symptoms frequently start during the first decade of life, that is, typically in the school playground and physical education classes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> The clinical presentation is dominated by exercise intolerance in the form of reversible, acute crises of early fatigue and contractures, which are frequently accompanied by exertional rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by marked increases in serum levels of creatine kinase activity and myoglobinuria (the latter being referred to by patients as “dark urines”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> Rhabdomyolysis can sometimes be so severe as to cause acute renal failure. Owing to blocked glycogenolysis, exercise intolerance is most marked during exercise tasks involving mainly anaerobic glycolysis for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in muscles, that is, typically isometric exercise (handgrip exercise, carrying weights), weight lifting or dynamic exercise of high intensity (climbing stairs, sprinting to catch a bus).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451328"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812451328">3</xref></sup> Another main characteristic of the disease is a high serum level of creatine kinase activity under basal conditions, that is, in the absence of heavy exercise in the previous few hours or days, which would reflect an ongoing state of muscle damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451328">2</xref></sup> Thus, “fixed” muscle weakness, frequently accompanied by muscle wasting and affecting mostly proximal muscles, is prevalent in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812451328">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451328">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no cure for this disease, yet there are 2 main effective interventions for alleviating patient’s exercise intolerance: (1) pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion to “protect” the muscle (as blood glucose entering muscle fibers can escape the metabolic blockade that occurs upstream)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451328">6</xref></sup> and (2) regular, light to moderate aerobic exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451328">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451328"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451328"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812451328">10</xref></sup> A question that remains unresolved is the feasibility of resistance exercise (also termed “strength exercise” or “weight lifting”) in these patients. This is an important issue because this type of exercise, together with aerobic exercise should form part of the routine exercise prescription to maintain and improve health and functional status in most, if not all population groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812451328">11</xref></sup> At present, however, clinicians in charge of McArdle disease patients discourage their participation in this type of exercise, owing to an increased risk of severe rhabdomyolysis, which might eventually lead to acute renal failure in the most severe cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451328">2</xref></sup> On the other hand, exercise interventions seem especially useful in the youngest McArdle disease patients to ameliorate the course of the disease as soon as possible, before functional deterioration becomes a self-perpetuating condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451328">9</xref></sup> Despite earlier concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of youth strength training, current public health objectives now also aim to increase the number of children and adolescents who regularly participate in strength-oriented exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812451328">12</xref></sup> Thus, it would be interesting to assess the applicability of resistance exercise interventions in McArdle disease patients, especially in the youngest ones, and the effect of this intervention on muscle strength.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient (15-year-old male; height, 177 cm; weight, 69 kg; Tanner maturation stage 5) and his parents provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. He is one of the 5 adolescents (out of a total of 239 patients) diagnosed with McArdle disease in Spain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> His parents were asymptomatic, he had no affected relatives, and there was no history of consanguinity in this family. The patient reported exercise intolerance since the first decade of life, particularly during physical education classes, together with the typical “second wind” phenomenon, that is, improvement in the tolerance of aerobic, dynamic, large muscle mass exercise (walking or cycling) after ∼10 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451328">6</xref></sup> Diagnosis was performed through molecular genetics at the age of 10 years (he harbors the <italic>PYGM</italic> p.R50X[c.148C&gt;T]/ p.K754fsX49[c.2262delA] genotype, which is the sixth most frequent <italic>PYGM</italic> genotype among Spanish patients and results in null myophosphorylase activity).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> Since the moment of diagnosis, he had been advised by his neurologist to refrain from sports activities.</p>
<p>When he first visited the laboratory (April 2009), his serum creatine kinase activity was 2,891 U<sup>.</sup>L<sup>-1</sup>. The mean values in the laboratory for male McArdle disease patients (n = 24, 8-78 years) and for their age- and gender-matched controls (n = 24, 8-78 years) are (mean ± SD) 3,069 ± 2,356 and 151 ± 48 U·L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451328">7</xref></sup> He belonged to the “severity class 1,” that is, “exercise intolerance, contractures, myalgia, and limitation of acute strenuous exercise, and occasionally in daily life activities, with no record of myoglobinuria, no muscle wasting or weakness.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812451328">13</xref></sup> He volunteered to perform the 6-week resistance training program that is described below. One researcher not engaged in the training program and unaware of the characteristics of the patient evaluated his muscle strength (one repetition maximum) in both the bench press using free weights and multipower squat from 90° knee flexion (as monitored with a goniometer), using the methodology that is described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812451328">14</xref></sup> The authors used an optical rotator encoder (Real Power, Globus, Codogne, Italy), which allowed the calculation of muscle force and power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812451328">14</xref></sup> The pretraining tests were preceded by a 2-week familiarization period with strength exercises, including 1-2 sets of 12-15 repetitions for the exercises that are described in the section below, and 6-7 additional exercises of upper and lower body and trunk muscles.</p>
<p>The resistance training program included 2 weekly sessions (Tuesday and Thursday). All sessions were performed at the same time of the day (early evening) after school classes in the same setting (weight-training room of the European University of Madrid) under the supervision of the same researcher, and had a total duration of ∼60 minutes. Each session was preceded by a 10-minute warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of light-intensity dynamic exercise (on a cycle ergometer or rowing ergometer), followed by 5 minutes of mobilization exercises and body weight exercises (eg, shoulder shrugs and rotations, arm elevations, changing squat stance, walking lunges, push-ups on the wall). The authors recorded the rate of perceived exertion to control the effort exerted by the patient at the end of each set of exercises, and 30 minutes after each training session.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812451328">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812451328">16</xref></sup> The core part of each session included 2-3 sets of 8 different resistance exercises engaging the major muscle groups and performed in the following order: bench press with free weights, multipower squat, shoulder press, arm curls and elbow extensions with dumbbells, and lateral pull-down on a weight training machine (Technogym, Barcelona, Spain), abdominal crunches, and low back extensions. The patient performed 10-15 repetitions per exercise (corresponding to 60%-75% of the one-repetition-maximum for bench press and multipower squat) with rest periods between sets and exercises of 1-3 minutes.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of strength exercise on rhabdomyolysis, the authors determined serum creatine kinase activity 24 hours after the pre- and posttraining one-repetition-maximum tests. To monitor the metabolic demands of a typical training session (randomly chosen over medium part of the program), the authors determined capillary blood levels (ear lobe) of ammonia (Ammonia Checker, Menarini Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) and lactate (Lactate Pro, Arkray, Japan) on termination of the third set of repetitions for the 2 main resistance exercises, that is, bench press and multipower squat.</p>
<p>The same researcher measured biceps, triceps and front thigh skin folds in triplicate using a standard caliper (Holtain, Crymych, UK), together with the circumference of the thigh and arm using anatomical reference points as detailed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812451328">17</xref></sup> The patient ingested a carbohydrate drink (400-500 mL, equivalent to ∼40 grams carbohydrates) 5 minutes before each of the strength tests and training sessions that the authors described above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812451328">18</xref></sup> He was also instructed to consume a high proportion (65%) of complex carbohydrates (fruits, cereals, bread, pasta, and rice) in the 2 meals (breakfast and lunch) that preceded each testing or training session.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The effects of the training program in the one-repetition-maximum tests are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812451328">Table 1</xref>. The authors observed a ∼27% increase in bench press performance (weight lifted) after training and a ∼6% increase for multipower squat. The increase in muscle strength was accompanied by a mild improvement in mean muscle power during the concentric acceleration phase of the bench press test, but not in the multipower squat test. Muscle force increased in both tests. The increase in one-repetition-maximum bench press strength (27%) in the McArdle disease patient was equal to the approximately 30% increase typically shown with longer periods (8-20 weeks) of weight training by healthy children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812451328">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The child did not complain of major muscle discomfort or contractures associated with the training sessions, and reported no occurrence of dark urines during the study period. Levels of serum creatine kinase activity measured 24 hours after the one-repetition-maximum tests decreased from 3.636 U·L<sup>−1</sup> at pretraining to 1.575 U·L<sup>−1</sup> at posttraining despite the child performing the same test.</p>
<p>As for lactate and ammonia levels during a typical training session, the authors recorded the following values at baseline (before the session) and after the third set of bench press and multipower squat exercises, respectively: 1.0, 1.4, and 1.0 mmol·L<sup>−1</sup> for lactate and 165, 283, and 174 µmol·L<sup>−1</sup> for ammonia. Normal values in the laboratory (obtained in 36 adolescent/young males) for the same conditions are (mean ± SD) 1.2 ± 0.4, 3.5 ± 0.6, and 2.8 ± 0.6 mmol·L<sup>−1</sup> for lactate and 100.8 ± 46.3, 190.3 ± 77.0, and 139.8 ± 61.2 µmol·L<sup>−1</sup> for ammonia. The “flat” response of blood lactate to heavy exertion shown by the adolescent patient (as opposed to normal people) is typical in McArdle disease, that is, reflecting blocked glycolytic flux, whereas his higher-than-normal levels of ammonia, a direct marker of energy status during exercise, would reflect the fact that muscle fiber potential for ATP resynthesis is compromised in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451328">6</xref></sup> The values of rate of perceived exertion ranged between 5 and 7 during all sessions.</p>
<p>There was virtually no change in the patient’s body weight over the training program (+0.6 kg). Similar findings were obtained for skin folds (biceps, 6.3 to 6.3 mm; triceps, 13.5 to 13.6 mm; thigh, 17.6 to 17.0 mm), whereas maximal limb circumferences increased (arm, 29.0 to 30.1 cm; thigh, 54 to 56.7 cm). The patient reported an improvement in his exercise tolerance, particularly during physical education classes, as well as improvement in his ability to cope with activities of daily living, as reflected by attenuation of his self-reported clinical severity after the training program, that is, he changed from severity class 1 to severity class 0 and thus became virtually asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812451328">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous preliminary research (using noncontrolled designs) has shown the benefits of light to moderate aerobic exercise in improving the maximal aerobic capacity (peak oxygen uptake, VO<sub>2</sub>peak) of McArdle disease patients (including very young children),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451328">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451328"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451328"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812451328">10</xref></sup> for example, 44% increase after an 8-month supervised exercise program, including 5 weekly sessions (duration ≤ 60 minutes) of walking or cycling at moderate-intensity (∼60% of maximum heart rate) with no major side effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451328">7</xref></sup> Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with patients’ VO<sub>2</sub>peak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup> However, this study is the first report on the feasibility and functional effects of resistance exercise in a McArdle disease patient. The authors believe to assess the applicability of this type of exercise intervention in these patients is of medical interest, given its well-established potential clinical benefits in the great majority of population groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812451328">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is especially important to promote interventions aiming at increasing the muscle mass and strength of McArdle disease patients since childhood because “fixed” muscle weakness, frequently accompanied by muscle wasting and affecting mostly proximal/trunk muscles in a symmetric manner, is a prevalent problem later in lafe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812451328">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451328">5</xref></sup> for example, reported in 34% of Spanish McArdle disease patients aged 40 or more years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451328">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerns are frequently raised by clinicians as to the potential risks of exercise for McArdle disease patients, especially weight lifting. However, serum creatine kinase activity did not increase with resistance training (in fact the values of creatine kinase measured after the one-repetition-maximum tests decreased with training), and the authors recorded no incidence of myoglobinuria. This indicates the weight training program was well tolerated. The data are limited by the fact that the authors did not measure the patient’s muscle mass, and thus cannot determine to what extent the training-induced improvements they observed in muscle strength are attributable to neuromuscular adaptations or actual increases in muscle mass.</p>
<p>In summary, and while keeping in mind the need for large sample intervention studies (which might not be easily feasible in rare diseases as this one), the preliminary data suggest that supervised, light to moderate resistance training is feasible in children with McArdle disease and has functional benefits in a short period (only 6 weeks), that is, increased muscle strength and force and attenuation of clinical severity. The authors believe this is a finding of clinical interest for a disease that has been traditionally considered to be the paradigm of exercise intolerance and a debilitating condition. Unsupervised, more intense training program should, however, be discouraged in these patients.</p>
