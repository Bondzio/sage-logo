<p>This edited collection is part of a growing number of works which consider how planning activity takes place in various parts of the world and how these different forms of planning came into being. Given that most planning scholarship still originates in, and reflects on, a relatively small part of the globe, this geographical broadening of the scope of planning studies is to be welcomed. It follows on recent texts such as Nasr and Volait’s <italic>Urbanism Imported or Exported?</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095211432617">2003</xref>), Sanyal’s <italic>Comparative Planning Cultures</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095211432617">2005</xref>) and Friedmann’s <italic>Globalization and the Emerging Culture of Planning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095211432617">2005</xref>) but with a specific focus in this book on how mobile planning ideas interact with local, or place-specific, material and intellectual milieu to create unique expressions of planning activity.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter by Patsy Healey is a very useful overview both of the chapters in the book and of thinking about planning idea diffusion. The most immediate problem in an exercise of this kind is, of course, defining planning as an institutional function and as an academic discipline. Variation across the globe in both areas is significant, as are understandings of what the purpose of planning might be. In government and in institutions of higher learning, planning has always managed to escape neat definitional boundaries, but now more than ever the kinds of activities that could constitute planning are spread across many actors and groupings outside of government, and students learn about planning in a range of different disciplinary departments and field settings, drawing on knowledge from many different sources. The possible goals of planning activity vary greatly as well, both across territories but also within them. Planning activities are used in some places to promote spatial justice, ‘inclusive’ cities and sustainability; in others to lay the basis for regional competitiveness and economic growth; and in yet others to control land use and achieve the vision of the clean and efficient modern city. Across all these variations there are commonalities as well as unique and ‘indigenous’ ways of planning, and it is the aim of this book to explore the question of how ideas have travelled geographically and how they have embedded themselves or been warped by local contextual factors. It is this process of embedding that is of particular interest for a number of authors in this volume who trace out what aspects of planning ideas from elsewhere have been found useful and were adopted, and what aspects have been discarded as being of less importance to local issues. Often this process of selection, rejection and hybridizing is politically motivated, with particular ideas and strategies being used to promote or marginalize some grouping relative to others.</p>
<p>Healey introduces the useful term of planning ‘assemblages’ (ideas, strategies, qualities, approaches, regulations – associated but not always clearly linked) to describe the association of concepts that find their way from one place to another. Problems arise, however, when there are buried assumptions within these assemblages that reflect their source of origin – unspoken or written beliefs about social, cultural, economic, environmental and political factors that perhaps subconsciously informed these ideas and were then ‘carried along’ to parts of the world where these contextual factors are very different. It is my own hypothesis that this is in fact a key reason for planning failure. Many planning ideas originate and are documented in the global North and then find their way via publications, international experts and academics to other parts of the world where the hidden assumptions do not hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095211432617">Watson, 2002</xref>). But because these travelling theories and ideas so often portray themselves as context-neutral and valid everywhere, these preconditions for success are missed (sometimes by oversight and sometimes for deliberate political reasons) and plans have unintended or unanticipated outcomes. Healey is careful to point out, correctly, that planning ideas no longer move only from global North to global South and that there are many cross and counter-currents, yet it seems likely that traditional north-south flow is still dominant. The book has a number of chapters which describe exactly this phenomenon: the American neighbourhood unit in India, compact cities in Japan, early 20th-century American regional planning in Sri Lanka. The discussion of how certain institutional forms promoted by international agency experts in Zambia were resisted by local actors for political reasons is an excellent example of how these hidden assumptions may be well understood, but inappropriate ideas are nonetheless used to promote or counter political ambitions. Recognition and understanding of the role of power would appear to be crucial to explanations of cross-border planning flows.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter and some of the other chapters in the book as well provide useful new ‘language’ to describe the flow of ideas and techniques: travelling ‘assemblages’ of ideas, ‘bundles’ of ideas which are selectively taken by agents from these assemblages, ‘carriers’ and ‘adaptors’ of ideas, ‘networks and communities of practice’ through which ideas circulate, and ‘circuits of knowledge’. However, explanatory theory seems to be somewhat harder to reach. Healey cautions against using a simple structural-agency perspective to understand what is going on when ideas circulate globally through institutional and other forces and are responded to selectively by agents, and points to the dynamic interaction between systemic forces and agents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095211432617">Tait and Jensen’s (2007)</xref> use of actor-network theory to explain travelling ideas is referred to but not critically considered here, hence passing over some interesting ideas which might have been taken further to explain the subject of the book. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095211432617">Tait and Jensen (2007)</xref> ask the very important question: why, despite the frequency with which imported models fail to achieve the success which their proponents claim for them, do processes of globalization facilitate an increasing scale and pace of ‘best practice’ dissemination and application? Their proposition, drawing on actor-network theory, is that the particular representations of space (essentialist, Euclidean) contained in the international translation of planning and urban models help to understand how they come to be regarded as potentially universal ideas. Actors concerned to promote the translation of an idea from one part of the world to another need to argue that origin and destination locations are similar, or that their difference does not matter. Developing spatial strategies is therefore likely to be the outcome of inherently political processes. Politics appear to imbue every aspect of this issue of travelling ideas, as most of the case study chapters imply or refer to explicitly. Whatever explanatory theory is eventually found to be most useful in this arena, there is no doubt that the role of power and politics needs to be conceptually centre-stage.</p>
<p>The case chapters in the book provide a wealth of fascinating reading and there is no doubt that the book should be high on the required reading lists of both undergraduate and postgraduate planning schools. There are two chapters which I will comment on further here, as both are particularly interesting, for different reasons.</p>
<p>Roy’s chapter (‘Poverty truths. The politics of knowledge in the new global order of development’), examines the way micro-finance strategies have been essentially globalized and appropriated as part of the ‘financialization of development’ by components of the Washington Consensus. In this chapter Roy moves towards an explanation of (one) idea which has power at the centre of its formulation through understanding the parallel circuits of truth and circuits of capital. And in raising the possibility of a Bangladesh Consensus in opposition to the Washington Consensus it becomes clear that these circuits and these dominant ideas can be challenged by ‘counter-hegemonic formations’.</p>
<p>Also interesting is Abramson’s chapter: ‘A trans-Pacific planning education in reverse’. Writing from deep personal experience, Abramson shows in this chapter how language can be a powerful lens for understanding the ‘situated’ and place-based nature of planning ideas. Having decided to undertake firstly a master’s degree in the US and then a doctoral degree in China, he was well placed to understand how ideas were warped in translation. The role which uniqueness of place and culture play in shaping planning ideas is abundantly evident in this story, thus presenting an extremely effective challenge to simplistic, ‘best practice’, idea-borrowing.</p>
<p>This book will hopefully give inspiration to an emerging scholarship of comparative planning across very different contexts as it offers an important route to begin addressing imbalances in global systems of knowledge production and circulation.</p>
