<p>Peer support interventions have mostly neglected the domain specificity of intervention effects. In two studies, the present investigation examined the domain specificity of peer support interventions targeting specific domains of self-concept. In Study 1, participants (<italic>n</italic> = 50) who had received an academically oriented peer support intervention on verbal subject matter improved significantly in verbal self-concept—but not other areas of self-concept—as compared with a control group that had not participated in the intervention. In Study 2, participants (<italic>n</italic> = 53) who had received a socially oriented peer support intervention that focused on interpersonal skills and communication improved significantly in same-sex relations self-concept—but not in other areas of self-concept—as compared with the control group. Hence, there is a compelling need for reconceptualizing peer support into academic and social domains in terms of domain specificity.</p>

<p>Positive peer relationships play a crucial role in the development of adolescents. However, due to the variety of studies targeting different outcomes, peer support has not been well defined. The present investigation attempts to capitalize on recent advances in peer support and self-concept research to examine the domain-specific relationships between peer support intervention and self-concept enhancement. The major purpose is to provide evidence in support of the necessity of a refined conceptualization of peer support in terms of domain specificity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431611436130">
<title>Importance of Peer Support</title>
<p>Since adolescents tend to build intimate relationships with peers and often seek help from peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431611436130">Parada, Craven, &amp; Marsh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611436130">Wassef, Ingham, Lassiter-Collins, &amp; Mason, 1995</xref>), positive peer relationships serve an important role in adolescents’ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611436130">Ellis, Marsh, &amp; Craven, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611436130">Peer Support Foundation, 2001</xref>). Support from peers has been found to be associated with positive outcomes such as coping with transition to high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611436130">Felner, Ginter, &amp; Primavera, 1982</xref>), adjustment to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611436130">Martin, Swartz-Kulstad, &amp; Madson, 1999</xref>), and positive self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611436130">Way &amp; Chen, 2000</xref>). Hence, peer support in educational settings is growing in popularity. Peer support is defined as planned practices where an individual is given defined tasks that offer a learning experience to another individual or group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611436130">Charlton, 1998</xref>). Various forms of peer support, such as peer mentoring, peer tutoring, peer counseling, befriending, and peer-mediated conflict resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611436130">Charlton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611436130">Cowie &amp; Hutson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611436130">Cowie &amp; Wallace, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611436130">Walker, Ashby, Hoskins, &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>), have been conducted worldwide. In the United Kingdom, peer support interventions have been widely used for combating bullying in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611436130">Cowie &amp; Hutson, 2005</xref>), whereas similar interventions have been implemented in more than 1,600 schools for promoting physical, social, and mental well-being in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611436130">Peer Support Foundation, 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, research that analyzes the impact of diverse peer support interventions on self-concept has been plagued with theoretical and methodological flaws due to neglect of the domain-specific nature of self-concept development.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272431611436130">
<title>The Peer Support Construct</title>
<p>Most of the peer support interventions for adolescents in the literature may be defined as either academic or social in terms of purpose. These two types of peer support intervention are probably the most significant in an educational context, since they play a crucial role in the development of adolescents. It is, therefore, important to revisit the definition of peer support and to evaluate the direct relationships between the focus of the implementation and actual outcomes.</p>
<p>In essence, ignoring the distinction between peer support in academic and social domains would lead to inconsistent findings when examining the differential effects of various forms of support on a range of self-development outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611436130">Malecki and Demaray (2003)</xref> found that only teacher support was positively associated with social skills and academic competency, whereas family support and peer support were not correlated with these two outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431611436130">Malecki and Elliot (1999)</xref> also showed that only teacher support was positively associated with academic competency but teacher support, family support, and peer support were all positively associated with social skills (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611436130">Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2002</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611436130">Demaray and Malecki (2002b)</xref> found that only family support and peer support were positively associated with social skills, whereas teacher support was not. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611436130">Demaray and Malecki (2002a)</xref> found that support from significant others (teacher support, family support, and peer support) was positively associated with social skills, none of these forms of support was significantly associated with academic competency. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611436130">Ahmed, Minnaert,Van der Werf, and Kuyper (2010)</xref> have shown all of these supportive figures to be significantly associated with academic achievement. Hence, there were clearly inconsistencies in the results of these studies; these inconsistencies might be explained by the fact that support was provided by the teacher, family, and peers differentially, in academic or social aspects. Hence, if support obtained from these influential persons were focused on academic enhancement, then positive gains in the academic aspect would be expected. If the support were more of a social aspect, then positive gains would be more likely to be found in the social domain than in the academic domain. This speculation warrants the present investigation, which examines the domain specificity of peer support interventions targeting specific domains of self-concept.</p>

<sec id="section3-0272431611436130">
<title>Relationship Between Peer Support and Multidimensional Self-Concept</title>
<p>Positive peer relationships have been found to be related to higher self-esteem. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611436130">Demaray and Malecki (2002a)</xref> found that peer support was positively associated with self-esteem in a sample of 1,711 students in Grades 3 through 12. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611436130">Arslan (2009)</xref> also found a significant positive relationship between self-esteem and support from peers in a sample of 499 adolescents aged between 16 and 18 years. Experimental studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431611436130">Thomaes et al. (2010)</xref> found that peer disapproval decreased self-esteem, whereas peer approval increased self-esteem in a sample of 333 preadolescents from 10 elementary schools. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611436130">Way and Chen (2000)</xref> found that friendship support was positively associated with self-esteem in a sample of 100 high school students from low-income families.</p>
<p>Reviews of self-concept research have supported the view that self-concept cannot be clearly understood if its multidimensionality is not taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611436130">Marsh &amp; Craven, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611436130">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431611436130">Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985</xref>). In a seminal work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431611436130">Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976)</xref> posited that self-concept is multifaceted instead of unidimensional in nature. In this model, general self-concept (or self-esteem) is divided into academic and nonacademic self-concept. Academic self-concept is further divided into self-concepts in particular content areas, whereas nonacademic self-concept is divided into social, physical, and emotional. Hence, recent self-concept research has emphasized the multidimensionality and domain specificity of self-concept.</p>
<p>Research to date has shown that positive features of friendships are strongly associated with various domains of self-concept. For example, findings showed that being a victim of bullying was negatively associated with various facets of self-concept whereas positive features of friendships were strongly associated with these domains of self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611436130">Marsh, Nagengast, Morin, Parada, Craven, &amp; Hamilton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431611436130">Marsh, Parada, Craven, &amp; Finger, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, these studies did not examine the relationship between certain types of peer support in a particular domain and the effects on relevant aspects of self-concept related to that particular domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272431611436130">
<title>Domain Specificity Between Self-Concept and Certain Outcomes</title>
<p>Self-concept research has also demonstrated domain specificity between self-concept and certain outcomes. For example, findings suggested that academic self-concept was strongly related to academic outcomes such as achievement whereas nonacademic self-concept was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611436130">Marsh &amp; Craven, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611436130">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611436130">Marsh &amp; O’Mara, 2008</xref>). Conversely, nonacademic self-concept was found to be strongly related to nonacademic outcomes, whereas academic self-concept was not. For example, physical self-concept was found to correlate with physical domain outcomes such as physical activity and not with nonphysical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431611436130">Marsh, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings of domain specificity between self-concept and outcomes are important for examining the effects of peer support on academic and nonacademic domains. Strong domain specificity implies that different types of peer support interventions would have different impacts on specific domains of self-concept. Thus, peer support interventions designed to influence academic outcomes may have positive impact on academic facets of self-concept, whereas peer support interventions targeting nonacademic outcomes may have positive impact on nonacademic facets of self-concept.</p>

<title>Aims of the Present Investigation</title>
<p>In order to test the domain specificity of peer support effects on multiple facets of self-concept, we examined two types of peer support intervention: (a) academically oriented peer support, and (b) socially oriented peer support. Results supporting the domain specificity of intervention effects would imply the need for a reconceptualization of the current peer support construct in terms of domain specificity.</p>
<p>The present investigation comprises two studies to test two different foci of peer support intervention. In Study 1, an academically oriented peer support intervention focused solely on language subject matter. It was hypothesized that an academically oriented peer support intervention would have a positive effect mainly on the academic domains of self-concept most logically related to the intervention’s goal. Because the focus was on the verbal domain, verbal self-concept was expected to benefit most and nonacademic domains of self-concept were expected to be least affected. In contrast, Study 2 involved a socially oriented peer support intervention to improve interpersonal skills and communication. Because of the social focus of the intervention, it was hypothesized that positive effects would be found in the social domains of self-concept, whereas the academic domains of self-concept would be less affected.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272431611436130">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>This study applied an experimental design to study the effects of an academically oriented peer support intervention (peer tutoring) on the self-concept facets of Grade 7 tutees. The intervention involved the experimental group of Grade 7 tutees receiving tutoring on a one-to-one basis from Grade 11 tutors. These Grade 7 tutees were recommended by their English teachers as being in need of extra help in English. The key tasks for the tutors were to provide academic assistance to the tutees with learning materials and assignments and to help them with clarification and revision of content covered in the regular school English lessons.</p>
<sec id="section7-0272431611436130">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 103 Grade 7 students from a Hong Kong secondary school. Their age ranged from 12 to 14 (<italic>M</italic> = 12.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.50). The sample comprised a total of 46 males (44.7%) and 57 females (55.3%). They were assigned to tutors who came from Grade 11 classes of the same school. There was a total of 50 tutors from Grade 11, whose age ranged from 16 to 17 (<italic>M</italic> = 16.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.37). Twenty two of the tutors were male (44.0%) and twenty eight were female (56.0%). All participants were Chinese and they were mainly from working-class to middle-class families.</p>

<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<sec id="section9-0272431611436130">
<title>The intervention</title>
<p>Recruitment of participants was done by a teacher in charge of student welfare, based on the recommendation of class teachers. Grade 7 (the tutees) formed the sample for the analysis. A sample of 50 tutors was recruited from Grade 11 to serve as peer tutors. They were recommended by their class teachers on the basis of their friendly, kind, and responsible attitude. Grade 7 students (<italic>N</italic> = 103) were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (<italic>n</italic> = 50) or a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 53). In the experimental group, each tutee was paired with a tutor of the same sex.</p>
<p>The design of the intervention was a collaborative endeavor between teacher and researcher. The contents of training for the tutors were discussed, and input was provided from both parties prior to the training session. Prior to implementing the intervention, the tutors were required to attend one training session for a period of 80 min. The training session was conducted by the teacher in charge of student welfare. The teacher explained the nature of the tutoring, the rationale behind the tutoring, the role of tutors, and the importance of the establishment of rules. The teacher also taught the tutors some tutoring techniques, including how to pause to give tutees opportunity to self-correct their answers, prompt with clues when tutees made errors, and provide tutees with positive feedback and avoid criticism. Besides the training session, there were regular weekly consultations on a group basis between teacher and tutors, to discuss issues that arose in the tutoring sessions. During these meetings, tutors’ questions were answered and corrective feedback on tutoring procedures was provided.</p>
<p>The tutoring was administered over a period of one school term (9 weeks). It took place in the library during the lunch break as a supplement to normal classroom instruction. Tutoring sessions comprised 20 min per day and 4 days per week. The intervention was closely monitored, and the roles of the teachers and researchers were clearly defined. Although the teacher monitored each tutoring session closely and provided feedback to the tutors at regular meetings, the researcher observed 10 tutoring sessions to ensure treatment fidelity. Specifically, all tutors were observed to ensure that they applied the tutoring techniques properly and provided appropriate assistance to the tutees. There were also biweekly meetings between researcher and teacher to check the progress of the intervention. For the control group, students had free time during the lunch break and they did not receive any intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272431611436130">
<title>The evaluation instrument</title>
<p>The Chinese version of the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQII; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611436130">Kong, 2000</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611436130">Marsh, 1990/1992</xref>) was used to measure 11 facets of the self-concept of the tutees in the present investigation. Seven are nonacademic self-concept scales (Opposite-Sex Relations, Same-Sex Relations, Parent Relations, Honesty-Trustworthiness, Emotional Stability, Physical Appearance, Physical Ability), three are academic self-concept scales (Verbal, Mathematics, General School self-concept), and one is a General self-concept (Self-Esteem) scale. The instrument consists of 102 declarative sentence items, approximately half of which are negatively worded. Responses to the statements are rated on a response scale that ranges from 1 (<italic>false</italic>) to 6 (<italic>true</italic>).</p>
<p>The validity of the instrument has been well documented, including reports of SDQ studies using a Chinese translation of the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611436130">Kong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611436130">Marsh, Kong, &amp; Hau, 2001</xref>). The factor structure was found to be distinct and was comparable to the normative data reported in the SDQII test manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611436130">Marsh, 1990/1992</xref>). In the present study, the coefficient alpha estimate of reliability for each scale of the Chinese version of SDQII was reasonable, ranging from .83 to .92, with a median of .90. In general, these reliabilities are also similar to those reported in the SDQII manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611436130">Marsh, 1990/1992</xref>) and a previous Chinese SDQ study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611436130">Kong, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The instrument was administered to the tutees in the school hall 1 week prior to implementation of the intervention during Term 1 of the school year. This served as the pretest measure (Time 1). At the end of Term 1 (Time 2 after 9 weeks’ intervention), the SDQII was administered to the tutees again in the school hall. For both Time 1 and Time 2, the teacher read aloud the instructions and questions to the participants, who completed the questionnaire silently in their seats. Other teachers also assisted by answering any questions raised by the participants.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0272431611436130">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>There were no significant pretest differences on any of the 11 self-concept facets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611436130">Table 1</xref>), supporting the success of the random assignment. A series of repeated-measure MANOVAs (multivariate analysis of variance) were used to evaluate the changes in different facets of self-concept scores. To scrutinize differential changes between the experimental and control groups over time, the most crucial test was the Group × Time interaction. Results showed that there was a significant Group × Time interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 101) = 18.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for verbal self-concept. Further analysis of the simple main effect of time for verbal self-concept indicated that the experimental group showed a significant increase in verbal self-concept, <italic>F</italic>(1, 101) = 27.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.51, whereas the control group did not show significant changes in verbal self-concept over time. Hence, evidence shows that participants who had experienced the intervention displayed significant improvement in verbal self-concept compared to participants who had not experienced this intervention.</p>

<p>For the other 10 facets of self-concept, no significant Group × Time interactions were found in the repeated-measure MANOVAs.

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 2 also applied an experimental design to study the effects of peer support, but this study focused on a socially oriented peer support intervention. Similar to Study 1, the experimental group of Grade 7 students received an intervention administered by Grade 11 students. Each session was structured to cover a specific theme designed to promote social and interpersonal relationship skills. Previous research has found that same-sex peers are a greater source of companionship for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611436130">Buhrmester &amp; Furman, 1987</xref>), and adolescents report more companionship with their same-sex peers than with opposite-sex peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611436130">Kuttler, La Greca, &amp; Prinstein, 1999</xref>). Same-sex peers may also be more effective in meeting children’s social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611436130">Dusek, 1991</xref>). Particularly for students in early adolescence, same-sex relations are the primary source of peer relationships. Hence, it was expected that participants who had experienced a socially oriented intervention would display higher Same-Sex Relations self-concepts as measured by the SDQII but with no significant effects for the other 10 facets of self-concept not targeted by the intervention.</p>
<sec id="section13-0272431611436130">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 105 Grade 7 students from a Hong Kong secondary school. Their age ranged from 12 to 14 (<italic>M</italic> = 12.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.38). The sample comprised a total of 45 males (42.9%) and 60 females (57.1%). The group leaders in this study were nine Grade 11 students whose age ranged from 16 to 17 (<italic>M</italic> = 16.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.44)—4 males (44.5%) and 5 females (55.5%). All participants were Chinese, and they came mainly from working-class to middle-class families.</p>

<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<sec id="section15-0272431611436130">
<title>The intervention</title>
<p>Recruitment of participants was done by a teacher in charge of guidance, based on the recommendation of class teachers. Grade 7 students were recommended to participate in the intervention by the class teachers on the basis of their need to improve social and interpersonal relationship skills. A total of nine Grade 11 students, who were recommended to participate in the intervention by the class teachers on the basis of their friendly, kind, and responsible attitudes served as tutors (designated as group leaders). The Grade 7 students (<italic>N</italic> = 105) were selected and randomly assigned to either an experimental group (<italic>n</italic> = 53) or control group (<italic>n</italic> = 52). There were nine intervention groups. In each experimental group, there were six Grade 7 students, except one group, which only had five Grade 7 participants. Each group was mixed-sex and was led by one Grade 11 group leader.</p>
<p>Prior to implementing the intervention, the Grade 11 group leaders were required to attend two training sessions for a period of 80 min each, which were conducted by the teacher. The teacher explained the nature and rationale behind the peer support intervention, the role of group leader, and the importance of establishing group rules and norms. The teacher also provided an overview of the contents of the peer support intervention. Group leaders were also taught some group-leading techniques, including how to establish rapport at the beginning of the intervention, promote group cohesion by building up trust, cooperation, and communication among group members, lead the intervention activity, and encourage group members to share their opinions and feelings. Last, the group leaders role-played some of the intervention activities and discussed how to implement the activities effectively. In addition to the training sessions, there were regular group meetings on a weekly basis between the teacher and the group leaders to discuss any issues that arose in each session.</p>
<p>The design and procedures of the study were similar to those in Study 1, except that a total of five observations were made by the researcher to ensure treatment fidelity. The intervention took place in the school hall during the lunch break. Each session comprised a period of 35 to 40 min per week for a period of 9 weeks.</p>

<sec id="section16-0272431611436130">
<title>The evaluation instrument</title>
<p>As for Study 1, the Chinese version of the 11 SDQII subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611436130">Kong, 2000</xref>) was utilized. In the present study, the coefficient alpha estimate of reliability for each scale of the Chinese version of SDQII was reasonable, ranging from .75 to .92, with a median of .88. In general, these reliabilities are also similar to those reported in the SDQII manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611436130">Marsh, 1990/1992</xref>) and a previous Chinese SDQ study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611436130">Kong, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>As in Study 1, in support of the success of the random assignment there were no significant pretest differences on any of the 11 self-concept facets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611436130">Table 2</xref>). Again, a series of repeated-measure MANOVAs were used to evaluate the changes in different facets of self-concept scores. The crucial analysis was the Group × Time interaction. The Group × Time interaction effect was found to be statistically significant for Same-Sex Relations self-concept, <italic>F</italic>(1, 103) = 12.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Further analysis of simple main effects of time for Same-Sex Relations self-concept indicated that the experimental group showed a significant increase in Same-Sex Relations self-concept, <italic>F</italic>(1, 103) = 25.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.42, whereas there were no significant differences over time for the control group. These results indicate that the intervention had introduced a significantly positive gain on the Same-Sex Relations self-concept that was targeted by the intervention in the experimental group.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, the findings of Studies 1 and 2 are consistent with the predictions that an academically oriented peer support intervention (peer tutoring) would display positive effects mainly on academic domains of self-concept. As demonstrated in Study 1, the largest gain was in the domain that was most logically related to the goal of the intervention (i.e., the verbal domain in this case), whereas nonacademic domains of self-concept were not noticeably affected. Conversely, the socially oriented peer support intervention in Study 2 displayed a positive effect for nonacademic self-concept (i.e., Same-Sex Relations self-concept in this case), which was most logically related to the intervention’s goals, whereas academic domains of self-concept were not noticeably affected. As mentioned previously, same-sex peers are known to be a greater source of companionship for adolescents than opposite-sex peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611436130">Buhrmester &amp; Furman, 1987</xref>). Hence, it was logical for those participants in the socially oriented intervention to have displayed a significantly more noticeable increase in Same-Sex Relations self-concepts than in Opposite-Sex Relations self-concepts. Although the participants had many interaction opportunities with their opposite-sex-group mates or leaders during the intervention, the increase in Opposite-Sex Relations self-concept was not as strong as for same-sex peer relationships.</p>
<p>In sum, the results of the two interventions in the present investigation have provided substantial support for the domain specificity of peer support intervention, which previous research has not systematically addressed so far. Most important, the present findings provide evidence to show that the peer support construct needs to be reconceptualized distinctly into academic and social domains. This refinement of the peer support construct can help to explain some inconsistent research findings with an attempt to examine the differential effects of various supportive persons on certain educational outcomes. For example, as discussed previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611436130">Malecki and Demaray (2003)</xref> have shown that teacher support was positively associated with academic competency, whereas family support and peer support were not. These differential effects of significant others may be explained in terms of the present findings, suggesting that the support obtained from different supportive figures with a different focus would result in different effects on specific domains of self-concept. Hence, students may obtain more academic support from the teacher, compared to support received from family and peers.</p>
<p>Whereas the present study has provided evidence of domain-specific intervention contents, further research on support obtained from other significant figures (e.g., family, teacher) could also investigate the domain specificity of support providers with different supportive focuses. Current social support research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611436130">Lipschitz-Elhawi &amp; Itzhaky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611436130">Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2003</xref>) has assessed the relative influences on student adjustment from different supportive figures: parents, teachers, classmates, and friends. Future research may be able to elucidate the relative effects of academic and social domains of support from different supportive figures on academic and social domains of adjustment.</p>
<p>The current study has also opened up an important pathway for systematic evaluation of the effects of peer support interventions that involve self-concept enhancement. Nevertheless, future research should also examine the impact of peer support interventions on more specific academic domains (e.g., mathematics and verbal) and nonacademic domains (e.g., moral, social, emotional, physical ability, and physical appearance), as found in the Marsh–Shavelson model of multidimensional self-concept. Hence, the findings call for a refinement of the peer support construct into domains that are similar to those found in self-concept research. Our findings demonstrate a close relationship between peer support and self-concept from a multidimensional perspective and suggest that interventions taking a multidimensional perspective will be more likely to obtain optimal effects. Indeed, previous peer support research has distinguished the social support construct into different function modes such as guidance, advice giving, esteem support, emotional support, and problem solving (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611436130">Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611436130">Weiss, 1974</xref>). However, it is possible for these different functions to be nested under academic and nonacademic domains of peer support. This conceptualization, nevertheless, remains to be elucidated by further research.</p>
<p>Finally, although the findings of this study provide preliminary evidence supporting the domain specificity between peer support and self-concept, a number of limitations of the present investigation need to be acknowledged in interpreting the results. The present study was confined to two types of peer support intervention; hence, it is not possible to test the generalizability of the findings to other types of peer support that match different facets of self-concept, such as physical peer support and emotional peer support interventions. A further limitation is that the peer support interventions in the present investigation were administered to Grade 7 students, and hence, the results may not generalize to other age groups. Since the Grade 7 participants were selected on the basis of their need for extra help in English or improvement in social and interpersonal relationship skills, the results may also not generalize to general student populations. Further studies should try to use larger samples to test the consistency of findings across different groups (e.g., the nine groups in Study 2) and to extend the generalizability of the findings. Although we found similar patterns of results for the different groups in Study 2, our small sample did not allow a strong statistical test of equivalence across groups, and this is another limitation. Furthermore, because we were unable to obtain students’ achievement scores after the interventions, we were unable to demonstrate that an increase in self-concept actually led to improved academic performance. Hence, further research would benefit from obtaining outcome data including achievement and behavioral variables, in addition to self-concept measures. Overall, the current study has opened up a useful blueprint for investigating peer support effects from a domain-specific perspective with a refinement of the peer support construct that emphasizes its multidimensionality.</p>
