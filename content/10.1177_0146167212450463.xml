<abstract>
<p>People’s success or failure to gain inclusion in groups may result from their own actions or the actions of others. Two studies compared the personal and interpersonal consequences of inclusion and exclusion when they resulted from these two processes. People’s own failure to “claim” inclusion in a computerized ballgame was equally detrimental for fundamental needs and made people equally unlikely to behave prosocially to group members, as being denied inclusion by others. In contrast, the beneficial effects of inclusion depended on the process with which it was obtained, and meta-perceptions of warmth mediated these differences; people who succeeded to claim inclusion thought their interaction partners liked them less than people who were granted inclusion, and as a result, their fundamental needs were satisfied less, and they behaved less prosocially.</p>

<p>Humans are social beings who seek inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>) and react immediately and intensely to signs of exclusion or ostracism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">2009</xref>). Compared with inclusion, exclusion threatens people’s fundamental needs, decreases their mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450463">Blackhart, Nelson, Knowles, &amp; Baumeister, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450463">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>), and impairs self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212450463">DeWall &amp; Baumeister, 2006</xref>). Exclusion also makes people feel colder than inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212450463">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>) and causes their brains to register higher levels of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212450463">Eisenberger, Lieberman, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>). In short, people dislike exclusion and like inclusion.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a closer look at people’s experience of inclusion and exclusion when they result mostly from their own actions or mostly from other people’s actions. More specifically, we assess whether people’s psychological and behavioral reaction to inclusion or exclusion differs depending on the primary source of the actions leading to it. Moreover, we investigate why this may be the case.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212450463">
<title>Distinguishing End-States and Processes</title>
<p>What do we mean by inclusion and exclusion? To answer this question, we argue first that it is important to distinguish between the end-state and the processes leading to it. As end-states, inclusion and exclusion refer to people’s level of connectedness with others. Thus, an included person is part of social bonds or relationships, whereas an excluded person is not part of social bonds or relationships and thus isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212450463">Leary, 2005</xref>). More importantly, we argue that there are two important processes that lead to these two states. Although, generally, both will to some extent be a cause of inclusion or exclusion, we argue that either of these processes may be the <italic>predominant</italic> cause in a given situation.</p>
<p>At the one extreme, we argue, people may end up included or excluded primarily as a result of other people’s actions. For example, people may or may not be asked for their opinion, be kept in the loop of information, be asked to join a work group, or be invited to a birthday party. Although people may exert some effort to secure inclusion in these examples, ultimately others’ decision on whether to include them determines whether this will happen. Research has found that the actions causing inclusion or exclusion may range from simply involving some individuals in activities and ignoring others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212450463">Farina &amp; Ring, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212450463">Lott, 2002</xref>), to more explicitly inviting some individuals to join a group and refusing others to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212450463">Farina &amp; Felner, 1973</xref>). Sometimes, exclusion may even be harshly enforced by collectively humiliating some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212450463">Schuster, 1996</xref>) or by giving them the silent treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212450463">Gruter, 1986</xref>). Key in all these examples is that other people’s actions play an instrumental role in causing a target’s state of inclusion or exclusion. That is, people end up included or excluded primarily because other people’s actions cause their inclusion or other people’s actions cause their exclusion.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, we argue, inclusion or exclusion may result primarily from people’s own actions. For example, joining some groups requires people to demonstrate their suitability (e.g., provide credentials, demonstrate skills) or take part in initiation rituals such as hazing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450463">Lodewijkx &amp; Syroit, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212450463">2001</xref>). Inclusion may also depend on meeting more implicit requirements, and people are highly sensitive to cues of such implicit norms. For example, people often conform to other people’s opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212450463">Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998</xref>), even when those others hold incorrect judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, Cheung, &amp; Choi, 2000</xref>). They also buy products and brands that other people buy as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450463">Escalas &amp; Bettman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212450463">Leibenstein, 1950</xref>) to ensure that they fit in. Indeed, people who are successful at meeting such explicit or implicit membership requirements end up included, whereas people who fail to do so end up excluded. In other words, inclusion or exclusion primarily results from people’s own success or failure to do what is necessary to ensure inclusion. That is, people end up included or excluded primarily because their own actions cause inclusion or their own actions cause exclusion.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly focus on these two different antecedents of inclusion and exclusion. Existing experimental research often focuses on inclusion and exclusion that result predominantly from the actions of others. For example, people are or are not involved or excluded by others in work tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212450463">Nezlek, Kowalski, Leary, Blevins, &amp; Holgate, 1997</xref>), group discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212450463">Gardner, Pickett, &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>), or a game of ball toss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, some research uses paradigms that place more emphasis on peoples’ own actions. For example, in the future-alone paradigm, excluded participants are told that they “are the type who will end up alone later in life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212450463">Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, &amp; Stucke, 2001</xref>, p. 1060; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2011</xref>). However, there is no prior research that has compared these antecedents in a single paradigm.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between the end-states of inclusion and exclusion and the processes leading to them is important for understanding the psychological and behavioral consequences of inclusion and exclusion, under which conditions they occur, and why. A substantive body of research has found that, compared with social inclusion, social exclusion makes people feel worse and threatens their fundamental needs for belongingness, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450463">Blackhart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450463">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether the observed effects are generally the result of the satisfaction of inclusion, the distress of exclusion, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450463">Blackhart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450463">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>). Moreover, behavioral reactions to exclusion are as diverse as acts of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212450463">Warburton, Williams, &amp; Cairns, 2006</xref>), seeking new connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212450463">Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, &amp; Schaller, 2007</xref>) and ingratiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450463">Romero-Canyas et al., 2010</xref>), and research has only begun to disentangle the situational conditions and individual differences that underlie these differences. Distinguishing between different sources of inclusion and exclusion may provide a useful framework in which to interpret the existing findings and understand why they occur.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>So will people react differently if their inclusionary status is predominantly the result of their own actions or the actions of others? For the state of exclusion, we argue they will not, at least not immediately. Here, we draw on prior theorizing that people’s immediate reaction to exclusion is undifferentiated and negative, with a fundamental underlying argument that human beings are social animals who are predisposed to over-detect cues signaling an exclusion threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212450463">Van Beest, Williams, &amp; Van Dijk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>). Given the potential threat of exclusion to survival, such a “reflexive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>) initial reaction to exclusion makes sense: How one ended up excluded does not matter at this stage. All that matters is that one is alone and, thus, potentially in danger. Providing evidence for this assertion, research has found that people who are excluded experience immediate psychological pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212450463">Eisenberger et al., 2003</xref>) no matter who (the Ku Klux Klan: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450463">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; strangers: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2000</xref>; a computer: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro, Williams, &amp; Richardson, 2004</xref>) or how many people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212450463">Chernyak &amp; Zayas, 2010</xref>) reject you, whether doing so was costly or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>), or whether they had a choice (following a script or not: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>). We assert that, in addition, this will be the case no matter whether exclusion is based on one’s own actions or on the actions of others.</p>
<p>The state of inclusion, however, does not represent acute danger. As a result, rather than reacting in a reflexive and undifferentiated manner, people should be ready to appreciate differences in how they got included right from the start. As a result, we argue that their reactions to inclusion will differ if it results from their own actions or those of others. Why may this be the case? Satisfying the need to belong may require having both ongoing interactions with a person and having a relationship marked by concern and caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). In support of this view, studies of romantic relationships have found that inclusion fails to be satisfying when affective feelings are unrequited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450463">Baumeister, Wotman, &amp; Stillwell, 1993</xref>) or relationships lack mutual concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212450463">Clark &amp; Mills, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>How may reactions to claimed and granted inclusion then differ? Claiming and being granted inclusion are equally viable ways of securing ongoing interactions. After all, how one attains inclusion does not affect the frequency with which one interacts. However, when one is granted inclusion, this may be perceived as a sign that one is appreciated, possibly even cared about, by interaction partners, whereas it seems difficult to attribute such feelings to interaction partners when inclusion is claimed for oneself.</p>
<p>Prior research on social inclusion and exclusion provides some support for this view. For example, although prior research on ostracism generally finds that inclusion is not more or less moderated by cross-cutting variables than exclusion, there is one often overlooked exception. Zadro and colleagues (2004) studied whether it mattered if inclusion or exclusion was allegedly based on people’s own decision to toss or not toss a ball to the participant, or whether they were simply following a script. This difference did not impact people’s immediate evaluation of exclusion, but it did impact people’s immediate evaluation of inclusion. When coplayers allegedly chose whom to toss the ball to, inclusion was more satisfying than when they followed a script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>). Although the study did not explicitly assess this, it seems possible that participants interpreted the self-determined choice of their interaction partners to include them in the game, to reflect at least some level of concern for their well-being. In line with this reasoning, we contend that to offer maximum psychological benefit, inclusion needs to be granted by others rather than claimed for oneself.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Cyberball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2000</xref>) is a powerful paradigm for manipulating inclusion in or exclusion from a group. In its classic form, it can be interpreted as a game of giving and receiving inclusion. Participants are led to believe they are playing a virtual ballgame with two or three others. Players determine to whom they will throw the ball by clicking one of the schematic figures on the screen. Thus, participants’ inclusion or exclusion in the game allegedly results from other players’ willingness to throw them the ball. In reality, participants are not playing with other people, but the computer determines other players’ ball throws. In the typical inclusion condition, participants receive the ball about as often as other players, whereas excluded participants receive only a couple of throws. In other words, the computer determines the outcome of classic cyberball, but participants are led to believe that their inclusion or exclusion in the game results from the behavior of the other players.</p>
<p>A simple change to the instructions and procedure of the game, but not to its outcome, allowed us to compare the consequences of inclusion and exclusion when they result from other players’ behavior and when they result largely from participants’ own behavior. In the altered version, termed <italic>claimball</italic> for the current purpose, participants “claimed” the ball by being the first to click on the figure on the screen of the player who had the ball.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212450463">1</xref></sup> In other words, included participants succeeded to claim the ball from other players and excluded ones failed to do so. To ensure the outcomes mirrored those of the classic cyberball game, the game was rigged such that participants in the inclusion condition managed to claim the ball as often as the other players, whereas participants in the exclusion condition only managed to get a couple of throws. In other words, the outcomes of claimball mirror those of classic cyberball. However, in claimball, participants are led to believe that their inclusion or exclusion in the game results largely from their own behavior, whereas in classic cyberball it allegedly results from the behavior of the other players.</p>
<p>In line with earlier research using the cyberball paradigm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>), we assessed the effects of inclusion and exclusion on people’s fundamental needs for belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control. We predicted that exclusion from claimball would have an equally negative impact on these fundamental needs as exclusion from classic cyberball. Moreover, we predicted that inclusion in claimball would not satisfy people’s fundamental needs to the same extent as inclusion in classic cyberball.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Psychology undergraduates at Tilburg University (<italic>N</italic> = 136) were randomly assigned to a 2 (game experience: inclusion, exclusion) × 2 (game type: claimball, classic cyberball) between-subject design. Four participants failed to complete the measures, leaving 132 participants (84.1% female) ranging in age from 18 to 35 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.84, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.37).</p>
<p>In a private cubicle, participants received detailed instructions of the ballgame, which was presented as a mental visualization exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Each game had three players and was set to run a total number of 30 ball tosses. The participant received about 10 (i.e., 1/3) ball tosses in the inclusion condition or 2 in the exclusion condition. The game was followed by an assessment of its impact, manipulation checks, and a full debrief.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167212450463">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>As is customary in research using the cyberball paradigm, need satisfaction was measured with a composite of four fundamental needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>). Participants rated, respectively, the level of <italic>belonging</italic> (e.g., “I felt as one with the other players”), <italic>control</italic> (e.g., “I felt that I was in control of the game”), <italic>self-esteem</italic> (e.g., “Playing the game made me feel insecure” [reverse scored]), and <italic>meaningful existence</italic> (e.g., “I thought my participation in the game was useful”) that they experienced during the game. The 20-item scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>; α = .95) featured 5 items per need rated on a 7-point bipolar scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>).</p>
<p>To check whether participants correctly perceived the game experience, we asked, “What percentage of the throws did you receive?” Their understanding of the game type was assessed with a forced choice question: “How was the game played?” (I had to click to throw the ball/I had to click to claim the ball). Participants also rated their engagement in the game (<italic>M</italic> = 2.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08, α = .84) on three items (i.e., “The game was exciting/challenging/engrossing”) on a 7-point bipolar scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>).</p>

Moreover, need satisfaction differed significantly between games following inclusion, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 10.23, <italic>p</italic> = .002, η<sup>2</sup> = .07, but not following exclusion, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 0.71, <italic>p</italic> = .400, η<sup>2</sup> = .01. Thus, as predicted, exclusion was equally detrimental for fundamental needs when it was withheld or not claimed, but inclusion that was granted was more beneficial than inclusion that was claimed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167212450463">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>To assess whether each need contributed to this effect, we also conducted separate analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167212450463">Table 1</xref>). Satisfaction of each of the needs was lower after exclusion than after inclusion in both games (all <italic>p</italic>s ≤ .009, η<sup>2</sup>s ≥ .05). Thus, as is typical for inclusion/exclusion manipulations using cyberball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2007</xref>), being excluded versus included had a detrimental impact on all four fundamental needs. Moreover, this was true both in classic cyberball and in claimball. In addition, game experience and game type interacted in their effect on belonging, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 13.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .10, and meaningful existence, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 6.33, <italic>p</italic> = .013 η<sup>2</sup> = .05, but not on control and self-esteem (<italic>p</italic>s ≥ .205, η<sup>2</sup>s ≤ .01). Moreover, belongingness and meaningful existence (<italic>p</italic>s ≤ .007, η<sup>2</sup>s ≥ .06) differed between games in the inclusion condition, but not in the exclusion condition (<italic>p</italic>s ≥ .273, η<sup>2</sup>s ≤ .01), whereas self-esteem and control did not differ across any of these conditions (<italic>p</italic>s ≥ .150, η<sup>2</sup>s ≤ .02). Stated differently, the differential impact of inclusion in classic cyberball and claimball was driven mainly by the need to belong and the need for meaningful existence.</p>

<sec id="section11-0146167212450463">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 1 provides first evidence for our reasoning. In Study 2, we extend this in several ways. First, we investigate <italic>why</italic> claimed inclusion fails to be as satisfying as inclusion that is granted by others. For this purpose, we draw on recent insights that inclusion is associated with warmth. For example, compared with exclusion, inclusion increases perceptions of room temperature and reduces people’s longing for warm food and drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212450463">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>). We expect that the effect of inclusion on warmth will also depend on the antecedent process. As giving is more strongly associated with warmth than taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212450463">L. E. Williams &amp; Bargh, 2008</xref>), we predict that participants who are included in classic cyberball will think their interaction partners perceive them to be warmer than participants included in claimball.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we draw on a central notion in research on person perception that people’s main criterion to interpret, judge, and react to other people’s behavior is its warmth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212450463">Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212450463">Wojciszke, 2005</xref>). In line with this notion, we expect that people will react differently to inclusion depending on their perception of the level of warmth involved. Given that people prefer relationships marked by mutual affective concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>), we expect that people will find inclusion in relationships more satisfying when their interaction partners perceive them to be warm. Thus, we expect that meta-perceptions of warmth will mediate the effect of the different conditions on need satisfaction. More specifically, we predict that participants who are included in claimball as opposed to classic cyberball will think their interaction partners feel less warmly toward them and as a result will experience lower levels of need satisfaction.</p>
<p>Second, we extend our findings from how people feel to how they behave toward others. That is, we assess whether others benefit or suffer depending on the antecedents of their interaction partners’ inclusion. For this purpose, we build on the presumed link between inclusion/exclusion and prosocial behavior that is central in theories on belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>), exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212450463">Baumeister, Brewer, Tice, &amp; Twenge, 2007</xref>), and ostracism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>). That is, we assess whether claiming and receiving inclusion differentially predict behavioral outcomes by measuring prosocial behavior in a dictator game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450463">Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin, &amp; Sefton, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that meta-perceptions of warmth will also mediate the effect of claimed versus received inclusion on prosocial behavior. Again, we predict that participants who are included in classic cyberball will think their interaction partners perceive them to be warmer than participants included in claimball. Moreover, as friendly behavior tends to be reciprocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212450463">Byrne &amp; Rhamey, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212450463">Sadler &amp; Woody, 2003</xref>), and assuming that giving inclusion is a more friendly act than letting someone claim it, and that prosocial behavior is more friendly than antisocial behavior, we predict that people will behave more prosocially to their fellow players following inclusion in classic cyberball than following inclusion in claimball.</p>
<p>Finally, to ensure that the effect on need satisfaction and prosocial behavior do not simply result from changes to participants’ affective states, we tested whether mood acted as an alternative mediator.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section13-0146167212450463">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Psychology undergraduates at Tilburg University (<italic>n</italic> = 113) took part. One participant was removed after playing the ballgame twice under different conditions, leaving 112 participants (71.4% female) ranging in age from 18 to 60 (<italic>M</italic> = 21.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.91). Apart from adding measures of mood, warmth, and prosocial behavior, the procedure was identical to that used in Study 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0146167212450463">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>To assess mood, participants indicated to what extent they experienced nine mood items during the game. Eight items were taken from the expanded <italic>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212450463">Watson &amp; Clark, 1991</xref>): Two items each measured <italic>positive affect</italic> (“enthusiastic” and “proud”), <italic>guilt</italic> (“ashamed” and “unhappy with myself”), <italic>hostility</italic> (“irritated” and “angry”), and <italic>sadness</italic> (“sad” and “lonely”). A final item assessed <italic>hurt feelings</italic> (“hurt”), an emotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212450463">Smart Richman and Leary (2009)</xref> termed the <italic>signature emotion</italic> of rejection. The items were rated on 7-point bipolar scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>), reverse scored, and averaged to create a mood composite (α = .82).</p>
<p>To assess to what extent participants attributed their inclusion or exclusion in the game to other players’ perception of their warmth, we included three “warmth” items (i.e., “The other players thought I was well intentioned/warm/ good-natured”; based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212450463">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>, Study 2). The items were rated on 7-point bipolar scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>) and averaged to create a warmth composite (α = .94).</p>
<p>To measure prosocial behavior, participants first divided 10 Euros between themselves and Player A in a dictator game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450463">Forsythe et al., 1994</xref>), and then did the same for Player B. Both times, they were given the choice between five alternatives in which the other received, respectively, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 Euros (and they kept, respectively, 8, 7, 6, 5, or 4 Euros themselves). The amounts given to the two players were averaged to create a composite of prosocial behavior (α = .93).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section16-0146167212450463">
<title>Manipulation checks</title>
<p>The manipulations were successful. Excluded participants (<italic>M</italic> = 8.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.64) recalled receiving less ball tosses than included participants (<italic>M</italic> = 33.91, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.39), <italic>F</italic>(1, 83) = 98.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .54, and the vast majority of participants (96.59%) correctly stated whether they had to click to throw the ball or to claim the ball. Removing the participants who had incorrectly answered this question did not affect the results, and no other differences were significant.</p>

<sec id="section17-0146167212450463">
<title>Need satisfaction</title>
<p>Like in Study 1, we ran a 2 (game experience) × 2 (game type) ANOVA on the need composite (α = .97). This yielded a main effect of game experience, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 199.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .65, such that need satisfaction was higher following inclusion (<italic>M</italic> = 5.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18) than exclusion (<italic>M</italic> = 2.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73), and a main effect of game type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 5.13, <italic>p</italic> = .025, η<sup>2</sup> = .05, such that need satisfaction was higher following classic cyberball (<italic>M</italic> = 3.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.66) than following claimball (<italic>M</italic> = 3.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.51). Moreover, and most importantly, this again yielded a significant interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 7.93, <italic>p</italic> = .006, η<sup>2</sup> = .07 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212450463">Table 2</xref> for descriptive statistics of all dependent variables). Simple effects analysis revealed that exclusion reduced need satisfaction relative to inclusion more strongly in classic cyberball, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 151.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .58, than in claimball, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 60.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .36. Moreover, need satisfaction differed between games following inclusion, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 13.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .11, but not following exclusion, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> = .699, η<sup>2</sup> &lt; .01. Thus, replicating the results of Study 1, exclusion was equally detrimental for fundamental needs when it was withheld or not claimed, but granted inclusion was more beneficial than claimed inclusion.</p>

<p>Again, separate Game experience × Game type ANOVAs followed by simple effects analysis revealed that satisfaction of each of the needs was lower after exclusion than after inclusion in both games (all <italic>p</italic>s ≤ .001, η<sup>2</sup>s ≥ .09). Thus, again being excluded versus included had a detrimental impact on all four fundamental needs in both games. Moreover, again game experience and game type mainly interacted in their effect on belongingness, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 17.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .14, meaningful existence, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 4.40, <italic>p</italic> = .038 η<sup>2</sup> = .04, but not on self-esteem, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .504, η<sup>2</sup> &lt; .01. However, this time there was also a significant interaction effect on control, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 4.01, <italic>p</italic> = .048 η<sup>2</sup> = .04, and a main effect of game type on self-esteem, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 8.60, <italic>p</italic> = .004, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. Simple effects analyses revealed that none of the needs differed between games in the exclusion condition (all <italic>p</italic>s ≥ .400, η<sup>2</sup> ≤ .01) but that belongingness, control, and meaningful existence (<italic>p</italic>s ≤ .013, η<sup>2</sup>s ≥ .06) differed significantly between games in the inclusion condition, whereas self-esteem (<italic>p</italic> = .203, η<sup>2</sup>s = .02) did not. Thus, again, similar to Study 1, the differential impact of inclusion in classic cyberball and claimball was primarily driven by belonging and meaningful existence. However, adding to Study 1, this time it was also driven by control.</p>

<p>Repeating the analysis with warmth as a dependent variable revealed a highly similar pattern: a significant main effect of game experience, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 53.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .33, such that warmth was higher following inclusion (<italic>M</italic> = 4.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.33) than exclusion (<italic>M</italic> = 2.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17); a significant main effect of game type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 5.02, <italic>p</italic> = .027, η<sup>2</sup> = .04, such that warmth was higher following classic cyberball (<italic>M</italic> = 3.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.66) than following claimball (<italic>M</italic> = 3.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.24); and a significant interaction effect between game experience and game type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 16.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .14.

<title>Mediation</title>
<p>To test whether warmth mediated the effects of game experience and game type on need satisfaction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167212450463">Table 3</xref> for detailed results), we followed the three-part procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212450463">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>. First, we regressed game type and game experience on need satisfaction, adding their interaction term in a second step. This yielded a significant interaction effect. Second, we did the same for warmth, yielding again the significant interaction. Finally, we assessed the simultaneous effect of the games and of warmth on need satisfaction. The interaction term no longer predicted need satisfaction, but the effect of warmth remained significant. Moreover, a Sobel test indicated that the mediation was significant. Thus, the conditions for mediation were met.</p>

<p>To test whether warmth also mediated the effects of game experience and game type on prosocial behavior, we repeated the procedure with prosocial behavior as a dependent variable. Again, this pattern of results meets the criteria for mediation. To check whether mood is also a viable mediator, we reran all regressions with mood. Although mood was related to need satisfaction (β<sub>standardized</sub> = .817, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and prosocial behavior (β<sub>standardized</sub> = .459, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the interaction effect of game experience and game type on need satisfaction (β<sub>standardized</sub> = .139, <italic>p</italic> = .001; <italic>z</italic> = 0.49, <italic>p</italic> = .622) and prosocial behavior (β<sub>standardized</sub> = .238, <italic>p</italic> = .002; Sobel test: <italic>z</italic> = 0.47, <italic>p</italic> = .635) remained significant.

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Humans are social animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212450463">Aronson, 1994</xref>) that generally require a certain level of inclusion in groups and relationships to remain physically and psychologically healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). We assessed the effect of two antecedents, one’s own actions or those of others, on the immediate experience of two inclusionary states, inclusion or exclusion in a group. Across two experiments, how people ended up excluded did not make a difference. The immediate impact of exclusion was equally detrimental for people’s fundamental needs, warmth, and prosocial behavior, regardless of whether the ball was not thrown to them or failed to be claimed by them. In contrast, how people ended up included did make a difference. When people <italic>managed to claim</italic> a ball as often as other players, their fundamental needs were less satisfied and they gave less to interaction partners than when they <italic>were thrown</italic> the ball as often as other players. Moreover, they thought others perceived them to be less warm, and this relative lack of warmth satisfied their fundamental needs to a lesser extent and made them less inclined to behave prosocially to interaction partners. These results imply that the immediate impact of claiming rather than receiving inclusion is to significantly undermine its psychological and interpersonal benefits.</p>
<p>Our findings make several contributions to theorizing on belongingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>), exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212450463">Baumeister et al., 2007</xref>), and ostracism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>). Importantly, we provide evidence that the immediate impact of processes underlying inclusion and exclusion need not work in similar ways on the two ends of the inclusionary continuum. We concur that people’s immediate reaction to exclusion are negative and undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams, 2009</xref>). Prior research found that people are instantly hurt by exclusion regardless of their disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212450463">Zadro, Boland, &amp; Richardson, 2006</xref>), social categorization of interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450463">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212450463">Smith &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>), and even when they are financially compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). We add that excluded people are equally hurt when it results from a failure to claim inclusion as when it results from being denied inclusion. However, we show that people’s immediate reaction to inclusion differs depending on whether people claim it or whether it is granted to them. Thus, one needs to assess reactions to both inclusion and exclusion to fully understand the immediate effects of the processes underlying inclusionary states as they do not always work in similar ways on the two ends of the inclusionary continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450463">Blackhart et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, we found that inclusion needs to be accompanied by perceptions of warmth to have a strong effect on well-being. This important finding is in line with the notion that both repeated interactions and interpersonal warmth are required to satisfy the need to belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). Moreover, it sheds light on prior research that failed to moderate how people experience inclusion. For example, when people were intentionally included by another person in an interaction, they most likely assumed that the person felt warmly toward them notwithstanding the university they attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212450463">K. D. Williams et al., 2002</xref>), their smoking habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212450463">Smith &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>), the ideology they supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450463">Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>), or the financial cost they incurred as a result of being included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450463">Van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). However, people who were merely included as a result of a scripted procedure need not have assumed their interaction partner felt warmly about them, which may explain why prescripted inclusion was found to be less satisfying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we argue that prior research found that inclusion had similar psychological consequences under a wide range of conditions because these conditions did not differ in terms of warmth. As this prior research did not measure the effect on warmth of the manipulations used, these claims are necessarily speculative and will need to be substantiated by future studies.</p>

<sec id="section23-0146167212450463">
<title>Limitation and Future Research</title>
<p>We observed that exclusion was worse than inclusion on all our indices of well-being. Moreover, we observed that inclusion resulting from the actions of others had a more positive effect on overall well-being than inclusion resulting from one’s own actions, whereas these antecedent processes did not affect the effect of exclusion on overall well-being. Thus, we found support for the predicted interaction between level of inclusion and antecedent process on the overall index of well-being. However, this predicted interaction was only significant for the need for belonging, meaning, and control. We do not know why this finding did not generalize across all four fundamental needs. Possibly, claiming inclusion did not reduce self-esteem relative to being given inclusion because self-esteem depends on feeling likeable as well as competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212450463">Tafarodi &amp; Swann, 2001</xref>). Thus, it is possible that claiming and receiving inclusion each boosted positive self-feelings in a different domain. More importantly, analyses of the separate needs showed that our findings are mostly based on changes in belonging and meaning. This underscores our reasoning that belonging remains a key motivation for people regardless of whether inclusion is largely the result of their own actions or others’ actions. Indeed, although we observed that inclusion that is claimed is less satisfying for belonging than inclusion that is granted, it remained more satisfying than being excluded. Hence, our results speak against the possibility that people simply do not care about belonging when it results from their own actions.</p>
<p>In that regard, it is even more striking that we observed our findings in a relatively neutral setting. After all, we did not manipulate the value of the group in either classic cyberball or in claimball. Thus, we do not know whether people were highly motivated to belong to the group while playing the game. Although these questions are beyond the scope of our current focus on the consequences of claiming or being granted inclusion, they may offer a fruitful path for further investigations. Given that previous research found that exclusion by undesirable group members is no less painful than exclusion by desirable ones (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450463">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>), we do not expect the value of the group to interact with the source (i.e., the self or others) of the exclusion. However, we do expect the value of the group to interact with the source of inclusion. The importance of interpersonal warmth for our findings suggests that the differential effects of claimed and received inclusion may depend on the value of the group. Participants may feel more warmly toward members of valued groups and thus react especially strongly to inclusion by interaction partners belonging to valued groups.</p>
<p>Our research distinguished between inclusion and exclusion resulting largely from one’s own actions or from those of others. Although beyond the scope of the current research, we note that participants in our studies may not necessarily have attributed their success or failure at attaining inclusion in line with the actions causing it. For example, because attributions tend to be self-serving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212450463">Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde, &amp; Hankin, 2004</xref>), excluded participants may have attributed their exclusion to others regardless of game (e.g., “they collaborated so that I would not be able to claim the ball” in claimball), whereas included participants may have attributed their inclusion to themselves regardless of game (e.g., “I demonstrated that I deserved to be thrown the ball” in classic cyberball). Investigating the nature of people’s attributions of inclusion and exclusion, as well as their effect on people’s subsequent behavior, offers an interesting path for future research.</p>
<p>Although we limited ourselves to comparing <italic>immediate</italic> reactions to inclusion and exclusion when they resulted from different sources, future research might also compare longer term reactions across these conditions. In particular, we draw attention to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450463">Molden, Lucas, Gardner, Dean, and Knowles (2009)</xref>. They compared situations in which people were passively ignored by others with situations in which people were actively rejected by others. They argued that people who were ignored should experience a failure to gain social connection, whereas people who were rejected should experience a loss of social connection. The experiences of failing to claim inclusion and being denied inclusion might differ in a similar fashion. Participants in claimball need to claim the ball to be included in the game. Thus, if they end up excluded, this ostensibly happens after they have attempted to claim the ball and failed. Consequently, they might primarily experience this as a failure at gaining inclusion rather than a loss of inclusion. Thus, extrapolating from the findings of Molden and colleagues, they may be inclined to seek reengagement, which might also lead them to behave relatively prosocially. In contrast, participants in classic cyberball need to receive the ball from other players to be included in the game. As we expect that people will expect to be thrown approximately an equal proportion of the balls, we think that when this does not happen they will experience this as a loss of inclusion more than a failure to gain inclusion. Again extrapolating from the findings of Molden and colleagues, this experience of exclusion should make them relatively more inclined to withdraw from the interaction, which might also lead them to behave relatively less prosocially.</p>
<p>We investigated the mediating role of meta-perceptions of warmth (i.e., feeling perceived as well intentioned, warm, good natured) because of its implications for theorizing that both frequent interactions and a relationship marked by affective concern are required to satisfy the need to belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). Given that warm feelings and affective concern tend to go hand in hand, our findings generally supported this theoretical view. However, this does not mean that other variables might not also mediate the effect of inclusion on need satisfaction and prosocial behavior. For example, participants in classic cyberball may infer that their interaction partners choose to include them because they ascribed positive qualities to them other than warmth (e.g., trustworthiness, cooperativeness, or competence) or might attribute equally favorable qualities to their interaction partners. Such variables might also mediate the effects of inclusion on need satisfaction and prosocial behavior, particularly in situations in which such positive qualities are valued. Assessing whether and when such differences occur may be a fruitful path for future research.</p>
<p>Finally, our studies were also limited to the two types of game experiences (inclusion and exclusion) that were the focus of this research. Future studies might also assess the effects of over-inclusion, or appropriating a disproportionate number of ball throws. This may result in more than a simple extrapolation of the current findings. It is likely that claiming over-inclusion will be associated with less warmth than receiving it and, as a result, negatively impact well-being. However, claiming over-inclusion might also have a positive effect on other important dimensions of social perception, like competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212450463">Fiske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212450463">Wojciszke, 2005</xref>), which may increase well-being. After all, being highly successful at claiming inclusion may make people feel victorious. Whether such an effect of competence on well-being will overrule our finding that warmth is essential for well-being remains an empirical question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0146167212450463">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The broad implication of our results is that the lack of warmth associated with claimed inclusion as opposed to received inclusion reduces its psychological and interpersonal benefits. Thus, warmth is an indispensable part of belonging, suggesting that belongingness needs are only met if interactions are marked by a certain level of affectionate concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). Sadly, the people who crave belonging the most will be the most strongly motivated to try and increase it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450463">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>) and thus the most likely to revert to efforts to claim inclusion. Paradoxically, inclusion that people so effortfully try to secure for themselves may never quite be as satisfying or lead to equally prosocial behavior as inclusion that they effortlessly receive. To have its full impact, it seems, inclusion needs to be given.</p>

<p>To check whether engagement in the game moderated these effects, we included the composite score as a covariate in the 2 × 2 ANOVA on fundamental needs.

<p>Although our analysis yielded only main effects on the mood composite, one might wonder whether exclusion from claimball exacerbates specific types of mood, in particular feelings of hostility or guilt. To test this, we reran the ANOVA with each of these subscales as dependent variable. For guilt, this only yielded a main effect for game condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 109) = 14.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, such that guilt was higher when participants were excluded (<italic>M</italic> = 2.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22) than when they were included (<italic>M</italic> = 1.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07).
