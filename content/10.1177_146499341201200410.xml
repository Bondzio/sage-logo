<p><italic>Biofuels and the Globalization of Risk</italic> gives a thought-provoking account of the growing biofuels industry and associated risks for the Global South. James Smith dissects some of the complex economic, environmental and social dynamics that drive and challenge the expansion of the biofuels industry. Overall, the book makes it clear that biofuels are not new, they are not guaranteed to be sustainable, and they may never be able to supply the amount of energy needed to meet current levels of consumption. Although careful to highlight potential alternatives to the observed negative consequences of biofuels development in the South, Smith leaves the reader uneasy about the speed at which current high-risk approaches are spreading across the globe.</p>
<p>Smith begins his book by outlining the general analytical approach he employs to examine the spread of biofuels. Following in the footsteps of Aihwa Ong and Stephen Collier, he uses the concept of an ‘assemblage’ to explore the social and economic ‘domains’ in which the global uptake of biofuels is evolving into increasingly complex systems (pp. 10–11). Although presenting some of the basic elements of an assemblage, the book does not dig into the assemblage theory. Smith’s decision to avoid lengthy discussions of philosophy or research methods opens the book to a larger audience and fits in its more activist tone and message. The core purpose of the book is to highlight how biofuels are driven forward by their ability to package ‘unsustainability as sustainability’ and ‘uneven development as fortuitous’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>After introducing biofuels and some associated risks, Smith examines the evolution of the assemblage around them. By building a picture from the ‘Science’ outwards, he captures layers of complexity and uncertainty which are often hidden behind policies for biofuels production. By repeatedly pointing out discrepancy between the image of certainty promoted by governments and industry, and the inadequacy of knowledge regarding the impacts of biofuels, Smith highlights the political nature of the biofuels assemblage.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of gliding over the natural and social science discussions around biofuels is that the book is limited in its discussion of evidence behind arguments. Citing David Pimentel, Smith highlights that ‘the energy contained in all the vegetation across the whole of the USA only accounts for around one-third of the total energy consumed in the USA per year’ (p. 42). In citing this calculation, Smith nearly falls into the trap of presenting controversial evidence as truths, a practice which he protests. Fortunately, the controversy surrounding these calculations serves to further highlight existing uncertainties and supports the need for more research and precaution; two of Smith’s main points. Overall, the majority of observations and accusations made regarding the inadequacy of knowledge behind biofuels are balanced with a healthy dosage of scepticism and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Smith does a good job of showing how scientists (natural and social) are themselves political actors within the assemblage. They provide the tools to turn biomass into fuel as well as the evidence for designing policies (pp. 63–64). However, the contribution of science to policy does not mean that either scientists or politicians fully control the larger process in which they are engaged. OECD governments spend billions on subsidies for biofuels production and only a fraction of that amount on research and development (R&amp;D), a clear indication that scientists do not control policy. The discrepancy in spending between R&amp;D and implementation is especially alarming, given that the majority of promoters claim research is the solution to the shortcomings of the current generation of biofuels.</p>
<p>To explain discrepancies between dialogue and action, Smith shifts his focus to the political economy surrounding biofuels and energy more broadly. He shows that governments are pushed towards biofuels by the shifting oil prices (for example, Brazil in the 1970s) and fears of dependency on fuel imports (pp. 21, 68–69). Furthermore, the actors pushing for biofuels include multinational companies that donate hundreds of millions of dollars to political campaigns, and intend to make profits (pp. 76–77). Taken together, it becomes apparent that neither governments nor industries are pushing for biofuels out of concerns for sustainability or pro-poor development. The outcome of this political economy appears to be large subsidies which support Northern farmers, transporters and producers, without adequate reflection on consequences for the South.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the science and political economy around biofuels, Smith focuses on how the assemblage may impact the poor and hungry in the South. The long-term impact of biofuels on the poor in the South is still largely unknown, but observed changes are alarming. Increasing interest in Southern biomass production is pushing for the re-designation of waste land, the mechanization of agriculture, intensification of water usage and introduction of agro-chemicals into untouched ecosystems (pp. 99–103). The current biofuel assemblage increases risks for the South by neglecting ways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accumulating risks for biomass producers and pushing greater responsibility on those who never contributed to GHG accumulation (p. 130). Although anecdotal as evidence of future problems, Smith highlights how 1 billion people went hungry in 2009, while the grains used to produce biofuels could have fed 330 million people that same year (p. 26).</p>
<p><italic>Biofuels and the Globalization of Risk</italic> does not promise or provide answers regarding how the global biofuels assemblage can be transformed into a pro-poor, sustainable solution for addressing demand for renewable energy. Instead, James Smith uses this book to question the very notion of a supply side solution for preserving today’s partially over-consuming and partially underdeveloped world. He suggested that solutions ‘will have a negative impact on the lives of those who consume the most’ (p. 129). In doing so, Smith may be neglecting the potential of increasing energy efficiency (e.g., in housing, transportation, etc.) and developing a sustainable mix of renewable energy (e.g., biomass, wind, solar etc.) to maintain current lifestyles. However, the book makes it clear that irrespective of solutions, future sustainability will require societies to pay more attention to the political structures which ‘derive sustainability from science’ and shape equality (p. 131).</p>
