<abstract>
<p>The main aim of this study is to describe consequences of climate change in the mountain region of southern Norway with respect to recently exposed finds of archaeological remains associated with reindeer hunting and trapping at and around ice patches in central southern Norway. In the early years of the twenty-first century, warm summers caused negative glacier mass balance and significant glacier retreat and melting of ice patches in central southern Norway. As a result, prehistoric remains lost and/or left by past reindeer hunters appeared at ice patches in mountain areas of southern Norway. In the warm summer and autumn of 2006 the number of artefact recoveries at ice patches increased significantly because of melting of snow and ice patches and more than 100 objects were recovered in the Oppland county alone. In 2009, detailed multidisciplinary investigations were carried out at the Juvfonne ice patch in Jotunheimen at an elevation of <italic>c</italic>. 1850 metres. A well-preserved Iron Age hunting station was discovered and in total <italic>c</italic>. 600 artefacts have been documented at the Juvfonne site alone. Most of the objects were recovered and brought to the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo for conservation, exhibition and storing. Thirteen so called ‘scaring sticks’ recovered from the recently exposed foreland of Juvfonne were radiocarbon dated, yielding ages that group in two separate time intervals, <sc>ad</sc> 246–534 and <sc>ad</sc> 804–898 (±1 sigma). By putting the temporal distribution of the radiocarbon-dated artefacts into the context of late-Holocene glacier-size variations in the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen regions, we conclude that the most extensive reindeer hunting and trapping associated with snow/ice patches was related to periods with prevailing warm summers when the reindeer herds gathered on high-altitude, contracted glaciers and ice patches to avoid insect plagues. The ‘freshness’ of the fragile organic finds strongly indicates that at least some of the artefacts were rapidly covered by snow and ice and that they may have been more-or-less continuously covered by snow and ice since they were first buried.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Global and regional climate changes during the recent decades have led to worldwide melting of glaciers, ice caps and snowfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425552">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425552">Lemke et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, archaeological remains have been exposed at ice patches, mainly in North America, the Alps and Norway. The term ‘snow (or ice) patch archaeology’ refers to the investigation and management of several alpine contexts in different regions of the world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611425552">Callanan, 2010</xref>). Snow and ice patches (consist predominantly of snow and ice, respectively) are snow, firn and ice accumulations that lie on the surface for a longer time than other seasonal snow cover. The frozen conditions, commonly combined with little or no basal ice movement, make excellent conditions for preservation of artefacts.</p>
<p>The archaeological potential of such finds is perhaps best known from the ‘Ice Man’ Ötzi found in the Alps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611425552">Spindler, 1994</xref>), from equipment at the Schnidejoch mountain pass in Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611425552">Grosjean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611425552">Suter et al., 2005</xref>), from mummies in Greenland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611425552">Hansen et al., 1985</xref>) and the Andes Mountains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425552">Ceruti, 2004</xref>), and from objects at retreating ice patches in Yukon (Canada), Alaska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425552">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>) and USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425552">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from the preservation of rare, organic artefacts, the combination of ice patches and datable objects also opens a new window into past climate history. In this paper, radiocarbon-dated artefacts related to reindeer hunting and trapping associated with snow patches in Jotunheimen have been compiled, calibrated and assessed in the context of late-Holocene size variations of glaciers and ice patches in the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen regions as a response to climate changes.</p>

<title>Ice patches with finds of archaeological remains: Preservation potential and climatic significance</title>
<p>Ice patches are part of the continuum between glacier-covered and glacier-free periglacial/permafrost environments. Ice patches have, however, received less scientific attention as a climate archive despite obvious links to permafrost and glaciers. In literature, however, there are few reports about ice patch mass balance and dynamics. Snow and ice patches commonly form in sheltered places where both the surface energy balance and orographical conditions are favourable for the conservation of snow and ice (larger snow accumulation by wind and less melting/ablation than surrounding terrain), such as small existing depressions, gullies or other concave terrain forms, commonly on north- or east-facing slopes. Snow and ice patches lie on the surface for a longer time than other seasonal snow cover and they normally consist of snow and firn in the upper parts and ice in the deeper parts. In warm summers the snow and firn melt. There are two types of snow patches: seasonal snow patches and perennial snow patches. Seasonal snow patches melt during summer, whereas perennial (in this context referred to as ice patches), are present from two years up to centuries or millennia. The main process that creates these accumulations is called nivation, which is a series of processes that includes alternating freezing and thawing (weathering), mass movement and transport by gravity, and erosion by meltwater. Around ice patches, there is normally high soil moisture that supports distinctive vegetation, usually dominated by species, predominantly herbaceous, which tolerate a shortened growing season.</p>
<p>In contrast to temperate warm-based glaciers that are at the pressure melting point at their bed, ice patches are similar to cold-based or polar glaciers in that they are below the pressure melting point at their bed, and commonly underlain by permafrost and thus frozen to the substratum. The ice movement is therefore insignificant and mostly by internal deformation above the bed, resulting in little or no basal sliding and minimal erosion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425552">Benn and Evans, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>During periods of favourable conditions for glaciers, e.g. lowering in summer temperature and/or sufficient period with increased snow accumulation and reduced surface melt, such as the ‘Little Ice Age’, or the initial stage of (Neo)glaciations, an ice patch could grow in size and form a glacier. The ice patches commonly make excellent conditions for preservation of artefacts because of limited ice deformation. Aside from the preservation of artefacts, the combination of ice patches and datable objects opens a new window into past climate history. Main factors for the mass balance of an ice patch are the amount of snow accumulation during the winter season and surface heat exchange during the melting season, similar to valley and cirque glaciers. However, there might be significant microclimatic differences owing to the size of the ice patches compared with glaciers. Ice patches are most likely more influenced by advective heat transfer from surrounding warmer air masses in summer. Compared with glaciers, the snow accumulation on ice patches is probably more sensitive to changes in prevailing wind directions and the amount of snowdrift during winter. Furthermore, average summer melt must be less than, or equal to, snow accumulation, thus ice patches are commonly located in shaded topographic settings with low incoming radiation.</p>
<p>Ice patches are by definition thin compared with glaciers, thus internal deformation and ice movement at the bed is small. Objects that accumulate in perennial ice patches will therefore normally be well preserved until they are exposed. Ice patches have, in contrast to glaciers, no frontal time lag/response time. Their extent and thickness vary annually in phase with mass-balance changes.</p>
<p>The surface temperature of an ice patch does not rise above 0°C; consequently these features are most likely underlain by permafrost. The only exception to this general rule is the possibility of non-conductive energy transfer under the ice patch, such as groundwater flow. Based on this reasoning, a perennial ice patch is normally frozen to the ground beneath, and can be interpreted as a strong indication of permafrost. Presently, permafrost thicknesses at the elevation with perennial ice patches (&gt;1700 m a.s.l.) in eastern Jotunheimen has been estimated to &gt;100 m. Observations of ground thermal regime indicate a lower permafrost limit in the Jotunheimen area of around 1600 m a.s.l. At present, mean ground temperature (MGT) at about 1900 m in Jotunheimen is −3°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425552">Isaksen et al., 2001</xref>) and above 2200 m, the MGT is estimated to be between −4 and −5°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611425552">Ødegård et al., 1992</xref>). Deep and old (early-/pre-Holocene?) permafrost in Jotunheimen is presently adjusting to current atmospheric and environmental conditions and tends to be in various stages of warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425552">Isaksen et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611425552">2011</xref>) or even thawing.</p>
<p>Observations during drilling of two PACE boreholes on Juvvasshøe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425552">Figure 4</xref>) showed that the layers of fine material between 1.5 and 5 m depth (above bedrock) contained some ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611425552">Harris et al., 2003</xref>) (and may be of similar age as the basal ice in ice patches in Jotunheimen). In addition, it was observed several ice layers during drilling into the bedrock below, the thickest (10–20 cm) layers were at about 12–13 m depth. This was later confirmed by the borehole geophysics and video camera recordings, which showed a generally high frequency of fissures and fractures in the bedrock. The resistivity borehole log also indicated some peaks interpreted as ice-filled fractures. The deeper ice (e.g. below 10 m) is potentially of pre-Holocene age.</p>
<p>Landsat-derived glacier inventories for Jotunheimen, central south Norway, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figure 1</xref>) show that 38 glaciers shrank by ~23% since the 1930s (until 2003) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425552">Andreassen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611425552">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>), and since the 1960s, 164 glaciers experienced an overall area reduction of 12%. Mapping of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) maximum extent of 233 glaciers in Jotunheimen revealed an area and length reduction by 35% and 34%, respectively, from the maximum LIA extent to 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611425552">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The reindeer were in the past, as at present, standing on snow/ice patches during hot days in the summer in order to avoid insects. The most extensive reindeer hunting took place on and at such ice patches. Arrows missing their targets are easily hidden and lost in the snow. Such items and other equipment or installations used at or near the ice patch therefore have a great preservation potential if buried in the snow and ice. This is for example demonstrated by the melt-out of well-preserved stone-made hunting blinds presumed to be of Iron Age at Juvfonne. The prestigious archaeological finds are constantly revealing insight into past hunting and trapping activities at and around snow patches and they have the potential to give new, accurate and detailed insight into past size variations of snow and ice patches where the reindeer hunting took place (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425552">Callanan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Ice patch archaeology</title>
<p>In Norway, the first finds of artefacts from ice patches were recorded in the early twentieth century and further finds were made during warm summers in the 1930s. Worldwide, the artefacts and sites in the high alpine mountains are mainly related to hunting/trapping (mainly in North America, northern Europe, Himalayas and the Andes), transport of people, animals and goods (mainly in the European Alps), grazing, seasonal herding, hunting and mining. The remains are both inorganic and organic, and they are commonly well preserved as they have been kept in a frozen state for centuries or millennia. The archaeological material from ice and snow patches in the high mountains of central southern Norway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425552">2</xref>) is by far the largest material in northern Europe. It consists mainly of artefacts associated with prehistoric reindeer hunting and trapping, such as iron and bone arrowheads and wooden shafts, hand-bow fragments, scaring sticks and wooden spades. In general, the finds are dominated by material from the Iron Age (<sc>ad</sc> 300–1030), the Medieval Period (<sc>ad</sc> 1030–1536), and the historical times up until the introduction of firearms in the 1600s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425552">Farbregd, 2009</xref>). There are also some finds from the late Stone Age and Bronze Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425552">Åstveit, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425552">Finstad and Vedeler, 2008</xref>), and it is presumed that older artefacts may appear if the remaining older ice melts in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425552">Åstveit, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425552">Callanan and Farbregd, 2010</xref>). In northern Scandinavia, outside central south Norwegian mountains, two organic arrow finds on Seiland near Alta, northern Norway, in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611425552">Johansen, 2002</xref>,) and two complete arrows from Jukkasjärvi in northern Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611425552">Lundholm, 1976</xref>), have been made (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425552">Farbregd, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Archaeological finds recovered from snow and ice patches in Dovrefjell and Sunndalsfjella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figure 1</xref>), central southern Norway (stored at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, NTNU, Trondheim), consist of more than 180 individual artefacts from at least 20 localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425552">Callanan and Farbregd, 2010</xref>). Based on ice-patch finds in Oppdalsfjella, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425552">Farbregd (2009)</xref> distinguished four development stages of hunting archery subsequent to ~<sc>ad</sc> 400. During the Migration Period (~<sc>ad</sc> 400–600), iron replaced bone and antler as the main material used for arrowheads and two types of shafts came into use. The first type (called A1) had straight, flattened end with V-like nock, was 66–70 cm long, 0.6–0.8 cm thick, and made almost exclusively of birch (<italic>Betula</italic>) wood. The second type (B) was characterised by U-shaped nocks in knob-like ends. The shafts were generally longer than the A1 type and were commonly made from other wood species. During the Merovingian and Viking Periods (~<sc>ad</sc> 600–1000) the arrowheads changed their shape. By the end of the sixth century the arrowhead tangs had changed from flat to pointed or tapering. The tangs were fitted into a split in the shaft-end. In the eighth century, the design of the arrowhead tangs altered; a step or stop was made on the tapering tang in order to prevent the shaft from splintering upon impact and the tangs were fitted into a hole in the frontal-end of the shaft. In the Middle Ages (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1000–1200), the arrowheads, shaft type and bow construction changed. Subsequent to about <sc>ad</sc> 1000, a thicker, shorter and stiffer shaft (type C) came into use, indicating the use of a stronger, heavier and shorter bow. In the thirteenth to seventeenth centuries both crossbows and hand bows were used for reindeer hunting.</p>
<p>Finds at ice patches in Oppdalsfjella in 2003–2004 gave new insight; 14 out of 27 finds were dated typologically to the Migration Period (early Iron Age) (<sc>ad</sc> 400–575) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425552">Åstveit, 2007</xref>). After 2000, finds of resin on a slate arrowhead and an incomplete wooden arrow shaft, both from Kringsollfonna (TUa-5292 dated at 3925 ± 40 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (2474–2394 <sc>bc</sc>), TUa-5293 dated at 3365 ± 65 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (1741–1606 <sc>bc</sc>), TUa-5293 dated at 3365 ± 45 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (1696–1609 <sc>bc</sc>)) were dated to the late Stone Age and early Bronze Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425552">Åstveit, 2007</xref>). This indicates that the snow/ice patches where they were found have existed (more-or-less) continuously at least during the last ~4000 years. In addition, another slate arrowhead, also from the late Stone Age, was found close to ice patches in Oppdalsfjella.</p>
<p>In 1936, a so-called wolf’s fence (Norwegian: ‘Gråbeinstengsle’) was found on a snow/ice patch at the mountain Ceciliekruna in Olden, inner Nordfjord in western Norway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425552">Figure 2</xref>) at an altitude of about 1180 m. A tag attached to the rope had the initials to a local farmer, running a farm from <sc>ad</sc> 1602 to 1624, indicating that the rope and sticks were put up during the first half of the seventeenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425552">Karlén, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425552">Nesje, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>On the mountain Rambera (at an altitude of 1500 m) at Vik in the Sognefjord region of western Norway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425552">Figure 2</xref>), remains of a wooden (birch) fence, interpreted to have been put up to lead reindeers toward hunters hidden behind hunting blinds, were found in 1936 and later radiocarbon dated by Professor Knut Fægri at the Botanical Institute, University of Bergen, at 1715 ± 105 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (<sc>ad</sc> 210–430) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425552">Barth and Nordengen, 1993</xref>). The find was later exposed during the warm summers (little snow) in 1947 and 2006. Also in 2010 the wooden remains were exposed and revisited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611425552">Åstveit, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425552">Åstveit and Nesje, 2012</xref>). During this visit, a reindeer antler was found close to the wooden remains, and radiocarbon dated at 1120–900 <sc>bc</sc>.</p>
<p>Since the warm summer and autumn of 2006 the number of artefact recoveries increased significantly and <italic>c</italic>. 800 artefacts from the Oppland County were collected, handed in to, and registered by the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425552">Wangen and Solli, 2010</xref>). The artefacts related to reindeer hunting were recovered at ice patches over large high alpine mountain areas from Jotunheimen in the SW to Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella in the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425552">2</xref>). Altogether, about 40 snow patches have been surveyed in the Oppland County (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figure 1</xref>) and archaeological finds have been recovered at 22 of them. At Juvfonne in Lom alone, about 600 artefacts and 50 hunting blinds were recorded until the end of the summer 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425552">Finstad and Pilø, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425552">b</xref>).</p>

<title>Jotunheimen – Breheimen – Reinheimen</title>
<p>Jotunheimen is a mountainous area of roughly 3500 km<sup>2</sup> in central southern Norway and is part of the long mountain range known as the Scandes Mountains. The 29 highest summits in Norway are in Jotunheimen, including the highest, Galdhøpiggen (2469 m). Jotunheimen contains the Jotunheimen National Park that was established in 1980 and covers an area of 1151 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In Lesja, Skjåk and Lom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425552">Figure 2</xref>), different artefacts related to reindeer hunting at ice patches have been recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425552">Figure 3</xref>). Arrowheads were found and registered in warm summers from the 1930s and up the 1970s (peak summer warmth 1932–1938 and 1947; met.no) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425552">Finstad and Pilø, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425552">b</xref>). During the summers of 2002 and 2003 a number of ice patches were surveyed and several artefacts (scaring sticks) were found and some of them were later radiocarbon dated. In 2006, a large number of finds were made at melting ice patches in the region, most of which came from Dalfonn in Reinheimen, and Kvitingskjølen and Lomseggen in eastern Jotunheimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425552">Figure 1</xref>). Owing to more extensive snow cover in the summers of 2007 and 2008, only a few artefacts were found by local mountaineers, however, limited surveys at a few ice patches led to recovery of archaeological material.</p>

<p>The most detailed ice-patch archaeological mapping has been carried out in the northern part of Jotunheimen, mainly through local mountaineers (Reidar Marstein and Jan Stokstad). In Jotunheimen, artefacts related to reindeer hunting at and around snow patches have been found at Juvfonne (first find in 2007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425552">Figure 4</xref>), where Iron Age reindeer hunting took place by means of scaring sticks and stone-made hunting blinds. The finds at Juvfonne cover an area of 70 000 m<sup>2</sup>. About 600 finds have been registered (by the end of 2010), together with 50 stone-made hunting blinds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425552">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425552">6</xref>).

<p>A typical artefact in Jotunheimen is the so-called ‘scaring stick’ (a wooden stick with a movable wooden object attached to the top of a stick put up some metres apart) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425552">Figure 6</xref>). Reindeer would shy away from scaring sticks because of the movement. By placing a row of scaring sticks to block the normal access of the reindeer on to or away from the ice patch, or prevent the reindeer to run away in all directions, their natural behaviour could be used to lead the reindeer toward the hunters hiding in hunting blinds. Scaring sticks have mainly been recovered in the mountains in the Lom area. Other artefacts include arrows, wooden spades, textiles, a leather shoe and a spear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425552">Finstad and Pilø, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425552">b</xref>). Of these, the oldest and most spectacular find was the leather shoe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425552">Figure 3D</xref>), spotted by Reidar Marstein on 17 September 2006, at Langfonna (‘fonn’ ≈ snow/ice patch) on Kvitingskjølen at an altitude of <italic>c</italic>. 2000 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425552">Finstad and Vedeler, 2008</xref>). The shoe was radiocarbon dated at 3070 ± 40 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (1 sigma error), calibrated age: 1404–1306 <sc>bc</sc> (± 1 sigma)/1429–1257 <sc>bc</sc> (± 2 sigma) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683611425552">Table 2</xref>). The shoe, by far the oldest shoe recovered so far in Norway, was extremely fragile, indicating that the shoe must have been covered by snow and ice more-or-less continuously since it was buried. Most likely therefore, Langfonna has not been smaller than at present for many years during the last ~3430–3260 years. Tests indicate that the shoe (size ~38) was made of untanned reindeer hide (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425552">Finstad and Vedeler, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Juvfonne ice patch</title>
<p>The first archaeological finds at Juvfonne (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425552">Figure 4</xref>) were made in 2007. In 2009, a large-scale multidisciplinary investigation, including mapping, sampling, registration and radiocarbon dating of artefacts in a 50 000 m<sup>2</sup> area took place at Juvfonne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611425552">Pilø et al., 2011</xref>). Monitoring of the ice patch was undertaken in 2010, and artefacts were collected on newly exposed terrain. Altogether, <italic>c</italic>. 600 artefacts were found by the end of 2010, mostly scaring sticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425552">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425552">6</xref>). A total of 50 stone-made hunting blinds are registered. Thirteen scaring sticks from the 2007 and 2010 field registrations were radiocarbon dated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611425552">Table 3</xref>). The radiocarbon dates, four of them most likely of in situ scaring sticks (the find context indicates that the sticks were put up between boulders or laid down by humans (stored at hunting blind) on ice-free ground), show that the dates fall into two separate age groups: <sc>ad</sc> 246–534 and <sc>ad</sc> 804–898. Between mid August 2009 and mid August 2010 the lowest-lying margin of the Juvfonne ice patch retreated ~18 m because of exceptionally little snow accumulation during the 2009/2010 winter and a rather mild and a rainy 2010 summer season. As a result, numerous finds (scaring sticks and stone-made hunting blinds) appeared along the melting ice-patch margin. Simultaneously, macroscopic plant fragments (mostly grass and dwarf willow (<italic>Salix herbacea</italic>) leaves) and fine-detritus organic remains that formed parts of the soil formed when the ground was ice free, emerged from the ice. <italic>Salix herbacea</italic> (dwarf willow) is a species of tiny creeping willows (family <italic>Salicaceae</italic>) and is adapted to survive in harsh Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. <italic>Salix</italic> has a wide distribution on both sides of the North Atlantic, in Arctic northwest Asia, northern Europe, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and further south on high mountains, south to the Pyrenees and the Alps, and the northern Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611425552">Meikle, 1984</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to reconstruct size variations of the Juvfonne ice patch, attempts were made to date organic remains along the eastern margin of Juvfonne. Radiocarbon dates of in situ moss (<italic>Polytrichum</italic> sp.) mats sampled from the ice patch foreland in August 2009 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611425552">Table 4</xref>) and organic remains/macroscopic plant remains sampled along the ice-patch margin in August 2010 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611425552">Table 5</xref>), all giving ‘modern’ age (<sc>ad</sc> 1950), together with a find of an unopened <italic>Coca Cola</italic> glass bottle (the label dates the bottle to 1981) and the heel part of a ‘modern’ skiing leather shoe retrieved from the foreland that became ice free during the summer of 2010, indicate that the Juvfonne ice patch was of similar size, or slightly smaller, than at present during the later part of the twentieth century. Meteorological data and aerial photographs also indicate that Juvfonne was of similar size, or even slightly smaller, than in the summer of 2010 in the early 1980s. Subsequently, the ice patch advanced some tens of metres in the 1990s because of increased winter accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425552">Andreassen et al., 2005</xref>), before a significant retreat took place after 2000 mainly as a response to warm summers, especially in 2006.</p>

<p>Recordings with ground penetrating radar (GPR, Georadar) at Juvfonne in September 2009 revealed a maximum ice patch thickness of 17–19 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425552">Figure 7</xref>) (Rune Strand Ødegård, personal communication, 2009). The near-surface reflection horizons are nearly parallel to the present surface. At greater depth, curved reflection horizons are observed. In May 2010, an ice tunnel was excavated in the Juvfonne ice patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425552">Figure 7</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oppland.no/Klimapark2469">www.oppland.no/Klimapark2469</ext-link>). The length of the tunnel in 2010 was approximately 30 m. In the tunnel, the curved layers of the deeper ice can be directly observed, forming a distinct angular unconformity with the surface ice layers, as observed in the outer part of the ice tunnel. The curved layering of the deepest ice is probably caused by deformation. Lichenometry indicates that the front of the Juvfonne ice patch extended ~250 m from its present position during the ‘Little Ice Age’ maximum position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683611425552">Figure 8</xref>). Then, Juvfonne had an estimated maximum thickness of 40–50 m, the thickness probably causing deformation of the deeper ice during the ‘Little Ice Age’ or earlier. Based on interpretation of the georadar recordings, the deeper ice is asymmetric relative to the present extent. The deep ice is exposed at the southern end of the ice patch, whereas the northern part consists entirely of ice layers parallel to the present surface.</p>

<p>When digging the tunnel into the upper and basal part of the Juvfonne, continuous, &lt;5 cm thick dark layers containing minerogenic particles and fine-detritus organic remains were revealed in the inner and deeper part of the ice patch. These horizons are interpreted to represent previous ice-patch surfaces after the ice patch was formed. Four samples from the dark/brown organic layers in the ice were collected in order to indirectly date when the deeper part of Juvfonne was formed. The ice was melted and the samples were dried before submitted to AMS radiocarbon dating. The samples yielded ages (in chronological order) ranging from 1257–1128 <sc>bc</sc> (oldest) to <sc>ad</sc> 943–987 (youngest) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0959683611425552">Table 6</xref>), indicating that the deeper part of the ice patch formed slightly before 3200 cal. yr BP.</p>

<p>Reindeer faecal pellets were recovered in a transparent ice layer in the inner part of the ice tunnel in Juvfonne in the summer of 2010. A pollen analysis was carried out on one of the faecal pellets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0959683611425552">Table 7</xref>). Although not much can be inferred from only one pollen sample, most of the pollen types apparently represent the regional vegetation, i.e. the lower forest region. The reindeer may have grazed on heather, grass and herbs, but it is difficult to infer which species were most important for the reindeer. The low herb values relative to the amount of tree pollen (pine) may indicate that the faecal pellets were incorporated in the ice during the autumn/winter/spring season based on evidence from pollen analysis of 3400 year old reindeer faecal pellets from Edgeøya, Svalbard (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425552">Bjune et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>Late-Holocene glacier/ice patch size variations in the context of the archaeological finds</title>
<p>To reconstruct the late-Holocene glacier activity of Kjelbreen and Vesljuvbreen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425552">Figure 4</xref>), a 54 cm long sediment core was retrieved by divers from ~7 m water depth in the distal part of Juvvatnet. Variations in dry bulk density, loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility in sediments retrieved from glacier-fed lakes have been demonstrated to reflect glacier activity in the upstream catchment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611425552">Bakke et al., 2010</xref>). These sediment parameters were therefore used on the sediments from Juvvatnet as indicators of the amount of glacially derived minerogenic material that has entered lake Juvvatnet, and thus as a proxy for the glacier activity in the catchment of the lake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0959683611425552">Figure 9</xref>) (A. Nesje and E. Støren, data obtained, 2010). The radiocarbon-dated scaring sticks at Juvfonne and the organic layers in the Juvfonne ice tunnel, as well as the radiocarbon-dated artefacts recovered at ice patches in Jotunheimen, were plotted on the glacier activity curve inferred from the Juvvatnet sediment core. In general, the glacier activity increased from about 2000 cal. yr <sc>bc</sc>, interrupted with periods of less glacier activity. The Bronze Age leather shoe dates to a period with small glaciers/ice patches in the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0959683611425552">Figure 9</xref>). The radiocarbon date of the lowest/deepest organic layer in the ice tunnel indicates that the Juvfonna ice patch was formed shortly afterwards (around 1200 cal. yr <sc>bc</sc>). The dated Iron Age artefacts related to reindeer trapping and hunting apparently fall within intervals with retreated/contracted glaciers/ice patches in the area, of which those around <sc>ad</sc> 400 and <sc>ad</sc> 800–900 were the most significant. During the ‘Little Ice Age’, by contrast, no signs of the hunting technique using scaring sticks and hunting blinds have been found at Juvfonna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0959683611425552">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

The evidence indicates that the recovered ice patch related archaeological finds in Jotunheimen originate from periods when glaciers (and most likely the snow/ice patches) in the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen areas were in a growing phase subsequent to have been in a contracted state, and that the artefacts soon afterwards were covered by snow and ice because of climatic deterioration. When the glaciers and snow/ice patches were in a contracted state, the higher ice masses were the only places where the reindeer could escape the insects. When the ice masses were more extensive, on the other hand, for example during the ‘Little Ice Age’, the reindeer could also use lower snow patches, but these have later melted and the organic remains disintegrated. The freshness of most of the finds (some of them very fragile) lends strong support to the idea that these artefacts have been more-or-less continuously buried in the snow/ice since they were first incorporated.</p>

Challenges of disappearing ice patches are to increase the knowledge about past size changes, internal structure (from georadar profiling and excavations/tunnelling), stratigraphy, degree of internal movement, mass balance (volume change) development, and melting processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425552">Farbregd, 1983</xref>). These aspects are fundamental for the understanding and prediction of preservation and release of artefacts embedded in the ice patches. Most ice patches with archaeological finds are located in remote areas and the season when the potential finds are exposed is short. These factors, together with the weather conditions in high south Norwegian mountains, pose logistical challenges. When climate change apparently is opening the frozen archive of ice patches, it becomes a challenge to survey, sample, collect, conserve and store the various finds. If not done properly, the fragile artefacts may never be found and saved for the future. Important questions still remain to be solved: (1) Have the archaeological finds been covered continuously in the snow and ice? (2) Are the most common finds, the wooden scaring sticks lying on the ground, a result of multiple subaerial exposures? (3) Have other types of (wooden) archaeological remains/artefacts been covered or disintegrated?</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this paper we have assessed the climatic significance of the archaeological finds exposed at retreating ice patches in Jotunheimen, central southern Norway. Thirteen scaring sticks recovered from the recently exposed foreland of the Juvfonne ice patch were radiocarbon dated and yielded ages that group in two separate time intervals, <sc>ad</sc> 246–534 and <sc>ad</sc> 804–898 (Iron Age).</p>
<p>The temporal distribution of the radiocarbon-dated artefacts from Jotunheimen has been compared with late-Holocene glacier-size variations in Jotunheimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425552">Matthews and Dresser, 2008</xref>) and Jostedalsbreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611425552">Vasskog et al., 2011</xref>), as reconstructed from independent evidence such as lake sediments and proglacial terrestrial sediments/sections. Based on the well-defined clusters of archaeological dates, which to a large extent fall within periods with contracted glaciers in the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen areas, we conclude that the most extensive reindeer hunting and trapping activity associated with snow/ice patches occurred during time intervals with prevailing warm summers when the reindeer herds, like today, gathered on contracted glaciers and ice patches to avoid insect plagues.</p>
<p>Radiocarbon dating of thin organic layers within the ice sampled in the inner part of the excavated ice tunnel in Juvfonne yielded ages ranging from 1257–1128 <sc>bc</sc> (oldest) to <sc>ad</sc> 943–987 (youngest). The basal date may indicate that the deeper part of the ice patch formed slightly before 3200 cal. yr BP.</p>
<p>A pollen analysis of reindeer faecal pellets, dated to <sc>ad</sc> 557–613, found in the inner parts of the ice tunnel in the Juvfonne ice patch, may indicate that the reindeer grazed on heather, grass and herbs. It is, however, difficult from only one sample to infer which species were most important for the reindeer.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this paper suggests that the archaeological finds at ice patches in Jotunheimen are from periods when the snow/ice patches were in a contracted state and that the artefacts were soon afterwards covered by snow and ice. The freshness of most of the finds indicates that at least some of the most fragile artefacts may have been continuously buried in snow and ice since they were first incorporated and until they melted out of the ice patches in the early twenty-first century.</p>

<p>The radiocarbon dating was carried out at the Poznan (Poland) and Trondheim (Norway) dating laboratories. Moss identification was by Einar Heegaard, Eva Bjørseth drafted some of the figures, Bjørn Haukeland assisted with the coring in lake Juvvatnet, Bjørn Kvisvik performed laboratory analyses on the sediment cores and Anne E. Bjune made pollen analysis of reindeer faecal pellets from the Juvfonne ice patch. To all these persons we offer our sincere thanks. We also thank KlimaPark2469 for the cooperation and two anonymous reviewers for suggestions of how to improve the paper. This is publication no. A354 from the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.</p>
