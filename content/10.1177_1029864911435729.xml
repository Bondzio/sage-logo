<abstract>
<p>This paper presents an in-depth, qualitative investigation into the impact of job loss for seven opera choristers. The paper focuses on their perception of this loss and how this perception influences the experience of career transition and subsequent redefinition of the self. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is used to highlight the individual nature of dealing with loss and transition. Discussion centres on three themes which best capture the psychological process involved in the renegotiation of self for the participants. Analysis shows that a key issue in adapting to career transition is re-defining what it means to be a singer without the validation of full-time employment. The Organismic Valuing Theory of growth after adversity (Joseph &amp; Linley, 2005) is used as a framework within which to discuss individual fluctuations between searching to develop new areas of the self and restoring the established self. The study concludes that singers are unique in the employment market because of their relationship to their embodied voice. For the seven participants, the experience of career disruption is determined by their ability to re-evaluate the role of singing as a primary agent of self-formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As companies respond to the economic crisis, down-sizing and involuntary job loss are an increasing concern for workers in every profession. However, within the performing arts, the understanding of ‘who we are’ and ‘what we do’ appears less straightforward than in many professions. Performance becomes more than a means of earning a living, it becomes a way of life. This is particularly true for singers who make a living using a biologically embedded instrument. Previously, musical career transitions have been addressed by researchers but in terms of natural development such as life-span models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1029864911435729">Manturzewska, 1990</xref>), becoming a full-time music student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864911435729">Burland &amp; Pitts, 2007</xref>) and the transition from music student to professional musican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1029864911435729">Burland &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435729">Creech et al., 2008</xref>). However, there is little work available which addresses enforced disruption to a musical career. The decision to investigate opera choristers was taken because, at the time of writing, they were the most recent group of musicians to suffer redundancy. In 2005 there were five full-time opera choruses in Great Britain. To date, three of those companies have made singers redundant. In 1998 Covent Garden made half of their personnel redundant. In 2003 English National Opera lost a third of their personnel and in 2005 Scottish Opera made a complete chorus redundant. As economic cuts to the arts take effect, these numbers may well increase. The data presented in this paper are part of a larger, more complex study on the effects of redundancy for opera choristers (for further reading see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1029864911435729">Oakland, 2010</xref>). This current paper seeks to understand the renegotiation of self in the context of a changing working environment for seven opera choristers.</p>
<p>The concept of work and career development has undergone considerable change as companies respond to economic change and globalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1029864911435729">Burke &amp; Cooper, 2002</xref>). This shift is reflected in the theories that underpin work and career development where the traditional linear structure of a career gives way to a more fluid, ever evolving concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1029864911435729">Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1029864911435729">Savickas et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1029864911435729">Hall and Mirvis (1995)</xref> conceptualised this change from the perspective of the individual. They talk of a move from an <italic>organisational career</italic> where an individual assumed they would work for a company until retirement, to a <italic>protean career</italic> which entails disconnecting a career from a life-long association with one company. A career is now increasingly viewed as a series of choices that individuals make during their life-span rather than a long-term commitment to a single employer or profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1029864911435729">Fouad &amp; Bynner, 2008</xref>). The implications for the employee are that instead of loyalty to one organisation the individual may need to have many employers. In addition the employee will receive less employer support and therefore need to be more self-reliant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1029864911435729">Weick, 1996</xref>).This led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1029864911435729">Hall and Moss (1998)</xref> to suggest that a career identity should be decoupled from a specific job or organisation and redirected to an individual’s personal values and broader career aspirations.</p>

<sec id="section2-1029864911435729">
<title>Career transition</title>
<p>When career expectations are disrupted, the individual needs to be able to adapt to those changes. Involuntary career transition is documented as one of the most stressful life events to affect individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864911435729">Spera, Buhrfeind, &amp; Pennebaker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435729">Zikic &amp; Klehe, 2006</xref>). Involuntary job loss has also been linked to poor physical health, particularly for older workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1029864911435729">Gallo, Bradley, Siegel, &amp; Kasl, 2000</xref>). Some studies have even suggested a link between unemployment and mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1029864911435729">Eliason &amp; Storrie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1029864911435729">Martikainen, 1990</xref>). There is also evidence that job loss places people at risk of poor mental health and in particular, depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1029864911435729">Fryer &amp; Fagan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1029864911435729">Price, Choi, &amp; Vinokur, 2002</xref>). This is explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1029864911435729">Waters (2007)</xref> who uses the theory of learned helplessness as a context within which to investigate depression resulting from voluntary and involuntary job loss. According to this theory, when someone is exposed to a negative, uncontrollable event they may see their efforts as being incongruent with the outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1029864911435729">Latack, Kinicki, and Prussia (1995)</xref> argue that it is because people do not see a connection between their efforts and outcomes that they become depressed. Thus Waters hypothesizes that people who have lost their job involuntarily will be subject to greater levels of depression than people for whom job loss was through their own choice.</p>
<p>Involuntary job loss involves not only loss of income but loss of self-esteem, loss of community and loss of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864911435729">Jahoda, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1029864911435729">Kuebler-Ross (1969)</xref> identified five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. These stages are often used to make sense of and shape the process of coping with traumatic experience such as bereavement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1029864911435729">Blau (2008)</xref> uses this model to measure the grieving stages of a group of pharmaceutical workers as they anticipated imminent job loss. Findings showed that denial, bargaining and anger decreased significantly over time but that anger and depression remained stable. Other models of grief focus on the interplay between confronting the loss and avoiding any reminders of the loss. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435729">Stroebe &amp; Schut (1999)</xref> devised a dual model of coping with bereavement. According to this model, individuals ‘oscillate’ between loss-orientated and restoration-orientated activities. Using a different approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1029864911435729">Worden (2009)</xref> focuses on the tasks of grieving and proposes a list of five grief activities: accept the loss, work through the pain of loss, make adjustments to the new world, cease investing in the deceased, start to invest in new relationships. In contrast to Kuebler-Ross, who argues that her stages are universal, Worden makes the point that while bereavement is universal, mourning is individual.</p>
<p>Job loss can also be seen as an opportunity to change careers and lifestyle, particularly if accompanied by adequate social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1029864911435729">Walsh &amp; Jackson, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1029864911435729">Jones (1989)</xref> noted that after a period of time, job loss allows one to redirect career goals and priorities and develop new competencies. This is shown to be the case in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1029864911435729">Wise and Millward (2005)</xref> who investigated voluntary career change in 30-somethings. They found that the driving force behind career change was subjective core values which in turn led to the perception that the individual was better equipped to deal with possible change. Thus, career transition initiated by job loss involves an emotional reorganisation which can involve loss, risk and anxiety as well as excitement about future possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1029864911435729">Lucey &amp; Reay, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The insecurity and adaptability which now seem to be characteristic of the contemporary career have always been a part of the classical music industry. In a study of the working practices of musicians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1029864911435729">Bennett (2007)</xref> found that the composite career was normal practice both for freelance musicians and for those employed full-time in a performance role. In other words, even workers who are in full-time employment in an orchestra or opera company also engage in a variety of other freelance work. This means that the terms ‘musician’ or ‘singer’ are not purely restricted to musical performance but incorporate a broad spectrum of industry roles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1029864911435729">Daykin (2005)</xref> suggests that the experience of musicians as creative adaptable workers may now have relevance to the wider working environment. In the context of redundancy, full-time musicians offer a unique perspective to the job loss literature because they occupy a middle ground in the employment arena as full-time workers but with a freelance approach.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The seven participants had all been made redundant from UK opera houses in the last ten years. Criteria for participation were that the singers should have a minimum of ten years’ experience as full-time workers and no longer be in full-time musical employment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1029864911435729">Table 1</xref>). At the time of the investigation, the first author was a professional opera chorister. Participants were recruited through peer networks but were not known personally to the author.</p>

<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Data was collected using informal face-to-face interviews to reflect the qualitative nature of the study. Each interview lasted approximately one and a half hours, was recorded and transcribed verbatim by the first author. The interview schedule was broadly semi-structured in order for each individual to have the freedom to explore potentially sensitive issues at their own pace, as well as to lessen any preconceptions on the part of the interviewer. To aid this process, the interview schedule began with an informal chat where each participant talked about their life and career in general. Each interview began with the same question ‘What does singing mean to you?’ The interviewer then followed the participant through their narrative, pursuing areas of interest that might arise. Three further questions were posed at an appropriate time in the interview. ‘How did it feel when you realised redundancy was inevitable?’ ‘How did it feel on your first day without work?’ ‘What changes in your life have you seen since you stopped singing full-time?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1029864911435729">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Understanding the process of adaptation to change requires an approach that can access personal and complex subject-matter. The interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).The benefit of a phenomenological approach is that no attempt is made to generate universal theory but ‘<italic>there is a striving to build meaningful local knowledge’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1029864911435729">McLeod, 1996</xref>). IPA is concerned with understanding the meaning of a particular phenomenon for a particular individual. However, IPA also recognises the active role of the researcher in gaining access to that window of experience (for an in depth discussion of IPA methodology see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864911435729">Smith, Flowers &amp; Larkin, 2009</xref>). During the research process a reflexive diary was kept by the first author in order to monitor any preconceptions and influences on the data collection and subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Analysis follows a series of stages whereby the data is synthesised into a small number of super-ordinate themes with relevant sub-ordinate themes. These themes are then transformed into a narrative account which mixes textual evidence with researcher interpretation and theoretical understanding. No attempt was made to fit data to preconceived theories in the early stages of analysis or data collection. However, during the final stages of analysis, additional investigation into theories of trauma found that the Organismic Valuing Process (OVP) devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1029864911435729">Joseph and Linley (2005)</xref> would be a useful theory to frame the subject-matter of this paper.</p>

<sec id="section7-1029864911435729" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>For the purpose of this paper, one over-arching theme is presented: ‘Re-defining Me’ which examines the participants’ experiences of dealing with the loss of professional work. Two further super-ordinate themes emerged from the larger study which brought to light the importance of professional work in validating an identity as an opera singer and the conflicts that the singers experienced between musical power and economic control. Discussion now centres on three sub-ordinate themes which best capture the psychological process of transition necessary for the renegotiation of self for opera choristers: first, the meaning of loss; second, a ‘square peg in a round hole’; and third, the new ‘Me’.</p>
<sec id="section8-1029864911435729">
<title>The meaning of loss</title>
<p>This theme looks at the emotional and physical reactions to the loss of operatic singing work. Anger and guilt are the predominant emotions expressed in these two excerpts:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s the most petty, bloody-minded action I’ve seen from an executive, completely pointless.’ (Hugh)</p>
<p>I just felt guilty because I wasn’t feeling these terrible emotions my colleagues were. (Moira)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hugh appears to cope with the personal trauma of redundancy by directing his anger towards what he sees as the vindictiveness of the management. He blames factors which he has no control over and which may relieve him from taking any personal responsibility for the changes to his life. Moira feels guilty because she isn’t able to experience the same feelings of loss as her colleagues. During the interview Moira talked at length about the way she enjoyed feeling different from the non-musical community as well as her constant search for individuality within the chorus she worked for. Guilt is a common expression of loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1029864911435729">Parkes, 1998</xref>) but for Moira it could be another way to endorse her individuality. The distance she puts between herself and her colleagues may help her retain personal self-esteem. The emotional content of loss can also have physical implications. Helen’s emotional reaction to redundancy resulted in her being physically unable to sing:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the moment, singing doesn’t really come into my life anymore, I haven’t sung for two years, somehow the artistic side of me is getting completely and utterly squashed and it’s not being allowed to blossom.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Helen feels physically and psychologically confined due to loss of work. Redundancy has compressed her artistic nature to the point where no physical display of vocal emotion is possible and she feels trapped. Her vocal loss could be explained by the uncertainty surrounding her ‘changed’ self where the role of singing is not yet established.</p>
<p>One other participant, Fiona, talked about her physical reactions to the transition. After the redundancy Fiona moved away from the area of her previous working environment and in this extract she recounts the lead-up to what she terms a ‘mental crash’, and its after-effects.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I passed out five times and was in hospital for four days, the diagnosis was exhaustion and I realised I’d never stopped since coming up here, making money, putting the kids to bed zooming off to do private teaching. I felt guilty if I did anything for me so I had a kind of mental crash and cried and cried and cried. I deal with it in a different way now, before it was pressure, never relaxing ever, ever. Being in hospital was my next big light-bulb.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first ‘light-bulb’ for Fiona was redundancy and the realisation of the lack of control she had over her professional life. The second was being in hospital, which showed her that although she had gained control of her life she was using it detrimentally. The metaphor of a light-bulb seems to illuminate key transitional moments in Fiona’s life that have enabled her to move forward and reformulate previous values. In the extract above she comments on the guilt she feels if she thinks about herself or does things for herself. For Fiona, working for her family was a way of dealing with change because she was temporarily able to avoid the strong emotional impact of the redundancy. However, ultimately the emotional entrapment manifested itself in physical symptoms. The ‘crash’ Fiona refers to became a catalyst for self-examination and re-evaluation.</p>
<p>The emotions of loss and bereavement are complicated. Anger, guilt and denial all resonate with the models of grief discussed earlier, but the varied emotions presented in the extracts hint at the individuality of grief expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1029864911435729">Worden, 2009</xref>). The extract from Helen shows that redundancy is more than just loss of work. She has lost a primary channel of self-expression and identity, and this has physical implications, as it did with Fiona. Underlying all the varying displays of emotion is the fluctuation between grieving for a loss of self and undertaking positive steps to regain self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435729">Stroebe &amp; Schut, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1029864911435729">
<title>‘A square peg in a round hole’</title>
<p>This theme is concerned with the experiences of ‘fitting in’ with new working environments and how the singers tried to replace the function that professional singing used to play in their lives. The title phrase was used by Helen to describe the way she felt as a creative, artistic person doing a non-musical job. Fitting into new communities was challenging and problematic for the singers who chose to work on a freelance basis as well as for those who entered non-musical environments. Moira placed importance on the need for a physical outlet for the energy she was not using due to the loss of singing and enrolled on a gardening course:
<disp-quote>
<p>I went on the course as an opera singer and I think I was accepted within the first week. I was doing country and gardening skills but then I would say it’s not only gardening, it’s fencing and slabbing, ’cos that would get a reaction. I like to think of myself as being different, I needed to find an avenue to get rid of all the energy I’d been putting out for singing and performing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moira appears to prioritise the external, visible elements of identity formation such as the recognition she receives for ‘being an opera singer’. For Moira, singing and gardening are compatible because of the physical energy involved but she also needs to be different and to be recognised for being different. Despite seeking attention through her gardening skills Moira still defines herself as an opera singer which may provide her with some continuity to make sense of the disruption to her life.</p>
<p>Helen found herself working in the property market. Her initial excitement at being offered full-time work was taken over by the realisation that it could never replace singing:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was so proud of myself for getting a full-time job. I couldn’t believe it, you get this fantastic boost and you think, ‘Oh I am worth something after all, somebody sees that in me, that’s great’, and you go to work and you realise that the job just doesn’t fit your personality. You’re trying to put a square peg in a round hole.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finding a new job can create similar feelings to those of doing a successful audition for singing work. It is a re-affirmation of an ability which is sometimes taken for granted in full-time employment. For Helen, her new job temporarily gave her hope that she could restore her previous professional values, albeit in a different field. However, Helen’s sense of self is not compatible with a non-artistic environment and she feels out of place and unfulfilled.</p>
<p>For the singers who chose to stay in the operatic profession difficulties were also experienced in finding a place in a profession in which they felt betrayed. In the following extract Margaret describes her feelings during an audition for full-time work:
<disp-quote>
<p>A job came up at (<italic>name of company</italic>), I’d just got into my second aria and I thought what am I doing here? You know I was singing away thinking, ‘Margaret what are you doing? This isn’t what you want, maybe in a few years but not now.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though Margaret is looking for other operatic work, she seems not to feel part of the operatic profession. Margaret uses the second person which reflects the remoteness she feels from the person who is physically singing and this splitting of the self may be a means of self-protection to compensate for perceived negative evaluation through redundancy. However, she doesn’t rule out singing full-time in the future. She may need more time before she is able to give the same commitment to a profession that she no longer trusts.</p>
<p>Hugh had been in the company 26 years and like many singers of a certain age expected to stay there until he retired. The average age of the sample is 49 years which, Hugh feels, makes it likely that he will find another full-time job as a chorister:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there’s a lot of discrimination in the profession, it’s something that holds you back in a completely pointless way, what are you supposed to do at 48, give up and never work? Before you’re even heard, you’re told not to bother coming ’cos you’re too old.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being in a full-time professional chorus for many years can have the disadvantage of isolating a singer from the real professional world. After many years in a protected environment, Hugh emerged to find himself in a profession he did not recognise. He feels out of touch and angry with the opera profession for discriminating against him. Professional opera singers are constantly working to high standards with meticulous attention to detail and a need for perfection. Moving out of that professional world puts them in the position of being with people who have different musical ideas and standards. Some of these difficulties are expressed by Beth:
<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t teach, didn’t want to get into any of the lower-class stuff that I’d done before, really didn’t like the thought of the ‘local pros’ (<italic>professionals</italic>) so to speak. I’m far too snobby for that and my standards are too high.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beth contextualises these differences in terms of class and needs to feel superior to the local musicians in her community. Without the status of full-time employment it is difficult for Beth to retain the ‘specialness’ that she feels separates a professional singer from her amateur counterparts. This extract highlights the isolation Beth feels in a non-professional world as well as her need for status and recognition. Like Beth, Fiona also makes clear divisions between herself as a professional singer and the amateur singers in her new environment but the amateur singers do not appear to be aware of this division:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everybody’s desperate for me to join the church choir but they don’t understand it’s such a specialised job, such a specialised world and there’s absolutely no way. I can switch off and listen but if I was there I’d be wanting to fix their vowels and things. To actually sit in amongst them, it would affect my professional ear.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beth and Fiona have built up a clear division of class between themselves and their amateur counterparts based the level of expertise required to work in a professional company. Although neither is directly involved in the profession, they still see association with amateurs as being degrading. Because Beth and Fiona no longer work for a prestigious company their professional status cannot be justified but their musical values and expectations remain unchanged. Redundancy has created an imbalance between what Beth and Fiona ‘feel they are’ and what they are ‘able to be’. A common thread throughout this theme appears to be the confusion experienced regarding group inclusion. All the participants had spent many years being part of the professional singing community and they assumed values appropriate to that group. These included factors such as status, high musical expectations and secure work in return for personal commitment. Redundancy meant that membership of the professional community could no longer be endorsed in the same way. There is a sense with all the participants that they are experiencing rejection from one group and are unable to find a replacement. A fragmentation of self appears to take place which may be just one stage in renegotiating a sense of self.</p>

<title>The new self</title>
<p>This theme explores the changing attitudes towards self, singing and work necessary for a redefinition of self. The title of ‘opera singer’ had been a means of self-definition for all the participants for many years. Because none of the participants had found alternative full-time employment within the operatic profession, this definition of self was no longer easy to validate. Under discussion is the extent to which the participants were able to re-evaluate the role of work and singing in order to rationalise the changes in their lives. Margaret deliberately chose to prioritise other areas in her life when she decided to act as a carer for her elderly parents:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve only got a certain amount of time with my family and my father needs me right now so I, I guess in some ways I have left singing behind a little because it’s not taking priority any more, now I’m caring for him (<italic>her father</italic>), whereas it was some years ago when I was working full-time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Margaret feels needed by her parents which may compensate for her feeling of not being needed by the opera profession. Although the role of carer may give her renewed feelings of self-worth she has also made a conscious attempt to reduce the importance of singing in her life. In contrast Fiona has rediscovered the importance of singing in her life:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like the final brick in the wall has been put in, socially I’m alright now, I can speak to anybody, I’m singing a lot better than I used to because it’s not as important, I don’t mean I don’t take it seriously, I do it purely artistically. I’ve proved myself now I know I can do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fiona seems to be more settled with herself and her achievements and feels a completeness of self. She is able to move forward and develop herself and her singing because she has re-evaluated what it means to her. Instead of it being a tool for her work which required a constant drive for excellence, Fiona is now able to enjoy singing because it is only a part of her life and not her whole life. It is as if Fiona felt there was something missing in her life when she was singing and the final brick represents the end of that quest or perhaps the start of a new cycle of self-development. In the following extract Andy emphasises his need to take personal control over the direction of his life after the lack of control induced by redundancy:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m in the second year of conducting the Bach choir and that’s great for me, I choose the programme and I can drive it the way I want, I conduct the performance and it’s really good for me as a way of expressing myself. I’m very comfortable with the space the conductor occupies, I’m more comfortable with performing now than I’ve ever been.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a strong sense of agency as Andy lists the number of ways he has taken charge of his life. Taking on the role of a conductor provides Andy with another performing arena but one where he is in sole control. However, it is possible that the sentiments expressed in this extract are coping strategies to hide deeper feelings of loss for his singing career rather than being indicative of forming a new identity as a conductor.</p>
<p>Moira’s initial enthusiasm for gardening was soon replaced by a need to continue singing. Despite enjoying the attention of being the only opera singer on the gardening course, she realised she still needed to use her voice for personal expression:
<disp-quote>
<p>I realised how much I missed it and I didn’t have any avenues to fill what it was I was missing as a performer. I wouldn’t call myself a gardener, I know a bit about plants, but I can sing, I have a voice, why should I let it go and not use it?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moira provides another example of the ‘oscillation’ (described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435729">Stroebe &amp; Schut, 1999</xref>) between confronting and avoiding loss. There is a marked contrast to the animated account she previously gave of the gardening course and the almost deflated way in which she now says ‘I know a bit about plants<italic>’.</italic> The experience of another profession makes her more aware of the part played by singing in her life rather than diminishing it. This need is sufficient motivation to accept the insecurity of occasional freelance work. However, in her next extract Moira has re-evaluated the role of singing yet again:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if singing has quite the same effect on me that it used to and I think that’s quite a good thing ’cos you’re not holding on to that one thing . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Returning to the company without full-time status has again changed Moira’s perception of singing. She realises the fragility of committing solely to her singing, or perhaps to one company. Moira fluctuates between minimising what singing means to her and elevating its status. Her story highlights a commonality between all of the participants, which is that the embedded vocal instrument cannot be ignored when re-defining the self.</p>
<p>Hugh is the only participant who feels that he has experienced change with the minimum of disruption. He continued to accept a large amount of freelance work from the company who made him redundant:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the people who were responsible for the redundancies have gone now so I don’t mind working for the company, from a selfish reason it benefits me . . . You can’t go round being an angry young man all the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Anger was a predominant feature throughout Hugh’s account particularly with regard to age. He now seems to have reconciled this anger but he has redirected his loyalty away from the company towards his own personal needs to sing and earn a living. At the opposite end of the transition spectrum is Helen who is the only participant yet to make any psychological progress towards coming to terms with the loss of her job. The following statement shows the extent of her loss:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think I’ll ever heal until I sing again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Helen still experiences enormous personal damage as a result of the redundancy. She sees the ‘loss’ of her voice as an injury or a sickness that can only be cured by using it again but the psychological impact of redundancy prevents this. Helen’s comment encapsulates the uniqueness of the human voice. It is an agent to restore well-being as well as a medium through which disruption and insecurity are experienced.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper has examined the meaning of job loss for seven opera choristers. The data presented in this paper highlight the social readjustment undergone in order for them to re-evaluate expectations, ambitions and general life assumptions. Much of the job loss literature is based on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1029864911435729">Leanal and Feldman (1990)</xref> term a ‘deprivation model’, which focuses on the loss of desired activities, personal status, structures and meanings in the lives of individuals. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1029864911435729">Charmaz (1983)</xref> with chronically ill people suggests that loss of self occurs when these experiences and meanings are no longer available. She proposes that former self-images crumble away without the development of equally valued new ones. However, it is perhaps the individual’s perception of these various losses that shape subsequent social readjustment. This can be clearly seen in Helen who sees herself as being injured through redundancy and unable to adapt. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864911435729">Smith et al. (2009)</xref> point out that although experience is personally situated it is also connected to more worldly phenomena. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864911435729">Ketokivi (2010)</xref> argues that seeing experience as solely limited to the individual does not take into account the individual’s relations to others. This has particular relevance for singers who rely on the social and professional evaluations of others when they form a sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435729">Oakland, MacDonald, &amp; Flowers, 2009</xref>). However, formation of self in this manner can be fragile, as shown by Hugh’s perception of professional evaluations made by age rather than individual ability. This study has found that the individual’s relationship to singing and the voice is highly influential in determining the experience of transition. Helen needs to sing before she can heal but Moira struggles between prioritising her need to sing and minimising its importance. Beth and Fiona may have felt isolated from others in their new environment because of the specialness they attributed to their singing, whereas Andy appears to distance himself from singing. The only participants to talk about significant others in their lives were Margaret and Fiona. Both coped with the initial impact of job loss by withdrawing from singing in order to give priority to family needs but ultimately cannot ignore the desire to sing. Although singing is a commonality for all the participants, adaptation to loss of professional work is individual: Fiona and Andy were able to perceive job loss as an opportunity. Clinicians and researchers have adopted the term Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) to describe the process by which individuals grow beyond their pre-trauma level of functioning and can gain a better level of psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1029864911435729">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>). There is now an increasing body of research addressing the more positive aspects of psychological change following job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1029864911435729">Payne &amp; Arroba, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864911435729">Shakespeare-Finch &amp; Copping, 2006</xref>) and traumatic experience in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1029864911435729">Bonanno, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1029864911435729">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864911435729">McMillen (1999</xref>, p. 459) states that trauma may be a wake-up call to some people, signalling that it is time to make significant changes in their lives. This is particularly apparent in Fiona’s references to the light-bulb.</p>
<p>A theory which integrates post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic growth is the OVP devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1029864911435729">Joseph and Linley (2005)</xref>. They explain the process involved in making sense of traumatic experiences in terms of assimilation and accommodation (loosely adapted from the developmental theory of Piaget). The OVP theory gives emphasis to the differences in personality and the social environments of bereaved individuals when processing trauma information. Assimilation is the process of restoring established world views, often done by minimising the impact of the trauma information. Accommodation can take a positive or negative form but is concerned with the development of new world views. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1029864911435729">Payne, Joseph &amp; Tudway (2007)</xref> studied thirteen trauma victims to test the OVP theory. They found that most participants attempted to assimilate trauma information by negating or minimising trauma information, possibly because it was the quickest and easiest option, whereas relinquishing existing beliefs is a more frightening challenge. They also point out that accommodation and assimilation can be a dynamic process that involves fluctuations between attempts to restore existing values and actively looking to change them. The findings of this paper resonate with the findings of Payne et al. The trauma of job loss has initiated a change for all the participants in their relationship to singing, which either opened up new areas of opportunity or efforts to restore the role of singing but under different circumstances. At the time of the interviews, Beth, Helen and Andy were none of them singing in a professional capacity. Beth and Andy appear to see this as an opportunity to develop new areas of self. However Helen seems to experience a loss of self with no new areas of value to take its place (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1029864911435729">Charmaz, 1983</xref>). Hugh, Margaret, Moira and Fiona are still singing in various freelance capacities but have nevertheless renegotiated the role of singing in their lives. For Fiona singing has ultimately become more important because it is no longer her main source of income. Hugh’s decision to stay with the company on a freelance basis would appear to be an attempt to assimilate the information acquired through redundancy. In practical terms he is able to retain his social environment but he has redirected his priorities away from company loyalty to personal needs. Moira and Margaret shift between various phases of accommodation and assimilation. Moira dealt with redundancy by immediately committing herself to a new direction. She then realised that the strength of her feelings for singing had not diminished and she needed to sing regardless of the insecurity. However, once back within her old company she began to minimise the importance of singing in her life. Similarly Margaret initially looked to a new role as a carer but eventually returned to freelance work. Again this may reflect a need to sing professionally regardless of the insecurity. It could also signify a change in her attitude towards singing full-time for a company in a situation where she feels she has little control over her life. These interpretations are cautious and are based on the information received from the participants during the interviews. In accordance with the dynamic process of accommodation and assimilation, it is likely that further fluctuations may occur during the process of adapting to enforced career disruption.</p>

<title>Conclusion and wider implications</title>
<p>This paper has highlighted the grieving experiences that are a part of coping with the loss of self brought about by redundancy. The data has shown that grief is individually orientated but that redundancy can lead to positive growth if the individual is able to create new opportunities for self-development. Feelings of loss and bereavement can be experienced by employees in all walks of life who are faced with redundancy. However, this study shows that understanding the transitional experiences of the seven opera choristers primarily requires an understanding of their relationship with professional singing and the embodied voice. Common to all the participants is the need to re-evaluate the role of singing as an agent in the formation of self. Issues raised in this study may have similarities with dancers and athletes who also need to understand the role of the body when coping with career transition. However, unlike the music profession, sport and dance have recognised systems in place to guide individuals through the inevitable transition. Career transition is now a fundamental issue for music world-wide. Career trajectories for musicians of the future may need to give greater attention to subjective career values in order to deal with the pressures of a profession in deepening economic crisis. As researchers we have an obligation to strive for a greater understanding of the issues that are specific to musicians when faced with major professional disruption.</p>
<sec id="section13-1029864911435729">
<title>Research considerations</title>
<p>In keeping with the principles of IPA, interpretation of the data is cautious and an attempt by the authors to offer a perspective on the phenomena of which the participant may not be consciously aware (see Smith et al. p.23). The account presented is intended to be credible but not the only credible one. In the interests of clarity, each participant was asked if they would like to revisit their interview data in the light of researcher analysis. Only one participant accepted this offer. Therefore a decision was made not to use the participants as a form of triangulation. The research takes no account of the temporal issues which may be involved in career transition. Beth, Andy and Fiona were made redundant three years before the other participants and appear to have reached a more stable point in the transition process. A longitudinal study may shed more light on the relationship between time and the experience of career transition.</p>
