<abstract>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT), opioids and the dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of panic disorder. In order to study 5-HT–opioid interaction, the opioid antagonist naloxone was injected either systemically (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or intra-DPAG (0.2 μg/0.5 μL) to assess its interference with the effect of chronic fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 21 days) or of intra-DPAG 5-HT (8 μg/0.5 μL). Drug effects were measured in the one-escape task of the rat elevated T-maze, an animal model of panic. Pretreatment with systemic naloxone antagonized the lengthening of escape latency caused by chronic fluoxetine, considered a panicolytic-like effect that parallels the drug’s therapeutic response in the clinics. Pretreatment with naloxone injected intra-DPAG antagonized both the panicolytic effect of chronic fluoxetine as well as that of 5-HT injected intra-DPAG. Neither the performance of the inhibitory avoidance task in the elevated T-maze, a model of generalized anxiety nor locomotion measured in a circular arena was affected by the above drug treatments. These results indicate that the panicolytic effect of fluoxetine is mediated by endogenous opioids that are activated by 5-HT in the DPAG. They also allow reconciliation between the serotonergic and opioidergic hypotheses of panic disorder pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by the repeated occurrence of spontaneous panic attacks (PAs), followed by chronic anxiety about having another attack and by avoidance of places where having an attack is embarrassing. The PA is a period of intense fear that peaks in less than 10 minutes from symptom onset, and usually subsides within 30 minutes. At least four of 13 symptoms, such as palpitation, sweating, trembling and fear of losing control or going crazy, are required to occur. During the attack, patients often have an urge to flee or escape and a sense of impending doom, as though they are dying from suffocation or a heart attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111434619">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A key issue is why panic patients are vulnerable to PAs and healthy individuals are not. Two neurochemical explanations have been advanced so far: the opioidergic and the serotonergic hypotheses, respectively. The first assumes that panic patients have a deficient opioid mechanism that normally restrains the onset of PAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111434619">Preter and Klein, 2008</xref>). This hypothesis is an amplification of the false suffocation alarm theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111434619">Klein, 1993</xref>) and is supported by the results of clinical assays showing that naloxone renders healthy individuals susceptible to lactate-induced PAs, as panic patients usually are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111434619">Preter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111434619">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>). However, this theory did not localize the assumed deficit in opioid-mediated neurotransmission in specific brain areas.</p>
<p>The serotonergic hypothesis stems from the proposal that serotonin (5-HT) restrains PAs by inhibiting neurons localized in the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter (DPAG) of the midbrain, which commands defence reactions that cope with proximal threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111434619">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>). A preclinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111434619">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) has shown that rats that were chronically infused with the GABA synthesis inhibitor l-allylglycine through a minipump placed into the dorsomedial hypothalamus became responsive to lactate, in contrast to controls that were similarly infused with the inactive enantiomer, d-allylglycine. Anatomical analysis showed that lactate increased c-Fos expression in serotonergic neurons located in the ventrolateral part of the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) of control, but not panic-prone, rats. The distribution of lactate-sensitive serotonergic neurons in control rats overlaps the set of neurons activated by stressful situations, which project to both the DPAG and sympathomotor control areas of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. The former projection is thought to inhibit the behavioural responses and the latter the neurovegetative changes evoked by lactate in panic-prone rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111434619">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111434619">Johnson et al. (2008)</xref> have hypothesized that such serotonergic neurons normally limit neurovegetative and behavioural responses to innocuous interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, and that dysfunction of this serotonergic system increases vulnerability to PAs in animals as well as humans.</p>
<p>Pertinent questions are whether the above hypotheses are related, that is, whether the assumed opioidergic and serotonergic mechanisms that control PAs somehow interact, and where in the brain this interplay would take place. The present experiments were designed to answer these questions. As tools we used an animal model of panic, the rat elevated T-maze (ETM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111434619">Graeff et al., 1993</xref>), the prototypical panicolytic agent fluoxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111434619">Tiller et al., 1999</xref>) and the classical opioid antagonist naloxone.</p>
<p>The ETM has one arm enclosed by walls perpendicular to two open arms of equal dimensions all elevated from the ground. Two tasks are performed by the same rat on the ETM: inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape. For the first one, the rat is placed at the distal end of the enclosed arm and the time to withdraw from this arm with the four paws is measured in three successive trials. For the escape task, the rat is placed at the end of one of the open arms and the withdrawal latency is measured three times. Pharmacological validation has shown that the drug profile of inhibitory avoidance is similar to that of generalized or anticipatory anxiety, while the drug response of escape is akin to that of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111434619">Pinheiro et al., 2007</xref>). As a consequence, the ETM is considered a sound animal model of both anxiety and panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111434619">Graeff and Del Ben, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>). Regarding panic, performance of the one-way escape in the ETM has been shown to be impaired by several antidepressant drugs following chronic, but not acute, administration, paralleling the therapeutic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111434619">Pinheiro et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, fluoxetine has been shown to increase escape latency without affecting inhibitory avoidance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111434619">Zanoveli et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111434619">2010</xref>), and this panicolytic-like effect is likely to be mediated by 5-HT, since fluoxetine has been shown to increase extracellular 5-HT in the DPAG, measured by microdialysis, and its effect on ETM escape to be antagonized by intra-PAG injection of a selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111434619">Zanoveli et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the first experiment was to verify whether systemically administered naloxone would be able to antagonize the panicolytic effect of fluoxetine, daily administered for 21 days, in the ETM one-escape task. Once this result was obtained, the next step was to investigate whether intracerebral administration of naloxone inside the DPAG would similarly antagonize the panicolytic effect of chronic fluoxetine, which would localize the drug action in this brain structure. Since the expected result was obtained, the final step was to explore 5-HT mediation, by examining whether the panicolytic effect of 5-HT, directly injected into the DPAG, would be antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone administered through the same route.</p>

<sec id="section3-0269881111434619">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male Wistar rats (State University of Maringá) weighing 230–300 g were housed in groups of five per cage in Plexiglas-walled cages in a room maintained at 22 ± 1°C, with an alternating 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00), and with free access to food and water except during testing. The experimental procedures adopted had been approved by the State University of Maringá Committee of Ethical Conduct in the Use of Animals in Experiments (072/2010-CEAE) and follow the Biomedical Research Involving Animals (CIMS) recommendations (Geneva, 1985).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881111434619">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>The following drugs were used: fluoxetine hydrochloride (EMS, Brazil), 5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulphate (5-HT, Sigma) and naloxone hydrochloride (Hipolabor, Brazil). Fluoxetine was dissolved in a solution containing saline with 2% Tween 80. The control group was given saline with 2% Tween 80 (vehicle). All drugs were freshly prepared, 30 min before the injections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881111434619">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The ETM is made of wood and has three arms of equal dimensions (50 cm × 12 cm). One arm, enclosed by 40 cm high walls, is perpendicular to two opposed open arms. To avoid falls, the open arms are surrounded by a 1 cm high Plexiglas rim. The whole apparatus is elevated 50 cm above the floor. Locomotion was measured inside a wooden circular arena (60 cm × 60 cm) with 30 cm high walls. Brightness at the level of the maze arms and arena centre was 60 lux.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111434619">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Rats were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (45 mg/kg, i.p.) associated with local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. For microinjections, a stainless-steel guide cannula (12 mm long; outer and inner diameter 0.6 and 0.4 mm, respectively) was implanted 1.4 mm above the DPAG. The stereotaxic coordinates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111434619">Paxinos and Watson (1997)</xref> with reference to bregma were: posterior = −6.6 mm, lateral = 2.0 mm, and deep = 3.6 mm, at an angle of 22°. The guide cannula was fixed to the skull with acrylic resin and one stainless-steel screw. The cannula was sealed with a stainless-steel wire to avoid obstruction. To prevent infection, at the end of the surgery all animals were injected (i.m.) with 0.2 mL pentabiotic preparation (Fort Dodge, Brazil). The surgery for guide cannula implantation was performed seven days before the ETM test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881111434619">
<title>Microinjection of drugs</title>
<p>For drug injection, a needle (0.3 mm outer diameter) was introduced through the guide cannula until its tip was 2 mm below the cannula end. A volume of 0.5 µL was injected over a period of 3 min (0.17 μL/min) using a 10 mL microsyringe (Hamilton 701-RN, USA) attached to a microinfusion pump. The displacement of an air bubble inside the polyethylene catheter connecting the syringe needle to the intracerebral needle was used to monitor the microinjection. The needle was removed 1 min after the injection was finished.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881111434619">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Before acute drug treatment, the animals were gently handled for 5 min and, 24 h later, pre-exposed to one of the open arms of the ETM for 30 min. A wooden barrier mounted between the central area of the maze and the proximal end of the arm closed the open arm exit. It has been shown that such pre-exposure makes the escape task more sensitive to antipanic drugs, as it shortens the withdrawal latencies from the open arm during the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111434619">Teixeira et al., 2000</xref>). The ETM test was performed 24 h later. For chronic treatment, the animals were injected daily during 21 days with drug or vehicle, on the 20th day were pre-exposed to the open arm of the ETM, as described, and on the 21st day performed the ETM test.</p>
<p>The ETM test was initiated by the inhibitory avoidance task. For this, each animal was placed at the distal end of the enclosed arm of the ETM facing the intersection. The time taken by the rat to leave this arm with four paws was recorded (baseline latency). This measurement was repeated in two subsequent trials (avoidances 1 and 2) at 30-s intervals. Thirty seconds after the last avoidance trial, the rat was placed at the end of the open arm it had been previously exposed to, and the latency to leave this arm with four paws was recorded in three consecutive trials (escapes 1, 2, and 3) at 30-s intervals. A cut-off time of 300 s was established for the avoidance and the escape latency. Thirty seconds after being tested in the ETM, the animal was placed inside the circular arena for 5 min to evaluate locomotion. The total distance travelled was analysed by a video tracking system (Ethovision, Noldus, The Netherlands).</p>
<sec id="section9-0269881111434619">
<title>Experiment 1: association of fluoxetine with systemic naloxone</title>
<p>Rats were daily injected, i.p., with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, 1 mL/kg) or vehicle solution for 21 consecutive days. On the 21st day, animals were tested in both the ETM and the circular arena. After randomization, rats were administered, i.p., with naloxone (1 mg/kg) or saline 10 min before fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Thus, the following groups were formed: saline/vehicle (<italic>n</italic> = 8), naloxone/vehicle (<italic>n</italic> = 6), saline/fluoxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and naloxone/fluoxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 6). After 30 min from the last injection of fluoxetine or vehicle solution, animals were submitted to the ETM test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881111434619">
<title>Experiment 2: association of fluoxetine with intracerebral naloxone</title>
<p>Rats were daily injected, i.p., with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, 1mL/kg) or vehicle solution for 21 consecutive days. On the 21st day, animals were tested in both the ETM and the circular arena. After randomization, 10 min before the last injection of fluoxetine or vehicle solution, animals were injected intra-DPAG with naloxone (0.2 µg/0.5 μL) or saline, forming the following groups: saline intra-DPAG/vehicle i.p. (<italic>n</italic> = 9), naloxone intra-DPAG/vehicle i.p. (<italic>n</italic> = 9), saline intra-DPAG/fluoxetine i.p. (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and naloxone intra-DPAG/fluoxetine i.p. (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Thirty minutes after the last injection of fluoxetine or vehicle (40 min after intracerebral injection), animals were submitted to the ETM test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881111434619">
<title>Experiment 3: association of intracerebral serotonin with intracerebral naloxone</title>
<p>Rats were injected intra-DPAG with naloxone (0.2 µg/0.5 μL) or saline 10 min before intra-DPAG injection of 5-HT (8 μg/0.5 μL) or saline. Thus, the following groups were formed: saline/saline (<italic>n</italic> = 6), naloxone/saline (<italic>n</italic> = 7), saline/5-HT (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and naloxone/5-HT (<italic>n</italic> = 8). After 10 min from the last injection, animals were submitted to the ETM test.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269881111434619">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>After testing, animals were anaesthetized with thiopental (Cristália, Brazil) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with 0.9% saline followed by 10% formalin solution. Afterwards, 0.2 mL of methylene blue (2%) was microinjected into the DPAG to mark the site of drug injection. Brains were removed from the skull and maintained in 10% formalin. Serial 60-µm brain coronal sections were cut on a cryostat, mounted on gelatine-coated slides and stained. Only animals with injection sites located inside the DPAG were included in the statistical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269881111434619">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was used to analyse both avoidance and escape data. Pre-treatment and treatment were the independent factors and trials (baseline, avoidances 1 and 2, and escapes 1–3) the repeated measures. When appropriate, the Fisher post-hoc test was used. Locomotion data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Fisher post-hoc test. Significance level was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111434619">Zanoveli et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111434619">2010</xref>), the present results show that chronic administration (21 days) of fluoxetine impairs the performance of one-escape in the ETM. Since the pharmacological profile of this task correlates with clinical drug response, it is considered a well validated animal model of panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111434619">Pinheiro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111434619">Graeff and Del Ben, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the observed increase of escape latency caused by chronic fluoxetine on ETM escape may be interpreted as a panicolytic effect.</p>
<p>The present results further show that pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone, given systemically, antagonizes the panicolytic effect of chronic fluoxetine. This indicates that the antipanic action of this drug is mediated by the activation of endogenous opioids. This suggestion concurs with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111434619">Preter and Klein’s (2008)</xref> proposal that an endogenous opioidergic mechanism restrains panic attacks in healthy individuals, which is defective in panic patients. A key evidence supporting this argument is the verification that naloxone renders healthy volunteers vulnerable to lactate-induced panic attacks, as panic patients usually are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111434619">Preter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111434619">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>). Within this perspective, the present results indicate that the therapeutic effect of antidepressants may be due to restoration of the faulty opioidergic inhibition of brain mechanisms that trigger the panic attack.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a considerable body of human and animal studies implicates the DPAG in panic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111434619">Del-Ben and Graeff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>) and indicates that 5-HT restrains panic attacks by inhibiting neuronal networks of the DPAG that orchestrate defensive reactions that cope with impending danger stimuli or situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111434619">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111434619">Graeff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111434619">Graeff and Del-Ben, 2008</xref>). In particular, chronic administration of fluoxetine as well as of several other antidepressants, including the benzodiazepine agent alprazolam, has been shown to make 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors of the DPAG more responsive to selective receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>). In addition, chronic fluoxetine has been shown to increase 5-HT release into the extracellular space in the DPAG, and its panicolytic effect in the ETM was blocked by a selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor blocker injected into the DPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111434619">Zanoveli et al., 2010</xref>). This led to the suggestion that antidepressant drugs restrain panic attacks by enhancing the inhibitory function of 5-HT on DPAG neurons that control proximal defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a deficit of 5-HT inhibition on DPAG neurons responsible for the behavioural manifestations of panic, as well as on sympathomotor neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla that engender the neurovegative changes of the panic attack, has been suggested to be responsible for the vulnerability of panic patients to spontaneous attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111434619">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>If the above argument is correct, injection of naloxone into the DPAG should antagonize the effect of systemically administered, chronic fluoxetine, as well as of 5-HT itself, injected directly into the DPAG. Both predictions have been fulfilled by the present results showing, first, that the lengthening of escape latency in the ETM caused by chronic fluoxetine was attenuated following the intra-DPAG injection of naloxone, and second, that the same pretreatment with intracerebral naloxone reduced the anti-escape effect of intra-DPAG 5-HT in the ETM. Although escape in the elevated T-maze has been pharmacologically validated as an animal model of panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111434619">Graeff, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111434619">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111434619">Graeff and Zangrossi Jr, 2010</xref>), these results should be replicated with other panic models, such as for example the electrical stimulation of the DPAG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111434619">Schenberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The drug effects presently observed on escape from the open arm of the ETM were specific to this task. No drug treatment used affected the performance of the inhibitory avoidance, which is viewed as a model of generalized or anticipatory anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111434619">Pinheiro et al., 2007</xref>). Neither are the drug-induced changes in escape latency likely to be due to unspecific motor effects, since the same drug treatments failed to significantly affect locomotion, measured in the circular arena.</p>
<p>Overall, the above-discussed evidence indicates that the panicolytic effect of antidepressants is mediated by 5-HT-induced activation of opioidergic mechanisms that restrain panic attacks in the DPAG. In this regard, the injection of morphine into the DPAG has been shown to attenuate defensive behaviour in the elevated plus-maze at lower doses, an effect antagonized by naloxone, but to increase fear-like responses at higher doses, probably by stimulation of receptors resistant to naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111434619">Anseloni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111434619">Motta and Brandão, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research is needed to identify the cellular and molecular substrate of the 5-HT–opioid interaction that is supposed to take place in the DPAG. Nevertheless, there are some clues that are worth mentioning. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111434619">Preter and Klein (2008)</xref> have remarked that only a high dose of naloxone (2 mg/kg) was able to potentiate the panic-inducing effect of lactate in healthy volunteers, and since naloxone blocks the μ opioid receptor at lower concentrations than those needed to block the δ receptor, they suggested that the δ receptors were chiefly involved in the panic-buffering action of endogenous opioids. In this regard, the endogenous opioid encephalin has a higher affinity for δ as compared μ opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111434619">Wolozin and Pasternak, 1981</xref>), and an interaction between this endogenous opioid and 5-HT has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111434619">Xuan et al. (1986)</xref>. As in the present study, their results show that the antinociceptive effect induced by 5-HT microinjected into the nucleus accumbens was blocked by naloxone preinjected into the same site. In contrast, it was verified that the antinociception elicited by intra-accumbens injection of [d-Ala2, d-Leu5]enkephalin was not affected by cinanserin, a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist. Since enkephalinergic nerve fibres are present in the area, they suggested that 5-HT activates an enkephalinergic mechanism within the nucleus acumbens, resulting in the antinociceptive effect. Therefore, enkephalin may be worthy of exploring as a possible mediator of the assumed 5-HT panicolytic action in the DPAG.</p>
<p>At a broader, conceptual level, the present findings allow reconciliation between the serotonin hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111434619">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>) and the opioid theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111434619">Preter and Klein, 2008</xref>) of panic pathophysiology, the DPAG being the fulcrum of 5-HT–opioid interaction in the regulation of panic.</p>
<p>As to clinical implications, therapeutic use of opiates in long-term treatment is problematic, due to abuse liability. Nevertheless, mixed agonist–antagonist compounds or selective δ-receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111434619">Broom et al., 2002</xref>) may be worth investigating for either alternative or coadjuvant treatment of PD.</p>
