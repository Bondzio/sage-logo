<p>An understandable first reaction to perusing Linda Putnam’s vita leads to the inevitable question, “My god, does this woman ever sleep?” But more thoughtful scrutiny by the organizational communication reader should leave one with a profound sense of gratitude. It wasn’t so very long ago that the field of organizational communication was still in its nascent stages. As the communication field struggled for legitimacy as this odd hybrid of social science and humanities, the subdiscipline of organizational communication was no exception. Part of the “legitimacy” question for organizational communication involved developing a distinctive lens. Part of it also involved engaging other scholars throughout the organizational sciences whose work could be informed by what we do. In writing this, I do not mean to suggest that we no longer struggle with legitimacy issues. I do mean to suggest that Linda Putnam has been our field’s chief ambassador for some time now, and she has been most effective in quelling legitimacy concerns with her keen intellect and excellent research, her brokering of interdisciplinary collaborations in which communication faculty figure prominently—and, if I’m being totally honest, no small amount of personal charm. I also mean to suggest that she has been playing an instrumental role in helping organizational communication scholars craft a distinctive lens and that <italic>Management Communication Quarterly</italic> has been her touchstone, her scholarly home.</p>
<p>To begin, Linda has had a long-standing interest in conflict and negotiation research. In fact, many readers may know that in 2010, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association for Conflict Management, an interdisciplinary group of scholars and practitioners dedicated to understanding conflict in family, organizational, societal, and international settings. Perhaps less well known is that Linda was the first special issues editor for <italic>MCQ</italic>, which involved a review and critique of five instruments for measuring conflict and conflict management styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912451430">Putnam, 1988</xref>). In this special issue, she articulated the centrality of a communication perspective to the study of conflict and, along with Mark Knapp and Lillian Davis, set a bold agenda for conflict research in terms of the study of <italic>actual</italic> conflict and negotiation interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912451430">Knapp, Putnam, &amp; Davis, 1988</xref>). It is a lens that dominates conflict research to this date. She was at the forefront of this movement with her interactional coding of bargaining processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912451430">Putnam, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912451430">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Jones, 1982a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912451430">1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Wilson, 1989</xref>), and she continues to lead this area with more recent work in negotiation discourse, framing, and dialectics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912451430">Putnam, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912451430">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912451430">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912451430">2010</xref>). Over the years, she has also had a number of interdisciplinary collaborations in the conflict arena, including one with Deborah Kolb of Simmons College and The Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School on the role of gender in negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912451430">Kolb &amp; Putnam, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912451430">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912451430">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912451430">2006</xref>), and the role of framing in environmental dispute resolution with management scholars, Roy Lewicki and Barbara Grey, and organizational communication scholar, Boris Brummans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912451430">Brummans et al., 2008</xref>). The latter collaboration was not only funded by NSF but also received the 2008 Article of the Year Award from NCA’s Organizational Communication division and the 2009 Outstanding Article Award from ICA.</p>
<p>Her interest in interaction processes led quite naturally to an interest in organizational discourse, which began to take shape in the 1980-1990s. There, too, she would go on to establish a beachhead for organizational communication in the organizational sciences. It all started with her edited book with Mike Pacanowsky in 1983, <italic>Communication and Organization: An Interpretive Perspective</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Pacanowsky, 1983</xref>). As other authors have written about in this tribute, this groundbreaking volume (and the conversations at Alta that started it) altered the course of organizational communication with its challenge to functionalism as this paved the way for more qualitative and interpretive discourse analyses. However, the growing prominence of organizational discourse study really became apparent when, as one of the editors of <italic>The Handbook of Organizational Communication</italic> (along with the late Fred Jablin), Linda had the idea to devote a chapter to surveying the wide range of interdisciplinary approaches (including communication) doing discourse analysis in and about organizations at the time; I was fortunate to have been invited on as her coauthor as it is heavily cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Fairhurst, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter in 2004, she began an interdisciplinary collaboration with European and Australasian management scholars David Grant, Cynthia Hardy, and Cliff Oswick to edit <italic>The Sage Handbook of Organizational Discourse Analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912451430">Grant, Hardy, Oswick, &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>). Her influence is apparent given the number of organizational communication scholars who wrote chapters for this interdisciplinary and international volume: Ashcraft, Cheney, Conrad, Cooren, Deetz (with Anderson and Broadfoot), Mumby, and myself. Then in 2005, she was the lead editor for another special issue of <italic>MCQ</italic>, this time on discourse and resistance, which featured both management and communication scholars, including an article by Kevin Real and herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912451430">Real &amp; Putnam, 2005</xref>). This latter work marked a growing interest of hers (and organizational discourse analysts more generally) in exploring the tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes of organizational life through discursive means. Finally, in 2011, she again collaborated with Grant and Hardy for the <italic>Sage Major Works Organizational Discourse</italic> series where, in keeping with the <italic>Handbook of Organizational Discourse Analysis</italic>, the work of several of the above-named organizational communication scholars can also be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912451430">Grant, Hardy, &amp; Putnam, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, I do not think it is possible to overestimate the influence Linda Putnam has had in establishing strong international and interdisciplinary ties between the discourse researchers in management and organizational communication. Moreover, in the same way that she has used her voice to set an agenda for conflict studies with the help of <italic>MCQ</italic>, she has done the same with discourse studies (and resistance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912451430">Putnam, Grant, Michelson, &amp; Cutcher, 2005</xref>) and its cousin, the communicative constitution of organizations (CCO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Nicotera, 2009</xref>); the latter I leave to others to discuss. Suffice it to say that her interdisciplinary collaborations have both informed and are informed by her writing and agenda setting in <italic>MCQ</italic>.</p>
<p>Given all of her international connections and numerous opportunities to lecture around the world, Linda is often called upon to address nascent organizational communication movements in other countries. One such engagement resulted in an <italic>MCQ Forum</italic> on Brazil with Linda and a number of scholars from that country reflecting on the challenges ahead for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912451430">Putnam &amp; Casali, 2009</xref>). In reading this work, I was struck by how many times she has told the story of organizational communication as a subdiscipline of the field of communication. I was also struck by how often she has told it in <italic>MCQ</italic> through the special issues (reviewed above) and invited commentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912451430">Putnam, Poole, &amp; Seibold, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Most striking of all, however, is how much her work and interdisciplinary collaborations have played a prominent role in constructing the “org com” narrative. She draws scholars from outside the discipline because of the communication perspective she so richly articulates and, in the process, legitimates. In turn, she draws them to us—and for that, we owe her our abiding gratitude.</p>
