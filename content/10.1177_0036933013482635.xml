<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Implementation of an in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex assay by West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre to improve sample processing means all viral eye swabs are now routinely tested for <italic>Adenovirus, Herpes simplex, Varicella</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0036933013482635">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review of virology results identified 76 <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive patients from 1914 eye swabs (4%) from May 2007 to April 2008. Of these results, 12 originated from Glasgow eye casualty and available clinical notes were cross-referenced with the sexual health network (Sandyford).</p>

<sec id="sec11-0036933013482635">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Identified issues included no documentation of implications of testing, poor communication of positive results and poor referral pathways to sexual health for assessment; all leading to inadequate management. A shared care network was created to address these issues.

<sec id="sec1-0036933013482635" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chlamydial conjunctivitis most commonly presents as a chronic unilateral follicular conjunctivitis, occasionally with atypical features such as peri-limbal infiltrates. Patients with viral conjunctivitis typically attend primary care or ophthalmology with symptoms unresponsive to topical antibiotics. Presumed viral conjunctivitis is not normally investigated for its aetiology unless the symptoms have had a prolonged duration of &gt;2 weeks or if there are atypical clinical features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482635">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482635"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482635">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chlamydial conjunctivitis rates have been shown to correlate with the recent 7% rise in genital <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infections (over 217,000 reported in the UK in 2009).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482635">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482635">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482635"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482635">6</xref></sup> Best management of chlamydial conjunctivitis should include specialist sexual health input, to ensure detection and treatment of genital<italic>Chlamydia</italic>, exclusion of other STI co-infections, completion of partner notification and safer sex advice to prevent re-infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482635">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482635">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482635">5</xref></sup> Genito-urinary carriage of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> D-K is often asymptomatic, but can cause symptomatic infection including conjunctivitis in a sexual partner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482635">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482635">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482635">8</xref></sup> The serovars A–C are responsible for trachoma and do not cause genital infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482635">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In April 2007, the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre upgraded their routine assay for eye swabs to an in-house quadriplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for <italic>Adenovirus, Varicella zoster, Herpes simplex</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>. This was intended to improve the efficiency and accuracy of sample processing. Multiplex PCR assay has been shown to be quick, cost-effective, sensitive and specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482635">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482635"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482635"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482635"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482635">14</xref></sup> However, this quadriplex test meant that eye patients could be unknowingly screened for a sexually transmitted infection and soon there was a complaint from a patient about this. Although the complaint raised awareness of the issue, anecdotal concerns remained about poor sexual health attendance for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive patients identified in eye casualty. We wished to evaluate the impact of this new test and address any other issues indirectly created following the routine implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482635" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Twelve months after the new quadriplex PCR assay was introduced, we performed a retrospective review of the clinical impact of this method of testing, prior to any improvement in the pathway. This audit identified all <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive eye swab results processed at the Specialist Virology Centre from May 2007 to April 2008. We then selected <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive results in adults, which had originated from the Glasgow Eye Casualty Service and reviewed the available clinical notes. The chosen audit standards included documentation of the potential implications of testing, the patient being appropriately contacted following positive results, attendance at sexual health/general practitioner (GP) for assessment, appropriate treatment, complete sexual health screen and sexual contact tracing. Our aim was to compare the recorded clinical management with these locally chosen standards. Our literature search did not identify any articles documenting these problems in ophthalmic practice or any published recommended standards.</p>
<p>The Glasgow Eye Casualty service is based at Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, UK. The West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre processes viral eye swabs from Greater Glasgow, Clyde and other regions in the West of Scotland. The Sandyford Initiative provides specialist sexual health services to the whole population of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (approx. 1 million) and supports all practitioners managing genital <italic>Chlamydia</italic> cases through a Shared Care system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482635" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The Specialist Virology Centre processed 1914 eye swabs in the year following the introduction of the multiplex PCR assay, resulting in 76 <italic>Chlamydia</italic> PCR positive eye swab results, a positive proportion of 4%. There were 20 children &lt;1-month-old with vertically acquired <italic>Chlamydia</italic> among the 25 patients who were aged &lt;16 years. Fifty-one patients were 16 years or older. Twenty-six patients were female and 25 male. The average age of this group was 23 years (range 16–68). About 80% (41 out of 51) of the patients were &lt;25 years of age. These population demographics mirror the national average with similar predominance in the 16- to 25-year-old age group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482635">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482635">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482635">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482635">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerns regarding the multiplex assay revealing dual conjunctival pathology were alleviated, as none of these cases had concurrent positive results. Such situations are rare, but case reports have highlighted the potential for chronic conjunctivitis to have more than one cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482635">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Twelve of the 51 adults originated from the Glasgow Eye Casualty and these were subjected to our audit standards. We were able to obtain nine sets of eye casualty notes. All patients had presented with unilateral follicular conjunctivitis of &gt;2 weeks duration, which had not settled with topical antibiotics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0036933013482635">Table 1</xref> for results). Only three patients (25%) achieved our chosen audit standards. As it was the clinicians’ expectation that these patients would have subsequently attended sexual health services, we sought reasons for this poor outcome.

<sec id="sec4-0036933013482635" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>There was no documentation in any of the ophthalmology notes regarding the implications of testing. This had led to a formal complaint from the family of a young teenaged patient who attended eye casualty and was found to be <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive. This unfortunate scenario was the main catalyst to this study. Poor communication of results to patients was being compounded by poor effectiveness of referral to sexual health services for assessment and subsequent contact tracing. The results of the audit were then presented and discussed by all interested parties in order to develop a protocol to improve the service (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0036933013482635">Table 2</xref>).

</table>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>These issues were addressed by the following three strategies:
<list id="list1-0036933013482635" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Ensure informed consent for testing: all clinicians (including Ophthalmologists) should obtain appropriate consent for testing by informing patients of the routinely tested organisms from eye swabs and the associated implications. All tested patients should receive a Patient Information Sheet explaining the reason for the test, the potential outcomes and details of the Sandyford services. This should reduce any future conflict or shock that the investigation of a minor eye problem can result in the diagnosis of a sexual transmitted infection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improve communication of results with patient: Attempts to re-contact patients with positive results proved difficult, with one-third of patients being unable to be contacted within 1 week. When this occurs, the patient’s GP should be contacted with the result to arrange appropriate follow-up.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improve sexual health referral pathway via designated sexual health advisor: All <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive eye swab results now contain an advice statement suggesting referral to sexual health and are also automatically copied directly from virology to the designated sexual health advisor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482635">Figure 1</xref>). This approach has proved highly effective for managing other sexually transmitted infections within the Greater Glasgow region. The advisor acts as a point of contact between ophthalmology and sexual health for organising follow-up. This shared care arrangement addresses the concerns that ophthalmologists have if their current practice is to defer treatment of this condition to the sexual health team (in order to incentivise the patient to attend follow-up). A teaching session was successfully organised to educate and inform the ophthalmology staff of the sexual health advisor’s role in the shared care network. This was particularly beneficial as a concern had been raised regarding the implications of a positive chlamydial conjunctivitis result in a young person and subsequent medico-legal responsibility of the ophthalmic healthcare professional.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482635">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0036933013482635">18</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig1-0036933013482635" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Example of a chlamydial conjunctivitis positive result with advice from laboratory regarding onward referral to sexual health.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0036933013482635-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<sec id="sec5-0036933013482635"><title>Impact of new protocol</title>
<p>The re-audit from January to June 2010 identified seven <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive swab results in 6 months. All patients had chronic unilateral follicular conjunctivitis. All had documentation of pre-swab consent and were given a patient information leaflet. Five out of seven had been contactable and referred to the Sandyford. The sexual health advisor had received copy reports of all these positive results. The three patients who attended for sexual health screening were found to be <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive at other sites and received appropriate treatment and contact tracing. The GPs of those who did not attend sexual health were all contacted as per protocol. Treatment regimens used included single-dose azithromycin or 2 weeks of doxycycline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482635">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0036933013482635"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0036933013482635">21</xref></sup> It was noted that those who received treatment by the ophthalmologist were still less likely to attend follow-up. This reinforced our belief that such patients require the incentive of treatment to encourage them to attend the sexual health services.</p>
<p>Although this study only specifically evaluated 19 cases, we believe that documenting the issues that our large regional centre has faced and addressed should enhance the ongoing debate regarding the best management of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. This shared care network is a more robust strategy in combating <italic>Chlamydia</italic> identified in the eye department and the associated sexual health implications.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0036933013482635" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have identified a rate of 4% <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-positive cases in all swabbed cases of presumed viral conjunctivitis. This represents a potentially undiagnosed cohort of individuals with a sexually transmitted infection. Managing chlamydial conjunctivitis in eye casualty requires a thoughtful and encompassing approach as patients do not expect the identification of such an infection in this setting. A novel quadriplex PCR test has contributed to the development of a multi-disciplinary approach to address all the issues involved in the effective management of chlamydial conjunctivitis. This has been due to improved communication and formalised protocols between virology, ophthalmology and specialist sexual health, with a central point of contact through a designated sexual health advisor. Similar new laboratory testing strategies or algorithms may require other cross-discipline working in the NHS as a whole.</p>
