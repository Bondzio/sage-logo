<p>A case of lower motor neuron disease with homozygous survival motor neuron 2 (<italic>SMN2</italic>) gene deletion is reported in this article. A 7-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with main complaints of lower extremity weakness and difficulty squatting for the past year. <italic>SMN</italic> gene copies were quantified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene were normal, but homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene was identified. Homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN</italic> centromeric gene was detected, and exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene were found to be normal in the proband. Two copies of exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene were identified, and zero copies of exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene were found. We consider that this case represents a previously unrecognized type of lower motor neuron disease that resulted from homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene.</p>

<body>
<p>Sporadic lower motor neuron disease is a family of heterogeneous disorders that involve various clinical manifestations and genetic changes. To date, the exact pathological mechanism is unknown. The survival motor neuron (<italic>SMN</italic>) gene is present in 2 highly homologous copies (<italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic>) on chromosome 5q13. The most common spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by deletion of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene. Homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> deletion is found in 5% of the normal population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812445505">1</xref></sup> whereas it is rarely observed in various other types of motor neuron disease. Some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812445505">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812445505"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812445505">4</xref></sup> have shown that the increased frequency of homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion is usually associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Echaniz-Laguna et al found that <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion may act as a susceptibility factor for lower motor neuron disease in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812445505">5</xref></sup> A recent study demonstrated that the homozygous deletion of <italic>SMN2</italic> existed in 22% (4/18) of patients with lower motor neuron disease, indicating that homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion may be specifically related to lower motor neuron disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812445505">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, many studies have found no significant correlation between the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812445505">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812445505"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812445505">9</xref></sup> A case of lower motor neuron disease with homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion is reported in this article.</p>

<title>Clinical Data</title>
<p>A 7-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with main complaints of lower extremity weakness and difficulty squatting for the past year. The onset of lower extremity muscle weakness, abnormal squatting posture, difficulty climbing stairs, and difficulty standing up from a squatting position occurred since he was 6 years old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812445505">Figure 1</xref>). Afterward, his symptoms did not progress significantly. He was a full-term infant born via cesarean section because of an abnormally narrow maternal pelvis. His weight was 3 kg at birth, with no history of perinatal asphyxia. He fed normally and had normal language development. He was able to stand without support at age 12 months, walk at age 16 months, and run at age 3 years. The patient has had no persistent diarrhea, constipation, bowel symptoms, urinary weakness, urinary incontinence, or urinary retention symptoms. His mother was 41 years old with right leg weakness and a waddling gait that did not get progressively worse. The other members of his family did not have similar symptoms. His father was phenotypically healthy.</p>

<p>A physical examination found that the patient was conscious with clear speech and a soft neck. No clinical abnormalities were found. A neurologic examination showed normal cranial nerves without a winged scapula. Muscle strength in the bilateral upper extremities from the proximal to distal part was level 5, and muscle tension was normal without muscle atrophy or fasciculation. The thenar, hypothenar, and interosseous muscles were not atrophied in either hand. His muscle strength was level 4 in the lower extremities in the proximal and distal parts. The bilateral lower extremities exhibited calf muscle atrophy, “crane legs” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812445505">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812445505"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883073812445505">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Classification and Characteristics of Motor Neuron Disease</title>
<p>Motor neuron diseases are a group of neurologic disorders that selectively affect the upper and lower motor neurons that control the voluntary movements of the limb and bulbar muscles, leading to neuronal dysfunction. The chronic motor neuron syndrome includes some severe cases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and childhood spinal muscular atrophy, in which the patient’s ability to lead a normal life is challenged and life is endangered. It also involves various slowly progressing benign disorders, such as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. These diseases primarily affect parts of the motor cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem motor nuclei and selectively involve the axons and surrounding sphingomyelin of motor neurons. These diseases are clinically diverse and include variations in nomenclature, disease progression rates, clinical signs, and genetic background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812445505">10</xref></sup> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common adult-onset form of motor neuron disease, characterized by progressive fetal neuronal degeneration. It commonly affects the upper and lower motor neurons located in the brain and spinal cord. Approximately 2% to 13% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases are familial, with some cases associated with a mutation in the SOD-1 gene. Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis accounts for 90% to 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, but the precise genes that indicate susceptibility, such as TARDBP gene mutations, are rarely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812445505">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812445505">12</xref></sup> The peak age of onset for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is 40 to 50 years, and the earliest symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are typically present in the distal limbs with obvious stiffness and cramping of the fingers, muscle weakness, wasting hands, and lower limb hyperreflexia that slowly and asymmetrically progresses to the forearms and shoulder girdle muscles.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of motor neuron disease patients have pure lower neuron disease with an onset after 18 years of age. The initial symptoms indicate lower motor neuron involvement, such as weakness, atrophy, fasciculation, muscle spasms, and a weakening or disappearance of tendon reflexes in the distal limbs. Electromyography showed lower motor neuron involvement in affected muscles without sensory disturbances and no definitive signs of upper motor neuron dysfunction. The clinical course is commonly long with a slow progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812445505">13</xref></sup> Among the pure lower neuron diseases, spinal muscular atrophy is divided into types I to IV, based on the age of onset and disease severity. Types I to III are also known as childhood spinal muscular atrophy. Type I spinal muscular atrophy generally occurs between birth and 6 months of age, and low muscle tone is evident at birth or within the first few months of life. The child is unable to sit without support and generally dies of respiratory muscle paralysis within 1 to 2 years after the onset of symptoms. Type II spinal muscular atrophy, also known as intermediate spinal muscular atrophy, usually occurs in infants between 6 and 18 months of age. Type III, often referred to as juvenile spinal muscular atrophy, has an age of onset of 3 to 18 years. Symptoms usually begin in the lower extremities and slowly progress to the upper extremities, including muscle weakness, wasting and fasciculation of the proximal limbs, diminished or absent tendon reflexes, waddling gait, winged scapula, and a positive Gower sign. Some cases are also accompanied by scoliosis and compensatory hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius. Type IV spinal muscular atrophy, also known as adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy, has an age of onset of 20 to 50 years. This disease causes slow but progressive weakness and wasting of the upper arm and lower leg muscles and fasciculation. The medulla oblongata has been shown to be involved in a few cases.</p>

<title>Oncologic Characteristics and Genetic Testing of This Case and Literature Review of the Association Between Homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> Gene Deletion and Motor Neuron Disease</title>
<p>In this case, symptoms occurred at 6 years of age. The bilateral lower extremities were affected (weakness and wasting), with no sensory impairment. Electromyography showed neurogenic changes in the right quadriceps and bilateral anterior tibialis muscles, with normal nerve conductance velocities. According to the diagnostic criteria for spinal muscular atrophy, the case was diagnosed as type III. Mutation or deletion of exon 7 of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene exists in almost 98% of children with spinal muscular atrophy, causing a substantial reduction in the expression of the full-length <italic>SMN</italic> protein, the leading cause of spinal muscular atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812445505">14</xref></sup> Nevertheless, <italic>SMN2</italic> produces mainly an exon 7–skipped product and generates a truncated and unstable protein. As a result, although it cannot fully compensate for the lack of SMN1 in spinal muscular atrophy patients, it can partially prevent neuronal loss. Furthermore, the variations in SMN2 gene copy number lead to changes in <italic>SMN</italic> protein levels and disease severity in spinal muscular atrophy patients. Thus, the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene may be viewed as a spinal muscular atrophy modifier gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812445505">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812445505">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>No homozygous detection of <italic>SMN1</italic> was found in this case. The quantitative analysis of the copy numbers of <italic>SMN1</italic> showed that both exons 7 and 8 had 2 copies. The patient’s parents had a normal phenotype and no <italic>SMN1</italic> or <italic>SMN2</italic> deletion, with no definitive family history of this genotype. The patient’s symptoms only lasted for 2 years and did not progress. Therefore, the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for proximal spinal muscular atrophy. The patient also presented no signs of upper motor neuron involvement and thus did not meet the diagnostic criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>
<p>Reports on the relationship between homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion and motor neuron disease are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812445505">Table 1</xref>. Homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene is closely related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and adult-onset lower motor neuron disease. Pure lower motor neuron disease is clinically characterized by the degeneration of lower motor neurons, distal and asymmetric onset of extremity weakness and muscle atrophy, a slow progression, and the absence of a family history. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812445505">Table 1</xref> shows that lower motor neuron disease occurred in individuals older than age 15 years, whereas the patient in the present report was only 6 years old. Additionally, an investigation of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population conducted by Tarynor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812445505">13</xref></sup> revealed that 70% of the patients with lower motor neuron disease progressed into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, characterized by the involvement of upper motor neurons and medulla oblongata within 6 years after the onset of symptoms. However, the patient in the present report had an earlier age of onset and only presented weakness of the bilateral lower extremities. Owing to its short clinical course, no obvious progression was evident. Therefore, the patient needs further follow-up, and the possible involvement of upper motor neurons needs to be examined. Srivastava et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812445505">18</xref></sup> reported a case of childhood spinal muscular atrophy caused by homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion in a 5-year-old patient. The patient’s symptoms included delayed motor development, diminished muscle tension, muscle weakness, a waddling gait, and difficulty standing from a squatting position. These symptoms occurred at approximately 9 to 10 months of age. Muscle weakness mainly occurred in the distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs, especially in instep flexors and finger flexors, and it was also present in proximal muscles. The patient had no family history of spinal muscular atrophy. Nerve conductance velocity in the upper and lower extremities was normal. Electromyographic findings indicated disease of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, and a diagnosis of distal spinal muscular atrophy was made. Subsequently, Ogino<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812445505">19</xref></sup>questioned the assertion made by Srivastava,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812445505">18</xref></sup> suggesting that although <italic>SMN2</italic> gene copy numbers may affect disease severity in spinal muscular atrophy, homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene itself does not likely cause spinal muscular atrophy.</p>

<p>Harding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812445505">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812445505">21</xref></sup> described 34 cases of distal spinal muscular atrophy with an age of onset of 5 to 70 years. The initial symptoms involved the distal muscles of the lower limbs, progressing to the upper limbs and eventually proximal muscles. Eighteen of the distal spinal muscular atrophy cases originally presented with chronic and asymmetric upper extremity atrophy, with an average age of onset of 33 years. Barry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812445505">22</xref></sup> reviewed the relevant literature on genital distal spinal muscular atrophy and distal shoulder girdle and peroneal muscle atrophy and classified them according to genotype, age of onset, symptoms, genes, and loci. These patients all had symmetric weakness and wasting in the distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities, often combined with weakness in other muscles and genetic heterogeneity. The phonotype was clinically and phenotypically similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with no sensory disturbances. Electromyography indicated normal motor nerve conductance velocity. The affected genes and gene loci were not directly correlated with the <italic>SMN</italic> gene. The clinical features of the case in the present report were similar to the case reported by Srivastava et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812445505">18</xref></sup> with homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene and a normal <italic>SMN1</italic> gene. These characteristics were consistent with Barry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812445505">22</xref></sup> but also different in several aspects. The case in the present report developed normally. Only the muscles of the lower extremities were symmetrically involved, whereas the muscles of the upper extremities were spared. Additionally, instep flexor and finger flexor atrophy was not found. Therefore, the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for distal spinal muscular atrophy.</p>
<p>A study of 18 cases of sporadic lower motor neuron disease was conducted by Juwon Kim in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812445505">6</xref></sup> The <italic>SMN2</italic> gene was homozygously deleted in 4 cases, and the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene was present with 2 copies. However, the clinical characteristics of the 4 patients were not presented in detail. The case in our report presented clinical signs and electromyography findings that indicated lower motor neuron involvement, and the copy numbers of exons 7 and 8 of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene were normal, consistent with Kim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812445505">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, although the case presented the clinical features of lower motor neuron disease, it still differed from previous reports in several aspects, such as age of onset, symmetric involvement of the extremities, and range of muscle wasting. The <italic>SMN1</italic> gene was normal in the patient, and we consider that degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord was not likely induced by <italic>SMN1</italic> gene mutation or deletion. Homozygous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene deletion was confirmed by genetic testing in this case. Therefore, we consider that it is a previously unrecognized type of lower motor neuron disease that resulted from homozygous deletion of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene. Thus, if the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene is present in 2 copies in suspected spinal muscular atrophy patients, then <italic>SMN2</italic> gene analysis is recommended. The diagnosis of other motor neuron diseases that are not linked to the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene should also be considered in combination with clinical manifestations.</p>
