<abstract>
<p>This case traces the series of events that led to the crippling employee strike faced by the University of Health Sciences in 2009–2010. Instigated by a somewhat ambiguously worded directive from the Punjab Government (under whose aegis the UHS functions) regarding the regularization of contract employees, the misunderstanding snowballed into a full-fledged revolt by the majority of the UHS contractual staff against the university management. This led to the university finally having to relieve 65 per cent of its work force from employment.</p>
<p>This case narrates in detail how these events came to pass. It also presents a brief overview of the UHS organizational structure; its decision-making dynamics; and the institutional context in which it functions. A brief outline of the university VC’s leadership style is also presented.</p>
