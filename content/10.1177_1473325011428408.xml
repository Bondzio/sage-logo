<p>A while back when I was looking for someone to review the book that is this issue’s subject matter, I received a helpful email from a friend that read, ‘Are you getting anyone to review the <italic>Sage Handbook of Social Work Research</italic>? I ask because … Mark Hardy is apparently reading it cover to cover!!! So he’d be in good position to write a review.’ That sounded promising, so I immediately sent off an email to this virtual stranger and introduced myself by saying that a friend had, ‘let slip that you are carefully reading the <italic>Sage Handbook of Social Work Research</italic> from cover to cover’ and asking him if he would be interested in writing a book review essay. His response spoke volumes. It was thoughtful, humble, and entertaining. It read as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Hi Karen, yes, for my sins I set myself this challenging task. Originally, I’d intended to have finished in advance of the European Conference of Social Work Research … so as to be able to engage key people in thoughtful discussions on an informed basis, but didn’t quite make it. Instead, I had an extra glass of wine and ‘bluffed’ it – which seemed to work just as well …. I’d be very interested in undertaking the review, and using it as a basis for reflections on the state of social work research.</p></disp-quote>
To which I could only answer that I had ‘often found a glass of wine (or two) seems to improves academic discussions’ and that I was thrilled that he was willing to turn his ‘ambitious reading activity into a book review essay.’ Happily, Mark was thus engaged in tackling this enormous project.</p>
<p>Simultaneously there were changes brewing at QSW. These included discussions about whether to increase the number of issues from four to six per year, along with my proposal to invite an additional person to share responsibilities for the book review section by co-editing it with me. I had long worried that I was producing a forum that was too US-centric; a problem QSW as a whole has strived to avoid. The net result of these assorted discussions – as regular readers of this journal already know – was to increase the number of issues to six per annum and to invite Mark to join me as co-editor of the book review section. The current issue reflects the inauguration of both of these decisions.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, increasing the number of issues has been a bit bumpy as new – and more immediate – deadlines for producing copy were announced. Mark responded to one set of emails with his apparently characteristic good humour, ‘My god, what have I let myself in for??!’. After several weeks – and another flurry of emails – we finally worked out the details including a decision to run his already-promised review essay of the Sage Handbook at the outset. I sent him a note confirming all this that read, ‘Welcome to chaos my friend!’ He responded, ‘Funnily enough I’m working on something on chaos and complexity at the moment.’ It seems I have the good fortune to be working with someone who sees messiness as seductive fodder for intelligent discourse and something to be embraced!</p>
<p>I would like to raise a glass in Mark’s honour and toast an exciting new partnership. I look forward to his contributions in the issues ahead and his ongoing ‘reflections on the state of social work research.’ I encourage readers to join me by picking the beverage of your choice (depending on the time of day) and settling in with Mark’s richly textured, deeply intelligent, intriguingly provocative, and lovely written book review essay. I hope you will be as excited about this review and its reviewer as am I.</p>
