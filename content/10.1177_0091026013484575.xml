<abstract>
<p>Recent research has demonstrated that public service motivation (PSM) is positively associated with the compatibility that public employees have to public organizations. However, the person–work environment (PE Fit) research also highlights the importance of compatibility not only between individuals and organizations (PO Fit) but also between individuals and jobs (PJ Fit). Hence, there is a need for research that investigates the level of the government work environment that PSM contributes to the most. Subsequently, this study sought to shed some light on the relationship that PSM has to PO Fit and PJ Fit. Using a sample of 205 randomly selected employees drawn from three public organizations in the States of Oregon, Indiana, and Kentucky, PSM was found to be a significantly better predictor of PO Fit, than PJ Fit. The implications of this finding for public administration research and practice are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public service motivation (PSM) has emerged as one of the most popular areas of research in the field of public administration nationally and internationally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Hondeghem, 2008</xref>). This domain of research has not only grown in quantity but also in terms of quality. Scholars are utilizing advance techniques to test the long-held theories regarding the positive effects of PSM in organizations, most notably on the performance, satisfaction, and commitment of public employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484575">Alonso &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484575">Bright, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484575">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091026013484575">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091026013484575">Perry, 1997</xref>). This research could not have come too soon. The field of public administration is facing challenges for which PSM research could provide answers. One of the major challenges is the fact that within the next 10 to 15 years, all levels of government will be greatly affected by the enormously large numbers of retirements from the aging public employees. Government leaders are scrambling to develop recruitment strategies that will offset these large upcoming reductions in force. However, merely determining the number of employees that will be needed to replace future retirees does not solve the problem of ensuring that the right employees are selected, nor does it guarantee that these individuals will have long-term interest in public sector employment. There is growing competition for obtaining excellent employees among government, business, and nonprofit organizations, thus the best and brightest individuals tend to have a number of employment options to choose from. Astonishingly, there is evidence that government organizations may not even be able to count on being selected as the sector of choice among those enrolled in public affairs education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091026013484575">Light, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091026013484575">Volcker, 1987</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial that public organizations develop a competitive edge in attracting desirable employees.</p>
<p>Determining which individuals have high levels of PSM and recruiting those individuals to careers that best suit them, at the same time avoiding those individuals who are less inclined toward PSM, may be the edge that government organizations have when attracting the right individuals to public service work. This is particularly important given the strong relationship PSM has with the preferences, attitudes, and behaviors of public employees. However, the degree to which PSM has positive results on these outcomes depends on the characteristics of the work environment. Person–environmental (PE) fit researchers suggest that the work environment is multidimensional and that it embodies many demands and opportunities that flow from not only the features of organizations but also from the features of the jobs within organizations. Subsequently, this suggestion highlights an important question regarding the level of work environment that PSM contributes the most to. Specifically, does PSM have the greatest impact on individuals’ public organizations (PO Fit) or public jobs (PJ Fit)? The answer to this question has implications for the recruitment strategies government organizations should use in our competitive labor market, as well as to our understanding of the kinds of work outcomes PSM should logically predict.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the purpose of this study was to comparatively investigate the relationship that PSM has to PO Fit and PJ Fit. This article begins with a review of the PSM and PE Fit literatures. The research questions and hypotheses that will be the focus of this study are presented after the review. The methods that were used to collect and analyze the data will be presented next, and the article will conclude with a discussion of the implications that this study has for research and practice in the field of public administration.</p>

<sec id="section2-0091026013484575">
<title>PSM</title>
<p>The concept of PSM is often used as an argument for why individuals choose government careers over careers in a business organization. Many scholars and practitioners believe that the explanation for these decisions can be attributed to the importance that some individuals place on meaningful opportunities to contribute to society. It is the authors’ belief that government organizations are naturally much more capable of providing these opportunities than business organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Porter, 1982</xref>). Although the lines of demarcation between government, business, and nonprofit organizations are blurring, opportunities to serve communities as firefighters, police officers, high school teachers, district attorneys, and social workers still firmly rest in the public sector. The primary goals of many public organizations are fundamentally different from business organizations as businesses inherently emphasize profit maximization, even though corporate social responsibility is a growing concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091026013484575">Steen, 2008</xref>). Still, it has been argued that individuals with high levels of PSM recognize and make career choices on the basis of these organizational and institutional differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091026013484575">Vandenabeele, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing interest in determining the consequences of PSM in public organizations. Of particular interest is the degree to which these individuals are distinctive in terms of their perceptions, work preferences, demographics, and behaviors in public organizations. Subsequently, empirical research does provide some answers. For example, scholars have found that individuals with high levels of PSM tend to be female, highly educated, and/or managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484575">Bright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091026013484575">Dehart-Davis, Marlowe, &amp; Sanjay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091026013484575">Perry, 1997</xref>). These individuals were less likely to prefer monetary opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091026013484575">Brewer, Selden, &amp; Facer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484575">Bright, 2005</xref>), and more likely to want nonmonetary opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091026013484575">Bright, 2009</xref>). Scholars have also found that PSM tends to come in many different shades and forms, each with distinctive characteristics and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091026013484575">Brewer et al., 2000</xref>). In terms of the attitudes and behaviors of public employees, evidence suggest that employees with high levels of PSM are more tolerant of the characteristics of bureaucratic organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091026013484575">Scott &amp; Pandey, 2005</xref>), more likely to report activities that are harmful to the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091026013484575">Brewer &amp; Selden, 1998</xref>), and are attracted to a range of government careers. Scholars have found these individuals to be more satisfied with their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091026013484575">Vandenabeele, 2009</xref>), less likely to leave their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091026013484575">Vandenabeele, 2009</xref>), and individuals with high levels of PSM report high performance rating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091026013484575">Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there have been positive results regarding the effects of PSM, there are studies that temper the enthusiasm surrounding the concept. For example, one study found PSM to be negatively related to years of tenure in public organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091026013484575">Moynihan &amp; Pandey, 2007</xref>). This finding appears to challenge studies that suggest that individuals with high levels of PSM are more tolerant of red tape and more satisfied with their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091026013484575">Scott &amp; Pandey, 2005</xref>). One would expect employees who are more comfortable in public sector settings to have greater longevity in public organizations than those who are less comfortable. Unfortunately, there are also mixed finding regarding the degree to which PSM influences the performance of public employees. For example, although some studies generally report a positive direct relationship between PSM and the performance of public employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091026013484575">Kim, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091026013484575">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091026013484575">Ritz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091026013484575">Vandenabeele, 2009</xref>), other studies are quite mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484575">Alonso &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091026013484575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091026013484575">Leisink &amp; Steijn, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484575">Alonso and Lewis (2001)</xref>, using preexisting data from two large data samples of federal employees, found that although PSM was positively related to performance appraisals in one sample of employees, no relationship was found in the other sample. These scholars concluded the PSM was not a meaningful predictor of the performance of public employees. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091026013484575">Anderson (2009)</xref> in one qualitative study found that although PSM was readily present among public and private sector professionals, PSM was not a major determinant of performance when compared with the strength of their professional norms.</p>
<p>Borrowing from studies in the general management literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright (2007)</xref> investigated the degree to which PO Fit could help explain the mixed findings in the PSM literature regarding the performance of public employees. He theorized that much of the mixed findings were largely due to the failure of many to consider the importance of compatibility between work environments and employees. He argued that PSM would not affect the attitudes and behaviors of employees the same way under different environmental conditions, particularly given the evidence that individuals with high levels of PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091026013484575">Brewer et al., 2000</xref>) and public organizations are multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091026013484575">Mintzberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091026013484575">Wilson, 1993</xref>). Using this reasoning, he hypothesized that the attitudes and behavior of public employees would be the most beneficial in work environments that are compatible with their needs and desires. The findings of his study concluded that although PSM was positively related to PO Fit, PSM had no direct positive relationship with the self-reported job performance of public employees, when PO Fit was considered. Similarly, in a study of the relationship among PSM, PO Fit, job satisfaction, and commitment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484575">Bright (2008)</xref> found that outside of PO Fit, PSM had quite negative consequences for the satisfaction and turnover intentions of public employees. These findings were recently confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091026013484575">Leisink and Steijn (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the research on PSM has advanced our understanding of the causes and consequences of PSM in organizations. Still, much more work is needed to illuminate where PSM matters the most on important organizational outcomes. We need additional research to help disentangle the mixed findings and causal connections between PSM and important work outcomes, particularly for performance. This information will help public managers better understand what to expect from individuals with high levels of PSM in public organizations and where to apply PSM generating strategies most effectively. Subsequently, recent research suggests that the PE Fit literature can help facilitate the discovery of these answers.</p>

<title>PE Fit</title>
<p>The research on PSM has improved and refined our understanding of the benefits it has in public organizations. Recent research suggests that the positive results of PSM on the attitudes and behaviors of employees are produced in work environments that are compatible with the needs and desires of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484575">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>). Surprisingly, these conclusions are quite similar to those reached by scholars in the field of PE Fit. PE Fit scholars also discovered that organizational outcomes are influenced by interactions between people and environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091026013484575">Bretz &amp; Judge, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091026013484575">Kristof, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091026013484575">Munchinsky &amp; Monahon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091026013484575">Vancouver &amp; Schmitt, 1991</xref>). Subsequently, there are at least three conclusions that can be drawn from PE Fit research.</p>
<p>The first conclusion drawn from PE Fit research is that the attributes of the work environment and attitudes of individuals are multidimensional. Two attributes of the work environment that have been the focus of many researchers deal with organization and job levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>). There is clear evidence that individuals routinely distinguish between the attributes of their organizations and those of their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091026013484575">Cable &amp; DeRue, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091026013484575">Lauver &amp; Kristof-Brown, 2001</xref>). In this case, the demands and opportunities that exist in public administration environments flow from the characteristics of public organizations and public sector jobs. Similarly, PE Fit researchers capture individuals from the perspectives of personalities, goals and values, needs, and competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A second conclusion that can be drawn from PE Fit research is that congruence can be achieved in two ways: supplementary and/or complementary. Supplementary congruence is achieved when the characteristics of individuals and their environment are similar to each other; whereas complementary congruence is achieved when the characteristics of individuals and environments add something that is missing to make each other whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091026013484575">Munchinsky &amp; Monahon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091026013484575">Vancouver &amp; Schmitt, 1991</xref>). Supplementary congruence is generally operationalized on the basis of goal and or value similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091026013484575">Chatman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091026013484575">Vancouver &amp; Schmitt, 1991</xref>), as is the case when individuals and organizations share the same goals. Complementary is generally operationalized in two ways: demands/abilities or needs/supplies fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091026013484575">Kristof, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>). From a demands/ability standpoint, complementary congruence is achieved when the demands of the work environment are adequately fulfilled by the knowledge and skills possessed by employees. From a needs/supplies standpoint, complementary congruence is achieved when the salient unmet needs of individuals are satisfied by the opportunities that are provided by organizations.</p>
<p>A third conclusion that can be drawn from PE Fit research is that the congruence between the attributes of individuals and work environments is related to a range of outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091026013484575">Boxx, Odom, &amp; Dunn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091026013484575">Cable &amp; DeRue, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091026013484575">Lovelance &amp; Rosen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091026013484575">Sims &amp; Kroeck, 1994</xref>). These findings were also mirrored in some public administration studies that found significantly positive relationships between PO Fit and the work attitudes and behaviors of public employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484575">2008</xref>). There is also evidence that these outcomes are related to the fit individuals have with different levels of their work environments. Scholars have found that PO Fit has the strongest relationship with organization commitment, turnover, and contextual performance, while PJ Fit has the strongest relationship with job satisfaction, intentions to quit, and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484575">Hoffman &amp; Woehr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, not only do individuals distinguish between the different levels of their environments, the behaviors and attitudes of employees are also differently affected by these levels as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091026013484575">
<title>Questions and Hypotheses</title>
<p>There is a need in the public administration literature to explore the effects of PSM at the many multiple levels of the public sector work environment. Indeed, the PE Fit field of research demonstrates that exploring compatibility at multiple levels of the work environment is definitely worthwhile. The congruence between employees and their work environments have significant consequences on their work attitudes and behaviors. This area of research has important implications for government organizations experiencing human resource shortfalls. The research suggest that these shortfalls could be mitigated by finding individuals who have a predisposition to fit in government work environments in ways that positively affects their work attitudes and behaviors. Subsequently, there is a need for research that comparatively explores the extent to which PSM influences PO Fit and PJ Fit.</p>
<p>The existing research suggests that PSM is related to PO Fit and PJ Fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484575">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091026013484575">Leisink &amp; Steijn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091026013484575">Wright &amp; Pandey, 2008</xref>). As previously explored, scholars have found strong connections between PSM and PO Fit. Public employees who reported having high levels of PSM also reported being significantly more congruent with the characteristics of public organizations. Similarly, there is indirect evidence that suggest that PSM affects the compatibility individuals have to the characteristics of their jobs. For example, one study found that public employees with high levels of PSM reported being significantly more interested in jobs that provided them with personal recognition, task meaningfulness, and professional growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091026013484575">Bright, 2009</xref>). With this information, one would expect employees with high levels of PSM to be most congruent in jobs that provide them with these opportunities.</p>
<p>Still, although there is evidence that PSM, PO Fit, and PJ Fit are related, there is no empirical research that explains which level of the work environment (organization or job) that PSM most benefits. There are scholars who suggest that PSM is a better predictor of PO Fit. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry and Wise (1990)</xref> suggested that the characteristics of organizations are the most salient work environment for individuals with high levels of PSM. These scholars hypothesized that “the greater an individual’s public service motivation, the more likely the individual will seek membership in a public organization” (p. 370). Similarly, scholars have found that PSM was not related to the career choices of public employees. Instead, individuals with high levels of PSM were found to be evenly represented among those who choose public service and nonpublic service careers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091026013484575">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Still, there are scholars who suggest that PSM is a meaningful predictor of the fit between individuals and jobs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091026013484575">Light (1999)</xref> implied that job characteristics are one of the most salient environmental attributes for individuals interested in public service careers. He found that a major distinguishing characteristic of many public administration students was their desire to have meaningful work, a finding that has been replicated in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091026013484575">Lewis &amp; Frank, 2002</xref>). What is the most surprising is Light’s conclusion that public administration students are not loyal to any particular organization or even employment sector in their quest for meaningful work. His study confirms that students recognize and are open to the increasing options they have in public service careers. However, Light’s study does not directly measure the degree to which PSM<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091026013484575">2</xref></sup> is related to career attraction in his sample of students. Although all students enrolled in public affairs education programs should not be expected to be highly attracted to government jobs, one would at least expect attraction to government careers to be positively related to PSM, given the findings of existing research. Hence, the following hypotheses can be made.</p>
<list id="list1-0091026013484575" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> PSM will be positively related to PO Fit. As individuals’ level of PSM increase their compatibility with the attributes of public organization will also increase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> PSM will be positively related to PJ Fit. As individuals’ level of PSM increase their compatibility with the attributes of their jobs will also increase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> PSM will be a stronger predictor of PO Fit, than PJ Fit.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data for this study was collected from 205 public employees. These participants were randomly selected from three public jurisdictions located in the States of Indiana, Kentucky, and Oregon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091026013484575">3</xref></sup> These organizations were chosen to create a diverse sample of participants who represented a board range of governmental occupations and localities. This was beneficial for extending the generalizability of the findings beyond a single agency in a single state. The respondents were mailed a survey to their office addresses with a self-addressed stamped return envelope to the author of this study. The participants were given 2 weeks to complete the survey. Nearly 35% of the 600 surveys distributed were returned. As expected, the respondents represented a diverse mix of public sector occupations, some of which included medical doctors, building inspectors, community health workers, registered nurses, police officers, management analysts, caseworkers, secretaries, social workers, district attorneys, librarians, maintenance workers, detectives, animal control workers, and engineers. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091026013484575">Table 1</xref>, the respondents were also diverse in terms of their race/ethnicity, age, gender, education, and experience.</p>

<title>PSM</title>
<p>The only known direct measure of PSM is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091026013484575">Perry’s (1996)</xref> 24-item PSM scale, which is subsequently used in this study. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091026013484575">Table 2</xref>, this scale was used to ask respondents to rate their agreement with 24 questions about their interest in self-sacrifice, compassion, public interest, and public policy making from 1 (<italic>highly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>highly agree</italic>). The responses were summed by each of the four categories (self-sacrifice, compassion, public interest, and public policy making). The summed categories were used as four observed indicators of PSM. The fit indices suggest that this scale has a good fit to the data.</p>

<p>A direct supplementary approach was used to measure the congruence between the respondents and their respective organizations from the perspective of values and goals. Direct strategies assessed fit by asking the respondents for their perceptions of their fit in their organizations. Indirect strategies, on the other hand, assessed fit by comparing separate assessments of the respondents’ characteristics and the characteristics of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Empirical research has shown that direct measures are stronger and better predictors of employee outcomes than indirect measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091026013484575">Verquer, Beehr, &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the participants in this study were asked to indicate their agreement with the following three statements from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>): My values and goals are similar to the values and goals of my organization, my organization deserves my loyalty, and what this organization stands for is very important to me.

<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>This study used several control variables for job satisfaction and turnover intentions: minority status, age, gender, education level, and years of public sector experience. The minority status of the participants was collected using the following multiple-choice question: How would you describe your racial or ethnic group? As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091026013484575">Table 1</xref>, multiple ethnic and racial options were given. The minority participants were coded as 0, whereas nonminority participants were coded as 1. The age of the respondents was measured using the following open-ended survey question: What year were you born? The year of birth was subsequently transformed into their current age by subtracting the year of birth from the current year of this study, 2006. The gender of the participants was collected from the following multiple-choice survey question: What is your gender? Females were coded as 1 and males coded as 0. The level of education of the participants was collected from the following multiple-choice survey question: What is the highest level of education you have completed? These responses were coded from 1 (<italic>Did not complete high school</italic>) to 6 (<italic>Master’s degree or higher</italic>). The years of public sector experience was collected from the following open-ended survey question: How many years of experience do you have working in the public sector?</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>After the data collection process, the data were analyzed in two stages. First, the data were examined to ensure that the assumptions of normality were upheld (i.e., linear independence of the study variables). The data were found to be in excellent condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091026013484575">4</xref></sup> For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091026013484575">Curran, West, and Finch (1996)</xref> suggest that skewness ranges should be fewer than 2 and kurtosis ranges fewer than 7. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091026013484575">Table 3</xref>, all of the study variables fell between these suggested ranges. Second, a statistical power analysis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091026013484575">5</xref></sup> was conducted utilizing a technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091026013484575">MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (1996)</xref>. Based on this analysis, this study was found to have an approximate 80% chance of rejecting false null hypotheses at a .05 level of significance. Third, the data were analyzed using structure equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimation (ML). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091026013484575">Figure 1</xref> displays the conceptual model that was tested in this study. This model tested the relationships among PSM, PO Fit, and PJ Fit. The goodness-of-fit statistic (χ<sup>2</sup>= 143.064, <italic>df</italic> = 52, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and fit indices<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091026013484575">6</xref></sup> (normed fit index [NFI] = .763, incremental fit index [IFI] = .842, comparative fit index [CFI] = .824, root square mean error of approximation [RMSEA] = .093)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0091026013484575">7</xref></sup> indicate that this model has a satisfactory fit to the data.

<p>The survey respondents were demographically diverse. However, it is notable that the majority of the respondents was White, female, had accumulated between 0 and 10 years of public sector experience, and had at least some college education. One issue that may have lessened the generalizability of the sample centered on the sample’s gender composition. The male participants in this study were undersampled, thus skewing the gender variable toward the female participants. As a result, the results of this study must be interpreted cautiously.</p>

<p>This study collected the respondents’ level of PSM, PO fit, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. The descriptive results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0091026013484575">Table 4</xref>, and these results will be the focus of the following discussion. First, the findings revealed that the majority of the respondents had a moderate level of PSM. More than 60% of the respondents indicated that they <italic>somewhat agreed</italic> or <italic>agreed</italic> with questions regarding their interest in the PSM subcategories of self-sacrifice, compassion, and public interest. However, the respondents were clearly less interested in the public policy making subcategory of PSM, as 58% of the respondents either <italic>disagreed with</italic> or were <italic>neutral</italic> regarding this category. Second, the majority of the respondents suggested that they were congruent with their respective organizations. When asked whether their goals were very similar to the values and goals of their organizations, 40% of the respondents either <italic>agreed</italic> or <italic>highly agreed</italic> with this statement. Finally, the survey revealed that some of the respondents were fairly comfortable in their jobs. For example, the majority of the respondents indicated that their jobs fully utilized their abilities, they enjoyed their work more than anything else they did, and their jobs were personally, socially, and/or organizationally important.</p>

<p>Second, this study controlled for the influences of age, gender, race, experience, and education on the respondents level of PO Fit and PJ Fit. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0091026013484575">Table 5</xref>, the results of this study indicated that education, years of experience, and gender have no significant relationship with these study variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0091026013484575">8</xref></sup> However, a significant relationship was found between PO Fit and the race of the respondents. Minority respondents indicated that they were significantly less congruent with the characteristics of their organizations than were their White counterparts. Similarly, a significant relationship was found between PJ Fit and age. Respondents who were older indicated that they were significantly more congruent with their jobs than their counterparts who were younger, and had higher levels of education.</p>

<title>Hypothesis Testing</title>
<p>Finally, this study explored the relationships among PSM, PO Fit, and PJ Fit. Three hypotheses were advanced. The first hypothesis centered on the relationship between PSM and PO Fit. It was hypothesized that PSM will be positively related to the compatibility between public employees and public organizations. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0091026013484575">Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091026013484575">Figure 2</xref>, the findings of this study confirmed this hypothesis. PSM was found to be positively related to the respondent’s perceptions of their fit in public organization. As the respondents level of PSM increased, they reported being significantly more congruent with the characteristics of their respective public organizations. The second hypothesis advanced in this study centered on the relationship between PSM and PJ Fit. This study hypothesized that PSM will be positively related to the compatibility between public employees and the attributes of their jobs. The findings of this study supported this hypothesis. PSM was positively related to the respondents’ perceptions of their compatibility with their jobs. Consequently, the respondents with high levels of PSM reported being significantly more congruent with the attributes of their jobs than their counterparts with lower levels of PSM. The third hypothesis of this study centered on the comparative relationship that PSM had to PO Fit and PJ Fit. It was hypothesized that PSM would have a much greater impact on PO Fit, than PJ Fit. The findings of this study supported this hypothesis. PSM was a significantly better predictor of the respondents’ level of PO Fit, when compared with their compatibility with their jobs.</p>

<title>Discussion of Results</title>
<p>There were several important findings of this study. For one, this study confirmed that PSM is meaningfully related to the respondents’ perceptions of congruence to their organization and jobs. As the respondents’ level of PSM increased they were significantly more likely to indicate that they were more compatible with not only the characteristics of public organizations but also with the characteristics of public sector jobs, than were their counterparts with lower levels of PSM. This finding confirms existing research and theory regarding the positive relationship between PSM government work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>), as well as provides the first empirical test of the relationship between PSM and PJ Fit. These findings suggest that accessing PSM levels and selecting individuals with higher levels may be an effective strategy for recruiting individuals to public service at all levels of government assuming that these individuals also possess the adequate education and other qualifications required. This may be an advantage that recruiters can use in their competition for individuals who are not only skilled but also highly likely to be compatible with government work environments.</p>
<p>A second implication of this study centers on the distinguishing impact PSM had on the study variables. Although PSM was found to be related to PO Fit and PJ Fit, it was a much better predictor of PO Fit. The respondents with high levels of PSM indicated that they were more compatible with the characteristics of their organizations than the characteristics of their jobs. One can argue that while this finding is consistent with many scholars suggestion that PSM is grounded in the “institution” of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Vandenabeele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>), it may also signal that a gap exists between the perceptions that employees hold about the broad public service goals of public institutions and the task of their specific public sector jobs. There are few benefits that result from individuals who are attracted to public organizations on the basis of broad public service goals only to find that their jobs do not fulfill their expectations and altruistic needs. This situation ultimately disadvantages the long-term tenure of the best and brightest individuals in public organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091026013484575">Moynihan &amp; Pandey, 2007</xref>). However, jobs rarely fulfill the whole individual. Most humans will never occupy a job that completely fulfills their intrinsic or extrinsic needs. We all tend to desire far more than what any single job or employer can fulfill. Although many organizations have made great strides in becoming more participative, less authoritative, and more accommodating of a wider range of employees desires, they are still fundamentally tasked with accomplishing a specific set of goals and tasks. There are only so many excursions from the primary goals that can be tolerated in effective organizations. Nevertheless, this situation can only improve as the link between PSM, the broad goals of public service, and the task of public sector jobs are strengthened. Fortunately, there are recent studies that provide a comprehensive discussion of various strategies and tactics that can be used toward this end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Hondeghem, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the finding that PSM is a better predictor of PO Fit, than PJ Fit also has the potential of clarifying where PSM counts the most on important work comes. For example, existing research is mixed regarding the relationship PSM has to the performance of public employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484575">Alonso &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091026013484575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484575">Bright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091026013484575">Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091026013484575">Leisink &amp; Steijn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091026013484575">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091026013484575">Ritz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091026013484575">Vandenabeele, 2009</xref>). These studies widely differ in terms of the types and shades of performance outcomes that have been studied. However, the finding of this study adds to the growing body of evidence that the field should be more discriminating in its selection of performance indicators for PSM. For example, there is clear evidence that performance is multidimensional. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091026013484575">Borman and Motosidlo (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091026013484575">Campbell, McCloy, Oppler, and Sager (1993)</xref> divided performance into two categories: task and contextual performance. In these studies, task performance represented the formal requirements of jobs that were arranged in ways that met the explicit goals of organizations. Contextual performance, on the other hand, represented those nonrequired activities that supported the task performance obligation of organizations and its goals. These activities can include volunteering to carry out tasks that are not a formal requirement of their job, and cooperating with others in the organization to get tasks accomplished. A related concept of contextual performance is organizational citizenship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091026013484575">Organ, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, given the multidimensional nature of workplace performance, there is evidence that PO Fit and PJ Fit are meaningful predictors of different kinds of performance outcomes. For example, two meta-analyses conducted in the general management literature found that task performance was best predicted by PJ Fit, while contextual performance was best predicted by PO Fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091026013484575">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005</xref>). This is noteworthy when viewed from the findings of this study that PSM best affects PO Fit when compared with PJ Fit. Taken together, one can argue that PSM is a significant better predictor of contextual performance outcomes, than task performance outcomes, given the findings of this study and existing research in the general management field. Even more, this hypothesis is supported by existing PSM theory that has firmly grounded the concept in a contextual performance context, especially given its theoretical links to altruism, prosocial, and public interest values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Hondeghem, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091026013484575">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>). Hence, it would be worthwhile for future research to reexamine the PSM and performance linkages from this standpoint.</p>

<title>Conclusion of Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to comparatively investigate the relationship PSM has to PO Fit and PJ Fit. This study demonstrated that PSM offers positive consequences for public sector work environments at all levels. Public employees with high levels of PSM were found to be significantly more compatible with the characteristics of their organization and jobs. This finding adds support to the notion that PSM may be an effective strategy for recruiting individuals who would be naturally equipped for public service work environments. This may be the edge that many public sector recruiters are looking for in their competition for the best and brightest who are predisposed to the values of public service. In addition, this study helps clarify the kinds of work outcomes PSM would most meaningfully and consistently predict. The strong relationship that was found between PSM and PO Fit suggests that PSM is a significantly better predictor of organization level work outcomes (i.e., contextual performance), than job level factors (i.e., task performance). Hence, although PSM was found to make a difference on all levels of government studied, it makes the most difference on the compatibility individuals have to public organizations. In this case, PSM may be best used as a strategy to recruit individuals to public organizations rather than specific public sector jobs.</p>
<p>Moreover, although this study found positive significant relationships between PSM, PO Fit, and PJ Fit, there are weaknesses of this study that should be acknowledged. One limitation of this study was its sample size. Although the study had sufficient statistical power to avoid Type II errors, a larger sample size would only improve the generalizability of the findings. Another limitation of this study may have been common method variance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0091026013484575">9</xref></sup> particularly given the lower than ideal response rate. This problem raises the possibility of the data being unduly influenced by nonresponse bias and inflated statistical scores. Similarly, although much work has been done to develop a methodology valid measure of PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091026013484575">Perry, 1996</xref>), the measures used for PO Fit and PJ Fit were much less sophisticated. Although the indicators used to represent the study variables were selected on the basis of theory, existing research, and available data, there is a need for better measurement techniques that improve the discriminate validity of these factors in public administration research. These limitations and weaknesses require that the findings be interpreted cautiously. Future research should replicate the findings of this study with larger sample sizes and a better response rate to provide confirmation of these results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, given the multifaceted nature of measurements of model fit, the different rationales for developing them, and their inherent weaknesses, no single fit measurement can be used to judge the quality of structural equation modeling (SEM). Although there is a general rule of thumb that .9 is an indication of excellent (near perfect) fit for large samples, there is increasing evidence that this rule is not applicable across all indexes and conditions, especially for small sample sizes. There is also wide acceptance among SEM scholars that all fit indexes are based on subjective judgments and should not be regarded as infallible or correct. Given these differences, it is best that a variety of measures be reviewed for the purpose of building a holistic picture of model fit.</p>

<p>Values for the comparative fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), and incremental fit index (IFI) represent the comparison between the hypothesized model and the independence model. Scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 being an indication of perfect fit to the data and excellent validity. Root square mean error of approximation (RMSEA) tests the discrepancy between the population matrix and the hypothesized model. The NFI measure has been found to underestimate fit in small sample sizes. Because of this problem, Bentler (the creator of the NFI index) recommends that the CFI index be the index of choice. The IFI index is a derivative of NFI that takes in account sample size. Regarding RMSEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091026013484575">MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (1996)</xref> suggests that RMSEA ranging from .8 to 1.0 indicates mediocre fit, whereas values above 1.0 are an indication of poor fit.</p></fn>
