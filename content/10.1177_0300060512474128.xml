<sec id="sec14-0300060512474128"><title>Objective</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer is mediated via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 overactivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0300060512474128"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC3, PANC-1 and a stably gemcitabine-resistant subline, PANC1<sup>GemRes</sup>, were treated with combinations of gemcitabine and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. Phosphorylated (p)ERK1/2 was examined by Western blotting; cell proliferation and apoptosis were quantified. A nude mouse xenograft model was established with each cell line, and the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine and U0126 alone or in combination was examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0300060512474128"><title>Results</title>
<p>Gemcitabine treatment visibly increased pERK1/2 levels in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells. PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup> constitutively produced high levels of pERK1/2. U0126 treatment reversed the gemcitabine-associated increase in cell proliferation and reduction in apoptosis, in all three cell lines. Combination treatment with U0126 and gemcitabine inhibited tumour growth and promoted apoptosis in xenograft tumours derived from all three cell lines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0300060512474128"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>ERK1/2 activity may protect pancreatic cancer cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The combined use of an ERK1/2 inhibitor (such as U0126) together with gemcitabine may result in synergistic therapeutic effects at tolerable gemcitabine doses.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all major cancers, with a 5-year overall survival rate of ∼5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060512474128">1</xref></sup> The current standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine, which is a cytotoxic nucleoside analogue. The benefits of gemcitabine are modest, with a tumour response rate of 12% and a median survival time of 5 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060512474128">2</xref></sup> Data from a small number of studies suggest that a combination of targeted therapy and gemcitabine has statistically significant benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060512474128">3</xref></sup> The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 are potential targets for combination therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060512474128">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ERK1/2 signalling pathway is involved in the control of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060512474128">4</xref></sup> This pathway is often upregulated in human tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060512474128">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060512474128">6</xref></sup> and represents an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060512474128">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060512474128"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060512474128"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060512474128">10</xref></sup> The inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MAP2K1/2), U0126, has been shown to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation effectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060512474128">11</xref></sup> and to enhance radiosensitivity of rhabdomyosarcoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060512474128">12</xref></sup> ERK1/2 has been shown to be activated in pancreatic carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060512474128">5</xref></sup> but little is known regarding its role in chemoresistance.</p>
<p>This study investigated the effects of ERK1/2 inhibition by U0126 and gemcitabine, alone and in combination, on a pancreatic carcinoma model in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0300060512474128" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0300060512474128"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Shanghai, China) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were incubated in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide in air, and passaged on reaching 60–80% confluence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060512474128"><title>Development of PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup></title>
<p>The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 was used to develop a gemcitabine-resistant cell line, PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup>, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060512474128">13</xref></sup> Briefly, PANC-1 cells were serially subcultured through incrementally increasing gemcitabine concentrations, starting at the 50% inhibitory drug concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>), over 3 months. Persistence of stable resistance was confirmed by subculture in gemcitabine-free DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum; PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup> retained the capacity for proliferation when returned to medium containing 5 µM gemcitabine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060512474128"><title>Determination of gemcitabine IC<sub>50</sub></title>
<p>The IC<sub>50</sub> of gemcitabine was determined in each cell line. BxPC-3, PANC-1 and PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup> cells were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> per well in 96-well plates, in 0.1 ml of culture medium and cultured overnight. The next day, the medium was supplemented with 0–100 µM gemcitabine (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 48 h at 37°C. The IC<sub>50</sub> was determined using 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-2<italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell proliferation was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm, and the IC<sub>50</sub> for each of the cell lines was estimated from the semilogarithmic dose–response curves, by linear interpolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060512474128"><title>Cell proliferation and apoptosis analysis</title>
<p>Cells (BxPC-3, PANC-1 or PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup>) were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> per well in 96-well plates in 0.1 ml of culture medium and allowed to grow overnight. The next day, the medium was supplemented with IC<sub>50</sub> gemcitabine for 48 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of 25 µM U0126 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) (added 1 h before gemcitabine), or treated with 25 µM U0126 alone. Cell proliferation was quantified by XTT assay as described above. Parallel cultures were immediately fixed in 37% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and allowed to dry overnight. Apoptosis was determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) method (Roche in situ Apoptosis Detection System; Roche, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were examined by light microscopy; apoptosis was quantified as the mean number of stained cells as a percentage of total cells in five random high-power fields (×100 magnification).</p>

<sec id="sec7-0300060512474128"><title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Cells (BxPC-3, PANC-1 or PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup>) were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> per well in 96-well plates, in 0.1 ml of culture medium, and allowed to grow overnight. The next day, the medium was supplemented with IC<sub>50</sub> gemcitabine for 48 h at 37°C. Cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 20 mM, pH 7.6) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS]), containing 0.3 mg/l protease inhibitor (Roche), for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 28 340 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 15 min, and 25 µg of protein for each sample was resolved by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and blocked with TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% skim milk for 30 min at 4°C. Membranes were incubated with mouse antihuman phosphorylated (p)ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (1 : 200 dilution) or mouse antihuman β-actin monoclonal antibody (1 : 500 dilution; both Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed four times with TBST at room temperature for 5 min each wash, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin G (1 : 5000 dilution; Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA) for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times with TBST at room temperature (5 min each wash) and immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection system; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), followed by exposure to AGFA X-ray blue film (AGFA-Gevaert, Hortsel, Belgium).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0300060512474128"><title>Mouse tumour model</title>
<p>Male athymic nu/nu mice (aged 5 weeks; weight 18–20 g; specific pathogen free) were obtained from the Laboratory Centre of Shandong University. Mice were housed in microisolator cages, with autoclaved bedding in a specific pathogen-free facility, with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals received water and food ad libitum and were observed for signs of tumour growth, activity, feeding and pain, in accordance with the guidelines of the Standing Committee on Animals, Shandong University. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinan Central Hospital of Shandong University.</p>
<p>Xenograft tumours were established by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> BxPC-3, PANC-1 or PANC1<sup>GemRes</sup> cells in 20 µl of PBS (pH 7.6). When tumours were 50–100 mm<sup>3</sup> in diameter (after 4 weeks) the mice were divided into four groups (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per group), to receive the following treatments by intraperitoneal injection, three times per week for 4 weeks (all injections were of identical volume): 250 µg/kg U0126 (in dimethyl sulphoxide; DMSO); 100 mg/kg gemcitabine (in 1% DMSO); 250 µg/kg U0126 and 100 mg/kg gemcitabine (in DMSO); and control group (1% DMSO). Tumour growth was monitored with calipers three times per week during the treatment period; tumour volume was calculated according to the formula (length × width<sup>2</sup>)/2. On completion of treatment, mice were sacrificed and the tumours were excised.</p>
<p>Ttissue samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until used for analysis. Apoptosis was quantified in frozen sections of tumour tissue (4-µm thick) using TUNEL assay (Roche in situ Apoptosis Detection System), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060512474128">14</xref></sup> Sections were examined by light microscopy and the apoptosis index was determined by counting ≥1000 cells in 5 randomly selected high-power fields (×200 magnification).</p>

<p>Human pancreatic cancer is characterized by high intrinsic (de novo) and acquired (therapy induced) resistance to traditional chemo- and radiation therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060512474128">15</xref></sup> Understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer is critical in order for new and effective treatments to be developed for this deadly disease. Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer patients, but its clinical impact is limited by the high degree of inherent and acquired resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060512474128">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have found ERK1/2 to be involved in tumour chemoresistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060512474128">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060512474128">17</xref></sup> and increased ERK1/2 activity has been shown to correlate with inherent gemcitabine resistance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060512474128">18</xref></sup> Levels of pERK1/2 appeared to be higher in PANC-1<sup>GemRes</sup> cells than in the gemcitabine-sensitive PANC-1 parental cell line in the present study, suggesting that gemcitabine resistance may be mediated via pERK1/2.</p>
<p>Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by U0126 promoted gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and reversed acquired gemcitabine resistance in PANC1<sup>GemRes</sup> in the present study. BxPC-3 cells, which were shown not to produce pERK1/2 constitutively in the present study, were sensitive to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in vitro. These data suggest that inherent ERK1/2 activity may play an important role in gemcitabine resistance.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the ERK1/2 pathway mediates apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including cisplatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060512474128">19</xref></sup> This is supported by the finding that Nic-T24 cells (which have low ERK1/2 activity) tend to remain in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase rather than undergo apoptosis, in response to antitumour agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060512474128">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that high ERK1/2 activity protects tumour cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, in pancreatic cancer. The combined use of an ERK1/2 inhibitor (such as U0126) and gemcitabine may result in synergistic therapeutic effects at tolerable gemcitabine doses. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which ERK1/2 inhibition enhances chemotherapeutic effects. The significance of pERK1/2 as a therapeutic marker in clinical specimens remains to be investigated.</p>
