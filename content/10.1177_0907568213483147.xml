<abstract>
<p>The article discusses informal child circulation in Latin America, as it is practiced by a marginalized urban mestizo population in the capital Quito, Ecuador. The practice of child circulation is contrasted to child welfare policies and interventions, and the author theorizes this contrast as a difference between rationales of relatedness – a fluidity rationale characterizing the care practices of the marginal urban population, and a fixity rationale characterizing child welfare governance. The contrast is explored through the case of child agency in what a modern and dominant discourse on child welfare and child rights would deem to be ‘non-ideal’ or ‘inappropriate’ contexts of childhood. A specific example of ‘chosen circulation’ looks at how child circulation has to be understood as movements in and out of the ‘safe zone’ of childhood, and this example also challenges ideas about childhood, the family and the social world external to the family. A main observation is that child agency and relatedness making tends to be ignored or disqualified as long as it happens outside proper childhood contexts. This lack of recognition has important consequences for the way policies are formulated and translated into welfare practices, and also for the way we construct social analysis of marginal childhoods.</p>

<p>Informal child circulation practices and flexible care arrangements are well known in contemporary Latin America and elsewhere. The issue of care is also central to Latin American reproductive governance and to politics of childhood, where child welfare and child rights are connected to certain notions and norms of childhood and parenting. Governing regimes and interventionist practices aim at fixing children and their caretakers in certain essential relationships. In policy, bureaucratic, professional and also, in part, in academic discourse, child circulation and changing care constellations tend to be strongly associated with the negative tropes of vulnerability, rupture, social disintegration and suffering. These notions about childhood are aspects of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568213483147">Sharon Stephens (1995</xref>: 5) identifies as a ‘modern conception of childhood’. In the Ecuadorian context these notions are more than abstract idealizations, they inform policies concerning child welfare.</p>
<p>Ecuadorian child welfare policies draw from different knowledge and ideological sources; family legislation within a civil law tradition, Catholic family values, developmental psychology and the principles of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) are among the most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2006</xref>). In combination these policies construe a childhood domain characterized by ‘individual freedom, social values of enduring love and care …, the family as the basic unit of society, the bounded local community as the site of value definition and transmission, and the possibility of noncommodified social domains outside the realm of the market and market-driven politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568213483147">Stephens, 1995</xref>: 10). Various authors comment on how these ideal notions indicate localizations – the idea of ‘the proper place of children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483147">Panter-Brick, 2000</xref>: 5) or specific children’s places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568213483147">Olwig and Gulløv, 2003</xref>), i.e. ‘the home, the school or some other environment in which they [children] can be guided and protected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483147">Panter-Brick, 2000</xref>: 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483147">Ennew (2002)</xref> emphasizes the idea of domesticity in relation to this conception of childhood – childhood is in this perspective played out ‘inside society, inside a family, inside a private dwelling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483147">2002</xref>: 389). Moreover, child welfare policies are informed by a so-called ‘universalist theory of child development’, i.e. ideas about ‘a unitary process marked by a series of transformations or stages, each preceding stage being a necessary condition for the subsequent one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568213483147">Boyden et al., 1998</xref>: 27–28).</p>
<p>Although these notions clearly constitute ‘a model or ideal type … abstracted from the real circumstances of children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483147">Panter-Brick, 2000</xref>: 5), this ideal type is in different ways played out in related fields of child rights, child welfare and child development governance. And by governance here I refer to the translation of policies into interventionist practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568213483147">Miller and Rose, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568213483147">Rose, 1996</xref>), and these translations imply the elaboration of plans, conceptual frameworks, regulations, procedural descriptions, i.e. schemes, that prepare and structure interventions. Governance, then, refers to the operationalization of dominant or authoritative ideas and values through welfare service provision and formalized and institutionalized care transference. The abstracted ideal type referred to above is linked to a broader relatedness rationale emphasizing <italic>relational fixity</italic>. The ideal type and this broader relatedness rationale have in my case a direct bearing on the social life and the care practices of marginal urban mestizo dwellers – since they are converted through schemes and interventions into modes of regulation and conditioning of marginal mestizo people’s care practices in interface situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0907568213483147">
<title>The analytical framework</title>
<p>In this article I theorize a rationale of relatedness based on observations of care practices in a marginal urban mestizo population in Quito, Ecuador, <italic>in contrast to</italic> that of relational fixity. Through ethnographic accounts, methodological reflections and theoretical reconsiderations I demonstrate how children and others practice essential relations, and how these are thought of differently within a <italic>rationale of fluidity</italic>. Concerning marginal urban people’s relatedness constitution we have to analytically distinguish between a symbolic and normative level of being essentially related – a level of belonging – and a level of practice where relatedness is produced through everyday socialization and activity – a level of social becoming. In this article I focus on care as activity that produces (creates and re-creates) relations, and on relatedness making as a basic source of social being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213483147">Carsten, 2000</xref>). Marginal urban mestizos say that their social belonging has to be reaffirmed and renewed through everyday work of care, expressed by people themselves as the teaching of custom (<italic>enseñar costumbres</italic>). The importance of this reaffirmation and renewal is related to the conditions of life characterized by frequent changes concerning care constellations, cohabitation and the circulation of children.</p>
<p>My observations from Ecuador resemble other studies carried out in Latin America. The work of Claudia Fonseca on ‘child circulation’ in urban <italic>favelas</italic> in Porto Alegre, Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568213483147">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568213483147">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483147">2002</xref>) is crucial in this respect. Fonseca describes extensive child placement practices within extended family and neighborhood networks, which also include temporary transfer of children to institutional care. She points out that fixing the child in certain relations of care and intimacy is not considered basic to the child’s ability to be and become a social person. A range of ethnographic and social historical studies carried out in Latin America on child circulation, informal adoption and fosterage and apprenticeship arrangements indicate that family is a highly changeable social structure, and the child a much less localized subject than we are tempted to assume (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483147">Blum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568213483147">Leinaweaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568213483147">Walmsley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568213483147">Weismantel, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to drawing from this Latin American research and the new work on kinship, the concept social becoming also borrows notions from other social studies. ‘Navigating youth’ is a concept emphasizing ‘the intersection between agency and social forces’ and the way young persons ‘navigate their lives through social environments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483147">Christiansen et al., 2006</xref>: 16). The authors here suggest a perspective on youth ‘as both social being and social becoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483147">2006</xref>: 11). Extended to childhood studies the concept helps us view children’s agency as an interrelation between proper action and the conditions of possibility in the contexts where children navigate. A navigation approach should be seen in relation to a current trend within childhood and youth studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483147">James and James, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568213483147">James and Prout, 1990</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483147">Allison James (2007</xref>: 263), this current ‘involves the twin research foci of childhood as a sociocultural space and children’s own perspectives as social actors’. This marks a break with studies of socialization and psychological theory on child development, and focuses on the social-cultural dynamics in which children contribute actively to the shaping of the social contexts of which they form a part.</p>
<p>The relevance of the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483147">Christiansen et al. (2006)</xref> for my focus on child care and urban marginality is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568213483147">Boyden and Mann (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568213483147">Honwana and DeBoeck (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568213483147">Nieuwenhuys (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483147">Taylor and Hickey (2001)</xref>, whose research contexts to a lesser or greater degree also resemble mine. These are characterized by severe power inequalities, violent, abusive and/or criminal practices, rapidly changing social situations due to the spread of epidemic disease, and displacements due to war and war-like circumstances. All are contexts clearly outside what would conventionally be considered the childhood domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568213483147">Stephens, 1995</xref>). A main concern in this article is to look at some of the analytical and political implications of the fact that in the process of navigating their lives children circulate in and out of the ‘domain’ of childhood.</p>
<p>In my view these implications can be grasped by contrasting a relational fluidity rationale with a relational fixity rationale, and by looking at social belonging and social becoming as different levels of relatedness constitution. In contrast to a fluidity rationale, relational fixity, which is formulated in Ecuadorian child welfare policies and translated into action by different professional and bureaucratic actors and operations, foregrounds the symbolic and normative level of belonging. Belonging here refers to idealizations about children and childhood, emphasizing localization, domesticity, basic unity, social boundaries, individual freedom and emotional care detached from the economic and the market. The continuous making of relatedness, which indicates change and transformation, is disregarded as crucial in a powerful public knowledge-practice on child welfare. In this sense the social engagement we analytically term becoming does not form part of the political. I argue that social becoming is ignored or even made invisible, and/or subject to corrections and defined as deviant social behavior by makers and practitioners of welfare policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568213483147">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The foregrounding of belonging has implications for the way child agency is understood by welfare advocates and actors. In a fixity rationale the child is considered to have agency because she or he is a changing and developing person according to specific age stages and because she or he is an individual rights subject. Moreover, child agency is thought of as only possible within appropriate childhood spaces – in spaces where the ‘vulnerable child’ is protected. The challenge we are faced with in relation to the ethnography I discuss, is that children’s actions specifically and care practices more generally take place in and out of what welfare advocates and actors deem to be the secure zone of childhood. How to account for children in circulation in ‘inappropriate’ places is a challenge for research as well as for policy formulation and child welfare administration. In order to focus on this challenge I have picked a case of what I term ‘chosen circulation’. This is an analytical concept that refers to children’s decisions to leave their current relations of care and dwelling/home contexts in search of alternative care solutions.</p>
<p>This study draws mainly from my research experience in Quito, Ecuador in the period 1999–2006, which concerns child circulation and care transference practices among a marginalized urban mestizo population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2006</xref>). Data were collected using a multi-sited fieldwork approach. I worked with a combination of archival material and ethnographic fieldwork data in Quito – including participant observation in a neighborhood area, a day care center and in a child welfare/adoption organization and in a wider network of rights activists, professionals and bureaucrats. A total of 18 months of fieldwork was carried out for this project. In order to take care of the ethical sides of this data production I signed an agreement with the organization with which I coordinated my fieldwork (Holt International Children’s Services). I agreed to make all persons referred to anonymous and employed techniques to distort information about persons’ identities, relationships and their connection to places.</p>

<title>The ‘lost child’ and the child welfare field</title>
<p>Let me introduce issues of child circulation as they pertain to Ecuador by describing a situation from the child welfare field. In May 2002, I was climbing up the steep slopes to one of Quito’s marginal neighborhood areas I had chosen as a research site. Socioeconomically this area forms part of the <italic>sector popular</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483147">Larrea, 1994</xref>) – or, an area of urban Ecuadorian society that traditionally experiences lower socioeconomic status. On this day I was offered a taxi ride by one of the child psychologists of a private organization with which I coordinated my research. Holt International Children’s Services was an important provider of child protection and care transference services within the public–private Ecuadorian child welfare system. The child psychologist formed part of the PPMA team,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568213483147">2</xref></sup> and she was heading for the neighborhood area to bring a five-year-old boy child to a foster family for temporary care. The boy had been found the evening before drifting around the inter-city bus terminal without an adult. From the scant information the psychologist managed to get from witnesses and the child, it was clear that he had arrived alone on a bus from Ambato, a city about 200 km south of the capital. He had probably been together with a relative or someone other than his parents when he left Ambato, and Quito was undoubtedly unfamiliar to him.</p>
<p>Entering the taxi, I sat down beside the child; this was my first experience with what I presumed to be a lost child. As the boy looked silently out of the car window, I had time to reflect on my own immediate reactions to this new experience. Although I was in a fieldwork context and research mode, I imagined the boy by my side was experiencing an involuntary separation from birthparents. I saw a minor vulnerably exposed in an unknown and dangerous environment. And as I perceived it, this situation most probably produced anxiety, distress and a strong and threatening sensation of disconnectedness in the child. In my first attempt to understand the boy’s experience, I found myself drawing extensively on my personal experience of family life, and on general academic and professional knowledge about child development and ‘spaces of childhood’. This encounter produced in me a range of emotions and imagined notions concerning social stability, care and cohabitation and a child ‘out of place’. The Holt PPMA team as well as other child welfare professionals and bureaucrats would confirm and further elaborate these impressions in repeated conversations about family disintegration and child neglect. My initial impressions also resonated with ideas about child trafficking and the child’s right to a (preferably biological) family, voiced by profiled child rights activists.</p>
<p>These professional/policy environments were heavily involved in <italic>legal reform</italic> work where the child’s right to a family was introduced as a central issue, especially in relation to a series of innovations introduced in adoption legislation and regulation. From the regulation of ‘plenary adoption’ in 1990, and introduction of the first modern Child Code incorporating the principles of UNCRC in 1992, to the implementation of the new Childhood and Adolescence Code of 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568213483147">2009</xref>), an increased emphasis has been laid on the link between the ‘right to a family’ and the ideal model of the nuclear family and the ‘natural’ birthmother–child bond. In <italic>policy formulation</italic> and <italic>child rights activism</italic>, two mutually constituting fields of knowledge practice, a progressive language of child rights is employed to defend the relational fixity ideals of heterosexual marriage, family unity and child care. The emphasis on conservative ideals of relatedness is combined with a progressive notion of the child as a subject (rather than an object) of rights. Agency in this discourse is related to the child’s ‘discovering’ of his or her basic rights, including the right to be treated well and to be protected within a certain family nexus.</p>
<p>Concerning ‘lost children’, Holt professionals had their own procedures to follow. In addition to mapping the care situation of children, the PPMA team systematically worked to find the best possible care situations for them, giving priority to family reunification whenever possible. In their work with abandoned and relinquished children, the Holt professionals coordinated their work with DINAPEN,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0907568213483147">3</xref></sup> the Child Tribunal and with the non-governmental organization, Reencuentro. Reencuentro specialized in child rescuing and carried out investigative work to identify the family situations of disappeared children; they had developed a range of different methods – announcements on radio stations and within institutional networks and spreading posters around the city. In the case of this lost child, his parents were identified and the child brought back to them a relatively short time after he was found in Quito.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0907568213483147">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lost child conjures up the image of involuntary separation. This image was often presented in the media, in public opinion as well as in Reencuentro’s self-representation as one of the major social problems affecting child welfare and inhibiting children’s rights (the right to family).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0907568213483147">5</xref></sup> Because of their work, Reencuentro was one of the key organizations producing knowledge about disappeared children. During fieldwork I was given permission to review their files, and I systematically searched through all reported cases in the first half of 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2006</xref>). The result of the search was surprising to me. A majority of the 229 registered cases were placed under the category ‘voluntary absences’ – in 71% of cases, children left their families of their own volition – some because they were exposed to violence, abuse and neglect in their homes (34%); some because they had been accustomed to haunt the streets together with other children and youngsters (18%); some because of ‘sentimental’ reasons including early pregnancies (14%); and others because of severe problems at school (11%). Although statistics demonstrated high rates of ‘voluntary absences’ among children, Reencuentro more readily shared and promoted statistics on involuntary separations.</p>
<p>The significant number of cases under the category ‘voluntary absences’ indicates very clearly that separation between children and birthparents (and other primary caregivers) is a much more complex issue than the image of the disappeared or trafficked child often portrayed in public as well as in activist and professional discourse. Even if ‘voluntary absence’ is an imprecise and even misleading concept here, it refers to the decisions of very young persons to leave, escape or distance themselves from the current conditions of (often disturbing and failing) family life and care. Reencuentro statistics on ‘voluntary absences’ indicate a notable presence of what one might construe as <italic>chosen circulation</italic>. The concept refers to children’s acts of separating themselves from a problematic, painful and/or destructive care situation – a care situation externally constrained by economic marginality and structural violence and internally conditioned by the social dynamics in the familial group. Moreover, the circulation chosen should not be understood as optimal with respect to age-specific child development stages and the child’s individual realization as a rights subject. In these care situations children make choices that appear possible and comparatively better (than staying with the familial group). Chosen circulation, then, implies navigating care through shifting social environments, in and out of childhood spaces. And it should be added here that in these cases of chosen circulation, ‘home’ or ‘family’ are not necessarily safe zones of childhood. In the following I will substantiate this issue of child agency and relatedness making under precarious circumstances through a case study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0907568213483147">
<title>Chosen circulation</title>
<p>I first met Alejandro when he was five years old, in the playground of a day care center in the neighborhood area. I had frequent interaction with Alejandro during my fieldwork; we conversed, played and teased one another, and partook in everyday routines at the center for about nine months. From him, I also learned something about a child’s perspective on, and his specific symbolic representations of, relatedness. His personal and family history was a harsh one, and painful to piece together from the social and medical reports on his case. I accessed these through my work at Holt International Children’s Services. Alejandro had, like one of his sisters, run away from home, or rather run away from a confusing, violent and shifting life together with his mother, a stepfather who drank and a younger half-sister. He sought refuge in the house of a <italic>señora</italic> (woman) living nearby who suggested he stay with them for a while. Soon after, Alejandro’s mother moved out of the neighborhood and disappeared for good. The medical examinations that he would undergo some months later indicated that he was sexually abused in his new home, probably by one of the <italic>señora</italic>’s adult sons. Alejandro ran away from his new caregivers and managed to establish contact with the president of the neighborhood association, who took the necessary steps to get Alejandro into foster care. And his new foster family sent him on all weekdays to the day care center where I met him.</p>
<p>In our conversations Alejandro revealed different and very subtle and almost silent images of his precarious social connections: a key to the house he currently lived in, indicating his newly won connection to his foster family; a kite he invented in a story of joyful play with his parents and brothers, indicating the social group he was disconnected from; and an airplane crossing the Andean sky, symbolizing in his view a future possibility of being adopted by a family from another country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0907568213483147">6</xref></sup> These images emerged both as a response to the specific way his social environment was structured, and at the same time out of his own agency, i.e. his decisions to circulate in search of a shelter and a potential home. Previously, I have analyzed this imagery as signs of social belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568213483147">2011</xref>), but through a review of the case I have come to the conclusion that we get a better idea of Alejandro’s being in the world by looking at his various relatedness making intents in shifting and precarious situations of care. Through a subtle and partly inverted symbolism, Alejandro wanted to tell me that although he was maltreated within previous social spaces of belonging (his cohabitation with his birthmother, stepfather and half-sibling; his cohabitation with a neighboring woman and her grown up children), he still carried with him the capacity to relate and connect; to continuously become a social person. His appearance as a sociable being was more important for him to communicate than the destruction and suffering he had been exposed to. Moreover, his capacity to relate and connect was strengthened through his self-initiated circulation. If he had stayed with his family he most probably would have been battered so often and brutally that it seriously would have affected his health and possibilities for survival.</p>
<p>Alejandro’s case challenges us to bring more nuance to the issue of child agency: it would be incorrect to hold that he desired to circulate, but it was necessary because of the circumstances. At the same time, his circulation must be seen as a series of chosen acts, although acts he basically could not necessarily fully assess the outcome or consequences of. Alejandro’s agency in the described situation concerns the optimization of survival in a clearly precarious care situation. Experience of pain, violence and abuse informed his trajectory, as did weak opportunities and an open-ended and unpredictable future of relatedness. Alejandro’s symbolism expressed in a period of circulation indicates clearly the importance for him to keep alive ideas of social connectedness. His acts indicate an insistent search for acceptable new adult caretakers. As a maltreated and neglected child Alejandro was definitely marginalized in relation to his primary caretakers, but through his own efforts he managed to place himself centrally in a process of continuous social becoming. An emphasis on the making of relatedness more than the given structure of belonging (the group he was born into) permits us to view Alejandro as a child navigating through social environments (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483147">Christiansen et al., 2006</xref>). A focus on navigating permits us to capture social structure through the essential human struggle of relating and creating meaningful social associations. Let me exemplify this by looking at Alejandro’s shifting connections in the social world.</p>
<p>The familial unit Alejandro left when he was four years and three months old consisted of his mother, a stepfather and his youngest half-sister. The family group, however, was continuously changing prior to, as well as after, Alejandro’s departure. His mother had four children with four different men; in addition to Alejandro and his youngest half-sister, she also had a 17-year-old son who lived with a maternal cousin, and an eight-year-old daughter who had run away and lived in an orphanage. The mother, who was an internal migrant to Quito, had throughout the years of shifting partnerships also changed dwelling places a series of times, including finding shelter in a public institution. Right after Alejandro left, the cohabitation group gradually dissolved, the mother handed the youngest daughter over to a woman she met in one of the nearby central plazas, and then lost track of her. Soon after, the mother was interned in a hospital where she was treated for tuberculosis. After that she separated from her partner and moved to another area of the city. The social group Alejandro was born into was not relationally stable. I became gradually aware of this as I realized that the joyful stories he related about his Sunday family visits were not only invented events, but also referred to an invented family group that tended to change in size from one conversation to another.</p>
<p>Alejandro’s decisions to move, first to the <italic>señora</italic>’s and after that to the home of the president of the neighborhood association, knitted him into new, albeit weak social ties. He had established these temporary relationships on his own – they resulted from initiatives he took to socialize and spend time with persons unrelated to his former cohabitation unit. Alejandro’s mother made it clear that she had never given away her son; he had simply run away while she had been washing clothes in a public laundry. When Alejandro decided to leave the <italic>señora</italic>’s place after six months he had already befriended the president and his wife, who, over a period had cared for him during the day, offered him food, bathed him and given him clean clothes. One evening he didn’t want to return to the <italic>señora</italic>’s place, explaining that they battered him and did other things that made the president suspect he was being sexually abused. Alejandro stayed in this house until the president reported the case to a municipal agency, which in turn reported to Holt. As a result, Alejandro was transferred to foster care in a family linked to their PPMA program. Interestingly, Alejandro’s navigating, his continuous relatedness making, both made him vulnerable to destruction and linked him to new relevant caretakers.</p>
<p>There is limited information about the specific foster family Alejandro lived in until he was adopted at the age of seven. In this case the welfare professionals did not invite me to meet alejandro’s foster family, since this was considered to be a safe place for him where he should not have unnecessary disturbances. Nevertheless, I have substantial knowledge about other foster families in the same area and linked to the PPMA program. Adult caretakers, married, cohabitating couples and single mothers alike, applied to and signed up in Holt’s foster care program. The program provided children with family-based care while their permanent care situation was cleared. Foster parents received economic compensation for their work, and also received money to cover expenses related to health care, education and to some extent also clothing and food. I made repeated visits to 12 foster families and carried out a series of interviews with parents and especially mothers. This material gives good insight into the kind of relatedness context Alejandro was placed into when he was transferred to foster care.</p>
<p>Formal foster care was a new form of care in this neighborhood area, paralleling well-established informal practices of care. In the many and highly emotional conversations I had with foster mothers (and foster fathers), temporary care was spoken of in terms of strong relational intimacy and incorporation. Whereas the organization’s staff wanted the foster parents to maintain a manageable relational distance, the foster parents themselves identified strongly with a parent–child bond. Different from the organization’s staff, the foster parents seldom referred to themselves as such, but simply as parents and family. And when the foster child finally left, this was expressed in terms of a loss exceptionally difficult to manage. I found that instead of creating rupture, the temporary care situation in the view of the foster parents generated weak to strong social ties. In their view care transferences are not characterized by clean breaks – the relations that are built through daily interaction stay with persons when they circulate to other caretakers, and then gradually fade away as new relatedness making reorients the children within a new family constellation.</p>

<title>Relational fluidity</title>
<p>Strong emotional expressions of family intimacy and loss could in the case of foster care be traced back neither to an essential birthmother–child relationship, nor to a rupture of a prior stable relationship of care. Furthermore, the expressions of loss, suffering and pain do not refer to relational disintegration, but rather to a continuous process of relatedness making. In my view, foster parents’ views of children that temporarily live together with them could be seen as expressions of a popular ethics of relatedness held more generally by dwellers of the neighborhood area. Based on conversations, interviews, observation and also interactions with adults and children in the neighborhood, I outlined a preliminary popular ethics of relatedness. The emic expression <italic>enseñar costumbres</italic> (to teach habits/custom) could be considered a core concept of this relatedness rationale. It refers to parents’, siblings’ and other family members’ everyday making of social relationships through a range of caring, educational, providing and nourishing and food sharing activities. Mestizos from the <italic>sector popular</italic> think of kinship and essential relations in terms of consanguinity, biology and to some extent also in terms of shared biogenetic origins; but the essential must be confirmed through continuous sharing practices that align people to a common source of relatedness. Essential sameness is confirmed through everyday practice, and this also implies that family members might fade away and become more loosely connected to the family collective when the practice of caring and sharing is reduced or even ends for shorter or longer periods. Persons, such as Alejandro, who are not related by blood ties to the members of his foster family can also be included in the family through this kind of everyday sharing and interaction. <italic>Enseñar costumbres</italic> resembles the meaning of the concept <italic>acostumbrar</italic>, described by Leinaweaver in a study of child circulation in Ayacucho, Peru, as ‘practices that constantly produce and reproduce relatedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568213483147">2008</xref>: 99).</p>
<p>Unlike the other care situations Alejandro had been in, an institutional dimension was added to his social environment from the moment he entered into foster care. For example, the institution hired the therapists he had sessions with. In this way child welfare professionals became part of his everyday life. Alejandro’s interaction with child welfare professionals influenced him indirectly and directly to re-work his past and find elements for an amended future self.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0907568213483147">7</xref></sup> So while the foster care arrangement presumably meant a strong but temporary informal family inclusion, the institutional framework must be seen as preparatory work for a distinct permanent care solution – an international adoption. Through this care transference all earlier social ties are annulled in order to instate the adoptive parents as the only nexus of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483147">Fonseca, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0907568213483147">Yngvesson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In my view one could not capture the complexity of Alejandro’s care context without looking at the shifting stages he went through and at the characteristics of the agency that contributed in generating them. A focus on chosen circulation implies an emphasis on individual action in order to make sense of the conditions of possibility in a specific social reality. The case exemplifies the search for rather than the reconfirmation of relatedness. Alejandro’s symbols also reflect this; they convey a movement towards a social home rather than movement within a social home.</p>
<p>Alejandro’s decision to circulate and the propensity in his social environment to support this decision fit well in the more general picture of relational fluidity. A popular ethics of relatedness making reflects a practice of care in which child circulation is common: children circulate within different care networks which implies different possibilities and qualities of care; within the birthmother’s family network, within the birthfather’s or male partner’s family network, in more extensive social networks based on more distant kin, neighbors and/or friends, and finally children may be placed with strangers and in institutions. Some, but relatively few, are also abandoned in public spaces.</p>
<p>A range of different factors occasion child circulation in the neighborhood area. Children and youth can be placed in the homes of relatives as apprentices, to help out in domestic chores and also for educational reasons. The primary care person’s job obligations can hinder her (or him) from taking care of the child for a period – in cases of in-house domestic work, internal labor migration and also because of transnational migration. Intrafamilial violence might escalate and motivate women to place children who are affected, with relatives and neighbors. New cohabitation situations (the woman’s inclusion of a new male partner in her cohabitation unit) and illness and bad health (both in the birthmother and the child) can result in care transference. Moreover, child circulation is not only about the moving around of children due to the dispositions of adult caretakers. As we have seen in the case of Alejandro, surprisingly young children make their own decisions about their care situation that might instigate and influence circulation.</p>
<p>Child circulation, changing cohabitation constellations and relational fluidity are related though not mutually replaceable phenomena that describe dynamics found in the case material from the Holt PPMA archive, and more broadly reflect situations in the neighborhood area. Moreover, a general trend on the national level resembles the particulars of my material and field site. A specialized national census concerning childhood carried out in 2000 reported that one in every 10 Ecuadorian children did not live with their biological parent(s). A majority of these children were involved in informal caretaking arrangements, and as many as 82% of them were taken care of by persons who had some kind of family relationship to the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483147">EMEDINHO, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0907568213483147">
<title>Empirical research and the relational fixity rationale</title>
<p>In this last section I detail how a fixity rationale is expressed in professional child welfare parlance and practice. Child welfare administrators, rights activists and policy formulators are highly aware of child circulation practiced in urban <italic>sectores populares</italic>, but are unable and/or unwilling to see this practice as something distinct from their own way of conceiving relatedness and child care. Practices I have described through a social becoming perspective are systematically translated into policies and interventionist practices that confirm fixity. A notorious lack of correspondence between empirically observed practices and formally recognized principles is common.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0907568213483147">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As part of a decentralization politics in Ecuador during the 1990s and 2000s, most of the child welfare service provision and elaboration of welfare regulations were delegated out to private actors: national and international NGOs and interest organizations. The so-called civil society was also a crucial agent in legal reform and in the promotion and implementation of the rights principles of the UNCRC. One of the central non-governmental actors in Quito in this respect in the first half of the 2000s was a Catholic international NGO, ASA (Asociación Solidaridad y Acción). I had fairly regular contact with ASA’s legal advisor during my fieldwork. As a lawyer she formed part of the core group of Ecuadorian child rights activists who had a decisive influence in the design of the new Childhood and Adolescence Code of 2003.</p>
<p>In talks I had with the legal advisor and the national leader of ASA, I focused on their work with families and child welfare in a marginal neighborhood area in the northern part of Quito. Detailing the characteristics of the families and especially the mothers who received assistance from ASA, these two professionals envisioned very clearly a fluid reproductive sociality: procreation took place in shifting female–male co-partnerships and in-between periods the birth mothers returned to a single motherhood. Child circulation was a common practice and care responsibilities were often delegated to close and not too close relatives, to neighbors or even institutions. In contrast to these empirical observations, the ASA professionals promoted very different programs and projects of intervention. The securing of the birthmother–child bond was central to their work, and in their own view this could be achieved through consciousness raising concerning the values of biological motherhood, and through conditioned economic and practical support.</p>
<p>Although it is not surprising that a Catholic organization would promote conservative family ideals and values, there is a general lesson to be learned from this example. Concerning the translation of observations of social reality into welfare schemes and concrete projects, what is observed is obscured by the establishment of an ideal, explicating relational fixity as a contrast and cure to family disintegration. Here empirical recordings in the files of ASA’s family integration program do not inform the organization’s schemes and procedural descriptions of intervention. They are replaced by another set of values. Something similar could be said regarding Reencuentro’s files of lost children as discussed earlier, and concerning the lack of correspondence between findings in the EMEDINHO’s national childhood survey and national policy formulation. Another telling example is the SINIÑEZ, a subsystem of social indicators on childhood matters that formed part of a state program under construction when I was carrying out my fieldwork called SIISE (Sistema Integrado de Indicadores Sociales del Ecuador). SIISE is a computerized information system on social issues that serve as an instrument in public policy formulation. The design of SINIÑEZ within this system caught my attention since its indicators were formulated to inform measurable categories according to the UNCRC normative. The indicators that should serve as an instrument for empirical data production were deliberately defined on the basis of principles which confirmed a fixity rationale (for more concerning SINIÑEZ, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568213483147">Leifsen, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the Reencuentro files, the EMEDINHO’s national survey, the ASA files and the SINIÑEZ information system were all produced by the same network of ‘civil society’ actors substantially involved in child rights and welfare policy formulation. This network of actors was instrumental in the making of the new Childhood and Adolescence Code of 2003, and they also constituted a strong lobby group influencing the work in the National Congress ratifying the Code.</p>
<p>Ecuadorian social science research differs interestingly from this strong tendency to disregard empirically observable Ecuadorian childhoods. In fact, sociological research on the variation of Ecuadorian family constellations and structures carried out by the independent research institution CEPLAES (Centro de Planificación y Estudios Sociales) in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568213483147">Garcia and Mauro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483147">Larrea, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483147">Mauro, 1992</xref>) played an influential role in the formulation of one of the central national campaigns for family-based care and family reunification – the program ‘My Right to Live in a Family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568213483147">MBS/Corporación Hogar/UNICEF, 1996</xref>). At the level of definition this program demonstrated an unusual sociological awareness of variation in empirically observable Ecuadorian family organization. The CEPLAES studies together with the substantial work on ‘features of the Ecuadorian family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483147">Verdesoto et al., 1995</xref>) are among the few empirical efforts within Ecuadorian academia to map variation within the mestizo majority population. A dominant idea is that the mestizo Spanish-speaking majority population forms part of a common moral universe that constitutes the basis for governing projects of the self and the body – regardless of placement within the social-economic hierarchy. Differences are conceived of and managed in terms of corrections and deviance from a common norm and rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568213483147">Rose, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568213483147">1999</xref>). The multiple ways relational fixity is promoted in dominant public, professional and political discourse and practice produce a blind zone and a membrane, so to speak, that is difficult to see through. Behind this membrane, I argue, we find radically different life worlds and the features of a distinct relatedness rationale.</p>
<p>The insight gained from looking behind this membrane might be irrelevant to legislation and policy formulation rooted in normative principles and authoritative knowledge production. It is definitely relevant to child welfare schemes and to the administration of marginal childhoods. To academic research, however, it is essential – it should inform our study of marginal childhoods and marginal life worlds. In order to make use of this insight, I argue that we have to disconnect our research approaches from our own basic notions and imageries of children, childhood and the family. We should do a better job of distinguishing the normative from the empirically observable. The methodological and analytical challenge implied in moving away from another rationale of relatedness should not be underestimated. In many cases where children circulate, fade away from caretakers and reintegrate in another care setting, it is in my view too easy to link the harshness of and the pain in the accounts to scenarios of rupture and crisis in parenting projects and identities. The image of the lost child too easily emerges.</p>
<p>I had to go many rounds with myself in order to capture another set of conditions for sociality – diverging substantially from the types of conditions that I assume as adequate for the social-emotional development of the child in the family. The fact that I had relatively small children at the time I carried out this research made the challenge even greater. Part of the work I had to do was to overcome certain emotional barriers. I did this by going through an extensive range of child abandonment and children-at-risk cases, which I then discussed in detail with my wife. This was undoubtedly a painful and disturbing process for both of us, especially because we inevitably compared the situations we read about to the vulnerabilities of our own children. To do this kind of work is important in order to be able to understand other ways of relating behind the emotional membrane of our own ethics of relatedness. The possibility of capturing what relational fluidity is about increases significantly by doing systematic emotional work as an integrated part of the research project.</p>
<p>The distance between ways families are practiced in marginal urban mestizo environments ‘of the South’ versus our own educated middle-class environments ‘of the North’, might be questioned. After all, changing partnerships and the sharing of children in extended family networks are not uncommon in modern middle-class family lives. As an empirical reality, modern family life ‘is a fluid and extremely changeable organizational process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568213483147">Sørhaug, 1995</xref>: 17). Although legitimate to compare, I think that the fluidity we live by misleads us when faced with urban marginality. To assume similarity here is to conflate very different conditions of possibility, and to ignore fundamentally different structural positions in relation to power. To look for similarities could easily be a new way of imposing ‘our’ experience on the marginalized. As a result we might be too influenced by the ignorance of governance, and disregard the significance of agency and circulation and the meaning of relatedness in what we most probably will continue to think of as care and circulation of children outside spaces of childhood.</p>
