<abstract>
<p>The Ro52 protein of the Ro/SSA antigen was recently defined as an E3 ligase controlling cytokine production. Autoantibodies from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients targeting the Ro52-RING domain, containing the E3 ligase activity, have been shown to inhibit the E3 ligase activity of Ro52. The objective of the present study was to investigate correlations between clinical parameters in patients with SLE and levels of Ro/SSA (Ro52 and Ro60) and La/SSB autoantibodies, including autoantibodies directed towards the functional RING and B-box domains of the Ro52 protein. SLE patients (<italic>n</italic> = 232) were clinically examined and disease activity indices collected concurrently to blood sampling. The samples were analyzed for immunological parameters including autoantibodies.</p>
<p>Ro52 autoantibody levels were associated with more variables than the other analyzed antibodies and were significantly associated with several individual items related to sSS and the diagnosis of sSS itself (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Other associated variables were high sedimentation rate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003), levels of immunoglobulins (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003), and an inverse correlation with levels of lymphocytes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and leukocytes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Antibodies to the RING domain of Ro52, which is the functionally active domain with E3 ligase activity, were significantly correlated with disease activity as measured by the SLAM score.</p>
<p>We conclude that autoantibodies against Ro52 and in particular its functional RING domain are important in lupus patients and associated with several clinical and laboratory features of the disease. The impact on disease activity of Ro52-RING specific antibodies was especially noted, and could imply a functional role for these autoantibodies in inhibiting Ro52 activity, which is important for the control of proinflammatory cytokine production, including type 1 interferons.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immunological dysregulation and multiple organ manifestations. The disease is heterogeneous and may present in milder or more severe forms. The patients also pass through periods of more or less active disease, which may cause tissue damage in involved organs. Validated indices that measure disease activity and organ damage have been developed for SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313479420">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313479420"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313479420"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313479420">4</xref></sup> These are used both in clinical practice and scientific investigations to guide medical decisions and facilitate comparisons.</p>
<p>SLE is characterized by the production of a large set of autoantibodies targeting different epitopes, many of which overlap with other autoimmune diseases. Autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB are commonly found in patients with both primary Sjögrenás syndrome (pSS) and in SLE. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that antibodies to Ro/SSA appear early, before disease onset, and prior to the occurrence of antibodies to double stranded DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313479420">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313479420">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ro antigen includes a 60-kD and a 52-kD protein, denoted Ro60 and Ro52 respectively. Ro60 has been described to function in a discard pathway of defect 5S RNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313479420">7</xref></sup> while Ro52 is an E3 ligase involved in the biological process ubiquitination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313479420">8</xref></sup> Ubiquitination is a covalent post-translational modification of proteins by the polypeptide ubiquitin. In this process, ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), transferred to a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), followed by a ubiquitin ligase (E3) mediated transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 to a target protein, which leads either to proteolysis in the proteasome, internalization from membranes, or functional alteration of the ubiquitinated protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313479420">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313479420">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ro52 E3 ligase contains two zinc-finger motifs, a RING and a B-box.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313479420">11</xref></sup> The RING domain of Ro52 is functionally active and binds the E2 conjugating enzyme during the ubiquitination reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313479420">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> Autoantibodies targeting the Ro52 RING domain are present in patients with lupus, and have been shown to inhibit Ro52-mediated ubiquitination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> The binding sites of the E2 ligase and Ro52-RING directed autoantibodies overlap, both engaging a valine in position 50 (V50) of the Ro52-RING domain. RING-binding autoantibodies thus abolish Ro52-mediated ubiquitination through steric hindrance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> In its capacity as an E3 ligase, Ro52 mediates ubiquitination of several members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor family, including IRF5, and thereby regulates type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313479420">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313479420"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313479420">15</xref></sup> Autoantibodies directed towards the Ro52 RING domain inhibiting the E3 ligase function of Ro52, could therefore theoretically promote the production of type 1 interferons and lead to enhanced disease activity.</p>
<p>The aim of the present investigation was to perform a detailed study of the occurrence and the levels of antibodies against Ro52, Ro60 and La in a clinically well-characterized SLE cohort, comprising 232 patients. We were specifically interested in studying the clinical correlates of antibodies to the functional domains of Ro52, i.e. the RING and B-box domains. Results were correlated to clinical and laboratory manifestations and to disease activity and organ damage. Longitudinally acquired samples were available for a subset of the cohort, and these were investigated for changes and associations over time.</p>

Data on fulfillment of the items was collected, and the amount of tears and saliva measured in mm and ml, respectively. If a salivary gland biopsy had been performed earlier, results were retrieved from the patient’s records. Fasting blood samples were drawn at inclusion and routine laboratory tests and analyses of complement factors, immunoglobulins and autoantibodies were performed at the SWEDAC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.swedac.se">www.swedac.se</ext-link>) accredited Clinical Chemistry and Immunology Laboratories at the Karolinska University Hospital. Immunofluorescence technique (IFL) was used for analyses of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). IFL or ELISA technique was used for analyses of anti-ds-DNA-antibodies.

<sec id="sec6-0961203313479420"><title>Quantitative ELISA for Ro and La antigens</title>
<p>Patient sera were analyzed for Ro52, Ro60 and La autoantibodies by ELISA technique using purified recombinant antigens as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313479420">20</xref></sup> Briefly, high-binding 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated with 1 µg protein diluted in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, per well overnight at 4°C. All other steps were performed at room temperature. Plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in TPBS (Tween 20 0.05% in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h before addition of patient sera diluted (1:500) in TPBS with 1% milk powder and incubated for 2 h. Bound antibodies were detected by ALP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Dakopatts) 1:2000 in TPBS for 1 h. Phosphatase substrate tablets (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.6, was used as substrate, and optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm after 30 min. Between each step in the process the plates were washed four times with washing buffer (NaCl 9 g/L, 0.05% Tween 20). Refolding was performed over 1 h with 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 9.0 for the recombinant RING and B-box proteins before blocking plates.</p>
<p>For determining relative antibody levels, an arbitrary index value was calculated based on a standard curve for each antigen obtained from a dilution series of five pooled positive patient sera run in parallel.

Ro52 antibody levels also correlated positively with the sedimentation rate, immunoglobulin levels, and with decreased count of both leucocytes and lymphocytes. Typical features of SLE (defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313479420">Table 1</xref>) were analyzed but no significant correlation was found with the levels of the different autoantibodies except for B-box antibodies, where levels were higher in patients with photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203313479420">Table 2</xref>). Notably, we found no correlation between the autoantibodies and any individual severe form of organ manifestation. We even noted an inverse correlation, though not significant, between La autoantibodies and nephritis and serositis (data not shown).

<p>The focus of this study is on the well-known autoantibodies Ro and La, and the more recently discovered subset of autoantibodies against the RING and B-box epitopes of Ro52, and clinical correlates in patients with SLE. A major novel finding is the observation that of the investigated antibodies only those targeting the RING domain of Ro52 were associated with higher disease activity in patients with SLE. This is interesting since anti-RING antibodies can inhibit the E3 ligase activity of Ro52,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> which takes part in the degradation of transcription factors for type 1 interferons, known to mediate higher disease activity in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313479420">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is a new observation that levels of antibodies directed toward the functionally active RING domain of Ro52 are associated with disease activity as measured by the SLAM score. Other commonly used activity indices are BILAG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313479420">25</xref></sup> and SLEDAI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313479420">3</xref></sup> Our choice of SLAM is based on the fact that it excludes immunological variables including autoantibodies thus avoiding a bias when analyzing correlations with autoantibody levels, as well as that it evaluates a large number of items representing several organ systems. It takes both subjectivity and severity into consideration. Studies in other, similarly well-characterized cohorts are desirable for confirmation of our observation that SLE disease activity correlates with Ro52-RING antibodies. The lack of association between clinical activity and the total pool of Ro52 antibodies is not contradictory to our observation, as many other epitopes of the protein have been defined and antibodies to these do not block the functional activity of Ro52.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> The total IgG level also did not associate either with the RING autoantibodies or disease activity scores, which further supports the specific mechanism of the RING specificity as the potential cause of the association found.</p>
<p>Patient autoantibodies binding the RING domain of Ro52 have been demonstrated to block Ro52-mediated ubiquitination by steric hindrance through obstructing access of the E2 ligase to the Ro52 E3 RING domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> Ro52 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the activity of IRF5 and IRF3 transcription factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479420">12</xref></sup> Anti-RING antibodies could thus directly contribute to disease pathogenesis in SLE through inhibition of Ro52 biologic activity in its capacity as a negative regulator of type 1 interferon production, leading to increased IFN-α and -β levels. Increased levels of type 1 interferons are present in a substantial number of lupus patients, and they increase during flares.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313479420">24</xref></sup> Long term treatment with IFN-α can furthermore cause an SLE-like syndrome and commonly gives rise to side-effects with a characteristic autoimmune profile like cytopenia, fever and fatigue all of which occur in SLE and in pSS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313479420">24</xref></sup> Thus, a future study of interest will be to analyse type 1 interferon levels and interferon-induced genes in SLE patients in relation to Ro52-RING antibody occurrence and levels.</p>
<p>The substantial variation of autoantibody titers we found between patients has been described earlier in other SLE cohorts. Immune complex formation may be one explanation for differing antibody levels, and although Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies have not historically been regarded as immune complex forming antibodies, recent studies indicate that immune complexes may form also with Ro/La antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313479420">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313479420">27</xref></sup> The extent and clinical implications of these are however warranting further investigation.</p>
<p>It is reported that sSS affects 9–14% of lupus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313479420">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313479420">29</xref></sup> Classification criteria for both pSS and sSS from 2002<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313479420">19</xref></sup> are used world-wide and they are also often practised as diagnostic criteria. In these criteria, item VI, which includes Ro and/or La autoantibodies, is only used for classification of pSS. We report a positive correlation between Ro52 antibodies and sSS among the investigated SLE patients. WUSF and a positive Schirmer's test, items used for both pSS and sSS, were both associated with Ro52 antibodies. Furthermore, quantitative measures of salivary and tear production were inversely correlated with anti Ro52 antibodies. Ro60 antibody levels correlated with sSS, and negatively with WUSF and salivary production, while La antibody levels were only negatively associated with measures of salivary production. Interestingly, anti-RING and anti-B-box antibodies did not correlate with items included in the classification criteria for pSS/sSS which may relate to the fact that the classification criteria reflect organ damage and not disease activity.</p>
<p>Previous studies have compared subgroups of patients with SLE with, and without, sSS and the main objectives have been to define clinical and laboratory features in the different groups and to compare similarities and differences. Baer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313479420">28</xref></sup> reported that sSS is associated with Ro and La autoantibodies, and with a milder clinical and laboratory phenotype. Positive associations with photosensitivity, oral ulcers and Raynaud's phenomenon and a negative association with renal disease were also noted. Manoussakis and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313479420">29</xref></sup> described similar findings and they also compared pSS to sSS. They reported a high frequency of the HLA-DRB1*0301 allele in both groups. This shared human leukocyte antigen (HLA) profile and similarities in phenotype suggest that pSS and sSS in SLE patients are overlapping entities. It would have been interesting to investigate how often the patients in our cohort fulfilled the classification criteria for both pSS and sSS. The necessary data were however not available, as very few individuals in our cohort had undergone a salivary gland biopsy. The association of autoantibody levels, primarily Ro52 antibody levels, with laboratory parameters such as high sedimentation rate, increased levels of immunoglobulins, decreased levels of lymphocytes and leukocytes, all of which are common in pSS, also supports the interpretation that the two conditions are overlapping entities. Interestingly, hypergammaglobulinemia observed in rheumatic patients can thus be expected to partly relate to autoantibody production and plasma cell activation.</p>
<p>None of the more severe clinical organ manifestations in SLE correlated with levels of La, Ro52, Ro60 or RING or B-box autoantibodies. Photosensitivity and levels of autoantibodies against the B-box domain of Ro52 were however associated. Previous studies have shown that SLE patients with La and/or Ro autoantibodies have less severe disease where skin and joint manifestations dominate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313479420">28</xref></sup> These manifestations are the most common in SLE and thereby also dominate for patients with La and Ro autoantibodies. Very few studies have investigated correlations between Ro and La autoantibodies and clinical manifestations in SLE. Boulware and Hedgpeth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203313479420">30</xref></sup> showed significance between Ro antibodies and pneumonitis in a small cohort with less than 100 patients, but Mittoo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313479420">31</xref></sup> could not reproduce the result for pleuritis. Yee and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313479420">32</xref></sup> found no correlation between Ro and damage indices. For La we noted a non-significant tendency for a negative correlation with more severe forms of clinical manifestations like nephritis and pleuritis in this study. We have recently reported that both Ro and La antibodies were associated with longer survival among SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313479420">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, among SLE patients, carriers of La antibodies were at less risk for cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313479420">33</xref></sup> These observations support the view that, in general, patients with Ro and La antibodies have a milder SLE phenotype. Further studies are needed to confirm if the subgroup of patients with Ro52-RING antibodies has a higher disease activity and thus constitutes an exemption from this view.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed increasing levels of antibodies to the B-box domain over time, indicating that epitope spreading can also occur after the onset of manifest SLE. In general, the levels of Ro and La antibodies did not increase over time, consistent with previous observations where the occurrence and levels of these antibodies have been essentially stable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313479420">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313479420">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203313479420"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313479420">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basic characteristics, clinical disease manifestations and laboratory test results of our cohort are similar to other reports from cross-sectional studies of SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313479420">37</xref></sup> This was expected since all lupus patients followed at the Rheumatology Clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital Solna were invited to participate, regardless of disease severity or duration. The observed basic characteristics of the cohort also indicate that any potential selection-bias has not had a major impact on which patients accepted to participate. The prevalence of more severe organ manifestations was rather low, which could be due to factors such as dominance of Caucasian heredity, established disease and medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313479420">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, our study confirms an association between Ro/La autoantibodies and a milder SLE phenotype which shares clinical symptoms and laboratory features with pSS. We base this conclusion on the fact that we found no correlation between the autoantibodies and any individual severe form of organ manifestation. This was also manifested through the absence of correlations with organ damage measured by SDI which additionally indicates that the patients had not been affected by disease activity in the form of severe organ involvement. We even noted an inverse correlation, though not significant, between La autoantibodies and nephritis and serositis. We further report for the first time that the subgroup of Ro/La positive SLE patients with antibodies to the functional RING-domain of Ro52 have a more active disease. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation and to investigate underlying mechanisms.</p>
