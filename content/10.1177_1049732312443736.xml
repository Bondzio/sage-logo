<abstract>
<p>We conducted a study offering peer support and education to members of families affected by concurrent disorders (CD). This article is an analysis of the qualitative data from a mixed methods study. Using constructivist grounded theory, we analyzed semistructured interviews with participants, with half attending a 12-week support group and reading weekly workbook assignments, and the others receiving the workbook only and being interviewed 3 months later. We developed a model that describes family journeys into, through, and beyond CD, involving three phases connected by two transitional constructs. Preoccupation with the unresolved CD of an ill family member characterized the journey into and through illness, the first two phases, whereas renewal characterized the passage from illness to journeying on toward recovery. Participants had strong comments about health care providers and the service system, and spoke of the need for self-care, empowerment, support, and inclusion.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>Concurrent disorders</italic> (CD) is a term used to describe the cooccurrence of substance use and mental health problems. Such cooccurrence can be synchronic (happening in the same moment) or diachronic (happening over time). For people presenting for treatment at addiction or mental health programs, it is usually both. The estimates of lifetime coprevalence range from 40% to 60%. That said, CD tends to be underdiagnosed and not adequately treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312443736">Health Canada, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312443736">Rush, Urbanski, Bassani, Castel, &amp; Wild, 2010</xref>). In the past, most programs specialized in either mental health or addiction treatment. When people presented with both sets of problems, things often did not go well for the patient or the concerned family members. Often, the set of problems that are outside the mandate of the treatment setting were not assessed or included in the treatment plan.</p>
<p>People with concurrent disorders experience complex problems that are difficult to understand, let alone treat. Evidence suggests that substance use, abuse, and dependence in persons with mental illness are major factors in problems with community living, relapse, psychiatric readmission, involvement with the criminal justice system, and a range of other problems that compromise quality of life and prognosis for sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312443736">Biegel, Katz-Saltzman, Meeks, Brown, &amp; Tracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312443736">Biegel &amp; Wieder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312443736">Clark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312443736">Corrigan, Steiner, McCracken, Blaser, &amp; Barr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312443736">Silver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312443736">Swofford, Kasckow, Scheller-Gilkey, &amp; Inderbitzen, 1996</xref>). These problems include self-harm and attempted suicide, and psychosocial crises such as severe interpersonal conflict, failed interpersonal relationships, and loss of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312443736">Primm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312443736">Rush et al., 2010</xref>). Additional chronic problems can include persistent positive and negative symptoms commonly found in more severe forms of mental illness, unemployment, poor financial management, homelessness, compromised nutritional status, self-care deficits, emotional dysregulation, demoralization, low levels of motivation, lack of employment, and overall increased mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312443736">Clark, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312443736">Clark &amp; Drake, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312443736">Dixon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312443736">Drake, Rosenberg &amp; Mueser, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>People with CD are more likely to seek help, but are less likely to remain in treatment or to achieve positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312443736">Rush et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312443736">Sciacca &amp; Hatfield, 1995</xref>). Although there has been progress toward better understanding of and treatment for people with CD, and a growing literature to inform and support clinicians to more effectively address these problems, many people seeking help still experience frustration, exclusion, and failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312443736">Bulger, Wandersman, &amp; Goldman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312443736">Daley, Moss, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312443736">Mueser, Noordsy, Drake, &amp; Fox, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312443736">Skinner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312443736">Watkins, Lewellen, &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>I’ve gotten help for each individual thing, but to get help for, like at the same time, you fall between the cracks and if one of your disorders is worse than another and then one doctor thinks you’re seeing someone else, basically nobody’s helping you, nobody follows up, you kind of disappear in there. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312443736">Health Canada, 2002</xref>, p. 74)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Having an ill family member (IFM) with CD can have powerful effects on overall family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312443736">O’Grady, 2005</xref>). We know that the development of CD often starts in adolescence and follows a course that can last for many years. What are the effects of CD on people close to the ill person, whether family or friend? They are the ones who are most likely to notice the early stages of these problems, and to experience the impact on family, peer relationships, neighborhood, community, school, and workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312443736">Greenberg, Kim, &amp; Greenley, 1997</xref>). Before a person with CD is involved in the health care or social service system, these problems are already written into the life stories of those close to the person with CD.</p>
<p>In spite of the dire picture that these data suggest, consumers have developed and promoted an empowerment movement which is based on a logic of recovery. In the past decade, the evolving recovery movement has become a foundational element in policy and practice in addiction and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312443736">Kirby &amp; Keon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312443736">Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312443736">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Health Services, 1999</xref>). Consumers have shared stories of change, renewal, growth, and their hope to live full lives on whatever terms are available to them. Concerned family members (CFMs) have sought to preserve these aspirations even as they watched their loved ones become disabled through addiction and mental illness.</p>
<p>Recovery is unique to each person and to each situation. It is not necessarily an overcoming of mental illness or addiction, and can be more difficult for someone struggling with both mental illness and addiction. When one problem improves, there is always the risk that the other problem might become worse. Recovery as a possibility can take root with improvement in one small area amid multiple challenges and limitations. Sustaining recovery requires journeying on.</p>
<p>CFMs travel roads that are alongside but different from those their loved ones traverse through illness and recovery. CFMs play major roles in the care and support of persons with CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312443736">Townsend, Biegel, Ishler, Wieder, &amp; Rini, 2006</xref>). Having an IFM can interrupt regular daily life, activate stressful emotions, derail social activities, and disrupt family life. It can cause significant interpersonal and financial stress, and evoke feelings of grief, guilt, shame, and exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312443736">Mueser &amp; Fox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312443736">Perlick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312443736">Sciacca &amp; Hatfield, 1995</xref>). As a result, many CFMs experience objective and subjective burden, anxiety and depression, feelings of hopelessness, disempowerment, and stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312443736">Cavaiola, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312443736">Jutras &amp; Veilleux, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312443736">O’Grady, 2005</xref>). CFMs often have limited access to the resources, information, and support they need to help their loved ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312443736">Clark; 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312443736">Clark &amp; Drake, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312443736">Dixon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312443736">Drapalski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312443736">Jubb &amp; Shanley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312443736">Kelly &amp; Newstead, 2004</xref>; Sciacca &amp; Hatfield). Even when efforts are made to include family members, there is a lack of positive knowledge about how to involve them effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312443736">Jevne &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312443736">Mueser, Fox, &amp; Mercer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312443736">Mueser et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of recovery has not often been applied to CFMs affected by CD in a loved one. What can we learn about recovery from listening to and working with CFMs? What are the experiences of illness and recovery from the vantage of members of the ill person’s family? Ours is the first study we know of in which the experiences of illness and recovery from the perspectives of members of families affected by CD have been explored.</p>

<title>Background Context</title>
<p>The qualitative results and conceptual model we discuss in this article evolved out of the qualitative data analysis of a larger mixed method intervention study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312443736">O’Grady &amp; Skinner, 2007</xref>). In that study, we compared a 12-week, professionally facilitated peer support/educational group for CFMs to an intervention in which the CFMs did not take part in a support group. Those who did not attend the support group were each given a copy of the workbook that was used in the group, to use as they wished for a period of 12 weeks. In preparation, we convened a focus group and then ran a pilot group to help us decide on the content for the group sessions. The session topics were information about CD, mental health problems and substance use problems, the effects of CD on the family, family member self-care, stigma, psychopharmacology, the treatment system, relapse prevention, and coping with crises and emergencies. The study interventions were designed for CFMs and did not include the IFMs with CD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312443736">
<title>Study Setting and Participants</title>
<p>We conducted the study at two sites: an academic health science center in a large city and a mental health center in a smaller community. The study involved selective sampling of adults over the age of 18 years who had an adult family member suffering from cooccurring mental illness and substance use problems. CFMs included the blood relative, spouse, partner, significant other, or close friend of someone with CD. Participants joined the study through a process of self-referral. We randomly assigned them to either the support/educational group intervention or to the workbook-only intervention. There were 20 CFMs in the two peer support and education groups, whereas 18 were in the workbook-only condition, across the two study sites.</p>
<p>The majority of the participating CFMs were married (60%) women (80%), with a mean age of 50.8 years; the majority of their IFMs were men (75%) with a mean age of 31.8 years. More than half of the study participants (55%) were parents of the IFM; the rest were spouses (15%), siblings (10%), or partners (10%). According to study participants, more than 25% of IFMs were suffering two or more psychiatric problems at the time of the study, not including substance-use disorders. Diagnoses included major affective disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, anxiety disorder (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and personality disorder (primarily borderline personality disorder). Another 25% were suffering from one of the following problems: bipolar disorder (20%), depression (15%), schizophrenia (15%) or other disorders (10%). In addition to these mental health problems, CFMs identified 80% of IFMs as polysubstance users, with 15% using only depressant drugs (such as alcohol or heroin alone) and 5% using only stimulants (such as methamphetamines). Of the entire sample from both interventions, 35% of the participants lived with their IFMs at the time of the study. Fifty percent of CFMs had daily contact with their IFMs, whereas 30% had weekly contact and 15% had contact twice per month. We used pre- and postintervention quantitative questionnaires to measure social support, personal mastery and self-efficacy, coping, and caregiver burden. We conducted postintervention, semistructured interviews with each participant. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim.</p>
<p>We used a brief guide that contained a few semistructured probes, such as: Describe your experience of being assigned to the (support group or workbook-only group) intervention. What was it like to be a part of this intervention? What were some of the positive and negative aspects of participating in this project? We also invited participants to speak freely and elaborate on their experience of being close to someone with CD. The qualitative interviews lasted between 30 and 120 minutes. The original purpose of the interviews was to determine the participants’ perceptions and opinions of their assigned intervention. Use of a semistructured interview strategy allowed for more detailed exploration into the benefits and limitations of each of the interventions, as did our inclination to give participants as much time as they needed to have their say. We invited participants to speak freely and elaborate on their experiences as a CFM of someone with CD.</p>

<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>We received ethics approval from both the large city mental health and addiction teaching hospital and from the university affiliated with the small town outpatient mental health community agency. Both research ethics review boards approved the mixed methods and the qualitative components of the research study.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-1049732312443736">
<title>Constructivist Grounded Theory</title>
<p>We chose to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312443736">Charmaz’s (2006)</xref> constructivist grounded theory (CGT). Charmaz posited that both the research process and the studied world are socially constructed through actions, but that social historical conditions constrain these actions. She recognized that researchers play active and vital roles in the research process, particularly in the developing dialogue between researchers and data from which codes, categories, and eventually a grounded theory result. Drawing on CGT, we placed emphasis on researcher reflexivity, the research context, and the inevitable influence of prior knowledge, practice, and the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312443736">Mruck &amp; Mey, 2007</xref>). Charmaz emphasized that “constructivism assumes the relativism of multiple social realities, recognizes the mutual creation of knowledge by the viewer and the viewed, and aims toward interpretive understanding of subjects’ meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312443736">2000</xref>, p. 510). By using the constructivist approach we can interpret the world being studied, but cannot produce an exact picture (replica) of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312443736">Charmaz, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312443736">2000</xref>). Participants’ stories therefore reflect the viewer as well as the viewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312443736">
<title>Sampling, Memoing, and Thematic Analysis</title>
<p>We used selective sampling to recruit participants into the study. During the early qualitative data collection and analysis phases, we moved from using selective sampling and open coding to more theoretical sampling (in terms of the questions being asked of participants and the qualitative themes emerging) and increasingly focused coding of the data. The interview questions evolved as we listened to the study participants talk about what it was like to have an IFM with CD. We compared theoretical constructs and additional empirical indicators until both investigators agreed that all data fit into a particular phase of the family journey and into one of the major constructs within a particular phase on that journey. In addition, we drew on highly detailed memo writing at every stage of the data analysis process to assist in determining when the point of theoretical saturation had been reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312443736">
<title>Study Rigor</title>
<p>Qualitative researchers use the concept of trustworthiness to measure the extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312443736">Jenson, 2008</xref>). We attempted to ensure dependability (the degree to which study results can be consistently linked to the data) within the evolving context of the research by verifying that the findings accurately expressed the meanings intended by the participants (Jenson). We tracked all alterations to the research design, such as the changes in method that we made by moving from selective to theoretical sampling and from open to focused coding. We also sought external consultation to ensure that changes in research design had both methodological and theoretical foundations and were consistently linked to the data.</p>
<p>To ensure the credibility of the study, we established a link between what the participants expressed in their interviews and the codes and themes that emerged during data analysis. We asked these key questions: Were the appropriate participants selected for the topic of study? Was the appropriate methodology for data collection used? Were participants’ responses as open, complete, and sufficiently detailed as possible? We used the following methodological procedures: establishing enough contact with the participants within the context under study to acquire the information we needed; looking at data from different perspectives and viewpoints to obtain the most holistic picture possible; turning to colleagues knowledgeable in this area to review and critique research and data analysis findings; and checking with family member participants to make sure that the data analysis was accurate and consistent with their beliefs and perceptions.</p>
<p>We addressed confirmability by accounting for the influence of our own personal input on data coding and analysis procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312443736">Jenson, 2008</xref>). We used more than one coder of the same data to establish consistency in the coding of themes. We maintained an open process of reflexive conversation throughout. We made the research process transparent by clearly describing how the data were collected and analyzed, and by offering examples of the coding process. Selected family members were asked to review portions of the coding and meaning-making processes. They confirmed that our interpretations were consistent with their perspectives and perceptions. Finally, we used the test of transferability to improve the rigor of the study. Transferability implies that findings can be applied to other contexts and situations beyond the scope of the particular research study (Jenson). We saw it as our responsibility to provide a full and accurate description of the study design, process, and context so that readers of the study documents could determine if this work was transferable to other settings.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732312443736">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>As we listened to the participants’ stories, we were struck by their unique dimensions. At the same time, we noticed the emergence of a grounding metaphor around which the main findings could be organized. The metaphor is one of journey and journeying. This is not just the ill person’s journey, but the passage that family members and concerned others make because someone they care about is suffering complex, persistent problems. Family members needed to talk about their unplanned travels into and through illness before they could focus on the present and the future. We found that these family journeys tended to have three phases: the journey into illness, the journey through illness, and journeying on. We have organized the findings into these phases. Rather than creating theoretical concepts to explicate them, we employ the language study participants themselves used to present these findings.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732312443736">
<title>Journey Into Illness</title>
<p>Clinicians in addictions and mental health tend to pay less attention to the descent into illness than to the person’s current status and the immediate issues. When we stepped back and listened to the stories family members had to tell, we discovered they needed to bear witness to what they had already been through.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312443736">
<title>Struck by lightning</title>
<p>It is easy for people to become complacent and preoccupied by their own daily routines. When serious health care problems strike a family member, the entire family is often shocked out of its complacency. The routines of everyday life are threatened. Participants described this initial shock as the start of a roller coaster ride that was out of their control. The journey might start with a question: “What is it: mental illness or addiction?” One of the mothers in the study described the impact of discovering that her son was suffering from problems that were beyond her comprehension:
<disp-quote><p>We were sure drugs were causing [our son] to withdraw from other people. We were relieved to find out about his drug problem—we could do something concrete to help him, like put him in rehab [rehabilitation]. But even when he wasn’t smoking pot [marijuana] or drinking, he still got worse! It was another two years before we found out he had a mental illness as well as a drug problem. We’d never heard of concurrent disorders before then. That’s when the real shock hit us. It’s like we’d been struck by lightning. We were overwhelmed by it all.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For these parents, the greater shock did not hit until they realized that their son was having difficulty with far more than substance use. From thinking it was a straightforward problem that could be directly addressed, they were thrown into a state of confusion that took years to sort out.</p>
<p>Another parent talked about the impact of the loss of the “daughter she had always known” on the family as a whole:
<disp-quote><p>I liken it to losing a limb—the rest of your body has to take over functions that used to be automatic and fluid. Only here, when my daughter got sick, our family didn’t have a clue what to do. It changed everything.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This deep sense of loss could become a pervasive source of trauma for CFMs. Some participants compared this sense of loss to grieving the death of a loved one. As one participant whose brother developed schizophrenia and started using marijuana and methamphetamines recalled, “I remember walking around saying to myself, ‘Where did my brother go?’”</p>

<title>The ostrich thing</title>
<p>For many family members, the distress that accompanied the realization that a loved one might be suffering from more than one serious illness was too much to accept:
<disp-quote><p>I do the ostrich thing and stick my head in the sand. You know, so I don’t see any of it. I blind myself to all the problems. And that’s the way I usually cope with stuff like this. I either get totally obsessed with it all, where I can’t think about anything else or do anything else, or I do the ostrich thing and hope it just all goes away, you know?</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several study participants recalled having similar responses. Ignoring the problem in the hope that it would either resolve itself or simply disappear was often an attempt to decrease stress and preoccupation.</p>

<sec id="section13-1049732312443736">
<title>One roadblock after another</title>
<p>Most families eventually realized that an IFM was in trouble and that something needed to be done. The first efforts were usually made within the family and with informal supports on which it could draw. When families sought formal help, they assumed that things would improve; however, the CFMs had story after story about the frustrations they experienced when they approached the health care system:
<disp-quote><p>It took so much energy on our part to even get [our son] to the doctor. And once we managed to get him there, it was one roadblock after another. When your kid has a serious mental illness and uses drugs, you can’t get any help, plain and simple. We were on our own, you know?</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Disillusionment was the norm for participants:
<disp-quote><p>Getting through the system is impossible sometimes! We’ve felt lost at sea so many times. When you ask for details, like who can help us with this, where should we start, what is available out there, how does it all work, and so on. And the professionals said, “Well, you’ll just have to start with the yellow pages [in the telephone book].”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Families found that the very resources that appeared to be most qualified to address the frustrating complexity of concurrent disorders were uninviting and evasive. For some participants, this felt like hypocrisy—a fundamental disconnect between talk and action:
<disp-quote><p>What I really need to know is, how do we talk to professionals who don’t want to treat our son? And what do we do when the door is shut in our face? Because to be left with nothing, no treatment options, no one to turn to, for us, that’s been the most disheartening thing. We can tell you a hundred stories of what it’s like to be left standing in the rain with nowhere else to go, not knowing who to turn to next.</p>
<p>I went to the justice of the peace [an appointed judicial officer], and the police took [my daughter] to the hospital emergency room. The staff told me it was going to be at least five hours before they decided what they were going to do with her, and that I might as well go home. I went back to work and called them, and the psychiatrist had assessed her. And then discharged her! And I was, like, “This is ridiculous!”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These stories show that, when seeking help for an IFM, families could be tenacious, sometimes taking extreme measures to secure help. When clinical assessment led to a decision not to admit the IFM to care, the very experience of seeking help could be invalidating and demoralizing for CFMs. Family tensions and conflict could intensify, with CFMs vulnerable to feeling more rebuked than engaged.</p>

<sec id="section14-1049732312443736">
<title>The Journey Through Illness</title>
<p>The journey into illness gradually leads to a second phase in which the complexities of the IFM’s problems become more evident. The difficulty a CFM has in understanding these problems is matched by diagnostic confusion and ambiguity as the IFM becomes involved with health care and social services. The family’s inability to support, direct, or challenge the person to more healthy levels of functioning is mirrored by repeated failure to find effective remedies through professional treatment. Participants spoke about becoming increasingly preoccupied with the troubles and suffering of the IFM.</p>
<sec id="section15-1049732312443736">
<title>Carrying this albatross</title>
<p>Most health problems and health care needs are relatively straightforward if the person with the problem recognizes that he or she needs help. This simple paradigm shapes most of the system of care in health and social services. But what if, because of the nature of the illness, people do not understand that the difficulties they are facing are health and social problems for which they are entitled to care, support, and intervention? What if the problems are so ambiguous and complex that health care experts, when they are consulted, are not able to offer a clear understanding of the problems? What if the experts say that before people are eligible for one set of specialized services, the other components of these complex problems have to (somehow) be dealt with? For example, some mental health programs make abstinence from substance use a precondition for treatment for an eating disorder. Addiction agencies might insist that people do not have active psychosis when they enter an addiction treatment program. These are some of the excluding practices that IFMs and CFMs experience when they seek help for CD. Receiving help for CD is further problematized if the IFM lacks insight into to the nature of his or her problems and is not at imminent risk of violence or self-harm. The burden of care then falls back on CFMs:
<disp-quote><p>You realize that you’ve been thinking nonstop about this whole problem and what it’s done to everybody in the family. It’s like carrying this heavy burden around, a big heavy albatross, that you’ve been forced to carry. It just got so heavy that you can’t deal with one more thing or you might just drop it, and then you’re really in trouble, ’cause you can’t manage any more.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The health care system is designed for people who are ready and willing to receive care. When the IFM did not want help or was unable to seek help, the family might have thought that they were caught in a situation from which there was no respite. They were on their own:
<disp-quote><p>My wife would start getting sick again, but I was too worn out. I’d go to bed at night feeling like I’d been in a fist fight with somebody, bruised, and battered. Except for something like this, your bruises are on the inside.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants talked about how the burden of being a caregiver drained them, body and spirit: “There are times when . . . when I could just tear my hair out and just scream at her, ‘Why don’t you call me? I’ve been sick with worry!’”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312443736">
<title>Double the stigma, double the pain</title>
<p>Because family members were often seen as part of the cause of the IFM’s problems, they might have been reluctant to seek help for the IFM and for themselves. Parents in particular might have become acutely sensitive to the effects of stigma. One participant, the father of a young man who was suffering from schizophrenia and polysubstance use, observed,
<disp-quote><p>One of the other key things for me was listening to all of the mothers in the group talk about what they think they did wrong. You know, some parents feel stigmatized, blamed for their kids’ problems . . . because my wife . . . for a long time she said things like, “If only I had done such and such differently.” And then listening to the other people in the support group say almost exactly the same thing, implying that part of it was their fault.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many families had an intuitive sense right from the very beginning that they were more vulnerable to stigma by association because they were dealing with two or more problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312443736">
<title>The conflict inside you</title>
<p>Participants commented on the glib ways that others proffered advice or spoke without understanding the depths of the problems that the family was facing:
<disp-quote><p>It’s the conflict you have inside of you, trying to figure out when you should give in and when you should say no, when you should set some limits. It’s easy for other people to say, “You just have to tell her, ‘No!’ The more you give in, the more she’ll take advantage of you.” And I know they’re right: I should be a bit harder. But she’s my daughter and I keep seeing her as a little baby, and “just saying no” to her is a lot harder than most people realize. I have so much conflict inside. When I know she needs money, but I don’t know what she’s going to spend it on, it feels like I’m being torn apart sometimes.</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="section18-1049732312443736">
<title>Journeying On</title>
<p>In this phase of the family journey of recovery, the family’s view of the whole experience shifts. Consistent with the realities of the ill person’s recovery experience, this transformation is not a magical cure from sadness, anxiety, and worry; rather, it is marked by a cautious but hopeful sense of renewal and the ability to move on. CFMs reported an enhanced ability to let go. Having acquired a more informed and confident view of the problems posed by their loved one’s CD, they acknowledged a renewed appreciation for the little things in life, including small, everyday triumphs.</p>
<sec id="section19-1049732312443736">
<title>Keeping the light on</title>
<p>A detailed analysis of the notion of hope broke down into two primary components in the study. The first was the ability of CFMs to hold the hope for their ill loved ones in times of despondency, lost goals and dreams, crisis, and relapse. They said that the opportunity to meet with other families helped them recognize that they shared a formidable task, but that each family went about it in a different way:
<disp-quote><p>[For] those of us who have been dealing with this for a long time and encouraging our sick family members to keep going and keep trying, it’s like being in a lighthouse. As the caregiver, you keep the light on, and you’re always ready for a setback, just in case; and you don’t get completely down when something does happen.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This mother was able to hold the hope for her ill son when the young man was unable to do so himself. This was not a denial of reality, but rather a choice about how to address what was going on. Another participant commented,
<disp-quote><p>My daughter said to me, “I’ve lost everything. I’ve had to start over again eight million times.” And so I said to her, “So make it eight million and one times.” You know, it’s like trying to put a positive spin on the situation—to give her a bit of hope.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The second component was our analysis of what the participants had gained from other members of the support group. The majority of participants said that the group experience had renewed and restored their spirits and energy. Although the intervention was designed as a support and education group, these comments illustrate that therapeutic factors also were present:
<disp-quote><p>The benefit of the group was more nebulous. The process was of meeting with the group and getting to know people, and hearing their stories and seeing that, in spite of all their hardships, they are still functioning. They are making progress and living their own lives, but still working to help the one they love to get through. You know, it’s kind of that, it was hopeful in a way that I didn’t see it coming. Something was positive but not tangible. You know it’s there but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>
<p>The other participants in the group, you could tell that they were dealing with difficult circumstances. So it shows that there really is light at the end of the tunnel. It really gave me a different perspective on everything.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One participant talked about the interrelatedness of both holding hope and giving hope as CFMs:
<disp-quote><p>The thing that resonated the most for me was that I felt some hope, and not just for me, but for my son as well. It’s important to try and find ways to give him hope, and for us to have hope, and those two things are obviously pretty closely tied together.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312443736">
<title>Coaches and kindred spirits</title>
<p>All of the participants talked about the importance of understanding, unconditional acceptance, validation, and respect from each other, significant others, and health care professionals. They were unanimous in their insistence that emotional and tangible support was an essential part of their own processes of recovery. One CFM spoke frankly about being surprised by his reaction to the support group. For years he had sought the services of a number of different health care providers at several different institutions and agencies. He admitted that both he and his wife, having “been around the block a time or two,” were cynical about the benefits of another “family education group about mental illness and addiction.” His participation in the group resulted in something unexpected and restorative, although he could not explain how it had happened:
<disp-quote><p>By the end of the group, you felt like you’d been a part of something that felt good, something that was restorative, which was kind of the opposite of how I thought I’d feel. Like I said, at the beginning of the group, I wasn’t so sure about how I was going to feel coming out of the group, but the positive effect is a testament to the whole thing.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He added, “It kind of gives you appreciation for the strength that people have. It helps you see that you can have that strength yourself. It’s very affirming.”</p>
<p>These quotes coalesce around a key theme: sharing a common identity. For most participants, there was a powerful sense of kindredness and community. They respected and drew on one another’s knowledge and experience, giving and taking support and encouragement in a reciprocal manner. They saw not just the staff facilitators but everyone around the table as coaches and kindred spirits. However, listening to other narratives left one participant feeling demoralized and guilty. She found herself comparing her own situation with her son to the situations of other group members:
<disp-quote><p>I found for myself, often when I left the group, I felt a little bit down, and I think that’s because I have a problem with guilt, and I would hear the other family members talk and some seemed to be doing more with their kids than I was doing with my son. So I was comparing a lot, and that’s what I tend to do: I kind of get down on myself. And so I just found that sometimes I would get discouraged and think that I wasn’t doing enough for my son.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This reminded us that, even when a concept is strongly articulated, there will be opposing concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312443736">
<title>Thirsty for information</title>
<p>The CFMs who participated in this project wanted to know more about cooccurring addiction and mental health problems. The materials in <italic>A Family Guide to Concurrent Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312443736">O’Grady &amp; Skinner, 2007</xref>), the workbook that participants were given, was one source of information that they valued. Their search for information went well beyond that:
<disp-quote><p>For me, both the support we got from the group and the information were helpful. There was so much I didn’t know. And we always had a handout to read, and then we talked about all of it. I always took the time to read everything because I was especially thirsty for information on both [mental health and substance use] problems and how they go together.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants also talked about how knowledge helped them feel more confident and able to cope:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think I’m far more relaxed now about the whole mental health and substance abuse problem. It was a great comfort hearing from the other people and their particular stories, and problems that they were dealing with, and that I too have faced in the past and didn’t handle that well. So it gave me insight into how to handle future episodes maybe a little differently. And so you get a sense of a little more control or self-confidence that, “Yes, I can handle this better next time.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They spoke of feeling calmer, less fearful, more in control, more aware, and more resilient:
<disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge dispels fear. Knowledge is powerful. And then at least I know who I can go to, who I can call, where I can get help or support. When you have that, you’re that much calmer, whereas when you’re very new to this, the fear is magnified, and you feel paralyzed.</p>
<p>That was a good thing, to learn new things about concurrent disorders. I really feel that I learned an awful lot. Now I feel a huge sense of confidence in dealing with my son and my family, and my own emotions. It just increased my knowledge in so many directions, to the point where I feel more positive and like I can handle so much more.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There were practical dimensions to the providing of information and knowledge that participants valued:
<disp-quote>
<p>The [family CD] material provided valuable information to help me understand our daughter’s simultaneous battles on two fronts. Other materials I’ve read that address only addiction or only mental health problems have not been as helpful because they have missed critical interrelationships between the two. This information for families shows how intertwined they can be in some cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants were knowledge agents as well as knowledge seekers. They shared what they knew with others, and put the information and knowledge into practice in their own circumstances:
<disp-quote><p>I learned about waiting for your family to respond to new ideas. Your family might need time to digest it, get used to it. New stuff can be intimidating. It’s important to try as many times as it takes. So I learned not to give up. You have to wait ’til people are ready. That was really new for me, ’cause I’ve never been the most patient person, you know?</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Even when they were self-critical and frustrated, these CFMs possessed practical wisdom. Often their negative experiences when they sought help and support had caused them to lose sight of this. Yet, when provided with information, they used it to be more self-reflective, and to become more balanced and clear about what could reasonably be done. They became more resolute in their convictions that caring and support matter on the long journey of chronic illness and renewal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732312443736">
<title>Self-care virtuosos</title>
<p>Personal self-care emerged as one of the most important and also one of the most uncomfortable themes for the participants. For example: “If the health care system just took care of our ill loved ones, then we as the family members would be fine as well”; “If you fix my ill loved one, you will fix me.” Many said that they were not skilled in the area of self-care, and that they were often too tired, too preoccupied, and too busy to stop and think about their own needs:
<disp-quote><p>I can’t talk about taking care of myself. I feel too guilty. I’m just fine. Please just help me get my family member into treatment or properly assessed in the emergency department and admitted as an inpatient. Then I’ll feel better and then I will focus on myself.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They were suffering the effects of caregiver burden, anxiety, guilt, and hopelessness. A few of them found that their physical and emotional health deteriorated dramatically.</p>
<p>When the participants finally decided to do something for their own physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health, they were amazed to find that many of their other problems became more manageable. For some of them, self-care became their first priority because they realized that without it, they would slip back into preoccupation and trying to control situations in which they needed to just let go:
<disp-quote><p>This whole experience has been a nightmare in a lot of respects, but I always make sure that I don’t get too stressed out. I have a workout routine, and part of that whole regimen is trying to eat healthy. When it comes to taking care of myself, I guess I would say I’m a “self-care virtuoso.” You have to be when you’re in the middle of something like this.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, an important part of taking care of oneself, of being conscious of one’s own physical, emotional, and spiritual health, and of gaining control over these and other related aspects of one’s life, also involves a kind of “letting go” or a “giving up of control.” I also found the self-care [material] really impactful. I think it helps you to be calmer about everything: you can start to let stuff go, and I think that makes you stronger. It also helps you to realize in kind of a realistic way what your limitations are, you know? The self-care theme just can’t be overstated.</p>
<p>I realized that I had no control over some situations, so I just may as well move on. I got more control of my own life. I decided I couldn’t control what was happening around me and I learned to deal with it better.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These comments highlight the ways in which taking care of themselves became a central theme in CFM recovery journeys. Self-care included taking time out to meditate, engaging in some kind of enjoyable physical activity, and becoming physically and mentally stronger. It included mental and emotional recovery; for example, knowing when to let go of a problem. It also involved learning about themselves and their limits, and taking care not to exceed them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732312443736">
<title>Finding the way together</title>
<p>Empowerment, seen from a family perspective, is not only about autonomy and independence; it also includes connection and interdependence. The following comment speaks to the need to recognize that families play important roles in responding effectively to CD: “Professionals need to be aware of the role of encouragement and praise to families as well. Professional staff need to know how to make families feel that they have some power and control in the situation.” The next comment reveals a pragmatic awareness of what CFMs were often up against, and a more resolute commitment to become a skillful advocate for the family perspective:
<disp-quote><p>We have to be strong and knowledgeable. [Family members] have to become “system navigators,” like a new profession that requires education and training. We have to be proactive and learn what to do, who to call, what kind of program is best, and how to find the right spot in the system. And we have to develop negotiation skills and talk like we have knowledge. You have to be active with the health care system and not reactive. When you’re trying to get help for your family member, the dynamic is not that the system is serving you; the dynamic is that you’re getting what you need out of the system, and that takes effort.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This illustrates the desire of CFMs to be recognized, respected, connected, and interdependently engaged with caring professionals in an effective health care system. Listening to and learning from one another was seen as particularly validating in becoming more confident and informed about how to be more effective in interacting with health care workers:
<disp-quote><p>One of the other mothers in the group said something really, really impactful during one of the sessions, and that was, ah, “Knowledge is power.” I can’t remember how she phrased it, but, well, when you’re dealing with the health care system, the presentation of knowledge actually invokes action on the part of professionals.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Seeing someone speak up in a way that exposed a problem and talk about how to use knowledge to address it was memorable for this participant. The positive social context of the group helped to build a sense of empowerment. Participants felt more equipped and supported in their own worlds.</p>
<p>Study participants spoke about needing to find others who were in similar situations. They began to believe that they could find the way together better than they could alone. The idea that they could sometimes turn to a wise peer who would listen and offer support or provide advice had very strong appeal:
<disp-quote><p>I would like to see more information on the kinds of peer supports that are available to families, you know, that kind of thing. But, for instance, take the situation where you’re in a crisis, or you’re going through a crisis with your family member. Who do you call first? And what can you expect when you do make the call?</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Part of the work CFMs did was to search for options, for things that kept the door to the future open. This was less about problem solving and more about a commitment to journeying on:
<disp-quote><p>When I have a problem in my own life, I make sure I have multiple paths and plans so that if something fails, I can get to the next plan, and if that fails, there’s a bridge over to the next route. So I kind of build bridges, you know, to get to the end. And I kind of plan like that. I don’t let things get to the point where, I mean, I plan everything so that in the case where, if someone says, “No,” and just, and shuts the door, I would always want to have a backup plan.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>CFMs were there before the IFM came into care, and they were there when an episode of treatment was concluded. Typically, CFMs were not included in the formal treatment process. Participants talked about ways they were excluded from the formal helping processes that IFMs received. In their commitment and in their practical wisdom, CFMs pointed the way to more holistic and inclusive approaches to helping people whose problems could be too hard to understand, and who received care in systems that were usually too hard to navigate.</p>

<sec id="section24-1049732312443736" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although we started this project with a narrow focus, we expanded our focus as we listened to what participants told us about the impact of CD on their families. We altered the interview guide so we could pursue new lines of thinking that were emerging directly from analysis. We employed thematic analysis and theoretical sampling in an iterative fashion so we could develop concepts and ideas about the family journey into, through, and beyond CD.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the journey into illness, three themes emerged: (a) the ambiguous and overwhelming effects of an IFM’s complex, cooccurring addiction and mental health problems; (b) the challenges in accepting that things were as bad as they really were; and (c) difficulties in finding help and information, and in accessing a health care system that was not skillful at identifying or intervening in problems of such complexity. In the middle phase, the journey through illness, we found a second trio of themes: (a) compassion fatigue, (b) stigma, and (c) inner conflict and ambivalence. In the third phase, journeying on, we identified themes relating to (a) hope; (b) peer support and mutual aid; (c) the need to know; (d) physical, emotional, and spiritual self-care; and (e) empowerment and advocacy.</p>
<p>We used thematic analysis to search for narrative patterns of experience within the overall qualitative data set. This led to a deeper description and an overarching, unifying design that pulled things together. By incorporating two bridging constructs, we were able to show how the phases developed and took shape, connecting one particular phase of the family journey of recovery to the next. First, for the journey into and through CD from initial signs to being established as complex illnesses, we organized the core negative effects that participants reported under the concept of preoccupation. Second, as their view of CD became more informed, they felt more supported, and as they reflected on their roles and goals, we saw a shift in participants toward a more positive and empowering process that we described as renewal.</p>
<sec id="section25-1049732312443736">
<title>Preoccupation</title>
<p>As participants moved from the initial shock and confusion that came from realizing that a family member had CD to repeated frustrations at being unable to obtain help, they found that the effects of illness in a loved one began to occlude the other things needed for a balanced personal and family life. These ranged from the loss of enjoyment in everyday pleasures and diminished interest in social activity to compromised physical health. The trajectory of this preoccupation was downward, as if CD’s destructive effects on an IFM canceled out everything else, robbing life of its healthy balance. The initial worry and the ensuing difficulty in finding appropriate treatment services gradually gave rise to extreme hypervigilance directed toward the ill relative. The narrow focus on the suffering, troubles, behaviors, and needs of the ill person compromised participants’ attention to other concerns.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312443736">Caine (2010)</xref>, in a different context, referred to cultural displacement as travel through unfamiliar territory. She noted the importance of having someone travel alongside one in the journey of narrative transformation. At the beginning of the journey into CD, CFMs were pulled into an unknown terrain where they easily lost their bearings. Participants talked about trying to deal with an IFM’s symptoms and behaviors to the point of feeling they were drowning. This led us to ponder if it might be harder to suffer the illness of someone one cares about than to have to endure one’s own health problems.</p>
<p>Participants in the journey-into-illness phase felt that they were caught in a situation that would probably only get worse. However, they were determined not to abandon or give up on the IFM; they were resolved to try to find a way through the obstacles. This was the dark cloud’s silver lining. Indeed, as we heard them say, often things happened that encouraged them to believe it was possible to move ahead, even though CD was still part of the journey. As the weight of preoccupation lifted, CFMs became committed to supporting and sponsoring the IFM’s journey of recovery, and to starting a renewed journey of their own. This shift from an exclusive focus on the IFM signaled a turn in the family’s journey of recovery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732312443736">
<title>Renewal</title>
<p>Our second bridging concept, renewal, describes the transition toward the third phase, journeying on. We have been careful in the language we use here. This is not a journey out of illness, but a renewed commitment to journeying on, with a decreased emphasis on illness. Some participants had already experienced this transition before entering this project. Others saw signs of it as they experienced peer support through the group, and as they learned more about CD and about ways they could be more effective in continuing on their journey. They told us that through participation in the group they had enhanced their optimism and confidence, and were better able to interact with others in the family, including the member with CD.</p>
<p>During this phase of the recovery odyssey, participants talked about how they moved from preoccupation with the ill member’s journey to finding their own separate but parallel recovery pathways. During times of relapse and crisis, and in moments of triumph and celebration, the well-being of the IFM was still important to them, but gradually they came to see recovery as a family journey as well. Now they could place the ill person’s recovery within a wider, more inclusive context. They moved from “fixing” and “doing for” to “being with” and “journeying alongside.” They were aware of the positive human characteristics of the IFM, and were more able to enjoy occasions when they were together.</p>
<p>Although each family’s experience of CD was unique, narrative patterns began to appear in the stories we heard. We reflected on them and shared our observations with participants and other members of families affected by CD. This increased our confidence in the concept of the passage from illness to recovery as a family journey. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312443736">Figure 1</xref>, we depict this journey without a destination schematically.</p>

<title>Concurrent Disorders and the Family</title>
<p>Following data analysis and explication of the model, we returned to the literature related to families, mental health, and addiction. This time we were looking for articles about the concept of recovery in the area of CD. We searched for theoretical and conceptual studies and qualitative narrative analyses related to the process of recovery for caregivers and family members. We found articles by researchers who explored recovery in either mental health or addiction, but recovery literature on CD was difficult to find. Articles on recovery from a family perspective were virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>Many authors have investigated the important implications of family relationships and well-being for client wellness and recovery when mental illness and addiction are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312443736">Copeland &amp; Heilemann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312443736">Dixon, McNary &amp; Lehman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312443736">Fals-Stewart, O’Farrell &amp; Birchler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312443736">Mueser &amp; Fox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312443736">Townsend et al., 2006</xref>). For example, families play significant roles in helping their ill loved ones seek and remain engaged in treatment (Fals-Stewart et al.). The notion of the descent into addiction as a change journey in itself is evocatively described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312443736">DiClemente (2003)</xref>. The focus here is on the person who becomes addicted. Research on the lived experience of CD from the perspective of family members is missing. There is an older literature that puts families with addiction or mental health problems (or both) in a pathogenic light. In our view, it contributes to a prejudice against including, working with, or even responding to family concerns in respectful ways that persists in mental health and addiction agencies. Too few services offer any form of care for CFMs. We have developed a heightened respect for what the journey into CD means for families. Models of illness and recovery need to expand to include this dimension, so that we can understand who needs support and who needs to be included in accomplishing healthy change and recovery.</p>

<title>Stigma and the Family</title>
<p>Mental illness and substance use disorders are frequently misunderstood and stigmatized. Suffering concurrently from both illnesses greatly increases the potential for stigma, and ultimately the social isolation of people affected. The following are common examples: mental illness, substance abuse, and violence; CD and despairing beliefs about faint hope for recovery; and personality disorders, addictive disorders, and beliefs in personal culpability and moral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312443736">Hinshaw &amp; Cicchetti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312443736">O’Grady, 2005</xref>). Even within the health care system itself, responsibility for causing a problem can be attributed to the individual and to the family rather than to environmental or hereditary origins. As a result, victim blaming, hostility and criticism, and avoidance and rejection might be experienced by families who come seeking help, in dire need of assistance, understanding, and support.</p>
<p>The attributional theory of stigma partially explains why family members who blame themselves for their problems end up downsizing their social worlds and isolating themselves. It also helps explain why some professionals lean toward a critical and judgmental view of the family and engage in neglectful and avoidant behaviors. Stigma can also affect the families of persons with CD, who in turn might be shunned merely because of their close association with the ill individual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312443736">Erving Goffman (1963)</xref> coined the term <italic>courtesy stigma</italic>, or <italic>stigma by association</italic>, to describe the experiences of those connected to a stigmatized individual. Thus, the advent of CD in a family is not just a personal process for the individual member, but is mapped into a larger social context that creates dread and apprehension for members of families in which these problems occur. The importance of stigma is heightened when CD is put in the context of diversity. In many cultures, people view these problems in ways that create shame and stigma not just for the individuals with CD, but for the families to which they belong. The cultural context that shapes a family’s worldview influences how mental health and addiction problems are perceived and understood, and affects if, where, how, and when help is sought. In this study, participants were able to see CD as health problems that deserved health care solutions, including access to formal health care and social services. Still, they described many experiences of stigma, directed at both the IFM with CD and the family.</p>

<title>Hope</title>
<p>From ancient thinkers to modern researchers, hope is widely recognized as an indispensable part of healing and well-being. Research evidence from many different disciplines suggests that hope and despair are related to health and illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312443736">Dufault &amp; Martocchio, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312443736">Farran, Herth, &amp; Popovich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312443736">Miller &amp; Powers, 1988</xref>). Hope has been described as a continually unfolding process that changes in response to life situations (Farran et al.). Hope can be the spark that moves people toward seeking help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312443736">Edey &amp; Jevne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312443736">Moore, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312443736">Groupman (2004)</xref> reinforced the importance of hope when he said that “to hope under the most extreme circumstances . . . is part of the human spirit to endure and give a miracle a chance to happen” (p. 81). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312443736">Jevne and Miller (1999</xref>, p. 6) noted,
<disp-quote><p>Hope is amazing. You can’t touch it but you can definitely feel it. You can’t physically see it by itself, but you can hold it and carry it. Hope doesn’t weigh anything but it can ground you and anchor you.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312443736">Jevne and Williams (1999)</xref> suggested that it is possible to “choose hope,” and noted that “hope is not about everything turning out alright. It is about being alright no matter how things turn out” (p. 164). As the study participants demonstrated by journeying on, renewal can come from “living as if what [you] hoped for could come true, even if all the evidence wasn’t in yet” (Jevne &amp; Williams, p. 57).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1049732312443736">
<title>Knowledge and Power</title>
<p>The adage “knowledge is power” emerged as a life lesson for family participants. As knowledge increased, fear diminished. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312443736">Foucault (1977)</xref> considered power relations to be inherent in human interaction. He and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312443736">Townley, 1993</xref>) provided a conceptual framework for understanding what participants had come to know through lived experience. Knowing gave them the power to act in ways that they perceived as better, both in the family context and in interactions with professionals. For example, after learning about reflective listening and other motivational skills, including avoiding argumentation, they reported that their interactions with the IFM and other family members were more effective. Their interactions with workers in the health and social service systems improved because they were better prepared and more able to handle demanding situations such as crisis episodes and emergency room visits.</p>
<p>People with severe CD might not be inclined to seek or accept help or, when they do, help might not be offered. In most cases, the concerned family is not included in the process. Our experience is that helping professionals still do not know how to answer the question, “Why involve family members in the care of someone with CD?” There tends to be an underappreciation of the fact that CFMs are usually already involved. They often see the problems develop and have already tried to ameliorate or solve them. Furthermore, they have vital roles to play in providing the social support that is predictive of better outcomes. Even when professionals accept the merits of family involvement, they might not have the knowledge, skills, or support to work with families effectively. Nonetheless, there is no excuse for the persisting failure to welcome and include families when treating people with CD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1049732312443736">
<title>Recovery</title>
<p>Families play a crucial role in ill persons’ struggles to gain a renewed sense of self-esteem and self-worth. Recovery is about finding new meaning and purpose in life even in the face of continuing mental health symptoms and substance-use relapse. Recovery is also about distinguishing between recovery and an all-out cure for their illness. Recovery is not necessarily the same as cure. It is about refusing to be dominated by labels and defined by the illness, learning to live with the chronic nature of CD and taking care of oneself when CD recur.</p>
<p>What did recovery look like from the perspectives of study participants? They talked about the importance of having a life of their own in spite of the many demands placed on them on a daily basis. For them, it was about feeling hopeful and being able to hold the hope for their ill loved one through good times and bad times. It was about being able to let go of an all-absorbing preoccupation with the ill person and to take responsibility for their own lives. Recovery for CFMs involves gaining knowledge, learning effective coping skills, and becoming better advocates. It also means self-care, which they saw as especially important to both short- and long-term mental and physical balance. Recovery involves the realization that, although CFMs cannot fix or cure IFMs, they can support them and join them on a journey of recovery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The participants in this study were a remarkable group of individuals who were going through family journeys of illness and recovery. They had unusual qualities of perseverance and determination. They were committed to participating, and wanted to share their stories and experiences in the hope that they would help other family members. They also wanted to contribute to better clinical practices that would include family members and more effectively address CD.</p>
<p>We propose a model of illness and recovery for families affected by CD. We see this model as a heuristic that can be useful to professionals and family members, as well as individuals with CD. We hope that it will spur more study in this area. We also hope that this work and the work of those who follow us will help those families whose journeys have not led to renewal, whose experiences with seeking help have been demoralizing and unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The narratives from this study bear witness to the fortitude and resilience families can possess. They also pose some challenging issues for systems of care that aspire to be client-centered but fail to recognize and respect that clients live in a social world that needs to be understood and engaged if we are to do better in the challenging work of helping people affected by CD.</p>
