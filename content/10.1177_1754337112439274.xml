<abstract>
<p>The desire of individuals with a lower-limb amputation to participate in sports, coupled with the high demands of athletics, has resulted in the development of energy-storing-and-returning feet, capable of storing energy during stance and returning it to the individual in late stance to assist in forward propulsion. However, little attention has been paid to date to advance the understanding of their dynamic characteristics (natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping) during running. The evaluation of such parameters is now urgently required, as the use of energy-storing-and-returning feet is now being investigated through legal and justice systems to determine participation of amputee athletes using them at the Olympic Games. This paper presents a study of the dynamic characteristics of two commercially available Elite Blade composite feet (solid and split foot). A full modal analysis of the feet was conducted with varying masses attached to them, representing different body masses. The study showed that natural frequencies close to typical running step frequency can be achieved with simple control of the mass or stiffness. It was concluded that further study of the dynamic characteristics could result in a significant change in the design, development and the attitude towards the use of composite prosthetic feet. This initial study has highlighted the key questions that need to be answered to fully understand the dynamic characteristics and inform designers on how to tune a foot to match an amputee’s gait and body condition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Until the 1980s most prosthetic feet were designed with the main objective of restoring basic walking ability and simple occupational tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337112439274">1</xref></sup> A common early foot design was the Solid Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) foot, developed in the late 1950s, which had a rigid keel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337112439274">2</xref></sup> The desire of individuals with a lower-limb amputation to participate in sports, and the high demands of athletics, have resulted in the development of energy-storing-and-returning (ESR) feet, capable of storing energy during stance and returning it to the individual to assist in forward propulsion in late stance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337112439274">3</xref></sup> ESRs have been in use for amputees commercially since 1985.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337112439274">4</xref></sup> The first ESR was the Seattle Foot, with a flexible keel internal to the foot. Further evolutions in foot design have seen the development of the Flex Foot, with a carbon fibre shank and heel spring, which was introduced in 1987. The Flex Foot was first seen in elite sport during the 1988 Paralympic Games.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337112439274">5</xref></sup> Four years later, the prosthetic heel for some athletes was absent, creating the first sprint prosthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337112439274">6</xref></sup> Since the introduction of the first specialised prosthetic sprint foot in 1996, no major design changes have been made to the original design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337112439274">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The energy efficiency of such prostheses will vary, and energy return rates have been found to range from 31%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337112439274">8</xref></sup> up to as high as 95%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337112439274">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337112439274">9</xref></sup> Studies of the biological lower-limb have found that the ankle can generate a 241% energy return, with the addition of the concentric plantarflexion contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337112439274">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337112439274">10</xref></sup> This has led to the conclusion that a prosthesis is fundamentally restorative technology and still falls a long way short of replacing the mechanical performance of the biological limb. In a review of trans-tibial energy storage and return prosthetic devices Hafner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337112439274">1</xref></sup> noted that effective replacement of this power generation is one of the major barriers to total gait replication within a prosthetic system.</p>
<p>Other principal factors of energy return prostheses have been indicated as mass and inertia manipulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337112439274">8</xref></sup> metabolic cost,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337112439274">11</xref></sup> inherent stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337112439274">6</xref></sup> and kinematic and kinetic patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337112439274">12</xref></sup> but little attention to date has been placed on their dynamic characteristics (natural frequencies of oscillation, damping and mode shapes) during running.</p>
<p>In 1993, two studies by Lehmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754337112439274">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754337112439274">14</xref></sup> evaluated the biomechanical and metabolic performance differences between two prosthetic foot designs. The mechanical and biomechanical functions, metabolic demand, and shock absorption of the two dynamic elastic response SACH prosthetic feet were compared. As part of the same study an attempt was made to measure and investigate the natural frequencies of oscillation of the feet. It was hypothesised that it may be possible to minimise the metabolic cost of ambulating amputees when the driving frequency of oscillation matched the resonant frequency of the prosthesis. This would be desirable as it has been shown that a normal individual uses 10–55% less energy than an amputee when walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754337112439274">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754337112439274">16</xref></sup> The efficiency will increase even further if the gait can be made symmetrical or if the elastic dynamic responses of both feet closely match. Lehmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754337112439274">14</xref></sup> found that the natural frequencies of oscillation for the prosthetic feet were too high to provide energy storage and release synchronised with the kinematic requirements. This finding is not unexpected, as the feet used were not designed to store and release energy.</p>
<p>To understand the effects of dynamic response on the performance of ESR feet their complete static and dynamic response should be studied before the significance of their contribution can be quantified. The difference in their response during both the acceleration and the terminal speed phase of the running also needs to be studied and compared if their full potential is to be realised and exploited for both walking and running. The evaluation of such parameters is urgently required as the use of ESR feet is now being investigated through various legal and justice systems to determine participation of amputee athletes using them at the Olympic Games on both a philosophical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754337112439274">17</xref></sup> and a physiological level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337112439274">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754337112439274">18</xref></sup> Further concerns have been raised about how this technology will be judged in the future to ensure ethical inclusion of such technology in disability sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754337112439274">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This paper presents a study of the dynamic characteristics (natural frequencies, damping and mode shapes) of two composite ESR prosthetic feet. Two commercially available composite Elite Blade prostheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754337112439274">20</xref></sup> (Chas A Blatchford &amp; Sons Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) were studied in this investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112439274">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112439274">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows that the foot is capable of bending and absorbing a large amount of strain energy that can later be recovered. This also indicates the nature of the displacement of the foot that is most relevant to the running action. If this bending mode could be synchronised with the cyclic excitation force generated by the body, the mass/body can exhibit a bouncing behaviour. That can only happen if the frequency of the massless force (due to muscle action) matches the natural frequency of the foot/mass system as long as it stays in touch with the ground.</p>

<p>In this study the combination of body mass and ESR prosthetic foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337112439274">Figure 2(b)</xref>) is assumed to be analogous to a typical mass spring system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337112439274">Figure 2(a)</xref>). In a typical linear dynamic mass spring system, exhibiting simple harmonic motion (SHM), the stiffness of the spring (<italic>K</italic>) is usually assumed to be constant.</p>

<p>In the absence of any damping or forcing function the frequency of the system is proportional to <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1754337112439274">

</inline-formula>, indicating a single sine wave with one frequency and no other harmonics. In reality, this vibration slowly decays and eventually stops due to damping.</p>
<p>If a cyclic excitation force now acts on the mass, the system vibrates in a steady state. If this excitation frequency is increased, the inertia force will also increase and it will reach a point where the inertia force will cancel the stiffness force of the spring. As a result, the excitation force will now act on the mass without any resistance. This will cause the mass to oscillate at its natural frequency. Then, the amplitude of the resulting vibration, in the absence of any damping, will increase. This condition is called resonance, and the corresponding frequency is called the resonant frequency.</p>
<p>If the frequency is increased further, the inertia force will overcome the stiffness force. The magnitude of oscillation will become small until a point where the motion is controlled by the mass (mass controlled). The system is said to be in isolation.</p>
<p>Damping is an important factor in the study of the dynamic characteristics of a structure. The decay rate can be used to predict the drop in amplitude of the vibration per unit time. Using the decay rate makes it possible to calculate the percentage drop in amplitude with respect to time elapsed. The damping characteristic for a given system must be physically measured as it cannot be determined using simulation tools, such as FEA.</p>
<p>A similar passive adaptive dynamic system that can enhance performance, if used properly, and is capable of simple harmonic motion, is a trampoline. However, a trampoline has a nonlinear stiffness, as it can easily be used by athletes with dissimilar masses and can adapt to every possible body mass combination. The inertia of the athlete dropping on it from a height stores a large amount of strain energy in the sheet and springs due to their large displacement. This strain energy is then recovered by the mass trying to return to its original position. However, due to damping and loss of energy, this mass will never return to the original height unaided or without additional energy input. If such a mass was capable of generating a cyclic bouncing action, and if the frequency of that action matches the frequency of the perceived mass/spring system, then the athlete will bounce continually without leaving the sheet at the system’s natural frequency. The body can intuitively identify that frequency and is able to match it with their body rhythm. This is a form of energy input to the system, and to maintain this motion this energy should be equal to the losses in the system.</p>
<p>To increase the amplitude of oscillation on a trampoline without leaving the trampoline the amplitude of the force needs to increase at the same frequency. This force can only increase up to a point beyond which the athlete will leave the trampoline and motion then reverts to impulse driven motion controlled by the magnitude and the duration of the force, which is sinusoidal in nature. This height can be maintained by the athlete consciously synchronising their effort (increased muscle activity, burning calories, etc) with the time step between each pulse, which is directly linked to, and is controlled by, the height. Poor synchronisation with the system characteristics can result in motion suppression. In the case of a trampoline, if the input energy per cycle is more than the loss of energy in the system per cycle, the athlete will be able to gain height otherwise impossible to achieve unaided and by just using their ankles. This results in higher take-off velocity, which means higher kinetic energy, resulting in higher potential energy stored in the system.</p>
<p>In this paper it is hypothesised that walking or running at a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the ESR foot and body mass system may provide mechanical advantage if used in synchronisation, as in a trampoline. This could potentially enhance performance if the foot is used at its optimum dynamic characteristics. Therefore, knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of such feet is important.</p>

<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>The experimental procedure and methodology used to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping factor of two different Elite Blade ESR prosthetic feet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112439274">Figure 1b</xref>) is discussed here. Due to the distinct difference in the shape of the toe region these feet were termed ‘solid’ (1) and ‘split’ (2).</p>

<title>Instrumentation and test set-up</title>
<p>Modal analysis is a well established methodology for identifying modal parameters (frequency, mode shapes and damping) in any static elastic structure/system. A modal analysis investigation was conducted on a number of ESR foot and mass combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112439274">Figure 3(a)</xref>). An impact hammer, tri-axial accelerometer, Me’Scope software (Vibrant Technology, California, USA) and an in-house data acquisition and analysis software, developed within the DasyLab virtual instrument environment (Measurement Computing Corporation, Massachusetts, USA), was used to investigate the dynamic characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112439274">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The specification of the instrumentation used can also be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1754337112439274">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Test procedure</title>
<p>Masses of 9, 21, 30, 46 and 55 kg, representing different body masses, were sequentially attached to each foot and a full modal analysis was conducted for every mass/foot system combination. A T-shape steel mounting bracket was designed to carry the masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112439274">Figure 3(a)</xref>) and its mass was also added to the overall mass of the system. In each case, the masses were fixed so that their line of action passed through the ground reaction point of the foot, hence creating no turning effect. Before each modal analysis test vertical equilibrium was maintained using three kinematically locating strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337112439274">Figure 4</xref>). The strings were approximately 120° apart to allow enough clearance to ensure the displacements in all three orthogonal directions were not suppressed.</p>

<p>Step one was repeated 10 times and the collected data averaged and stored.</p>

The accelerations captured in the three orthogonal directions were then used to calculate modal displacements in the <italic>X, Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> directions at each roving point to produce animations of each mode shape in Me’Scope. It must be noted that the frequency and damping are exact values for the system but mode shapes are relative displacement relative to a reference point.</p>
<p>A complete frequency response function (FRF) for each foot was needed to identify all the natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping characteristics. The natural frequencies are identified as the peaks of the FRF graph. The frequency bands around each peak were identified by zooming around the frequency range of interest. Further data processing, using data averaging and curve fitting procedures, was conducted to calculate decay rates and damping ratios.</p>

For example, the FRF for the 9 kg mass shows that natural frequencies occur at 41.7, 35.9, 8.16 and 4.29 Hz.</p>

<p>An analysis of the mode shapes shows that there are a number of natural frequencies and mode shapes that can be excited as a result of impact. This is equivalent to impulse/impact due to jumping, walking or running. However, it is clear that the first bending mode potentially contributes the most to this process as it produces vertical displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337112439274">Figure 8(a)</xref>).</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337112439274">Figure 8(b)</xref> shows twisting modes can occur close to the first bending mode. This first twisting mode appears at a relatively low frequency. In some cases this mode appeared either before the first bending mode or very close to it. Twisting is quite a significant observation and indicates the existence of a strong elastic coupling that links bending to twisting indicating the load is not passing through the shear centre of the section. It must be noted that the twisting in the foot can be a result of many factors, such as unsymmetrical loading, an unsymmetrical section or shear coupling due to high material anisotropy. The study of twisting mode of the ESR foot and its potential application is outside the scope of this paper.</p>

The energy loss due to damping is higher at higher modes. The results indicate all the modes will damp out quickly unless they match the excitation frequency of an external source. The first bending mode (Mode 2) registered the lowest damping. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112439274">Figure 9(a)</xref> shows a plot of first bending mode frequency against the mass.

</inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112439274">Figure 9(b)</xref>). For a linear mass spring system with constant stiffness this relationship should be linear. The high levels of nonlinearity observed show that the foot does not exhibit constant stiffness. The biggest contribution to the nonlinearity comes from large deflections and changing boundary conditions due to variation in contact surface. This results in varying bending moments when using larger masses.</p>

<p>For practical purposes it may be possible to plot a straight line through all of the points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112439274">Figure 9(b)</xref>). The linear approximation of the stiffness makes it possible to closely predict the frequency of the first bending mode of vibration irrespective of the mass or the weight of the amputee. This can inform the design of ESR feet, and guides the design towards a geometry that has a more uniform stiffness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that top speed step frequencies during sprinting can reach 4.31 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754337112439274">21</xref></sup>. The results of these investigations show that the natural frequency of both Elite Blades in the first bending mode (which is capable of aiding both walking and running) can be close to these frequencies (4.22 and 3.83 Hz) when attached to a mass of 55 kg. This shows that with a minimal change to the mass and/or stiffness, these prosthetic feet could be tuned to achieve natural frequencies that are close to step frequencies during running. Further research is required to investigate and identify if a link exists between natural frequency and running frequency. The Elite Blade has a complex, non-uniform geometry, due to its high stiffness and material properties and, in the absence of any large mass attached to them, they possess high natural frequencies and high damping characteristics. The Elite Blades used in these investigations are not designed purely for running as they are stiffer than most running prosthesis. This study can help designers of such feet to determine if better knowledge of the dynamics of their systems can improve comfort as well as increase the range of function these feet can provide such as moderate running or jogging. This knowledge may also inform the design of specialist running prosthetic feet and may also inform the athlete how to better interact with their prosthesis. It is expected that the running specific prosthetic feet, such as the Cheetah and Flex-Run (Ossur), which have a more uniform variation in their stiffness, shape and thickness would be easier to tune as compared to the geometrically more complex Elite Blades studied in this investigation.</p>
<p>The effect of twisting mode on the system is yet to be fully investigated and understood. It may be possible to bring the bending and twisting modes closer together in order to take advantage of both phenomena. The twisting mode can have an impact on the alignment of the foot during the loading phase. This could be due to shear coupling as a result of the non-symmetric and unbalanced nature of the composite laminate used in the manufacture of the feet used in this study. This can bring about bend–twist coupling which can be a design feature also needing further investigation. The lack of detailed knowledge in this area warrants further investigation and is in agreement with Lechler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337112439274">7</xref></sup> who states more knowledge is needed to understand the influence of variations in carbon lay-up and shape alterations.</p>
<p>While little or no data regarding the dynamic characteristics of prosthetic feet have previously been reported, it is generally believed that faster ambulators benefit from stiffer, more dynamic foot designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337112439274">2</xref></sup> This has been confirmed in two studies which have shown that ambulation with a Flex Foot at higher speeds tended to conserve energy, resulting in enhanced gait efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754337112439274">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754337112439274">23</xref></sup> Grabowski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754337112439274">21</xref></sup> measured ground reaction force and stride kinematics of elite unilateral trans-tibial amputee sprinters over a range of speeds up to top speed. It was shown that the step frequency of the unaffected leg was lower than the step frequency of the prosthetic leg at lower speeds. As the running speed increased to top speed the step frequency of the unaffected leg became greater than that of the prosthetic leg (8% difference at top speed). It was suggested that the difference in step frequency at top speed was probably due to the shorter aerial time of the unaffected leg at faster speeds. It was also found that by adding mass to the prosthetic the step frequency became more symmetrical between legs. Gailey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754337112439274">24</xref></sup> found that improved running symmetry was seen in trans-tibial amputees when a greater stiffness category of the Cheetah foot was used. Again, modification to the prosthetic foot mass or stiffness will have altered their dynamic characteristics.</p>
<p>This initial study has shown that further investigation is warranted to identify the effect natural frequency has on the performance of the prosthetic foot. Future research is required to study:</p>

<list-item>
<p>the effect of impulse and impact, due to running, on the prosthetic foot’s vibration and its link to phase.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>
<?h-4?>Damping is also another important factor in the dynamics of prosthetic feet that should be studied in detail. Modal analysis has shown that impulse will excite all modes of vibration. It is, therefore, hypothesised that not all induced vibration, due to the impulse from ground reaction force or the inertia of the body, are damped out before the subsequent impulse (step). This could be verified using a simple drop test. Any stored energy in the system due to kinetic energy or potential energy will be locked in the system, facilitating higher take-off velocity. This extra energy can manifest itself, or assist, at the later stages of the running, when an able-bodied athlete usually starts getting tired.</p>
<p>A better understanding of these characteristics can have an impact on how competitive amputee running will be conducted in the future. In competitive sport any contribution or enhancement to the running performance from the prosthesis can make a difference in terms of competitive advantage and can be the difference between winning or losing a race. A better understanding can also inform the governing bodies on the ethical inclusion of such technology in disability sport. Lastly, it can inform designers on how they can create better passively controlled prosthetic feet to minimise amputee energy consumption during walking and/or running. Ultimately the outcome of this research can translate into a tool that can assist prosthetists to match the amputee’s walking/running frequency with the dominant natural frequency of their prosthetic foot. The study of the material properties and composite lay-up also becomes important if a foot is to be fine tuned to the athletes’ requirements.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research, which studies the dynamic characteristics of two composite prosthetic feet, has shown that natural frequencies close to the typical running step frequency can be achieved. A sinusoidal impulse frequency close to the foot’s natural frequency makes the foot more compliant with the bouncing action. An impulse frequency either side of this frequency will make the prosthesis appear stiffer due to damping. It has also been shown that the lay-up of the composite may be responsible for producing twisting modes of vibration at lower frequencies. The effect on the stiffness, alignment and energy storage needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Further study of the dynamic characteristics of prosthetic composite feet could lead to significant changes in the way these feet should be designed in the future. This initial study has highlighted the key questions that need to be answered to fully understand the dynamic characteristics of such advanced composite feet to inform designers on how to exploit their true potential and to fine tune a foot to match an amputee’s gait and body condition. This would, in turn, enable amputees to participate in more competitive running or equivalent sports using the same foot.</p>
