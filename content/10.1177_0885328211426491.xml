<p>Surgical sealants form gel when applied to tissues. Currently, fibrin sealant has been successfully used in many surgical fields, but it has several disadvantages, including possible virus transmission, low adhesive strength, and high cost. In this study, gelatin and glutaraldehyde (GA) solutions were chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-linked gelatin gel as sealant and barrier, both of which have long been used in medical applications. It was found that the gelatin gel prepared from 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solutions exhibited bonding strength almost three times higher than that of fibrin glue. The bonding strength increased with the increasing gelatin and GA concentrations. When a needle hole on PTFE vascular grafts was sealed with the gelatin gel, the water-resistant pressure significantly increased upon rubbing and was twice higher than that of fibrin glue. The cytotoxicity of gelatin gel was found to be much lower than that of albumin glue prepared at the same composition as commercially available BioGlue®. The gelatin gel was found to be also effective as barrier to prevent adhesion in a rat cecum abrasion model.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211426491" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>At present, it is very difficult for biomaterial researchers to aim at creating clinically applicable biomaterialswith synthesis, modification, or other chemical means. This is probably because medical device and pharmaceutical industry, as well as medical doctors, do not willingly accept new biomaterials that have never experienced practical applications in clinical medicine. Unless any precedented clinical applications are available, the users must be concerned about the toxic issue associated with the new biomaterials. It is absolutely reasonable that the minimum requirement for biomaterials is not to be toxic, since they may threaten or harm human life. This is in marked contrast with non-medical products which will consider their performance, efficiency, and price as the most critical. Peer reviewers of international journals will recommend to reject the paper submitted if the study has been conducted using well-known materials and methods even if it involves remarkable findings that may greatly contribute to clinical medicine.</p>
<p>Huge expense is required to prove the safety of biomaterials, including non-carcinogenicity, non-teratogenicity, non-immunogenicity, and others. The total expenses costed for proving the non-toxicity of a biomaterial are enormous to most of the academic people. It seems therefore likely that the interest of biomaterial researchers is diverging from that of medical and industrial societies, increasingly biasing in favor of more basic research. This is not a good trend from the social point of view. One of the promising means to compromise the discord between the two sides is for the biomaterial researchers to create original biomaterials by combining a number of well-known materials, although some of them might have not yet cleared toxic issues.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate one model of this strategy using gelatin which has very long history as an absorbable, non-toxic biomaterial. This naturally occurring polymer is modified by cross-linking to produce a surgical sealant (or adhesive) and a barrier to prevent tissue adhesion. Fibrin glue has most broadly been used for the purpose of stopping bleeding and air leakage. Stopping bleeding is one of the fluid leakage preventions from defective tissues, similar to cerebrospinal fluid and bile leakage. However, fibrin glue has a number of shortcomings, including virus transmission, low adhesive strength, troublesome preparation, and high price.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211426491">1</xref></sup> On the other hand, GRF® (Cardial, Techinopole, Sainte-Etienne, France), composed of 37.5% gelatin, 12.5% resolcin, 16.7% formaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA) solutions, and Bioglue® (CryoLife, Inc., Kennesaw, Georgia), composed of 45% albumin and 10% GA solutions, have high adhesive strength, but their applications are limited, probably because late complications and adverse events have been reported for GRF®<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211426491">3</xref></sup> and Bioglue®.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211426491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211426491">5</xref></sup> Seprafilm® (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA) and Interceed® (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) are not easy to handle and not able to reliably prevent the postoperative adhesion occurring on injured tissues, although these biomaterials have been most frequently applied at present in abdominal and gynecologic surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211426491">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To challenge these surgical problems, we have chosen the most common biomaterial, gelatin and GA. In medical applications, gelatin has been extensively used for pharmaceutical capsules, drug delivery systems, hemostatic agents (e.g., Gelfoam® (Pfizer, NY) and FloSeal® (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Freemont, CA)), and surgical adhesives (e.g. GRF®). Gelatin-based sealants have been developed using different cross-linking agents, such as water-soluble carbodiimides (WSC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211426491">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211426491">8</xref></sup> genipin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211426491">7</xref></sup> transglutaminase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211426491">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211426491">10</xref></sup> ruthenium-based photopolymerization technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211426491">11</xref></sup> and biopolymers, such as poly(<sc>l</sc>-glutamic acid) in the presence of WSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211426491">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211426491">14</xref></sup> and oxidized polysaccharides containing aldehyde groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211426491">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211426491">16</xref></sup> Cross-linking of gelatin film with GA has been extensively studied including for medical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211426491">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211426491">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we will present how effective the cross-linked gelatin is for preventing hemorrhage and tissue adhesion in comparison with currently available biomaterials and, in addition, how low the toxicity of GA is when a reasonably small amount is applied for gelatin cross-linking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0885328211426491" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Gelatin was supplied by Nitta Gelatin Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). It was extracted from the porcine skin to have an isoelectric point of 5. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(−)), 25 wt% GA solution, 3-methyl-2-benzo-thiazolone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH), and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Japan). All reagents were used as obtained. Fibrin glue (Beriplast®, CSL Behring) was purchased from Wakenyaku Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Doubly distilled water (DDW) was used for any preparation.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0885328211426491"><title>Viscosity measurement</title>
<p>Gelatin solutions of 5, 9, 17, 23, and 29 wt% were prepared using PBS(−) at pH 7. Fibrinogen solution (8 wt%) was obtained from Beriplast® kit and prepared as instructed. BSA solution of 45 wt% was prepared using DDW. The vial containing 3 mL of protein solution was warmed in a water bath to 37°C or 60°C, and the solution viscosity was measured with an oscillating viscometer (Sansyo Co., Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211426491"><title>Gelation time measurement</title>
<p>In a plate with 1.6 cm diameter, various concentrations of gelatin (1 mL) and GA (0.13 mL) solutions were mixed at 300 rpm with a 1.4-cm magnetic bar at 45°C or 60°C. The time required for the magnetic bar to stop motion was recorded as the gelation time of the mixed solution. The solution concentrations of gelatin and GA were expressed as the initial concentration of each solution before mixing throughout this study. The volume ratio of gelatin to GA solutions was kept as 7.5:1.0, unless otherwise stated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211426491"><title>Bonding strength measurement</title>
<p>When a gelatin gel was used as a glue, the gelatin solution and the GA solution were separately prepared and stored in syringes. Each of the solutions was injected at the same time on the surface of the chicken breast meat to be bonded or sealed at 45°C to avoid physical gelation. The total volume of applied gelatin gel was 200 µL with the gelatin/GA volume ratio of 7.5/1.0. To evaluate the bonding strength of glues, the meat was sliced to pieces of dimensions 1 × 3 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref></sup>. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211426491">Figure 1</xref>, the glue was put on one side of each slice, and these sides were overlapped to a bonding area 1 × 1 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref></sup>. After loading a weight of approximately 30 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref></sup> on the slice for 30 s and incubating for 3 min at 37°C, the bonding strength was measured at 25°C using a spring balance.

<sec id="sec6-0885328211426491"><title>Evaluation of sealing on pricked vascular grafts</title>
<p>Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft (GORE-TEX Vascular Grafts, W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, AZ) was cut into a circle with a diameter of 24 mm and assembled into the apparatus for testing burst pressure, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211426491">Figure2</xref>. A water leak hole was prepared by pricking the graft with a needle with a gauge size 23. Gelatin (26 wt%) and GA (1 wt%) solutions were preheated to 50°C and applied to the graft simultaneously with or without rubbing by fingers at 37°C. The total volume of applied gel was 200 µL with the gelatin/GA volume ratio 7.5/1.0. In the case of fibrin glue, 100 µL of fibrinogen solution was applied with or without rubbing, followed by addition of 100 µL of thrombin solution. After 5 min, water pressure in the apparatus was gradually increased and the pressure read with a pressure gauge (Valcom Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) when water leakage occurred.

<sec id="sec7-0885328211426491"><title>Release of aldehyde from gelatin gel</title>
<p>Gelatin solution (26 wt%) was mixed with GA solution (1 wt%) with the gelatin/GA volume ratio 7.5/1.0 at 45°C for gelation in a polypropylene tube and allowed to react for 2 min. In the case of albumin gel, 45 wt% albumin solution was mixed with 10 wt% GA solution with the albumin/GA volume ratio 4.0/1.0. After addition of 5 mL PBS(−) solution to the gel (1 g) and incubation at 37°C for predetermined durations, the supernatant (extract) was collected and the same amount of new PBS(−) was added, followed by extraction. Release of the unreacted aldehyde from the gelatin gel to each of PBS(−) was determined with the MBTH method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426491">22</xref></sup> The extracted solution (0.3 mL) was mixed with the same volume of 0.4 wt% aqueous MBTH solution and the reaction allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30°C. Then, 1.5 mL of 0.2 wt% FeCl<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution was added to the mixed solution and allowed to stand for 5 min at 30°C. Finally, 3.9 mL of acetone was added. The optical density of the final solutions was measured at 635 nm with UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1100 pro, GE Healthcare, Tokyo). The calibration curve obtained for GA solutions of known concentrations was used to determine the aldehyde concentration of extracted solutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211426491"><title>Cytotoxicity test of the gelatin gel extract and GA</title>
<p>Gelatin gels were prepared by mixing 26 wt% gelatin solution and various concentrations of GA solution at the gelatin solution/GA solution volume ratio 7.5/1.0 at 45°C and extracted with 5 mL DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) for 24 h at 37°C. The albumin gel was obtained by mixing 45 wt% albumin and 10 wt% GA solutions at the BSA solution/GA solution volume ratio 4.0/1.0 and extracted as described above. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF, KF<bold>-</bold>4009, Kurabo, Osaka) were seeded on 12-well plates and grown to confluence at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM with 10% FBS. The culture medium was then replaced with either the supernatant extract or the medium supplemented with sequentially diluted solutions of GA (1 mL/well for both). After cell culture for 24 h, the cells were assessed for viability using the 3 -(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution. This method gives the counts of the number of viable cells. After aspirating the medium, 1 mL of 0.33 mg/mL MTT in PBS(−) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Then, theMTT solution was aspirated and 1 mL of 0.04 N HCl/isopropanol was added and kept for 5 min. The optical density of the solution was measured at 570 nm.</p>

<p>Known weight of gelatin glues prepared with 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solution at 45°C was subcutaneously implanted on the back of female rats (Wistar ST, 8 weeks old, weighing around 200 g, Japan SLC, Inc., Kyoto). After 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, the gel was carefully removed and washed with cold water, followed by drying. The weight of dried isolated gel was measured and the extent of <italic>in vivo</italic> absorption expressed as the percentage of the remaining dry weight. Each experiment was triplicated.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328211426491"><title>Adhesion rat model</title>
<p>Female Wistar ST rats (8 weeks old) were housed at room temperature and given the standard rat chow. After pre-determined periods of time, all the rats were anesthetized with the intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital (Somnopentyl, Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) by 30 mg/kg body weight. The mid-abdominal area was shaved and treated with 70% ethyl alcohol. A 3-cm midline incision was made to exteriorize the cecum. A 1.5 × 1.5 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref></sup> area of the cecum was gently abraded with a sand-paper to remove the serous membrane and then a similarly sized peritoneal injury was produced on the abdominal wall opposite the cecum with surgical scissors. Gelatin gel was applied by simultaneous injection of 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solutions from separate syringes on the cecum only with or without thermally cross-linked gelatin sheet and allowed to stand for 3 min. The gelatin sheet was prepared by cast-drying the gelatin solution, followed by thermal treatment at 140°C for 4 h under vacuum. Control group received no treatment. For comparisons, 2 × 2 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426491">2</xref></sup> area of Seprafilm® or gelatin sheet was applied. The injuries were placed together by one stitch with 6-0 nylon suture and the abdominal wall was closed with continuous 4-0 nylon suture. Simple interrupted stitches with 3-0 nylon suture were used to close the abdominal skin incision. At 2 weeks post-operatively, the rats were euthanized with overdose (300 mg/kg) of sodium pentobarbital and their abdomens were examined for adhesion formation.

<p>The viscosity of gelatin solutions before chemical cross-linking was evaluated as a function of gelatin concentration at 37°C and 60°C. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211426491">Figure 3</xref>. The viscosities of 23 wt% gelatin solution at 37°C and 60°C were 930 and 350 mPa·s, respectively. In comparison, the viscosities of fibrinogen (8 wt%) and serum albumin (45 wt%) solutions at 37°C were 21 and 16 mPa·s, respectively. These results indicate that the chain configuration of denatured gelatin is quite different in solution from those of fibrinogen and serum albumin. The solution viscosity of gelatin could not be measured at temperatures lower than 30°C because of physical gelation.

<p>The pH effect of gelatin solution on the chemical gelation was studied using 17 wt% gelatin and 0.5 wt% GA solutions at 40°C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211426491">Figure 4</xref>, gelation occurred within 10 s at alkaline pHs and the increase in solution pH accelerated the reaction to form gel, mainly owing to enhanced Schiff base formation at the alkaline region.

When the reaction temperature was raised from 45°C to 60°C, the gelation was also accelerated.

<p>To study the release profile of the unreacted GA from the gelatin gel, 1 g of gelatin gel was prepared with 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA. Two minutes after gelation, 5 mL of PBS(−) was added to the gel, and the GA released to the supernatant at 37°C was measured during 24 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211426491">Figure 6</xref> represents the results observed at 37°C. The aldehyde released from 1 g of gelatin gel was 0.1 µmol after 1 min of incubation, reaching 0.7 µmol after 24 h. Gelatin molecules of 2.6 mg were also released after 1 min, and the weight reached 27.4 mg after 24 h. In contrast, the aldehyde released from 1 g of albumin gel was 25.7 µmol after 24 h. It should be mentioned that the aldehyde concentration of extracts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211426491">Figure 6</xref> does not mean the concentration of unreacted GA molecules, since the extract (sol fraction) contains not only the unreacted GA, but also the aldehyde groups bound to gelatin molecules through half-reacted, tethered GA.

The extract obtained by immersing the gel (1 g at 37°C) in 5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h was placed on the fibroblasts for 24 h, and the cell viability was assessed using the MTT conversion assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211426491">Figure 8</xref> shows the cell culture result, together with the result for the pristine GA. As can be seen, GA concentrations as low as 0.001 wt% (10 µg/ml) lead to significant reduction in the MTT conversion (lower MTT conversion indicates higher cytotoxicity). In contrast, the extract from the gelatin gel prepared from 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solutions showed a high MTT conversion (93.5%) when compared at the same GA aldehyde concentration, suggesting the minimal change in the viability of human fibroblasts. When initial GA concentration of gelatin gel was increased to 2, 3, and 5wt %, the aldehyde concentrations of the extracts raised to 0.0013, 0.0016, and 0.0022% (GA calibrated), respectively. Their MTT conversions were also higher than those of pristine GA solutions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211426491">Figure 8</xref>. The albumin glue extract, on the other hand, had aldehyde concentration of 0.0257%, and showed a highly cytotoxic result such as MTT conversion of 20.9%.

<p>An inflammatory response was explored to evaluatethe <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity of gelatin gel. For this study, 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solutions prepared in separate syringes were applied at the same time on the rat cecum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211426491">Figure 9</xref> shows the HE staining of the cecum cross-section applied with the gelatin glue for different implantation periods of time. After 3 days post-operatively, a part of gelatin gel remained on the cecum and only low-grade superficial inflammation was observed. After 7 days, mild, localized, and organized inflammation was detected at the site where the gel was implanted. After 14 days, the gel was completely absorbed without any detectable inflammation.

<p>The sealing effect of gelatin glue on the expanded PTFE vascular prosthesis with a needle hole was studied by measuring the maximal water pressure when water leakage occurred from the sealed hole. The injected mixed solutions were rubbed with fingers to let the mixed aqueous solution penetrate into the interstices of super-hydrophobic PTFE prosthesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0885328211426491">Figure 11</xref>, the burst water pressure of gelatin glue markedly increased from 25 to 400 mmHg by rubbing. In the case of fibrin glue, the burst water pressures were 200 and 140 mmHg with and without rubbing, respectively. This small difference in pressure may be due to the low viscosities of fibrinogen and thrombin solutions which do not need strong rubbing.

<sec id="sec17-0885328211426491"><title>Cytotoxicity of GA</title>
<p>The largest concern regarding this study is definitely the use of GA which is potentially toxic. GA is a water-soluble, highly-reactive molecule with low molecular weight 100. Therefore, this small molecule is thought to be able to distribute almost everywhere in the body even inside cells, but this is not likely because GA in neutral aqueous solutions is present in the equilibrated state with polymerization products such as CHO–(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>–C(CHO)=(CH–CH<sub>2</sub>–CH<sub>2</sub>–C(CHO))<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>=CH–(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>–CHO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211426491">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211426491">26</xref></sup> This characteristic of GA may reduce the cytotoxicity, although the highest GA concentration eliciting the detectable cytotoxicity in fibroblast culture was reported to be 10 µg/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211426491">27</xref></sup> In spite of this potential toxicity, GA has greatly contributed to the production of clinically important implants derived from animal tissues such as bioprosthetic valves. For such biologically derived devices, GA functions as fixative of the tissue proteins to enhance the resistance against enzymatic degradation, to augment the mechanical properties, and to eliminate the immunogenicity of allogeneic animal tissues.</p>
<p>When –CHO groups of GA react with –NH<sub>2</sub> groups of proteins through Schiff base formation, cross-linking takes place between the protein molecules under reaction of two or more –CHO groups present in the GA or polymerization products. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0885328211426491">Scheme 1</xref> shows the cross-linking with one GA molecule.
<fig id="fig16-0885328211426491" position="float"><label>Scheme 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211426491-fig16.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The bond –N=CH– is liable to hydrolysis unless chemically reduced. Under the reaction condition in this study, almost all –CHO groups of GA seem to have reacted with the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups of gelatin, because plenty of –NH<sub>2</sub> groups are densely present around one –CHO group. The molar ratio of –NH<sub>2</sub>/–CHO in themixture prepared from 26 wt% gelatin and 1 wt% GA solution, with the gelatin/GA solution volume ratio 7.5/1.0, is calculated to be approximately 7/1, if the amino acid content of gelatin that has –NH<sub>2</sub> groups in the side-chain is assumed to be 74 mmol%.</p>
<p>This high ratio of –NH<sub>2</sub>/–CHO suggests that the aldehydes detected in the extract from the gelatin gel generated upon mixing the concentrated gelatin solution and the dilute GA solution are not those of free GA but low-molecular weight gelatin molecules having an unreacted –CHO group. The molecular distribution in the gelatin gel is schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0885328211426491">Figure 13</xref>. The concentration of free GA in the gel seems statistically very low because of high concentration and high reactivity of the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups in the mixed solution. The sol fraction of the gel may contain lower molecular weight gelatin molecules carrying much smaller amounts of unreacted –CHO group, if any, than higher molecular weight gelatin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0885328211426491">Figure 13</xref>. This biased gelatin distribution in the sol and gel fractions should occur so far as the polymer molecules before cross-linking have a broad molecular weight distribution. The molecular weight distribution of gelatin must be formed as a result of partial hydrolytic chain scission during extraction of gelatin from animal tissues containing native collagen. The lower cytotoxicity of the gel extract than that of free GA when compared at the same –CHO concentration for the cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211426491">Figure 8</xref>) denotes that the –CHO groups in the extract are all or partially bound to gelatin molecules.

<sec id="sec18-0885328211426491"><title>Superiority of gelatin sealant</title>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0885328211426491">Figure 14</xref>, adhesives and glues are generally defined as materials to bind two surfaces together, while sealants are defined as materials to close a small opening like aperture and hole. In the medical field, the so-called surgical adhesives serve mostly as sealant. Gelatin glues seal needle holes and fistulae, while GRF and Bioglue close the entry of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta. The higher adhesive strength of gelatin glue than fibrin and albumin glues is well expected, because gelatin has unique molecular characteristics. First, gelatin is present in solution mostly as random chains, in marked contrast with fibrin of fibrilar structure and serum albumin of globular structure. Clearly, strong adhesion needs the conspicuous chain entanglement that is possible only for the polymers of random chain, but very difficult for fibrilar and globular protein molecules. This is schematically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0885328211426491">Figure 15</xref>. The fact that 23 wt% gelatin solution is viscous, in marked contrast with 45 wt% albumin solution, clearly indicates the presence of chains actively entangling or interacting among the polymer molecules in concentrated gelatin solution. It is interesting to note that the native collagen molecules are not capable of forming a strong film as gelatin, probably because of a high content of fibrilar structure (triple helical structure).

<p>Second, the gelatin molecule consists of a variety of comonomers involving hydrophobic, polar, and negatively/positively charged amino acids. The diverse hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of this polymer will facilitate different interactions with the material surface to be glued. It has been known that the dried surface of gelatin film is hydrophobic, while the surface gradually turns into hydrophilic when hydrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211426491">28</xref></sup> This is because various side-chains of gelatin can orient selectively to the most stable state, adjusting to the outer environment. The sealing efficiency of biomaterials other than gelatin was reviewed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211426491">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0885328211426491"><title>Superiority of anti-adhesion barrier</title>
<p>The major function of anti-adhesive biomaterials is to physically separate two opposing tissues for a short time until healing of the wounded tissue. In addition, the barrier membrane should elicit minimum foreign-body reactions and be bioabsorbed promptly after having fulfilled its role as barrier. Otherwise, the membrane itself would cause tissue adhesion as a result of encapsulation. Contrary to the native collagen, gelatin which is a denatured protein is physiologically very inactive, in other words, biocompatible. The bioinert, hydrophilic gelatin film with higher mechanical strength than that of clinically available Seprafilm® may be an ideal biomaterial as anti-adhesive barrier. The gelatin membrane to be used as barrier does not need a high cross-linking density because the tissue injury causing the tissue adhesion will heal within several days.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mild cross-kinking of gelatin with GA may yield the biomaterial useful in surgery as sealant and barrier.</p>
