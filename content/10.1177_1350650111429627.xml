<abstract>
<p>Influences of electromagnetic stirring (EMS) and rare earth (RE) CeO<sub>2</sub> addition on reciprocating wear behaviour of hypereutectic Al–Si alloys have been presented in this article. Reciprocating wear tests were carried out at different contact loads (from 15 to 90 N) and speeds (from 0.2 to 1.0 m/s) using pin-on-plate configuration for a constant sliding distance of 500 m. It was observed that EMS and RE (CeO<sub>2</sub>) addition refined the microstructure and improved the hardness. EMS reduced the wear rates of hypereutectic Al–Si alloy irrespective of applied load and sliding velocity. Transition from mild to severe wear was observed in as-cast alloy at 90 N normal load (constant sliding velocity = 0.4 m/s). Scanning electron microscopy of worn surfaces and wear debris was carried out to study the wear mechanism of material removal under different sliding conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650111429627" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypereutectic aluminium–silicon (Al--Si) alloys are widely used all over the globe due to their light weight, good castability, corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429627">1</xref></sup> These alloys are best suited in automobile industry for manufacturing tribological components like cylinder heads and pistons. For such applications, wear resistance and other tribological properties are required. Therefore, efforts are being made for improving the wear resistance of these alloys using various approaches such as adding alloying elements, improving casting techniques, heat treatments and reinforcing hard micro-constituents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111429627">2</xref></sup> All these methods of enhancing the wear resistance of an alloy are primarily based on the modification of structure to achieve desired properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429627">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111429627">3</xref></sup> These methods can be applied either in single or in combination to improve the properties.</p>
<p>Additions of rare earth (RE) elements reduce gases generated during casting and improve mechanical properties by solid solution strengthening and precipitation hardening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111429627">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111429627">6</xref></sup> Further, mechanical properties such as hardness, in turn, can increase the applied normal load and speed (velocity) of tribological components and enhance the wear resistance. Moreover, dry sliding reciprocating conditions cause more wear than continuous sliding conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111429627">2</xref></sup> So, it becomes essential to study some new alloying element that improves the wear resistance in dry sliding reciprocating conditions. Addition of RE elements such as CeO<sub>2</sub> has been reported to improve the mechanical and tribological properties of Al–Si alloys by refining eutectic silicon and primary silicon particles (PSPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111429627">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111429627">8</xref></sup> Rare earth CeO<sub>2</sub> primarily refines the eutectic silicon better than PSPs. PSPs can be further refined by some processing method such as semi-solid processing.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic stirring (EMS) is a newer method of semi-solid processing and has shown promising results on refinement and spheroidization of microstructure of Al–Si alloys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111429627">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650111429627">11</xref></sup> Literature survey has revealed that no attempts have been made to study the influence of combination of EMS process and CeO<sub>2</sub> addition in hypereutectic Al–Si alloys on dry sliding wear behaviour under reciprocating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429627">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111429627">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650111429627">12</xref></sup> So, it is very important to investigate the adhesive wear behaviour of alloys to be used for wear applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650111429627">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650111429627">14</xref></sup> Therefore, an attempt has been made to study the adhesive wear behaviour of a combination of CeO<sub>2</sub> modified hypereutectic Al–Si alloy subjected to EMS in dry sliding reciprocating conditions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1350650111429627" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>The Al–16 (wt%) Si alloy used in this study was prepared by melting Al–50% Si master alloy and pure Al ingot in an induction furnace. This alloy was modified by adding CeO<sub>2</sub> (0.2 wt%) in molten condition. The temperature of the molten metal was maintained at 850°C for 30 min before pouring the melt and the molten metal was treated with cover flux and degasser for removing impurities and gases. The following alloy designations were used in various plots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650111429627">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec3-1350650111429627"><title>Wear testing</title>
<p>A reciprocating wear test rig conforming to ASTM standard G-133-05 was used to investigate the dry sliding adhesive wear behaviour of alloys in as-cast, EMS-cast, as-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> and EMS-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111429627">Figure 1</xref>. A grey cast iron plate (250 HVN) was used as a counter surface having surface roughness (<italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic>) of 0.21 µm. Initial and final weights of wear pins subjected to reciprocating wear were measured by an electronic weight balance with a least count of 0.0001. Contact load was applied to the wear pins by a dead weight using a lever system. Dry sliding wear tests under reciprocating conditions were performed by applying contact load in the range 15–90 N and average reciprocating velocity in the range 0.2–1.0 m/s. Weight loss criteria were used for calculating the wear of material. Wear rate (g/m) was calculated from ratio of weight (in grams) and sliding distance (in meters). For each wear test, wear pins were cleaned with acetone and weighed after running through a constant sliding distance of 500 m. To maintain identical sliding conditions, the counter surface was polished to a surface roughness less than 0.3 µm. Scanning electron microscopy of the debris and wear surfaces was done to study the wear mechanism under different sliding conditions.

<sec id="sec5-1350650111429627"><title>Metallurgical characteristics</title>
<p>Optical microscopic studies of as-cast and EMS-cast alloys modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> primarily revealed polyhedral-shaped PSPs, a mixture of Al–Si eutectic in the matrix of aluminium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429627">Figure 2(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429627">b</xref>)). Image analysis of various micro-constituents present in the microstructure of alloy under different conditions showed that morphology (in respect of average size and aspect ratio) of PSPs is significantly influenced by CeO<sub>2</sub> modification and EMS. It can be observed that EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> reduces the average size of PSPs (from 284 to 76.87 µm) and aspect ratio (from 2.68 to 1.32). Reduction in aspect ratio indicates that PSPs tend to spheroidize. Further, electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of CeO<sub>2</sub> modified alloy appreciably increased hardness (from 98.5 to 122.66 BHN). Refinement of PSPs, reduction in aspect ratio and increase in hardness owing to EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> are expected to enhance the wear resistance of an alloy.

<sec id="sec6-1350650111429627"><title>Wear behaviour</title>
<p>Initially, a trial run of dry sliding wear test under reciprocating condition was carried out to identify the sliding distance required for achieving the steady-state condition, so that the other tests can be conducted to investigate the wear performance of an alloy in different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111429627">Figure 3</xref>). It can be observed that an increase in sliding distance increases wear but at a decreasing rate until steady state is achieved, as indicated by the negative slope of wear vs. sliding distance curve. Plot indicates that steady-state condition is attained after 500 m of sliding distance. Therefore, in this study, all wear tests were carried out at a sliding distance of 500 m.

<sec id="sec7-1350650111429627"><title>Effect of alloy conditions and contact load on wear</title>
<p>The effect of alloy conditions (as-cast, EMS-cast, as-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> and EMS-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub>) on wear behaviour under varying load conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111429627">Figure 4</xref>. It can be observed that as-cast alloy is subjected to higher wear rates than EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> irrespective of applied normal load. The conditions of alloy having wear rate in decreasing order is given as follows: as-cast, EMS-cast, as-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> and EMS-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub>. Further, it can be noticed that the effect of alloy condition on wear rate is more at higher load (above 45 N) than low loads. Moreover, EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> results in significant reduction in wear rate especially at high normal loads i.e. 60, 75 and 90 N. In general, an increase in normal load increases the wear rate irrespective of alloy condition (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111429627">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429627">5</xref>). A bar chart showing the comparative wear behaviour of an alloy as a function of normal load in different alloy conditions indicates that EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> significantly lowers the wear rate compared to as-cast alloy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429627">Figure 5</xref>). It can also be noticed that an increase in normal load from 15 to 45 N causes a linear increase in the wear rate of as-cast alloy. Thereafter, further increase in load from 60 to 90 N abruptly increases the wear rate. Increase in normal load (from 15 to 90 N) linearly increases the wear rate of EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> without any sharp change in wear behaviour. The change in slope of wear rate vs. normal load curve for as-cast alloy (above 45 N load) indicates the transition in the mode of wear from mild oxidative regime to severe metallic wear regime. This trend suggests that EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> is more coherent and stable under dry sliding wear conditions than as-cast alloy.

<sec id="sec8-1350650111429627"><title>Effect of alloy conditions and reciprocating velocity on wear</title>
<p>The effect of alloy conditions (EMS-cast, as-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> and EMS-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub>) on the wear behaviour under varying reciprocating velocity conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429627">Figure 6</xref>. It can be observed that, in general, the effect of alloy condition on wear behaviour under varying reciprocating velocity conditions is similar to that of varying contact load conditions because the as-cast alloy under varying reciprocating velocity conditions is also subjected to higher wear rates than the EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> irrespective of reciprocating velocity. The alloy condition has been found to significantly influence wear rate under different reciprocating velocities, and the alloy conditions in the decreasing order of wear rate are given as follows: as-cast, EMS-cast, as-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> and EMS-cast modified by CeO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the effect of the alloy condition on wear rate is more at low reciprocating velocity (&lt;0.8 m/s) than high reciprocating velocity (&gt;1.0 m/s). Moreover, the EMS and RE modification of alloy results in significant reduction in wear rate especially at low reciprocating velocity i.e. from 0.2 to 0.8 m/s. In general, an increase in reciprocating velocity linearly decreases the wear rate irrespective of alloy condition (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429627">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111429627">7</xref>). A bar chart showing comparative wear behaviour of the alloys in different conditions as a function of reciprocating velocity shows that EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreases the wear rate as compared to that of the as-cast one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111429627">Figure 7</xref>).

<sec id="sec9-1350650111429627"><title>Scanning electron micrograph study</title>
<p>Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of wear debris generated during the sliding wear test (conducted under different sliding conditions) of as-cast and EMS-cast alloys modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8</xref>. It can be observed that EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> has produced very fine and powdery particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(b)</xref>) during the wear test while, very coarse and elongated laminates were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(a)</xref>) during the sliding wear test of as-cast alloy at 15 N load. EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> also produced finer debris even at high load (90 N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(c)</xref>). Debris of the as-cast base alloy and CeO<sub>2</sub> modified and EMS cast alloys at 0.2 m/s are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(d)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">e</xref>). It can be observed that the as-cast base alloy produced some large size laminates due to high wear (at velocity = 0.2 m/s), whereas EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> produced comparatively finer debris due to low wear (at velocity 0.2 m/s).

<p>In the case of hypereutectic alloys, the basic phenomenon for the formation of wear debris is the mutual transfer of the material. Debris are produced in these alloys when a comparatively softer material has some harder area, the harder material has some softer area and these two areas come in contact with each other; the harder one pulls out a laminate from the softer material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111429627">15</xref></sup> When one of the areas in contact has coarse, hard and brittle region like the one observed in our case, the as-cast and unmodified hypereutectic alloys have coarse PSPs. Then, the laminates produced are large and elongated ones, as evident from the SEM of the wear debris of the as-cast base alloy without modification and EMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(a)</xref>). Application of EMS and modification of CeO<sub>2</sub> refined the microstructure and reduced the size of coarse PSPs that produced very fine powdery laminates at low load (15 N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(b)</xref>) and small size laminates even at high load (90 N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111429627">Figure 8(c)</xref>). These findings are in agreement with wear test results. The form of wear debris suggests the occurrence of mild oxidative wear under these sliding conditions (low load and high load).</p>
<p>SEMs of wear surfaces generated during sliding wear test (conducted under different sliding conditions) of as-cast and EMS-cast alloys modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9</xref>. In general, SEMs of wear surfaces show abrasive marks, wear scars, craters, ridges and oxidized surfaces irrespective of alloy conditions. SEM of wear surfaces of the as-cast base alloy and EMS cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">b</xref>) at 90 N load, respectively. It can be observed that the worn surface of as-cast base alloy shows mainly wear craters and oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9(a)</xref>), whereas the worn surfaces of CeO<sub>2</sub> modified and EMS cast alloy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9(b)</xref>) show comparatively smoother surface along with signs of oxidation. The presence of surface craters at worn surfaces suggests that the material has been removed from that place in the form of laminates. Some granular kind of delamination can also be observed inside and outside wear craters where small granules of the material have been deposited, as shown in the SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9(c)</xref>) of wear surface of as-cast alloy at high velocity = 1.0 m/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650111429627">16</xref></sup> The worn surfaces of the CeO<sub>2</sub> modified and EMS processed alloy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111429627">Figure 9(d)</xref>) at <italic>V</italic> = 1.0 m/s show comparatively smoother surface than those of as-cast and unmodified alloys, which implies that wear damage was lesser than that of as-cast alloy due to lesser time available for cold weld bonding and heating up of the worn surface at high speeds. There are lesser number of contact points on the two surfaces in contact and consequently lesser or mild wear at high velocities. These results further confirm that wear surfaces of EMS-cast alloy modified by CeO<sub>2</sub> are harder, stronger and more coherent than those of the as-cast alloy and also in agreement with wear test results.

<p>EMS of alloys promotes the formation of fine-grained and spheroidal grain structures of alpha-Al besides refinement of PSPs. Rare earths reduce oxygen and hydrogen contents in metallic materials, which in turn reduces blow holes and pin holes, refines microstructure and improves distribution of elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111429627">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111429627">6</xref></sup> EMS of alloys combined with RE CeO<sub>2</sub> shows reduction in the average size of PSPs and average aspect ratio of the alloy. Reduction of such microstructural features in a structure improves the hardness and wear properties of an alloy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111429627">7</xref></sup> Rare earth CeO<sub>2</sub> also form intermetallic compounds like AlCe and CeO<sub>2</sub> with hypereutectic Al–Si alloys that remain unmixed in the structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111429627">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aluminium alloys at low loads and speeds form a mechanically mixed layer (MML) primarily composed of oxides of elements from interacting surfaces under reciprocating sliding conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650111429627">17</xref></sup> MML increases the hardness of wear surface, which predominantly influences the mechanism of wear between the interacting surfaces. According to delamination theory, all the factors such as mechanical properties and morphology of micro-constituents present in an alloy facilitate the easy removal of MML from wear surface in the form of laminates (by crack nucleation and growth processes) and generally increase the wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111429627">18</xref></sup> Micro-constituents present in hypereutectic Al–Si alloys include alpha aluminium, eutectic mixture and PSPs besides some other intermetallic compounds such as CuAl<sub>2</sub>, Mg<sub>2</sub>Si and Al<sub>5</sub>SiFe. In general, size and shape (high aspect ratio) of hard and brittle micro-constituents such as eutectic and PSPs, Mg<sub>2</sub>Si and Al<sub>5</sub>SiFe affect the crack nucleation and growth tendency at hard particles–matrix interfaces and they are known to increase the delamination tendency as they encourage crack nucleation and growth tendency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429627">1</xref></sup> As hard and brittle intermetallic compounds and coarse PSPs offer high stress concentration at the tips of needle–matrix interface, this may be the primary reason for higher wear rates of an alloy in as-cast condition without EMS process and RE addition. EMS process and RE CeO<sub>2</sub> modification of the alloy used in this study lead to mild wear even at high loads/low speeds (velocity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111429627">Figures 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111429627">7</xref>). The transformation of coarse PSPs into comparatively fine PSPs with low aspect ratio in alloys modified with RE addition and processed by EMS significantly lowers the adhesive wear because short and blocky PSPs decrease the stress concentration at particle–matrix interface and crack nucleation and growth tendency, which in turn lowers the formation of laminates by delamination.</p></sec>
