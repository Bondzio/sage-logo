<p>This study investigates the effects of fiber type, fiber loading, and coupling agent on the performance of oil palm biomass (OPB) fiber composites. Fiber composition and fiber morphology were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). Grinded fiber was compounded into polypropylene by means of a twin-screw compounder. Maleated polypropylene (MAPP) was used as a coupling agent during compounding. The incorporated fiber contents for OPB composites were up to 40% (by weight). The compounded samples were prepared into test specimens by injection moulder. The composites were characterized by tensile testing, flexural testing, impact testing, melt flow index, SEM, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The most significant effect on strength and modulus were found by the addition of coupling agent. This was attributed to the thermodynamic segregation of the MAPP toward the interface, resulting in the formation of covalent bonding to the –OH groups of the fiber surface. Composites with MAPP also provided better thermal stability.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311417647" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the growing interest has focused on thermoplastic composites reinforced with lignocellulosic- and cellulosic-based materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311417647">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311417647">3</xref></sup> Lignocellulosic materials are considered new generation of reinforcing materials with thermoplastics since they are renewable natural resources. Furthermore, lignocellulosic fibers, due to the strong cellulose backbone structure, possess good strength properties and the favorable strength/weight-ratio of the fibers is an advantage compared to other conventional reinforcing materials. The natural fiber-reinforcing thermoplastic composites provide attractive new value-added market for agricultural products. On the other hand, such composites are performing with versatile advantages, especially, reducing the consumption of petrochemical-based plastic resins and also increasing the biodegradable nature of the thermoplastic materials.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the utilization of lignocellulosic materials in production of polymeric composites is attractive, particularly because of low cost and high volume applications. Biodegradable lignocellulosic filler possess several advantages compared to inorganic fillers, such as lower density, greater deformability, smaller abrasiveness, high stiffness, reduced dermal and respiratory irritations, good thermal properties, enhanced energy recovery, and relatively cheap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311417647">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311417647">9</xref></sup> These attractive composites are used from automotive interior components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311417647">10</xref></sup> to geotextile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311417647">11</xref></sup> In addition, short fiber-reinforced polymeric composites have gained importance due to the considerable processing advantages and improvement in certain mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311417647">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>At present, there are different types of plant-based natural fibers being used as reinforcing agents with thermoplastic resins. Among the plant-based fibers, flax, hemp, jute, straw, wood, bamboo, baggase, kenaf, palm oil, betel nut, coir, sisal, and banana are most common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311417647">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311417647">17</xref></sup> OPB (empty fruit bunch, front, trunk) is an industrial waste product and hence available at minimal cost. About 30 million metric ton of empty fruit bunch (EFB) produced in the world is considered as by product of agriculture material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311417647">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311417647">20</xref></sup> Malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil. Abundance of oil palm cellulosic materials can be readily obtained from the agriculture byproducts and provides a new area for research and development. It is shown that incorporation of fillers as reinforcing materials significantly changes various properties of thermoplastics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311417647">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311417647">22</xref></sup> Numerous studies carried out on other wood-based filler were also been reported by a number of researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311417647">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311417647">24</xref></sup>. This study investigates the effect of fiber loading and coupling agent on the properties of OPB/PP composites.</p>
<p>However, the main disadvantage of natural fiber is its hydrophilic nature that lowers the compatibility with hydrophobic polymeric matrices. Moreover, it also presents poor environmental and dimensional stability that prevents a wider use of natural fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311417647">25</xref></sup>. For instance, cellulose fibers contain many hydroxyl groups (-OH) and readily interact with water molecules by hydrogen bonding. Therefore, swelling by water uptake can lead to micro-cracking of composites and degradation of mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311417647">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, without using the expensive surface barriers, it is difficult to eliminate entirely the absorption of moisture in composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311417647">26</xref></sup> Likewise, good wetting of the fiber by the matrix and adequate fiber–matrix bonding can decrease the rate and amount of water absorption in the interface region of the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311417647">27</xref></sup> In this context, it is mentioned that optimization of interfacial adhesion between cellulose-based fibers and thermoplastics has been the focus of a large number of research conducted during the last two decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311417647">28</xref></sup> It is commonly observed that coupling agents in wood fiber-reinforced plastic composites play an important role for improving the compatibility and adhesion between polar wood fiber and non-polar polymer matrices by forming bridges of chemical bonds between the fiber and the matrix. So far, more than forty coupling agents have been used both in production and research purposes. Among them, maleated polypropylene (MAPP) is the most popular one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311417647">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>John et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311417647">27</xref></sup> studied coupling agent performance in wood-fiber-reinforced high-density-polyethylene composites and found that the improvement on the interfacial bonding strength, flexural modulus, and other mechanical properties was mainly related to the types of coupling agent, functional groups, molecular weight, concentration, and chain structure. The maximum value of interfacial adhesion was achieved with 3 wt% concentration level for most maleated composites. Beg et al. also reported 3–5 wt% coupling agent is optimum for good adhesion between fiber and matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311417647">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a great deal of research over the past decade has demonstrated the efficiency of the use of coupling agents in wood plastic composites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311417647">31</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998311417647">34</xref></sup> the work of that extent has not been conducted for oil palm fiber in composites. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the coupling agents for oil palm fiber in composites.</p>

<p>The OPB-fibers used in the study were mostly in fiber bundles of 10 to 50 individual fibers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311417647">Figure 1</xref>). OPB-fibers were in irregular shape, with an uneven porous surface. This appearance was believed to aid in the mechanical interlocking of the fibers and the plastic matrix when composites are manufactured from them. From the SEM micrographs, it can also be observed that the gummy polysaccharides of lignin, pectin, and hemicellulose are localized on the surfaces of the fibers. However, the fibers of frond and trunk appeared to have clean but rough surfaces containing large numbers of etched striations. The rough surface morphologies of these fibers are expected to assist with mechanical interlocking bonding mechanisms when used in composites, and the clean surface expected to ameliorate the bonding between the fibers and the matrix material. The chemical composition of OPB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311417647">Table 1</xref>) did not vary greatly with other lignocellulosic fibers, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin as the major components,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311417647">35</xref></sup> which was determined from the EDAX.

<p>Fiber specimens were thermogravimetrically analyzed in a temperature interval of 25°C to 600°C under nitrogen purge and the heating rate was 20°C/min in order to attain the isothermal temperature. Typical DTA/TGA traces for fiber (oil palm EFB) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311417647">Figure 2</xref>. Two main stages of decomposition were observed for the fiber, starting with dehydration combined with emission of volatile components at a temperature of about 300°C followed by a rapid weight loss due to oxidative decomposition corresponding to formation of char as the temperature increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311417647">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311417647">36</xref></sup> The pattern was found to be similar for all the fiber (oil palm trunk, frond, and EFB). The thermal properties of the fibers are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311417647">Table 2</xref>. As the thermal stability of natural fibers depends on the constituents like hemicellulose and lignin, the EFB showed comparably better thermal properties compared with the OPF and OPT, which was attributed to the higher concentration of hemicellulose (29.60%) and a comparable concentration of lignin (17.84%) residues within EFB fibers. Thus, the order of thermal stability of the fiber was EFB &gt; OPT &gt; OPF.

Generally, composites’ TS were found to be lower than that of matrix; however, TM, flexural strength (FS), and flexural modulus (FM) were found to be higher than that of matrix PP. It can be seen that the difference of TS of composites for different types of oil palm fiber (frond, EFB, trunk) was within the range of 4%–5%. However, significant differences were observed for TM, FS, and FM, where these values of the trunk/PP composites were higher than that of frond or EFB composites. The reason of this difference may be due to chemical and physical characteristics of different type of fibers from different portion of OPB. Both impact strength and MFI was found to be lower for composites compared to PP.

TS and MFI was decreased with increasing of fiber content, while FS and impact strength increase with increasing of fiber content. Results of this study when compared with some researchers’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311417647">12</xref></sup> showed that the TSs of natural fiber/polyolefin composites decreases with an increase of fiber content, while results of other workers showed a reverse trend.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311417647">37</xref></sup> The decrease in the TS in this study could be attributed to the weak interfacial adhesion or interaction between the PP matrix and the EFB fibers. Poor interfacial bonding between the fibers and the matrix cause inefficiency of stress transfer when stress is applied on a tensile specimen. These interfaces are the weakest part of the composite and serve as failure part of the composite and as failure initiation points. Moreover, fibers with uniform circular cross section and a certain aspect ratio normally improved the strength. However, the capacity of irregularly shaped fibers like EFB fibers with shorter fiber length used in the study may not be able to support stresses transferred from the polymer matrix, thus there was a reduction of TS as the fiber loading was increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311417647">35</xref></sup>

<p>Addition of coupling agents increased TS, TM, FS, and FM of composites; however, maximum improvement of TS and FS was found for the addition of 3 wt% MAPP with 30% fiber content. At highest fiber content, fiber agglomeration might occur, which results in reduction of strength at 40% fiber loading. FS and FM were found to be increased for 40 wt% fiber content. The improvement of mechanical properties by the addition of MAPP was likely to be due to the better interfacial bonding between the fiber and the matrix.</p>
<p>Coupling agents did not show any dramatic effects on impact strength; however, there was a slight increase with increasing coupling agent. Fiber weight fraction also increased impact strength (IS) and 20 wt% fibers provided the maximum IS. MFI of composites was found to be increased with increasing coupling agent content but decreased with increasing the fiber loading, which is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311417647">Table 3</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311417647">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998311417647">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311417647">39</xref></sup></p>

<p>The surface morphology of virgin polymer was found to be smooth and crack-free, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311417647">Figure 9</xref>(a). It was also observed that certain protrusions are present on the surface of composite materials. Some holes were observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311417647">Figure 9</xref>(b) and (c) that indicated the occurrence of fiber pull-out. This indirectly implies that there was a poor filler-matrix interaction between untreated fiber and matrix. It can also be seen that from the micrograph there was an occurrence of feathering, which indicated the ductility of PP matrix. However, these protrusions were lesser in case of composites with 30 wt% of loading of the filler. Whereas the 40 wt% fiber composites showed undulating and cracked topology. Thus, 30 wt% loading of the filler appeared to be the critical loading percentage of the filler into the matrix material on account of better dispersion and interfacial adhesion. In addition to pull-out of fiber, fiber breakage was also been seen in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311417647">Figure 9</xref>(b)), at a lesser extent than the former. Due to hydrogen bonding between fibers andthe wide difference in polarity between untreated lignocellulosic fibers and the matrix, the fibers tend toagglomerate into bundles and become unevenly distributed throughout the matrix. It is obvious thatfiber pull-out was one of the main modes of failure. Fibers were shown to be oriented in a random fashion. Theexistence of voids as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311417647">Figure 9</xref>(b) and(c) may created the stress concentration points which is in turn reduce the strength of thesamples. It can also be seen that the surface of composite materials with 30 wt% filler percentage wasrelatively smooth compared to other PP composites, which indicated the former was less ductile than the latter.

<p>Thus, SEM examination of fractured surfaces of the PP-based fiber composites (without coupling agent) revealed the poor interfacial bonding. Micrographs indicated fiber pull-out, deboning, delimination, and fiber breakage. At high fiber loading, fiber-to-fiber contact was greater and dispersion problems were evident.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311417647">Figure 10</xref> shows the fracture surface of composites with coupling agent. The fibers did not agglomerate when MAPP was used as a coupling agent. It could also be observed that the wood fibers were dispersed within the matrix. Fiber distribution seems to be more uniform in the PP matrix with MAPP. As compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311417647">Figure 10</xref>(a), the reinforcing fibers appeared to be impregnated uniformly due to the presence of 3 wt% MAPP with PP, which should have increased the reinforcing fibers–matrix compatibility. Overall, this would affect the mechanical and thermal performance of the substrate, where the fibers will potentially be used. It could also be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311417647">Figure 10</xref>(a) and (b) that the polypropylene adhered to most fiber surfaces, as a result of the presence of MAPP. Composite fracture was thus thought to have occurred by means of fiber fracture and shear failure of the polypropylene matrix. It was also observed that the reinforcing fibers in both composites were well dispersed throughout the matrix and separated from their fiber bundles.

It can be seen from the figure that PP showed single major decomposition peak from 267–471°C, with a maximum peak (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) at 420°C, while composites showed two major peaks. With the addition of fiber, the final decomposition temperature increased from 420°C for PP to 464°C for composites with 10 wt% EFB. Further increment was observed on further addition of fiber (from 464°C for 10 wt% fiber composites to 470°C for 40 wt% fiber composites). The increasing of decomposition temperature was attributed to the hindered diffusion (i.e., barrier effect) of volatile decomposition products caused by the dispersion of fibers in the PP matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998311417647">40</xref></sup>

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311417647">Table 4</xref> that composites with coupling agent start to lose weight at higher temperatures when compared to composites without coupling agent. This apparent improvement in thermal stability of the treated fiber composites could be attributed to the presence of the MAPP coupling agent. MAPP is able to bond with the hemicellulose in the fiber, thus stabilizing its structure and improving the thermal stability of the composite. Several authors also reported the thermal stabilization of noncellulosic fiber constituents by means of a coupling agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311417647">41</xref></sup> The poor thermal stability of hemicelluloses and pectins in a composite can thus be negated by the inclusion of a coupling agent. This indicates the complex interactions/reactions occurred between the fiber constituents, the MAPP coupling agent, and the polypropylene matrix of each composites.</p>
