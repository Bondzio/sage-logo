<title>Addressing Cultural Diversity in Gifted Education</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig1.tif"/>
<p>Data clearly point to a lack of racial and cultural diversity among identified gifted population in schools. In <italic>Multicultural Gifted Education</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-59363-699-9), Dr. Donna Ford addresses a myriad of important topics related to gifted education in light of underrepresented student populations. In the introductory chapters of this book, Dr. Ford describes racially and culturally different students and highlights historical and legal analyses of multicultural gifted education. She then speaks to the need for empowering teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary for finding and serving diverse gifted populations and presents several multicultural education models to assist educators in setting goals and objectives for establishing culturally responsive gifted services. Specific chapters are dedicated to assessment, curriculum, instruction, research, and evaluation as they pertain to specific cultural gifted populations. Each chapter concludes with thought-provoking questions and activities to assist readers in reflecting, understanding, and applying the information.

<title>Guiding Gifted Teens</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig2.tif"/>
<p>After surveying gifted teens in more than 19 countries around the world, authors Judy Galbraith and Jim Delisle present the fourth edition of <italic>The Gifted Teen Survival Guide</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-58542-381-4). These well-known authors of valuable contributions in the area of affective needs of gifted students clearly point out in the text’s introduction, “This is not a book <italic>about</italic> gifted young people. It’s a book <italic>for</italic> gifted young people.” Each chapter covers a different topic that teens around the world have deemed most important to them as gifted students. These topics include perfectionism, working with teachers, choosing a college, and relationships with gifted and nongifted peers. Focusing on timely and more sensitive issues, the last chapter addresses hot topics such as depression, homosexuality, developing wisdom, and the meaning of life. Embedded in the chapters are true stories told by gifted teens and short articles written by experts in the field of gifted education. Although the book is written for teenagers, teachers and parents of gifted adolescents will glean insight into social and emotional challenges faced by gifted teens as they explore this valuable resource.

<title>Problem Solving in Science</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig3.tif"/>
<p>The subject of science naturally lends itself to creative thinking and inquiry, setting the stage for content to be adapted to effectively address interests of individual students through problem-based learning (PBL). <italic>Bringing Problem-Based Learning Into the Science Classroom</italic> (ISBN: 978-4-934358-42-9) is a resource that guides teachers in the process of incorporating PBL into everyday science instruction. The author, Dr. Liz Fayer, explains how PBL is different from teacher-directed instruction and clearly describes the key components of PBL. Dr. Frayer discusses numerous topics including teacher anxiety when shifting into the role of facilitator of learning, setting expectations and defining the role of the student in the learning process, engaging students in meaningful discussion, and assessing students’ acquisition of knowledge. A variation in the format of the “KWL” (What we know, What we want to know, and What we learned) chart, commonly used to assess prior knowledge and set specific learning goals for individual students, is presented. In Frayer’s format, the element of how (the “H”) is added. This component adds a critical thinking step to the process by asking students to identify how they will learn what they need to know. Examples of graphic organizers and numerous sample classroom PBL lessons for all levels of instruction, from elementary to high school, are also included.

<title>Designing Differentiated Learning Experiences</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig4.tif"/>
<p>Differentiation has become a common word in most general education settings; however, many educators would like to have more guidance in how to plan differentiated learning experiences that provide opportunities for each of their students to interact with content that is most appropriate for them. Encouraging educators to implement a more rigorous curriculum, <italic>Advancing Differentiation</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-57542-357-9) offers strategies to motivate and engage students, develop student self-regulation, and use the Teaching and Learning Continuum to meet the needs of students while challenging them in their learning. Focusing on the idea that thinking skills play a vital role in the success of differentiation and student learning, Dr. Richard Cash dedicates five chapters of this book to using thinking skills in the classroom. Through tools such as work plans, reflection logs, and graphic organizers, the author explains how teachers can organize learning for individual students in a way that will aid them in actively and successfully thinking their way through appropriately challenging content. The book is accompanied by a compact disc for use in reproducing materials for individual students.

<title>Writing in the Middle</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig5.tif"/>
<p>Do you want to inspire creativity in the writing of your middle school students? Do you want to instill in your students a desire to express themselves through writing? Do you want your middle school students to be proud of their written products and aspire to be authors? Many middle school students have difficulty tapping into their feelings to compose impressive pieces of written work. Drs. Jim and Deb Delise, in their new publication, <italic>Building Strong Writers in Middle School</italic> (ISBN: 978-57542-370-8), provide teachers with the tools to personalize writing for their students in a way that builds confidence, engages thoughtful reflection, and results in written products that capture the inward feelings and personal experiences of young authors. This user-friendly resource is divided into four sections, each focusing on a different purpose of writing. Purposes for writing include writing to get to know others, writing to get to know one’s self, writing to make a difference, and writing to create art. Writing activities within each section include three steps: a hook to gain the students’ attention, an introduction that explains the activity in which the students are about to participate, and an invitation to write or engage in the writing activity presented. Learning objectives, materials, and common core state standards are also provided for the teacher. Activities presented in the book can be extended to allow writers to interact with and involve others in the classroom, the school, and their own families.

<title>Making the Most of Mathematics</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511429541-fig6.tif"/>
<p>Some students may claim that math is like a foreign language! Others may have mastered mathematical content being taught in the regular classroom and be ready to explore more challenging mathematical concepts. <italic>Math Dictionary for Kids</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-59363-644-9) is a resource that can make math more understandable, provide easy access to math definitions, and invite bright students to explore accelerated mathematical content. Written to be used in either whole group settings or by individual students, this book categorizes terms and strategies by algebra, geometry, statistics, fractions, and measurement. With all the main mathematic subjects in one book, it is easy to personalize instruction for each student, allowing them to quickly look up the specific skill they are working to master or have questions about. Definitions are easy to understand and are accompanied by illustrated examples that show students how to use manipulatives to further understand particular concepts. Also included are tables and charts that give lists of factors, multiples, fraction equivalents, and square roots along with measurement conversion charts and a chart for prime numbers.
