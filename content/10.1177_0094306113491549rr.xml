<body>
<p>This book has two themes: an investigation into long-term homelessness as experienced by teens and young adults in Australia, and a study of the process of gaining and experiencing what is commonly described as empathy in field work and interviewing.</p>
<p>Catherine Robinson has a vast capacity for compassion and is intensely affected by the knowledge she gains and the experiences she shares with the homeless youth she interviews and serves. The authenticity of her connection to homeless youth becomes a centerpiece of the book. It is described both theoretically and in brief references to her experiences as an interviewer and researcher, and in both versions it is convincing.</p>
<p><italic>Beside One’s Self</italic> is not hefty ethnographically and relies on few previous homelessness studies. For example, in a brief discussion of the meaning of “walking” in the lives of the homeless, Robinson draws on theorists including Michel De Certeau rather than sociologists Leon Anderson and David Snow, who studied the homeless of Austin, Texas, and who showed precisely how the placing of institutions and services which the homeless rely upon necessitates long treks on foot through a city with few sidewalks, often in intense heat, and seldom with any place of rest, comfort, or refreshment. Robinson speaks of the need of the researcher to experience the experience of homelessness, but she presents the argument theoretically, as an in-depth study of what would normally be called empathy in fieldwork.</p>
<p>We learn that more than half of the homeless young people had experienced sexual or violent abuse and extraordinarily unstable family situations from which their movement into homelessness seemed almost a natural progression. The homeless young people she interviews and serves describe physical disconnection, struggles with substance addictions, and other health problems. But they also describe the community of outsiders to whom they turn for surrogate parents, friends, protectors, and benefactors. This culture of the street is described as a lifeline in a precarious world, but not one without its comforts. The accounts of the homeless also include descriptions of nearly countless passages into, through, and out of rehab experiences, temporary shelters, subsidized living arrangements, and other arms of the state (of which the author was one) who perhaps clumsily attempt to provide a lifeline to the most desperate. Indeed, in the preface she notes Australian Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (just elected as the book was completed) had made “tackling homelessness” a “key part of the new government’s moral and policy platforms” (pp. xvii–xviii). Of course we do not know the outcome of these policy initiatives, but the larger point is that the book speaks two messages: one describes a population that is victimized and adrift, and another that is buoyed by the alternative community of the street and a largely benign (though not thoroughly effective) state.</p>
<p>Much of the book studies how one views and, in fact, vicariously experiences the grief, trauma, pain, dislocation, and suffering that is the daily reality of the long-term young-adult homeless. Robinson refers to this as a mandate to study homelessness as felt and lived. She turns inward, calling upon her own “researching body” to create a path or connection to this new awareness. The expression of this ideal is highly theoretical, and expressed in dense, reference-laden prose. For example, she writes: “Such an insistence on the necessity to ‘stay close’ (Tuan 1975; 151) to felt-experience is critical when as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Elaine Scarry (1985</xref>; 22) suggests, preempting Butler, that the derealization of sentient experience is understood as a political ‘technique of vanishment’ (Schlunke 2005; 208) of already marginal subjectiviites, and further, when the successful expression of pain is intimately linked to its elimination (Scarry 1985; 11)” (p. 19). In fact, much of the book is written in this style: very long sentences with many references that often express an essentially simple idea. This style contrasts mightily with other passages in which her voice and argument are clear and purposeful. For example, she writes at the conclusion of the above argument that “There is a pressing need to communicate an understanding of homelessness as an affective state, to use homelessness as a term that describes the felt-experience of multiple displacements, of deep traumatization and geographical and social isolation” (p. 22).</p>
<p>Robinson is critical of researchers who, she asserts, naively create or call upon their own experience as a basis for understanding. Her path weaves a more complex path. For example she uses the term “corporeography” to describe what she calls the “researcher’s enduring capacity for bodily engagement in and by the field” (p. 26)—the phenomenology of sensing others. These include “sensability”—how the field is “absorbed through the skin”; “seeing”—how her visual universe was redefined in field work; “tasting”—as she sometimes sampled the food and drink which institutions provided for the homeless; “touching”—the body contact that sometimes came with interviewing, at least with female clients; “smelling”—both the creation and dislodging of the odor that comes with being homeless; and “listening,” in which she describes being party to wrenching tales of abuse. Following this useful and moving discussion, she references Kurt Wolff’s concepts of “surrender and catch” in which he described the field work experience in part as a process of what he called love. In this case, Wolff truly reinforced Robinson’s interesting foray into the actualities of fieldwork.</p>
<p>In the end the book has two distinctive personalities, messages and styles. The reader learns a great deal about the human-to-human connection that is the reality of field work when she describes her own fear and embrace of what she observes and experiences, even when she includes memories of her youth, or reflections on her pregnancy. We also learn a great deal about homeless young people in Australia, and how their survival is often a collective effort that produces forms of community through which they hold each other up. Her writing in these examples is often vivid, clear, and compelling.</p>
<p>It is likely that the other voice of this book will speak to phenomenologists, therapists (several of her arguments draw heavily on studies of the therapeutic interview), psychologists, and theorists of ethnography. In fact, much of the book is about <italic>her</italic> learning and her experiences: becoming a “tough persona” and building the psychological reserve for dealing with desperateness that pushed her to her limits and perhaps beyond. This voice is abstract and nuanced, as in this sentence, chosen at random: “…incorporation of the experiences of others is cannibalistic, as Derrida (1991) suggests, but does not nor can it represent a complete consumption by the researcher of the researched, hence Derrida’s (114) consideration of the possibilities of ‘eating well’” (p. 38). It takes patience to make one’s way through many of these sentences and paragraphs, and I have little confidence that policy makers or the homeless who she hopes to reach will have the background or stamina to unravel the book’s often dense prose. More likely the book will be used in advanced qualitative methods seminars, or courses specific to the study of the truly disadvantaged.</p>
