<p>Clarithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic in the United Kingdom and is strongly recommended for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2049936113497203">Schembri <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. The drug’s use among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or community-acquired pneumonia is associated with increased cardiovascular events over the course of a year among patients requiring hospitalization with acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, serious arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death (SCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2049936113497203">Schembri <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. Because increased cardiovascular risk persisted over the next year after clarithromycin was discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2049936113497203">Schembri <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>], the immediate effect of the drug did not explain the above findings even though clarithromycin has a proarrhythmia effect linked in some fashion to QTc interval prolongation and <italic>torsades de pointes</italic> (TdP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2049936113497203">Bril <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>].</p>
<p>Bril and colleagues, in a study of antimicrobial agents linked to QTc interval prolongation, outlined risk factors using a flowchart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2049936113497203">Bril <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>]. Drug-related risk factors were separated into administration, pharmacokinetic interactions and pharmacodynamic interactions. Host-related risk factors included modifiable ones (internal environmental disturbances, heart disease, central nervous system and dysautonomy) and those that cannot be modified (older age, female sex, structural heart disease, long QT syndrome and ion channel polymorphisms). Based on our experience with a case report format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2049936113497203">Vieweg <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2049936113497203">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2049936113497203">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2049936113497203">Kogut <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>], we seek to organize risk factors to better help clinicians manage patients requiring treatment with clarithromycin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2049936113497203"><title>Background</title>
<p>In the 1970s, the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical developed the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin aiming to improve on erythromycin’s spectrum of activities, frequency of administration and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2049936113497203">Zuckerman, 2004</xref>]. A branded version was introduced into the Japanese market in 1991 and the US market later in the same year. Less than 6 years after its introduction, clarithromycin was linked to erythromycin’s adverse electrophysiological properties including drug-induced TdP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2049936113497203">Kundu <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049936113497203">Paar <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2049936113497203">Sekkarie, 1997</xref>]. This linkage is exacerbated by the common coprescription of QTc interval prolonging drugs in the outpatient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2049936113497203">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>] and the coprescription of drugs blocking CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2049936113497203">Sagir <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. Clarithromycin went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-2049936113497203"><title>Clarithromycin pharmacology</title>
<sec id="sec4-2049936113497203"><title>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics</title>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin are similar to those of erythromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2049936113497203">McConnell and Amsden, 1999</xref>]. Clarithromycin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clarithromycin has the greatest bioavailability of any of the macrolides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2049936113497203">McConnell and Amsden, 1999</xref>]. Clarithromycin pharmacokinetics are basically linear and the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is reached within 3–4 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2049936113497203">Abbott Laboratories, 2013</xref>].</p>
<p>The postantibiotic effect of clarithromycin varies according to the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2049936113497203">McConnell and Amsden, 1999</xref>]. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of this <italic>in vitro</italic> observation has not been determined. Clarithromycin penetrates infected tissue sites extensively. Efficacy is based on maintaining a drug concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration and clarithromycin is dosed with a frequency to meet this requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2049936113497203"><title>Clarithromycin as a hERG channel inhibitor</title>
<p>A common feature of drugs associated with acquired long QT syndrome and TdP is their ability to produce pharmacological inhibition of the activity of the hERG (<italic>human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene</italic>) potassium ion channel and its native cardiac equivalent, the rapid delayed rectifier K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> current, I<sub>Kr</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2049936113497203">Finlayson <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2049936113497203">Hancox <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>]. Macrolide antibiotics including clarithromycin have been reported to inhibit the hERG channel current (I<sub>hERG</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049936113497203">Abbott <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2049936113497203">Volberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2049936113497203">Stanat <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2049936113497203">Duncan <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>]. For example, using hERG channel expression in mammalian (HEK 293) cells, Volberg and colleagues demonstrated I<sub>hERG</sub> inhibition by six macrolide drugs of which clarithromycin was the most potent (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC<sub>50</sub>, of 32.9 µM), whilst erythromycin exhibited intermediate potency (IC<sub>50</sub> of 72.2 µM) and oleandomycin was the least potent (IC<sub>50</sub> of 339.6 µM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2049936113497203">Volberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>]. However, in a separate study using a similar hERG expression system, in a direct comparison erythromycin was reported to be more potent than clarithromycin (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 38.9 and 45.7 µM, respectively). In that study both drugs were also reported to inhibit I<sub>hERG</sub> when this was elicited with an action potential shaped waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2049936113497203">Stanat <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>], consistent with an ability to reduce the contribution of I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> to action potential repolarization and, hence, the QT interval. Clarithromycin has been shown to prolong action potential duration (APD) in rabbit cardiac tissues in a concentration-dependent fashion (over concentrations ranging between 3 and 100 µM) and to reduce native I<sub>Kr</sub> amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2049936113497203">Gluais <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. For a given drug concentration, APD prolongation was found to be greater for Purkinje fibers than for ventricular myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2049936113497203">Gluais <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>], presumably because the comparatively impoverished repolarization reserve of Purkinje fibers makes them particularly sensitive to hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> blocking drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2049936113497203">Gintant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2049936113497203">Hancox <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>]. In experiments on intact perfused rabbit hearts, high concentrations of clarithromycin prolonged both monophasic action potential and QT interval duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049936113497203">Milberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>]. In the presence of simulated hypokalemia, clarithromycin could produce cellular arrhythmogenic events [early afterdepolarizations (EADs)] and TdP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049936113497203">Milberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>]. Thus, the preclinical literature demonstrates that at some concentrations clarithromycin can inhibit I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub>, prolong action potential repolarization and, under appropriate conditions, predispose towards arrhythmia.</p>
<p>An intriguing aspect of clarithromycin’s ability to inhibit hERG channels is the potential for this action of the drug to vary between individuals. In 1999, Abbott and colleagues discovered an accessory protein, MiRP1 (also referred to as KCNE2), that can co-assemble with hERG, modifying I<sub>hERG</sub> properties and drug sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049936113497203">Abbott <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>]. A MiRP1 mutation, Q9E-hMiRP1, which was identified in a patient treated who survived clarithromycin-induced TdP and ventricular fibrillation, was found <italic>in vitro</italic> to increase markedly hERG’s sensitivity to inhibition by clarithromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049936113497203">Abbott <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec6-2049936113497203"><title>Analysis of static and dynamic complex variables</title>
<p>Multiple regression analysis evaluates the effects of more than one independent variable on a dependent variable. However, the assumption is that neither variable changes in the course of analysis. Risk factors associated with drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and TdP may change dynamically and the risk factors themselves may be approximations of more specific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2049936113497203">Vieweg <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2049936113497203">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2049936113497203">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2049936113497203">Kogut <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec7-2049936113497203" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a systematic review of case reports published up to and including 17 April 2013. Initially, we entered the following MeSH terms: ‘clarithromycin and QTc prolongation’ (13) and ‘clarithromycin and torsade’ (10) into Medline. We searched CredibleMeds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.azcert.org/">http://www.azcert.org/</ext-link>) for case reports of clarithromycin, QTc interval prolongation and <italic>torsades de pointes</italic> (19). This search was initiated via AZCERT: (“Clarithromycin”[MeSH] AND (“Long QT Syndrome”[MeSH] OR “Torsades de Pointes”[MeSH])) OR (((torsade[ti] OR torsadegenic[ti] OR torsades[ti] OR torsadogenesis[ti] OR torsadogenic[ti] OR torsadogenicity[ti]) OR qt[ti]) AND clarithromycin[ti]). We searched EMBASE (0) and Cochrane (0) only for case reports. Only human studies were included. We also reviewed reports from our files and reference lists yielding a total of 21 cases as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2049936113497203">Table 1</xref>. (A more detailed case narrative appears in the appendix.) Titles and abstracts were independently reviewed by two investigators (WVRV and AB). Disagreement was resolved by consensus.

<p>We found 15 women, five men and one boy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2049936113497203">Table 1</xref>). Among the 17 adults with reported clarithromycin dose and concurrent QTc interval measurement, we found no statistically significant relationship between clarithromycin dose and QTc interval duration (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = −0.086, <italic>p</italic> = 0.744; Kendall’s τ<sub>B</sub> <italic>r</italic> = −0.185, <italic>p</italic> = 0.359; Spearman’s rho ρ = −0.223, <italic>p</italic> = 0.390). These findings did not change for the adults who developed TdP (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = −0.093, <italic>p</italic> = 0.785; Kendall’s τ<sub>B</sub> <italic>r</italic> = −0.159, <italic>p</italic> = 0.541; Spearman’s rho ρ = −0.161, <italic>p</italic> = 0.636). Among adults, major risk factors were female sex (15), old age (11) and heart disease (17). A total of eight adult subjects had all three major risk factors and 14 of the 20 adults had at least two major risk factors. All adult subjects had at least two risk factors besides clarithromycin. A total of four of the 20 adults received cisapride and three received disopyramide. Three adults were considered to suffer from some aspect of the congenital long QT syndrome.</p>

<sec id="sec9-2049936113497203" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the administration of clarithromycin did not lengthen the QTc interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2049936113497203">Van Haarst <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>]. However, plasma clarithromycin levels were not reported in this study. In our study, there was neither parametric nor nonparametric statistical association between drug dose and QTc interval measurement.</p>
<p>The finding of congenital long QT syndrome in three (ages 29, 76 and 79 years) of our 21 patients (14.3%) is quite surprising because the prevalence in the general population is approximately 1:2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2049936113497203">Schwartz <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>]. Our finding argues strongly for inquiry into a family history of cardiac arrhythmia, presyncope, syncope and SCD before administering clarithromycin.</p>
<sec id="sec10-2049936113497203"><title>Cisapride and disopyramide</title>
<p>Among our 20 adult patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2049936113497203">Table 1</xref>), four received cisapride (Cases 4, 5, 6 and 10) and all four had at least two major risk factors (female sex, old age and heart disease). That is, clinicians may have to take into consideration other risk factors even when clarithromycin and cisapride are co-administered. Three of our patients (Cases 3, 9 and 14, ages 74, 76 and 76 years, respectively) received disopyramide and all three were elderly and had heart disease. Again, clinicians may have to look beyond the co-administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide to more completely explain drug-related QTc interval prolongation and TdP. These observations highlight the point that these drugs when combined with clarithromycin act synergistically to increase QTc interval duration and increase the risk of subsequent TdP, but may not be the only risk factors in operation.</p>

<sec id="sec11-2049936113497203"><title>Risk factors discussed in the literature</title>
<p>In 2001, Bednar and colleagues identified 16 risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and TdP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2049936113497203">Bednar <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>]. In 2003, Witchel and coworkers described high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2049936113497203">Witchel <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. In 2003, Viskin and colleagues identified 12 risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2049936113497203">Viskin <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. In a study of 249 patients, Zeltser and coworkers made the point most patients at increased risk for QTc interval prolongation and TdP have readily identifiable risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2049936113497203">Zeltser <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. The majority of their 249 patients had at least one risk factor that could be easily identified and 71% had ≥2 easily identifiable risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and TdP. In addition, most women (female sex being the most common identifiable risk factor) had additional risk factors.</p>

<sec id="sec12-2049936113497203"><title>Multiple-hit hypothesis</title>
<p>Owens and Ambrose in their study of TdP associated with fluoroquinolones describe the ‘multiple-hit hypothesis’ in which several factors influence TdP development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2049936113497203">Owens and Ambrose, 2002</xref>]. Many prescribed drugs including antibiotics and antipsychotics unfavorably affect I<sub>Kr</sub> kinetics. However, this impact in-and-of itself rarely explains substantial QTc interval prolongation and resultant TdP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2049936113497203">Zareba and Lin, 2003</xref>]. Combining the list of risk factors produced by several authors produces the following items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2049936113497203">Zareba and Lin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049936113497203">Sauer and Newton-Cheh, 2012</xref>]: (1) prolonged QTc interval, (2) female sex, (3) advanced age, (4) bradycardia, (5) hypokalemia, (6) hypomagnesemia, (7) structural heart disease, (8) cardiac arrhythmias, (9) drug combinations including ion channel blockers and CYP450 inhibitors, (10) reduced repolarization reserve and (11) genetic polymorphisms of gene coding cardiac ion channels or enzymes in liver metabolizing drugs.</p>
<p>Pathogenic theories include (1) triangulation (short-term variability of action potentials preceding TdP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2049936113497203">Michael <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>]), (2) reverse-use dependence (action potential prolongation at slower heart rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2049936113497203">Hondeghem and Snyders, 1990</xref>]), (3) short-term viability (instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049936113497203">Sauer <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>]), (4) repolarization dispersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049936113497203">Sauer and Newton-Cheh, 2012</xref>]—these four known together as TRIaD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049936113497203">Sauer and Newton-Cheh, 2012</xref>]—and (5) EADs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049936113497203">Sauer and Newton-Cheh, 2012</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-2049936113497203"><title>We need to use all available information about risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and TdP</title>
<p>As pointed out by Owens and Ambrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2049936113497203">Owens and Ambrose, 2002]</xref>, information from spontaneous reporting rates (case reports) is not synonymous with incidence rates (all cases occurring over a specific interval such as a year). However, we believe that if regulatory agencies more vigorously emphasize (perhaps through a reward system) the need for pharmaceutical companies and clinicians to report all major drug-related adverse cardiac events, spontaneous reporting rates for drug-related QTc interval prolongation and TdP would better approximate incidence rates. If more information unfolds supporting the hypothesis that drug safety related to QTc interval prolongation and TdP more depends on clinical assessment (such as case reports) than preclinical studies such as hERG analysis, clinicians may have better guidance when prescribing drugs and more drugs may reach the level of phase II and phase III studies ultimately providing a better selection of possible treatments for patients with serious illnesses.</p>
<p>However desirable it may be to have (1) baseline EKGs, (2) serum concentrations of nonclarithromycin drugs and (3) genetic information identifying subjects with the congenital long QT syndrome, the clinician is left to decide on the merits and demerits of clarithromycin administration based on the presence or absence of more readily available risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and TdP. We propose that sufficient information based on case report analysis exists to presently identify the triad of (1) female sex, (2) old age and (3) heart disease as major risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and TdP among patients about to receive clarithromycin. We believe that the FDA and manufacturer of clarithromycin should provide this information in the clarithromycin Black Box Warning. The closer the patient comes to having all three major risk factors, the more likely clarithromycin administration will link to QTc interval prolongation and TdP.</p>

<sec id="sec14-2049936113497203"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The topic discussed in this manuscript is not new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2049936113497203">Raschi <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>], but we believe merits discussion from a clinical point of view. Owing to the low incidence of TdP, QTc interval prolongation is used as a surrogate marker of drug-induced TdP risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2049936113497203">Shah, 2005</xref>]. Large cohort or population studies and ‘thorough QT’ investigations on healthy volunteers can index the likelihood and extent of QTc interval prolongation with individual drugs, but nonetheless usually provide information on a surrogate marker for TdP rather than TdP itself. By contrast, case reports provide direct clinical information in the setting of TdP occurrence. Consequently, case reports provide valuable insight into risk factors concomitant with drug administration. However, the low incidence of TdP means that the numbers of case reports with individual drugs tend to be limited, as is the case here for clarithromycin, and results from our 21 case reports (20 adults and one child) must only be extrapolated to larger groups with great caution. Another potential limitation with case reports is selection bias as fatalities may not always be reported. Thus, both large sample/population data and case report information need to be considered together when attempting to gain an overall picture of TdP risk of particular drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-2049936113497203" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The FDA has taken the position that current information identifies clarithromycin as an at-risk drug for QTc interval prolongation and TdP. In addition to clarithromycin administration, risk factors include (1) uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, (2) clinically significant bradycardia, (3) patients receiving Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs and (4) elderly patients. On the basis of case report analysis, elderly female patients with heart disease may be particularly at risk.</p>

<td>70-year-old woman was admitted to evaluate syncope after collapsing at home while watching TV. Past medical history included coronary heart disease requiring angioplasty twice (1 year and 3 years before this presentation), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, obstructive hypertropic cardiomyopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. Cardiac problems were well controlled before the onset of syncope. Medications included sublingual nitroglycerin, sotalol, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Four days before admission, she presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of cough, low-grade fever and a left lung infiltrate. EKG then showed normal sinus rhythm and QT/QTc interval of 440/498 ms without evidence of ischemia. She received clarithromycin 250 mg BID for presumed respiratory infection. On current admission, EKG showed sinus bradycardia (50 beats/minute) and QT/QTc interval of 696/641 msec without evidence of ischemia. Serum potassium was normal. Neither atrial fibrillation nor TdP occurred. Clarithromycin and sotalol were stopped. Over the next 5 days, QTc interval returned to normal and she was discharged to home. <bold>QTc 641 ms; clarithromycin dose 500 mg TdP not documented.

<td>27-year-old woman presented to the ED with a 3-day history of irregular pulse and intermittent palpitations. She was a medical resident and may have been more alert and concerned about bodily changes. She denied chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, weakness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. She gave a history of several weeks of clear rhinorrhea for which she had taken terfenadine 60 mg and phenylpropanolamine 60 mg each BID for 1 week. She believed she suffered from sinusitis. Previously, she had used terfenadine for allergies with no adverse effects. After stopping terfenadine and phenylpropanolamine for 4 days to avoid drug interactions, she started clarithromycin 250 mg BID. Palpitations started after the 6th dose of clarithromycin. Medical history was free of cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine or psychiatric disease. Review of systems was otherwise negative and she denied taking drugs, ethanol, tobacco, caffeine or other medications except for oral contraceptives. In the ED, her pulse was irregular and telemetry showed many premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). During these arrhythmias, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation remained normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and a QTc interval of 468 ms. Chemistries were normal and terfenadine was not detected in the serum. She was admitted and clarithromycin stopped. Over the next 4 hours, PVCs and brief runs of VT resolved. The next day, echocardiography was normal and QTc interval was 420 ms. She remained asymptomatic over the next year even when taking phenylpropanolamine. <bold>QTc 468 ms; clarithromycin dose 500 mg VT did not occur.

Clarithromycin 500 mg BID was started. Other medications included transdermal nitroglycerin, iron, erythropoietin, calcitriol, calcium acetate, ipratropium inhaler and cisapride 10 mg TID. Hemodialysis was uneventful and she returned home at noon. Six hours later, she took cisapride just before supper. Shortly after finishing eating, she lost consciousness for a minute recovering spontaneously. EMS found her awake and in sinus rhythm. On hospital arrival, TdP was noted and she again lost consciousness. Cardioversion restored sinus rhythm and consciousness. EKG showed sinus rhythm, severe T-wave inversion anteriorly and QTc interval prolongation (630 ms). Lidocaine was then administered and she was transferred to the ICU. Cisapride and clarithromycin were stopped. Cardiac enzymes were normal, serum potassium was 3.6 mmol/l, and other chemistries were unremarkable. No further cardiac arrhythmias occurred and lidocaine infusion was stopped. Within 36 hours, anterior T-wave inversion returned to normal. QTc interval slowly returned to normal (440–480 ms). Cardiac catheterization demonstrated patent bypass grafting with good filling. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%. She was discharged with no further cardiac problems on follow up. Manufacturer analysis showed that at 15 hours, the last dose of cisapride produced a serum level of 91.6 ng/ml with an elimination half-life of about 24 hours. Following hospital discharge, persistent vomiting returned refractory to noncisapride drugs. Cisapride was again given at 10 mg TID.

Pre-admission medications included furosemide 80 mg BID, hydrochloride 25 mg daily, potassium chloride 16 mEq BID, captopril 50 mg TID, warfarin, cisapride 10 mg TID, oxazepam 15 mg QHS and budesonide, albuterol, salmeterol and ipratropium bromide inhalers. Potassium chloride was reduced to 16 mEq daily, captopril reduced to 25 mg TID, cisapride inadvertently increased to 20 mg TID and the other medications continued as recorded above. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 10 mg Q8H IV and clarithromycin 500 mg BID were started for pneumonia. Admission QTc interval was prolonged (520 ms). One month before, this value was normal (440 ms) at a paced rate of 70 BPM. She remained relatively stable over the next 48 hours and then was found to be unresponsive. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU where serum potassium was 4.1 mmol/l, serum magnesium was 1.94 mEq/l and serum creatinine was 1.37 mg/dl. Antibiotics and captopril were stopped. Medications included ipratropium 2 ml with albuterol 1 mg Q2H, albuterol 1 ml/h PRN and methylprednisolone 120 mg IV, followed by 100 mg BID. Shortly after arriving in the ICU, cardiac monitoring showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (180 BPM). Repeat serum potassium was 3.3 mmol/l and QTc interval was prolonged (640 ms) at a paced ventricular rate of 70 BPM. Multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia continued during the night for which she eventually received a lidocaine infusion. Magnesium was given for recurrent TdP. On several occasion, electrical cardioversion was required. Lidocaine was stopped.

<td>30-year-old man positive for hepatitis C and HIV and enrolled in a methadone detoxification program was admitted for treatment following 10 days of cough, mucopurulent sputum, pleuritic pain, fever and dyspnea. At that time, he had a viral load of 90,000 copies/ml and CD4 + lymphocyte index of 36. Chest X-ray showed an alveolar pattern in both bases consistent with bilateral pneumonia. Laboratory testing showed arterial desaturation, anemia, elevated serum creatinine (2.4 mg/dl), hyponatremia (129 mmol/l) and potassium of 5.0 mmol/l. EKG showed sinus tachycardia (100 beats/minute) and normal QTc interval (350 msec). Initial treatment included infusion of two packed red cells and correction of hyponatremia. IV antibiotics included cefepime (2 g Q8H), clarithromycin (500 mg Q12H), and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim 240 mg + sulfamethoxazole 1200 mg Q6H). 48 hours later, EKG showed bradycardia (35 BPM), QTc interval prolongation (580 ms) and ventricular bigeminy. 24 hours later, he developed a self-limited episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (150 BPM) in a RBBB configuration (QRS 160 ms). Clarithromycin and cotrimoxazole were stopped and IV cefepime continued. Cardiac enzymes were normal. Echocardiography showed a slightly dilated left ventricular and depressed ejection fraction (23%). Immediately thereafter, no new episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred. 4 days later, the QTc interval was normal (360 ms). <bold>QTc 580 ms; clarithromycin dose 1000 mg Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia did occur</bold>. <bold>Risk factors were heart disease, acute medical illness, chronic medical illness, bradycardia, methadone, cotrimoxazole (both directly and as a CYP3A4 blocker), chronic liver disease and clarithromycin.</bold></td>

<td>80-year-old man presented to the ED with 3 days history of cough and productive sputum. Medical history included coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease controlled. At admission, white blood cell count was elevated (18,600) and serum creatinine, electrolytes and cardiac enzymes were normal. Initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia and ST segment depression in the lateral leads. Chest X-ray was inconclusive for pneumonia. He was treated with oral clarithromycin 500 mg BID. After 48 hours, EKG showed QTc interval prolongation (560 ms) and T-wave inversion in the anterior leads. He remained asymptomatic. An echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormalities. Clarithromycin was stopped and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid started. One week later, the EKG was normal. <bold>QTc 560 ms; clarithromycin dose 1000 mg TdP did not occur. Risk factors were elderly, heart disease, acute medical illness, chronic medical illness and clarithromycin.</bold></td>

<td>79-year-old woman presented to the ED with her first syncopal episode. Past medical history included appropriately treated hypertension, hypothyroidism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neurological history and examination was unremarkable. Penicillin allergy was noted. Admission EKG showed atrial fibrillation that reverted to sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block and QTc interval prolongation (496 ms). A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made based on dyspnea and productive cough. Clarithromycin (250 mg BID) and ceftriaxone were started. Within 24 hours of starting antibiotic treatment, she developed brief runs of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia/TdP (QTc interval 542 ms) and amiodarone infusion was started. Amiodarone was stopped following evidence of complete heart block interspersed with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. Unremarkable studies ensued including serum electrolytes, coronary arteriography and echocardiography (small pericardial effusion). Overdrive pacing at 90 BPM was commenced with a temporary pacing wire. However, the wire dislodged with failure to capture at 6 mV. She was transferred to a tertiary care center. Clarithromycin was stopped. A permanent DDDR pacemaker was placed. A beta-blocker was started. At the time of discharge QTc interval was prolonged (500 ms). <bold>QTc 542 ms; clarithromycin dose 500 mg TdP did occur. Risk factors were female sex, elderly, heart disease, suspected congenital long QT syndrome, acute medical illness, chronic medical illness, amiodarone and clarithromycin.</bold></td>

<td>50-year-old woman with history of hypertension and depression admitted for cardiac monitoring following two episodes of syncope during preceding 2 days. Chest X-ray was normal. Serum potassium was 3.3 mmol/l. She had been treated with clarithromycin for an upper respiratory tract infection. Other medications included HCTZ, fluoxetine and potassium supplement. TdP recurred deteriorating to ventricular fibrillation requiring defibrillation. Posterior fascicular block was noted on the EKG and the QTc interval was 620 ms. <bold>QTc 620 ms; clarithromycin dose unknown TdP did occur. Risk factors were female sex, hypokalemia, acute medical illness, fluoxetine and clarithromycin.</bold></td>

<td>71-year-old woman was hospitalized with acute respiratory failure and rapid atrial fibrillation. She was allergic to penicillin, smoked and had previously undergone a hysterectomy. On the first day, she received amiodarone as a 300 mg bolus followed by a 900 mg/day infusion slowing the ventricular rate to less than 100 BPM and then converting to sinus rhythm with negative T waves. On day 2, she received clarithromycin 1 g/day and ciprofloxacin 1 g/day for community-acquired pneumonia. On day 3, rapid atrial fibrillation recurred and hemodynamics worsened prompting mechanical ventilation. EKG on day 4 showed sinus or nodal rhythm (58 BPM) and QT interval prolongation. Sustained ventricular tachycardia developed and was treated with amiodarone infusion. Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin were stopped and ceftriaxone started. On day 5, she had probable nodal rhythm with bradycardia and a QT interval of 640 ms. Amiodarone dose was decreased and she developed rapid atrial fibrillation. On day 6, she had sinus or atrial rhythm, bradycardia, and QT/QTc interval prolongation (630/570 ms). <bold>QTc 570 ms; clarithromycin dose 1000 mg daily Sustained ventricular tachycardia did occur. Risk factors were female sex, elderly, heart disease, bradycardia, acute medical illness, ciprofloxacin (CYP3A4 inhibitor and directly linked to TdP), amiodarone and clarithromycin (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and directly linked to TdP).</bold></td>
