<abstract>
<p>For women serving life sentences, adjustments to prison are often marked by thoughts of suicide. Many enter prison with specific vulnerabilities that place them at risk for suicide. Using data on 214 female lifers, the authors examined the extent of suicide ideation prior to incarceration as well as current suicide ideation. The relationships between preprison abuse, mental health indicators, prison adjustment factors, prison and family supports, and time served along with sociodemographic variables were analyzed with respect to four categories of preprison and current suicide ideation. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated significant group differences in suicide ideation for abuse histories, depression, family and prison supports, and education level. Among the preprison ideation groups, current depression—not abuse history—distinguished between women with or without current ideation. That is, the way women coped with past abuse was a stronger predictor of current suicide ideation than abuse itself.</p>

<p>Approximately 6% of deaths among state inmates are attributed to suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854813476266">Noonan &amp; Carson, 2011</xref>). Although seemingly rare, suicide is the second leading cause of death in U.S. prisons, and rates typically exceed those of the U.S. general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854813476266">Hayes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854813476266">Mumola, 2005</xref>). As is the case among the general U.S. population, suicide attempts and ideation are more common than completed suicide in prison—at a ratio of approximately 22:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854813476266">Tartaro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854813476266">Tartaro &amp; Ruddell, 2006</xref>). More so than those of men, women’s suicide rates are substantially higher in prison than rates of suicide among women in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813476266">Daigle &amp; Côté, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813476266">Dye, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey &amp; Reed, 2010</xref>). Despite the gender paradoxes in prison suicide, suicide continues to be viewed as a male problem. Consequently, there is relatively little research on suicide, suicide attempts, or suicide ideation among women in U.S. prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854813476266">Tartaro &amp; Lester, 2009</xref>); the bulk of our knowledge is found in studies of self-harm of women prisoners in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813476266">Daigle &amp; Côté, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813476266">Jenkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854813476266">Liebling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854813476266">Mackenzie, Oram, &amp; Borrill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854813476266">Marzano, Fazel, Rivlin, &amp; Hawton, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813476266">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, Rivlin, &amp; Fazel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854813476266">Themeli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093854813476266">Zhang, Liang, Zhou, &amp; Brame, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More generally, the “throw-away-the-key” mentality surrounding “lifers,” and the invisibility of women and girls in the criminal justice system in particular, has resulted in a lack of attention toward women serving life sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854813476266">Owen, 1998</xref>). While the vast majority of lifers are men, approximately 4,700 women are currently serving life sentences in U.S. prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854813476266">Nellis &amp; King, 2009</xref>). With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey and Reed’s (2010)</xref> most recent examination of a national sample of female life-sentenced inmates’ preincarceration experiences, much of the extant literature on female lifers consists of small samples from prisons in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854813476266">Owen, 1998</xref>), Ohio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854813476266">Roscher, 2005</xref>), the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854813476266">Genders &amp; Player, 1995</xref>), and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854813476266">Jose-Kampfner, 1990</xref>) as well as anecdotal accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854813476266">George, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854813476266">Talvi, 2007</xref>). Among these accounts, the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of suicide ideation and attempts are minimally addressed, although there is some evidence that female lifers may be at increased risk for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey &amp; Reed, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854813476266">Magaletta, Wheat, Patry, &amp; Bates, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the correlates of suicide among women serving life sentences and, in particular, the ways in which suicide ideation is imported into, exacerbated by, and induced by the prison environment is a key contribution to knowledge about suicide in prison and how women cope with long prison sentences. The purpose of this article is to examine the following research questions: To what extent do women serving life sentences report thoughts of suicide and suicide attempts? To what extent were thoughts of suicide evident prior to incarceration? To what extent do women serving life sentences currently think about ending their own lives? In what ways are preprison victimization, prison adjustment factors, prison and family supports, mental health factors, and time served associated with suicide thoughts? How do these relationships differ given preprison versus current suicide ideation?</p>
<sec id="section1-0093854813476266">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Prior research on suicide in prison has typically taken two approaches, which alternately focus on the individual inmate (most common) or on prison conditions. The research questions central to this study are informed by this body of literature on how inmates adjust to life in prison. Within the larger theoretical debate in the criminology, the deprivation and importation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854813476266">Goffman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813476266">Irwin &amp; Cressey, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854813476266">Sykes, 1958</xref>) attribute prison maladaptation (e.g., violence or suicide) to, respectively, factors specific to the prison experience (deprivations) and preprison characteristics that inmates bring with them (import) into the prison. Although violent resistance as a response to imprisonment may seem intuitive, there is little support for increased violence (i.e., “nothing-to-lose” mentality) among life-sentenced inmates, but suicide ideation and attempts are prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854813476266">Johnson &amp; McGunigall-Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813476266">Leigey, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As applied to suicide, the importation model suggests that suicide or suicide ideation is best explained by individual inmate characteristics that are imported into the prison. Studies in this vein have consistently pointed to prior suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854813476266">Magaletta et al., 2008</xref>); traumatic life experiences, such as childhood and adult physical, sexual, and emotional abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813476266">Clements-Nolle, Wolden, &amp; Bargmann-Losche, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854813476266">Verona, Hicks, &amp; Patrick, 2005</xref>); and demographic correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854813476266">Blaauw, Kerkhof, &amp; Hayes, 2005</xref>). In addition, the mental health of prisoners is well documented in the literature on inmate suicide, with depression and hopelessness cited most often as key correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854813476266">Chapman, Specht, &amp; Cellucci, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854813476266">Suto &amp; Arnaut, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854813476266">Verona et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The deprivation model assumes that suicide and suicide ideation are attributable to the depriving nature of the prison environment. Security level, isolation within the institution, contact with others outside the institution, overcrowding, program availability, and levels of violence and safety influence the likelihood of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854813476266">Bonner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813476266">Dye, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813476266">Huey &amp; McNulty, 2005</xref>). Research suggests that suicides occur more often in maximum- compared to medium- and minimum-security prisons, where deprivations are greatest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854813476266">Daniel &amp; Fleming, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813476266">Huey &amp; McNulty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854813476266">Salive, Smith, &amp; Brewer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854813476266">Way, Miraglia, Sawyer, Beer, &amp; Eddy, 2005</xref>). In particular, placement in a single cell or other segregated housing unit is shown to increase the likelihood of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813476266">Fruehwald, Matschnig, Koenig, Bauer &amp; Frottier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854813476266">Way et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854813476266">Liebling’s (1992)</xref> qualitative interviews with suicide attempters in U.K. prisons indicated that prisoners’ vulnerability to suicide was related to the extent of family and outside contact as well. Prisoners vulnerable to suicide had few or unreliable visits, wrote few letters, had little contact with community release or probation programs, and found thinking of the outside difficult (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813476266">Marzano, Fazel, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Contemporary prison suicide researchers stress the importance of integrated models—the interaction between inmates’ preprison characteristics and the prison environments—as the most vital area of prison suicide research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854813476266">Dear, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854813476266">Liebling, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854813476266">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093854813476266">Towl, Snow, &amp; McHugh, 2001</xref>). The combined model recognizes that prisons are painful and that certain prison conditions increase the likelihood of suicide for some inmates. Key to the combined model is the idea that inmates react, or cope, differently to these conditions largely as a result of preprison characteristics and levels of vulnerability (e.g., sociodemographic variables, psychiatric history, and abuse history as well as values, norms, and life experiences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854813476266">Liebling, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854813476266">Medlicott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854813476266">Zamble &amp; Porporino, 1988</xref>). From this perspective, highly vulnerable prisoners may successfully adapt to living in prison when conditions are less depriving. In the most depriving prison conditions, inmates’ vulnerabilities are exposed; these inmates are worse off compared to other inmates in terms of the ability to cope with the prison environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854813476266">Liebling, 2006</xref>). This theoretical framework as applied to preprison and current suicide ideation is portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093854813476266">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

In terms of the gender-suicide relationship, the primary explanation points to female inmates’ relative vulnerability and experiences with the pains of imprisonment. Compared to men, women in prison have reportedly higher levels of psychiatric disorders, histories of physical and sexual violence, and previous suicide attempts (Leigy &amp; Reid, 2010). In addition, women have increased difficulties with separation from children and family during incarceration because of the location of the relatively few prisons for women, which makes visiting less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854813476266">Liebling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>). There is also evidence that women’s prisons, in comparison to men’s prisons, offer fewer educational, medical, and vocational services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854813476266">Themeli, 2006</xref>) and are more overcrowded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854813476266">Grossman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>This combined model is particularly relevant for women serving life sentences. Despite challenges brought to prison and the deprivations brought on by life in prison, most inmates serving life sentences adjust maturely with confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854813476266">Johnson &amp; Dobrzanaka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813476266">Leigey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854813476266">Ruddell, Broom, &amp; Young, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854813476266">Thompson &amp; Loper, 2005</xref>). However, women who arrive to prison with a life sentence are often in a state of shock, denial, and numbness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854813476266">George, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093854813476266">Welch, 1987</xref>). Prison-induced depression can exacerbate existing mental health problems or cause inmates to withdraw socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854813476266">Kruttschnitt, Gartner, &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>). Depression may be difficult to overcome for life-sentenced women, who experience long-term prisonization, extended separation from children, and diminishing hope of parole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854813476266">Dhami, Ayton, &amp; Loewenstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813476266">Leigey, 2010</xref>). The lack of access to many educational and vocational programs to occupy the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854813476266">Ruddell et al., 2010</xref>) leaves those serving life sentences with limited resources within the prison and a sense of hopelessness as confinement stretches out over time. Family supports and relationships between incarcerated women play a positive role in women’s adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854813476266">Severance, 2005</xref>), as does, for some, the passage of time behind bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854813476266">Dhami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854813476266">Thompson &amp; Loper, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For women in prison, there also is a dramatically increased risk of having experienced physical, emotional, and sexual abuse—especially among women serving life sentences for killing abusive partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854813476266">Dermody-Leonard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey &amp; Reed, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813476266">Schneider &amp; Feltey, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey and Reed (2010)</xref> reported the prevalence of lifetime physical and sexual abuse for life-sentenced female inmates as high as 77.8% and 59.6%, which was significantly higher than the comparison groups of non-life-sentenced females and life-sentences males. Moreover, 83.8% of the life-sentenced women had experienced either form of abuse, and 53.5% had experienced both.</p>
<p>With a combination of negative preincarceration experiences, lack of family connections and prison supports, and a sentence of life behind bars, suicide ideation and attempts may result. Reporting from a national sample of inmates in U.S. prisons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey and Reed (2010)</xref> reported that 35.1% of female lifers had made a suicide attempt in their lifetime compared with 13.5% of life-sentenced males and 28.9% of non-life-sentenced females. Whether the suicide attempt occurred prior to incarceration or while in prison was not distinguished. Although Leigey and Reed examined the traumatic preincarceration experiences of female lifers, the relationship between risk factors (preprison or prison induced) and suicide attempts was not determined. In recent examination of suicide attempts among female inmates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854813476266">Chapman et al. (2005)</xref> concluded that stress associated with incarceration was not a significant predictor of suicide attempts after controlling for current feelings of hopelessness (i.e., pessimism or negativity about the future). Although many researchers have reported links between abusive pasts and suicide among female inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813476266">Daigle &amp; Côté, 2006</xref>), Chapman et al. found only a weak correlation between suicide attempts and abuse after controlling for hopelessness. A lack of consensus, however, remains regarding the effect of preprison factors and the role of penal harm on suicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854813476266">Daigle, Alarie, &amp; Lefebvre, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854813476266">Liebling 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854813476266">Liebling &amp; Maruna, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813476266">Marzano, Fazel, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>). The present study extends this line of research on prison suicide among females and broadens our limited understanding of the experiences of women serving life sentences.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected using a convenience sample from three women’s prisons in a southern state and was approved by the university’s institutional review board and the state department of corrections. Of the 303 women serving life sentences in this southern state, 214 (71%) participated in the on-site survey. Few inmates declined participation; the majority of women who were not included in the sample were unable to participate because of work conflicts or administrative reasons (i.e., disciplinary and/or mental health). According to prison records, most women (92.7%) were convicted of murder charges. Survey results also indicated the average age of the participants was 41.4 years, although there was much variation (range 19 to 78 years). Just fewer than 6% of the sample were between the ages of 19 and 25, 14.7% were ages 26 to 30, 32.7% were ages 31 to 40, 23.2% were 41 to 50 years of age, 17.1% were between 51 and 60 years, and 6.6% of the sample were 60 years of age or older. The majority of participants were White (46.9%) or African American (46.9%). Approximately a quarter of the sample (25.5%) reported less than a high school education, 37% had a high school education, and 37% had at least some college or a college degree. In addition, roughly 11% of the women had graduate degrees. A little more than half (56.1%) were or had been married. Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported having been physically abused prior to incarceration, and 62% reported prior sexual abuse. Eighty-four percent of the women reported histories of some type of abuse—physical, sexual, and/or emotional. For 95% of the women, this was their first time being incarcerated; the average time served at the time of the survey was approximately 12 years (range &lt;1 to 35 years; median 10 years). Approximately 19% of the women had served 5 years or less, and a little more than 10% had served more than 20 years of their life sentence. Comparing the characteristics of the 214 women in the sample with the population of female lifers in the state revealed no differences in sociodemographic characteristics or criminal history.</p>
<p>On the days of data collection, prison staff brought participants to cafeterias and visitation settings. After describing the nature of the research, the research team provided consent forms to willing respondents, and then the team distributed the questionnaires. Questionnaires consisted of closed and open-ended questions on demographics; physical and mental health conditions, including the Hopkins Symptom Checklist; prison adjustment; prison and social supports; prison activities; family supports; abuse indicators; suicide ideation and attempts; and coping with a life sentence.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-0093854813476266">
<title>Suicide ideation and attempts</title>
<p>Three questions about suicide ideation and attempts were dispersed throughout the questionnaire. First, the survey gauged preprison suicide ideation with the question, “Did you ever have suicidal thoughts prior to incarceration?” This question was followed with the question, “Have you ever attempted suicide?” Response choices included yes and no. Current suicide ideation was measured with a Likert-type prompt: “During the past few weeks, have you thought about ending your life?” Possible responses included <italic>never</italic> (0), <italic>rarely</italic> (1), <italic>sometimes</italic> (2), <italic>pretty often</italic> (3), and <italic>very often</italic> (4) and were coded such that lower values corresponded to less suicide ideation.</p>
<p>The primary dependent variable of interest in the bivariate and multivariate analyses was constructed on the basis of the cross-tabulation of responses to the questions regarding preprison and current suicide ideation. Respondents who indicated they “never” think about suicide were considered as having no current ideation, whereas all other responses were considered as having thoughts about suicide while incarcerated. This dichotomized variable measuring current suicide ideation in combination with responses to preprison ideation (yes or no) resulted in a four-category variable with respondents coded as “no suicide ideation ever,” “preprison ideation only,” “preprison and current suicide ideation,” and “current ideation only.” This coding decision was based on the distribution of cases as well as a theoretical rationale. Those who never thought about suicide prior to prison or during the past 2 weeks represented a distinct group, as did those with preprison and any level of current ideation. Any degree of self-reported thoughts of suicide, including those who thought of suicide at least rarely during the past 2 weeks, indicated current ideation. In all cases, women were incarcerated during the past 2 weeks. As such, this measure represented suicide ideation while in prison. A cross-tabulation and chi-square test confirmed a strong and statistically significant association between preprison and current suicide ideation, χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.017, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Respondents who reported no preprison ideation were overrepresented among those with no current ideation (77.2% vs. 44.8% with preprison ideation). Likewise, for most other current ideation response categories, those who reported no preprison ideation were underrepresented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093854813476266">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Fourteen variables were considered in our bivariate and multivariate analyses of preprison and current suicide ideation. These included sociodemographic variables of age (years) race, marital status, and education; as well as time served (years); prior prison history (yes or no); religious coping (yes or no); extent of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; general mental health; current depression; family support; prison support; and prison adjustment. Race and marital status were dichotomous variables where Black = 1 (non-Black = 0) and ever married = 1 (never married = 0). Education was represented by a set of dummy variables (less than high school [reference], high school degree, some college or more). To gauge the presence and extent of abusive pasts, we computed a variable that represented the total types of abuse experiences (range 0 = <italic>no abuse</italic> to 3 = <italic>physical, sexual, and emotional abuse</italic>). The extent to which women rely on religion to help them cope with a life sentence was also examined. For this item, we included responses (yes or no) to the question, “Has your religion helped you in any way to cope with prison?”</p>
<p>To assess the effects of mental health on suicide ideation, three variables were examined. Respondents indicated whether they had ever received treatment for a mental health problem (yes or no). This item gauged lifetime mental health problems, including those experienced prior to incarceration. Current depression was measured using a modified version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854813476266">Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth, &amp; Covi, 1974</xref>). Participants rated the level at which they were bothered by certain symptoms as <italic>never</italic> (0), <italic>rarely</italic> (1), <italic>sometimes</italic> (2), <italic>pretty often</italic> (3), or <italic>very often</italic> (4). For the computation of the scale score, respondents’ scores were summed across seven items that assessed depression. Higher scores indicated a greater manifestation of depression. A Cronbach’s alpha of .79 was obtained for this scale, indicating good reliability (range 0 to 26; mean = 11.99). One item within the depression scale measured the extent of hopelessness about the future. Because feelings of hopelessness have been cited in recent literature as a key correlate of suicide among female inmates, we examined this item separately in the bivariate analyses. A more general measure of self-reported mental health was also examined in which respondents rated their mental health as <italic>excellent, good, fair</italic>, or <italic>poor</italic>.</p>
<p>Family support was gauged by the frequency with which respondents received letters, phone calls, and visits from family. For each method, respondents indicated how often they received contact: <italic>never</italic> (0), <italic>occasionally</italic> (1 to 2 times a year; 1), <italic>fairly often</italic> (monthly; 2), or <italic>very often</italic> (weekly; 3). Responses were summed such that higher scores indicated more family support via letters, phone calls, and/or visits (range 0 to 9; mean = 4.63).</p>
<p>For prison support, we computed a scale based on responses to 15 yes-no questions, such as “I have fellow inmates here who I can depend on” and “Friends I have made here are very important to me.” The prison support scale ranged from 0 to 13 (mean = 9.19) and had a Cronbach’s alpha of .854.</p>
<p>To measure prison adjustment, the questionnaire contained a scale similar to that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854813476266">Zamble and Porporino (1988)</xref>. Our scale consisted of 21 items that produced a Cronbach’s alpha of .86, indicating strong internal consistency. This Likert-type scale asked respondents to rate certain aspects of imprisonment as bothering them <italic>never</italic> (0), <italic>rarely</italic> (1), <italic>sometimes</italic> (2), <italic>often</italic> (3), or <italic>always</italic> (4). For the computation of the scale score, each respondent’s item scores were summed and divided by the number of items constituting the scale. Thus, lower scores indicated better adjustment. Items on the scale included being separated from family, lack of privacy and quiet, loss of freedom, not feeling physically safe, relationships with other prisoners and prison staff, and parole status.</p>

<title>Analytic strategy</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics for the sample characteristics along with frequency distributions for the dependent and independent variables are presented along with select bivariate analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854813476266">Tables 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854813476266">3</xref>). Bivariate analyses consisted of one-way ANOVA, chi-square, and independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests as appropriate. For the multivariate analysis, the multiple responses on the dependent variable suggest the strategy of multinomial logistic regression. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854813476266">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813476266">5</xref>, the following group comparisons are made: no suicide ideation ever (reference) versus preprison ideation only (importation model), current ideation only (deprivation model), and preprison and current ideation (importation-deprivation model); preprison and current ideation (reference) versus preprison ideation only and current ideation only; and preprison ideation only (reference) versus current ideation only. Listwise deletion of missing cases resulted in 195 cases with complete data. A comparison of the 195 cases with complete data and cases excluded because of missing information revealed no statistically significant differences between these groups on any of the key variables used in the regression analyses. Eleven of the 14 variables examined for associations with suicide ideation were included in the multivariate model. Religious coping and prior prison history were not included because of a lack of variation in responses, lack of statistical association, and poor model fit. Only the depression scale and the variable representing ever receiving treatment were included as indicators of mental health. Results from the fully specified regression models are presented and discussed next.</p>

<title>Descriptive and Bivariate Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854813476266">Table 1</xref> presents the descriptive statistics for the sample as well as the distribution of suicide ideation and attempts. As shown, more than 62% of the sample indicated that they had never thought about suicide during the past 2 weeks. The remainder of the sample had thought about suicide rarely (13.3%), sometimes (16.2%), often (2.9%), and very often (5.2%). More than 45% of the sample thought about suicide prior to incarceration. A similar proportion (43.9%) had attempted suicide. These items were highly correlated with near-perfect overlap; those having attempted suicide also indicated suicide ideation and vice versa. In addition, there were no substantial or statistically significant differences in the correlates of suicide ideation or attempts. For our purposes, we used suicide ideation as an indicator of preprison suicide risk and compared this item with recent and current suicide ideation. The breakdown for the four categories of preprison and current suicide ideation resulted in two categories that represented no change in ideation and included those with no suicide ideation ever (<italic>n</italic> = 88) as well as those with preprison and any current ideation (<italic>n</italic> = 53). The additional two categories reflected changes in suicide ideation, whether a decrease or increase, after incarceration. Forty-three women were included in the category of having preprison but no current suicide ideation, and a final group of 26 women indicated no preprison ideation but some degree of current suicide ideation.</p>
<p>Bivariate analyses indicated no statistically significant differences between the four categories of preprison and current suicide ideation for age, race, marital status, religious coping, prior prison history, or time served. Noticeable differences in scores for family and prison support were evident among women, with current ideation only compared with no ideation ever, although these differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. The bivariate analyses also suggest that suicide ideation may decrease with time served. Those with more than 10 years served were more likely to be in the no-current-ideation group than those with fewer than 10 years served (62.8% vs. 37.2%). However, this association was not statistically significant. Significant differences in ideation were found for self-reported mental health rating, depression, hopelessness, history of treatment for mental health problems, abuse history, prison adjustment, and education level. The results of these group comparisons are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854813476266">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>As shown, those in the no-suicide-ideation-ever group were more likely to rate their mental health as excellent or good—59.5% reported an <italic>excellent</italic> rating—compared to those experiencing current suicide ideation (4.8%). Similar trends were evident for depression and prison adjustment scores. Groups reporting no suicide ideation ever or currently returned the lowest scores for both depression (10.07 and 10.37) and prison adjustment (1.95 and 1.93), meaning these groups were less depressed and better adjusted compared to those with current ideation (15.24 and 14.58 for depression; 2.44 and 2.31 for prison adjustment). An examination of the single item measuring hopelessness also confirmed this pattern: Women with any current suicide ideation had higher scores on feelings of hopelessness about the future (2.32 and 2.12) than those with no current ideation (1.35 and 1.33).</p>
<p>A different pattern was evident with regard to abuse history. Women who reported preprison suicide ideation regardless of current ideation had very similar abuse histories (2.38 and 2.40), which were more extensive than those with no preprison ideation (1.66 and 1.75). Likewise, any preprison ideation was associated with a greater likelihood of ever receiving treatment for mental health problems. More than 86% of those with preprison ideation only and 83% of those with preprison and current ideation reported mental health treatment versus 44% in the group with no suicide ideation ever and 58% in the group with current suicide ideation only.</p>
<p>Significant differences in educational attainment were also evident. Women with less than a high school education were overrepresented among those with preprison and current suicide ideation (46.2% vs. 17.1% with a high school degree and 18.2% with at least some college). In contrast, women with preprison ideation only and those with current ideation only tended to have more education. Among those with less than a high school education, only 5.8% were in the current-ideation-only group.</p>

<title>Multinomial Logistic Regression Results</title>
<p>Overall, the results of the multinomial logistic regression models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854813476266">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813476266">5</xref>) were consistent with the bivariate analyses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854813476266">Table 4</xref> presents the coefficients and odds ratios for the comparisons of those with no suicide ideation ever with the three additional groups. The strongest predictors of suicide ideation (compared to no ideation ever) were depression, history of mental health treatment, abuse history, prison adjustment, family support, prison support, and education level. Higher scores on the depression scale significantly increased the odds of preprison and current ideation as well as current ideation only versus no suicide ideation ever by a factor of 1.151 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and 1.229 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), respectively. Likewise, the odds of preprison and current ideation were more than doubled for every unit increase in prison adjustment, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.708, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Since lower scores indicate better adjustment, the findings support the notion that those in the group of preprison and current suicide ideators were both more depressed and less adjusted to prison than those with no suicide ideation ever. In addition, we found that for current ideation only, women with more family support were less likely to be in this group compared to the group with no suicide ideation ever, Exp(<italic>B</italic>)=.791, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10.</p>
<p>The effects of current depression levels were found while controlling for the effect of ever receiving treatment for mental health problems and abuse history. Ever receiving mental health treatment significantly increased the odds by a factor of 3.051 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) for current ideation only and 9.311 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for preprison ideation only, compared with no suicide ideation ever. The only other statistically significant distinction between the groups with no suicide ideation ever and preprison ideation only concerned the extent of past physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Women with more extensive abusive pasts were more likely to have preprison ideation only compared to those who had never considered suicide. That is, for every unit increase in abuse history, the odds of preprison ideation only were 1.5 times greater than no suicide ideation ever (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>
<p>Along with the effect of depression, mental health treatment, and abuse history, having at least a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma lowered the odds of preprison and current ideation versus no suicide ideation ever by a factor of .265 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Thus, the women in this group had lower levels of education than the women in the group with no suicide ideation ever.</p>
<p>The remaining results of the multinomial logistic regression models comparing preprison and current ideation and preprison ideation only with the alternate categories are continued in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813476266">Table 5</xref>. Again, depression, treatment for mental health problems, abuse history, prison adjustment, education level, and prison support influenced the odds of preprison and/or current suicide ideation. Those in the group with preprison ideation only were less depressed, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .846, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and more adjusted to prison, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .287, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, than those with preprison and current ideation. Having at least some college also increased the odds of being in the preprison-ideation-only group by a factor of 3.762 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) compared to the reference group. There were no significant differences in abuse history, prison support, or family support for the groups with preprison ideation only (i.e., no current ideation) and preprison and current ideation.</p>
<p>The current-ideation-only group evidenced significant differences compared to those with any preprison ideation. A unit increase in the prison support scale lowered the odds of membership in the current-ideation-only group relative to the group with preprison and current ideation by a factor of .855 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), whereas having a high school degree or at least some college increased the odds, respectively, by 7.957 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and 5.131 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared to those with preprison ideation only but no current suicide ideation, current ideators were significantly more depressed, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 1.263, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but reported significantly lower scores on abuse history, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .628, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This group was also significantly less likely to have been treated for mental health problems compared to the preprison-ideation-only group, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .164, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Thus, current ideation only was predicted most strongly by increased levels of depression, lower levels of prison support, and higher levels of education. However, this group was the least likely to report past physical, sexual, and emotional abuse or treatment for mental health problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For the women in this sample, their accounts of initial reactions to a life sentence often included thoughts of death and suicide. For example, one stated, “I just wanted to die; seriously wanted to die,” and another indicated, “I wanted to kill myself and still do every day.” This research examined correlates of suicide ideation among women serving life sentences and the ways in which suicide ideation is imported into, exacerbated by, and induced by prison experiences. Consistent with these accounts and with previous research, this study found that histories of suicide ideation and attempts were prevalent among female life-sentenced inmates; 45% reported thoughts of suicide prior to incarceration. Another consistent finding regarded the extent of past abuse and its association with suicide ideation. More than 80% of the female lifers in this sample reported a history of physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse. Preprison ideation was significantly related to histories of abuse and victimization and prior mental health treatment. A high level of depression as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist was also a significant predictor of current suicide ideation, an association that is common among incarcerated and general population studies of suicide. Prison-related factors, such as prison adjustment, prison support, and connections with family, were also associated with suicide ideation (controlling for amount of time served of life sentence).</p>
<p>Although female lifers as a whole appear as a homogenous population, the effects of preprison experiences—especially traumatic ones, such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse—along with prison-related factors have differential impacts on suicide ideation. What emerged in these analyses as distinct from the prior literature were four categories of preprison and current suicide ideation among women serving life sentences. Among these four groups, in general, women who reported preprison suicide ideation differed from those with current ideation. There were also apparent differences for those women whose suicide ideation persisted (no change), began, or desisted (at some point) following incarceration. More specifically, women who thought about suicide prior to entering prison had similar demographic and educational experiences, and their suicide ideation was accompanied by extensive abuse histories and prior mental health treatment. However, some of these women reported no current suicide ideation; others continued to consider suicide following incarceration. For those women with preprison and current suicide ideation, levels of depression, which were likely imported or exacerbated by the prison experience, as well as prison adjustment but not abuse history distinguished this group from those with no current suicide ideation—ever or current. Similarly, women who had considered suicide prior to entering prison were less depressed and better adjusted than women with recent thoughts of suicide, even though these women were just as likely to report preprison physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. One possible explanation for this finding is that these women were incarcerated for killing abusive partners. If this is the case, then a life sentence in prison may be a reprieve from a life of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854813476266">Dermody-Leonard, 2002</xref>). For women with preprison ideation only and histories of abuse, nearly 77% indicated that their past experience with abuse was a factor in their incarceration, compared to 62% of the women overall (<italic>n</italic> = 108).</p>
<p>Current ideation, regardless of preprison experiences, was characterized by high levels of depression, worse prison adjustment, and a lack of family and prison supports. Although extensive abusive histories were reported and the literature suggests that physical, sexual, and emotional abuse are risk factors for suicide among women in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813476266">Clements-Nolle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813476266">Marzano, Fazel, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854813476266">Verona et al., 2005</xref>), abuse history did not produce current suicide ideation when controlling for other risk factors (for similar findings, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854813476266">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, in the multivariate analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in abuse history between the group with preprison and current ideation and the group with no suicide ideation ever; primary differences were levels of depression and prison adjustment, or in essence, how well women coped with histories of abuse while living in prison. Women in the current-ideation-only group (no preprison ideation) had relatively high levels of depression, less extensive abuse histories, and a lack of prison social supports. Most striking, these women were fairly educated compared to other ideation groups and less likely to have received mental health treatment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>On the whole, these findings provided support for the theoretical framework guiding the study’s research questions. Many women serving life sentences are emotionally and psychologically vulnerable because of negative preincarceration life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813476266">Leigey &amp; Reed 2010</xref>), and many are also ill prepared for the stressors and challenges they will face in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854813476266">Aday &amp; Krabill, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854813476266">Greer, 2000</xref>)—consider that in this sample, for 95% of the women, this was their first time in prison. These imported characteristics have a substantial impact on prison adjustment and suicide ideation, independently and in combination with the deprivations of a life sentence behind bars. Controlling for time served, preprison experiences and suicide ideation, which were imported into the prison, influenced how women adjusted to prison, their feelings of depression and support, and current suicide ideation. Women with no suicide ideation ever come to prison with (or without) life experiences that better equip them to cope with living in prison, whereas current ideators bring with them experiences that either yield thoughts of suicide or, in combination with prison deprivations, exacerbate or promote these ideations. For example, abuse history was a significant preprison experience predictive of suicide ideation but was not the only factor and was not a significant predictor of suicide ideation for all women. The same was the case for having ever received mental health treatment. In addition, whereas higher levels of education may indicate a greater degree of social capital in conventional society, it may result in increased vulnerability or a lack of capital or resources in the prison setting. If this is the case, then the deprivations of prison may have a more pronounced effect on suicide ideation for this group of women. The lack of prison support evident among women with current ideation offers only some support for this explanation.</p>
<p>The findings presented and described in this research are interesting and represent an important addition to the understanding of suicide ideation among incarcerated women as well as the experiences of female lifers. However, several important limitations of this study should be noted. The study design relied on a large convenience sample of women serving life sentences in three prisons in one southern state. Given this methodology, the results may not generalize beyond this sample of women who volunteered to participate, to inmates in other state prisons, or to inmates outside the United States. One seriously potential problem with this volunteer sample was that although a few inmates were unwilling to participate, many were unable to participate because of disciplinary or mental health reasons. Within these groups, those most at risk of suicide may have been excluded from the sample. However, this sample of female lifers is drawn from a state with a relatively large population of inmates and female lifers. When compared to the sample characteristics of female lifers in the Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854813476266">U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2004</xref>), sociodemographic, criminal, mental health, and suicide histories are consistent. On the whole, then, the results may be consistent with experiences of female lifers elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, the intent of the initial survey design was to garner much needed information about the everyday lives of life-sentenced women. The purpose was broad in scope rather than a specific examination of suicide ideation and attempts. The questions that were included were based on self-reports of suicide ideation and attempts prior to prison and within the past 2 weeks and were simple in structure. Prior research on suicide ideation and attempts have included more comprehensive scales, such as Beck’s Scale for Suicide Ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093854813476266">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), the Lethality of Suicide Attempt Rating Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854813476266">Magaletta et al., 2008</xref>), and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813476266">Clements-Nolle et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the self-reported questions regarding suicide were not corroborated with clinical or mental health records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854813476266">Verona et al., 2005</xref>). Other studies have distinguished between intent to die, lethality, and self-harming behaviors, which are also common among women in prison but which may have different explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854813476266">Borrill, Snow, Medlicott, Teers, &amp; Paton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813476266">Daigle &amp; Côté, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854813476266">Tartaro &amp; Lester, 2009</xref>). Although many common predictors of suicide ideation were included as questions in the survey, important additional predictors were likely omitted. Situation-specific factors related to incarceration, parole status, or bad news from home—factors that are particularly prevalent among lifers—are pointed to as more proximate correlates of suicide among inmates that alone or combined with preincarceration experiences may better explain the causes of suicide in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>). Although questions were geared at retrospective accounts of preprison experiences as well as self-reported ratings of mental health, prison adjustment, and supports from within and outside the prison, the findings of this research should be considered correlational rather than causal. In addition, given our measure of lifetime treatment for mental health problems, we could not differentiate whether this treatment occurred before prison or after incarceration or how recently that treatment was received.</p>
<p>Abuse histories are prevalent among incarcerated women and are associated with suicide for some women. It is the case, however, that even when confronted with similar traumatic preincarceration experiences as well as the deprivations of prison, the majority of inmates do not commit suicide in prison. It remains unclear the processes that lead some women with abuse histories to crime, a life sentence in prison, or suicide. Manifestations of suicide ideation and attempts likely operated differently for women who experience different types of abuse (e.g., physical only vs. sexual) as well as variations in the duration and intensity of abuse. This study only speculated about those different processes, but these relationships between abuse history and suicide ideation should be examined in future research.</p>
<p>Although the results point to the important role of social support, previous research has documented a much stronger relationship between (lack of) prison supports and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813476266">Jenkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813476266">Marzano, Fazel, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813476266">Marzano, Hawton, et al., 2011</xref>). Although prison supports were marginally significant for the prediction of current suicide ideation, the prison adjustment scale, which gauged “problems” with prison life rather than supports, was a consistent and strong predictor of suicide ideation. Additional analysis must examine the varied role of family and prison support in women’s adjustment to a life sentence, including suicide ideation. Additional research on suicide in prison should also compare importation and deprivation outcomes for men and women, for lifers and inmates with other sentence lengths, and other special populations behind bars. For example, incarcerated mothers are often the focus of study, fascination, and debate. Although this study did not examine the degree to which incarcerated mothers report thoughts of suicide, being disconnected from children, dismissed from the role of mother, and labeled as a “bad mother” may produce feelings of hopelessness and suicide ideation. In contrast, incarcerated mothers may have protective factors (i.e., children) that prevent suicide. More than 70% of the women in this sample reported having children, with an overrepresentation of mothers—83.7%—found among the group with preprison ideation only.</p>
<p>Despite these limits and the vast array of research questions left unaddressed about female lifers, this study demonstrates many contributions. An important strength rests with the relatively large sample, which is the largest known sample of female lifers. This is also the only study framed by the importation and deprivation models that examines preprison and current suicide ideation among female lifers. Given the broad scope of this large data set on female lifers, additional analyses will add to our understanding of the experiences of women serving life sentences and provide practical policy implications for treatment of life-sentenced women as well as those with current suicide ideation. In particular, prison suicide prevention policies should document the processes of suicide ideation and risk, given varied histories of preprison suicide ideation and abuse as well as current mental health indicators.</p>
