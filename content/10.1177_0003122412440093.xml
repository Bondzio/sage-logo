<abstract>
<p>Institutional changes associated with the rise of shareholder value capitalism have had seemingly contradictory effects on managers and managerialism in the United States economy. Financial critiques of inefficient corporate bureaucracies and the resulting wave of downsizing, mergers, and computerization subjected managers to unprecedented layoffs during the 1980s and 1990s as firms sought to become lean and mean. Yet the proportion of managers and their average compensation continued to increase during this period. How did the rise of anti-managerial investor ideologies and strategies oriented toward reducing companies’ labor costs coincide with increasing numbers of ever more highly paid managerial employees? This article examines the paradoxical relationship between shareholder value and managerialism by analyzing the effects of shareholder value strategies on the growth of managerial employment and managerial earnings in 59 major industries in the U.S. private sector from 1984 to 2001. Results from industry-level dynamic panel models show that layoffs, mergers, computerization, deunionization, and the increasing predominance of publicly traded firms all contributed to broad-based increases in the number of managerial positions and the valuation of managerial labor. Results are generally consistent with David Gordon’s (1996) fat and mean thesis.</p>

<p>The determinants and historical progression of managerialism and managerial intensity in formal organizations have long interested sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412440093">Bendix 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412440093">Guillén 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122412440093">Weber 1978</xref>). During the early twentieth century, managers assumed control of growing corporations and built expansive, complex administrative bureaucracies well-suited to their purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122412440093">Berle and Means 1932</xref>). Separation of investor ownership from management control allowed managers to insulate themselves from the discipline of the market; this assured managerial incumbents job security, generous pay, and privileged access to internal labor markets. As a result of this institutional configuration, the U.S. economy saw continual increases in the ranks and rewards of managerial employees throughout the postwar era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This all appeared to change with the shareholder value revolution and the spread of organizational restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s. Scholars and popular commentators heralded the end of managerialist modes of organization as a resurgent Wall Street sought to heighten profits by dismantling corporate bureaucracies and trimming the ranks and perquisites that managers had long enjoyed in America’s large firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412440093">Caves and Krepps 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122412440093">Hirsch 1993</xref>). Financial critiques of bureaucratic bloat and the resulting wave of downsizing, mergers, and computerization subjected managers to unprecedented layoffs and appeared to confirm predictions that managers would eventually face the same sort of business cycle insecurity previously borne only by blue-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412440093">Osterman 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412440093">2006</xref>). Analyses of displaced worker surveys confirmed that managers were increasingly likely to suffer layoffs during the 1980s; by the early 1990s, layoff rates for managers had nearly surpassed those for blue-collar production workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412440093">Cappelli 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412440093">Gardner 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>But at the same time that managers came under fire, sociologists had largely abandoned their classic concern with the study of managerial intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122412440093">Baron, Hannan, and Burton 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122412440093">1</xref></sup> Scholars have probed the effects of corporate restructuring and employment reorganization on job stability, career paths, and workplace morale, but there has been surprisingly little systematic research on the paradoxical fact that the shareholder value revolution failed to staunch the growth of managerial positions and pay in the U.S. economy: the proportion of managerial employees in the U.S. private sector rose steadily from the mid-1980s through the early 2000s by several different metrics. Furthermore, hourly earnings for managerial incumbents increased 34 percent at the same time overall wages stagnated. As a result, the share of total business income devoted to managerial salaries actually rose from 16 to 23 percent between 1984 and 2001 (author’s calculation from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412440093">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis [2010]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122412440093">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [2010a]</xref> data).</p>
<p>How do we reconcile the fact that managerial employment and pay continued to increase during a period when dominant institutional currents and much previous research would suggest just the opposite? In other words, how did the well-documented spread of lean and mean strategies oriented toward reducing companies’ labor costs and trimming corporate bureaucracies coincide with increasing numbers of highly rewarded managerial positions? Ample evidence suggests that top executives learned to re-channel the anti-managerial thrust of shareholder value pressures in self-enriching ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412440093">Westphal and Zajac 1998</xref>), in part because executives’ own compensation became tied to their ability to cut labor costs. But it is still not clear how to square this with the improbable increases in the total number and pay of the broader class of middle-managers whom executives were charged with trimming.</p>
<p>I assess three different possibilities. The most straightforward explanation is that shareholder value strategies did negatively impact managerial positions and pay, but these effects were outweighed by stronger countervailing pressures that caused managerial employment and earnings to increase in the aggregate, such as the structural shift in the economy toward more managerially intensive service and financial industries (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412440093">Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin 2011</xref>). Second, an institutionalist explanation suggests shareholder value had no impact on managerial growth because its anti-managerial symbolism was decoupled from actual organizational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412440093">DiMaggio and Powell 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412440093">Westphal and Zajac 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412440093">2001</xref>). Finally, a third thesis suggests lean and mean strategies positively contributed to increasing managerial positions and pay by transforming organizational structures and employment practices in ways that heightened demand for managerial labor and enhanced managers’ ability to capture rents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412440093">Meyer 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>I test these alternatives by analyzing the effects of prototypical shareholder value strategies on the growth trajectories of managerial employment and earnings in 57 major industries in the United States from 1984 to 2001. In probing the relationship between shareholder value strategies and managerial growth, the analysis builds on a line of work pioneered by the late political economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">David Gordon (1996)</xref>. Gordon’s study was the first to show systematically that the supposed assault on managers during the late 1980s and early 1990s actually coincided with continued aggregate increases in managerial employment and pay in the U.S. economy. Gordon furthermore argued that these two processes were causally related insofar as attempts to heighten efficiency by squeezing labor costs necessarily result in demand for more managerially intensive supervision. However, this latter element in Gordon’s argument (the causal link between labor cost-cutting strategies and managerial growth) rests on shaky methodological grounds, namely aggregate time trends and cross-national correlations.</p>
<p>This article presents a much more rigorous test. It decomposes aggregate data to the industry-level and longitudinally analyzes effects of mergers, layoffs, computerization, deunionization, and the growing predominance of publicly traded firms and institutional investors on managerial employment and hourly earnings. Results from dynamic panel specifications show that layoffs, mergers, computerization, deunionization, and the increasing predominance of publicly traded firms all contributed to broad-based increases in the number and pay levels of managerial positions in U.S. industries.</p>

<title>Shareholder Value and Reorganization of U.S. Firms</title>
<p>The 1980s saw a revolution in corporate governance and management ideology in the United States. A diffuse alliance of institutional investors, financial economists, investment banks, stock analysts, management consultants, and a new generation of financially trained executives advocated and progressively institutionalized a new paradigm for reorganizing large corporations’ structures and behaviors. Economic sociologists have subsumed these multifaceted changes under the rubric of the <italic>shareholder value</italic> revolution. Shareholder value can be conceived of as both an epochal business ideology and a dominant institutional configuration within U.S. capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412440093">Fligstein 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412440093">2001</xref>). It is marked by (1) investor dominance and the use of financial markets to discipline corporate activities, (2) financial conceptions of control that stress stock performance and rate of return over alternative performance metrics such as growth, (3) a strategic emphasis on cost-cutting and short-term profits, and (4) streamlined organizational structures and a focus on core competencies. Economic sociologists have extensively documented the rise and spread of shareholder value institutions as firms reorganized their assets, governance structures, and employment strategies to cut costs and boost short-term stock value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122412440093">Davis and Thompson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122412440093">Useem 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412440093">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412440093">Westphal and Zajac 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412440093">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122412440093">Zorn et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Less research has examined the broader consequences of this shift in economic organization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412440093">Fligstein and Shin (2007)</xref> point out, shareholder value involved not only a succession of corporate control or ploys for manipulating stock prices, but also a concrete set of tactics and organizational practices that significantly reshaped organizations, work, and employment. Central to this project were organizational transformations intended to refashion firms as lean and mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412440093">Budros 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis 2009</xref>). By lean and mean, I refer to strategies aimed at reducing companies’ labor costs and streamlining managerial bureaucracies through various forms of corporate restructuring. In particular, layoffs, computerization, mergers, and attacks on unions all emerged as collectively understood means to decrease labor costs and for executives to signal their commitment to boosting shareholder value. None of these strategies were new, but starting in the 1980s the shareholder value logic became the common institutional thread linking them together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412440093">McCall 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412440093">Fligstein and Shin (2007)</xref> report that at the industry-level, mergers were followed by layoffs, layoffs coincided with increased investment in computer technologies, and computers then replaced workers in highly unionized industries. Downsizing was also more prevalent in industries with higher rates of unionization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122412440093">Baumol, Blinder, and Wolff 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412440093">Figure 1</xref> plots the incidence of mergers, layoffs, and real investment in computer technologies during the core years of the shareholder value revolution from 1984 to 2000. (For the sake of presentation, all three series are normalized to 1984 = 1.) The graph shows that the U.S. private sector aggressively pursued all three of these strategies, especially during the period of economic growth from the mid- to late-1990s.</p>

<p>Firms’ attempts to streamline in accordance with shareholder value ideology differed from traditional job reductions because they did not reflect adaptation to shifting economic circumstances so much as adaptation to an institutional environment that prescribed downsize-and-distribute as a normative orientation of corporate activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412440093">Lazonick and O’Sullivan 2000</xref>). Even profitable, growing firms shed positions as restructuring became construed as a sign of shareholder-friendly management, and financially trained executives oriented toward such strategies assumed increasing power within firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122412440093">Zorn et al. 2005</xref>). The voluntary, proactive nature of shareholder value restructuring is evident in the fact that overall job displacement rates were higher during the expansionary years of 1993 to 1995 than at any point since 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412440093">Kletzer 1998</xref>). Approximately half of all respondent firms in the American Management Association surveys reported downsizing during the economic growth years of 1995 to 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412440093">Cappelli 2000</xref>), and job displacements actually peaked at the height of the economic expansion between 1998 and 2000. The locus of layoffs also shifted increasingly from declining manufacturing industries toward growing service industries by the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412440093">Gardner 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122412440093">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Top executives could benefit from labor cost-cutting precisely because their own incentives had been realigned to accord with the perceived interests of financial investors. Firms increasingly linked executive pay to market capitalization rather than employment size to discourage empire-building and to establish shareholder returns as the overriding principle of managerial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122412440093">Hall and Liebman 1998</xref>). In conjunction with the fact that Wall Street favored low fixed-costs and streamlined organizations, this gave top executives a strong incentive to cut. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412440093">Kennedy (2001</xref>:165–66) explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Executives] who want to perform against the standards of the day need to do whatever they can to make sure the quarter comes in right. The heavy and continued emphasis on cost reduction is the most visible manifestation of this trend. Cost cuts, especially cuts in staffing levels, fall directly to the bottom line in a totally predictable and manageable fashion. . . . Since the stock market tends to respond positively to any announcement of an impending cut, why worry? Just keep cutting.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Empirical studies confirm that CEOs of firms that engaged in mergers or announced layoffs experienced sizable and persistent pay increases, mostly in the form of bonus or stock-based compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412440093">Brookman, Chang, and Rennie 2007</xref>). Evidence also shows that CEOs whose firms won union decertification elections received subsequent pay increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412440093">DiNardo, Hallock, and Pischke 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, if the overarching aim of shareholder value ideology was that executives should restructure firms to accord with the interests of shareholders, lean and mean strategies came to be seen as a key means of achieving or signaling conformance with this goal. At the same time, growing sectors of the economy, such as retail and services, were becoming increasingly dominated by publicly traded corporations. This meant an ever-greater proportion of workers were employed in firms subject to shareholder value pressures (author’s calculation from Compustat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122412440093">Standard and Poor’s 2008</xref>] and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412440093">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis [2010]</xref> data).</p>
<sec id="section2-0003122412440093">
<title>Assault on Managerialism</title>
<p>The bid to reduce labor costs had a particular distributional character. Cost-cutting strategies were largely directed at traditional targets like workers and unions. The reigning wisdom on Wall Street held that reducing wage rents for workers would help boost shareholder value after a decade of falling profits during the 1970s and early 1980s. Shedding unionized labor was likely an ulterior motive behind much restructuring, particularly in manufacturing industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The far more novel aspect of shareholder value ideology was that it was also very much anti-managerial. In the bureaucracies that predominated in postwar corporate America, managerial pay and status were closely linked to the number of subordinates because rewards filtered up the organizational hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122412440093">Jackall 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412440093">Rosen 1982</xref>). This created incentives for managers to build their own mini-empires by hiring more and more subordinates. Separation of investor ownership from managerial control insulated white-collar incumbents from market pressures, bringing them job security, annual pay raises, and well-defined career ladders in return for loyalty and competence.</p>
<p>However, scholars and critics alike noted that this bureaucratic logic of managerial empire-building came into tension with the capitalist logic of profit maximization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412440093">Dahrendorf (1972</xref>:46) put it, “never has the imputation of a profit motive been further from the real motives of men than it is for modern bureaucratic managers.” Whether this characterization was accurate, shareholder value critics singled out paternalistic corporate policies and the languid bureaucrats they sheltered as another cause of stagnating profits. Middle-managers were especially targeted due to the perception that they represented an overpaid and underproductive drain on resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412440093">Osterman 2008</xref>). The CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, who is often cited as a paragon of the shareholder value orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412440093">Kennedy 2001</xref>), bemoaned of middle management, “we were hiring people just to read reports of people who had been hired just to write reports” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>:51).</p>
<p>Reducing managerial positions was often a primary motive behind corporate restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412440093">Jacoby 2000</xref>). Streamlining hierarchies frequently entailed the wholesale removal of entire management layers. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122412440093">Batt (1996)</xref> describes a unit at AT&amp;T where an explicit goal of restructuring was to decrease the ratio of managers to non-managers from 1:5 to 1:30. Mergers and acquisitions also became a means of excising perceived managerial bloat. Corporate raider Carl Icahn became well known for pursuing this strategy with zeal during the 1980s. In a <italic>New York Times Magazine</italic> article he decried the “incompetent, inbred managements of many of our major corporations” and described his task as eliminating “layers of bureaucrats reporting to bureaucrats” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412440093">Icahn 1989</xref>). Investment banks also aggressively marketed synergistic merger-combinations as a strategy to reduce costs associated with redundant headquarters staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122412440093">Ho 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The effects of shareholder value restructuring on managers are evident in the increasing rates of job loss they suffered relative to both their own historical security and other workers. Involuntary displacement rates for executive, administrative, and managerial occupations during the 1981 to 1982 recession were 2.5 percent but increased to 4.7 percent by 1991 to 1992. Rates for blue-collar operators and fabricators actually declined from 8.2 to 5.3 percent across these two downturns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412440093">Gardner 1995</xref>). Managers and professionals together accounted for 35 percent of new unemployment during 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412440093">Caves and Krepps 1993</xref>). Nor was managerial downsizing merely an episodic event of the early 1990s. Managers accounted for a disproportionate 19 percent of all involuntary job displacements in the private sector from 1999 to 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122412440093">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2002</xref>). This percentage was even higher among the large firms included in the American Management Association’s downsizing and layoff surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412440093">Jacoby 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412440093">Osterman (2006</xref>:194) put it, “regardless of whether the impetus was tougher governance or organizational innovation, at a first approximation the results were the same for many middle managers: they lost their jobs.”</p>
<p>In short, a great deal of research in sociology and labor economics suggests that the restructuring of U.S. companies in accordance with shareholder value ideologies augured the end of postwar managerialism. By this account, the discipline of financial markets not only targeted management positions but also upended the whole white-collar career logic and executive incentive structures that had allowed managers to become so numerous and prosperous in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122412440093">Hirsch 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Managerial Persistence</title>
<p>In contrast to the research discussed earlier, other data show that the classic managerialist tendency to create more and more high-paying managerial positions continued unchecked throughout the shareholder value era. Even as layoffs heightened turnover, the number and proportion of managerial employees, their pay levels, and their share of total corporate income in the U.S. economy all grew steadily from the mid-1980s through the early 2000s.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122412440093">Figure 2</xref> charts the proportions of total business income devoted to production and supervisory/nonproduction employees’ wages. Supervisory employees is a broad definition of managers that encompasses all types of employees for whom supervision is a primary task. Supervisory salaries as a proportion of total business income increased from 16 to 23 percent between 1980 and 2004, while nonsupervisory workers’ share of corporate income decreased from 36 to 27 percent. Also striking is that total employee pay as a proportion of corporate income (the sum of the two lines) remained virtually unchanged across this period, hovering near 51 percent and only dropping to 49 percent after 2001. This highlights one of the most striking contradictions of the shareholder value regime: it resulted in neither reduced managerial labor costs nor a significant shift of corporate income from employees to owners. Instead, the rise of shareholder value coincided with a massive redistribution in the composition of employee pay from workers to managers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122412440093">Figure 4</xref> plots real average hourly earnings for managerial incumbents. It shows managerial earnings appreciated 34 percent over the study period. This means that returns to managerial positions increased in spite of negative wage pressures from layoffs. When interpreting the upward earnings trend it is important to note that the series plotted here is unaffected by high-earning outliers (see below). Nor does the series include stock-based compensation. This means that managerial earnings growth was not simply a function of increased equity pay.</p>
<p>As important as any of the individual trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122412440093">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122412440093">4</xref> is the fact that managerial positions and pay both moved upward in unison. One argument about managerial rewards during this period is that average pay increased largely because culling of the lower managerial ranks concentrated positions and rewards among a relatively small number of personnel at the top of the hierarchy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122412440093">Figure 3</xref> shows this to be false. The increasing portion of corporate income captured by managers is not only a story of steep increases in top executive compensation, but also of broad-based growth in the overall number of managers and their rewards.</p>
<p>Data depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122412440093">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122412440093">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122412440093">4</xref> show similar upward trends across several different measures and definitions of managers. Total payments to supervisory employees increased relative to both nonsupervisory employees and total corporate income. The number, proportion, and hourly pay of the narrower executives, administrators, and managers category also increased. Together, these data call into question arguments that investor capitalism augured the end of managerialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis 2009</xref>). They point instead toward a more complex and counterintuitive relationship between the supposedly anti-managerial shareholder value regime and the actuality of managers in the U.S. economy.</p>

<title>Explanations</title>
<p>The data and previous research discussed earlier present two seemingly contradictory sets of facts. First, U.S. firms shed managerial positions en masse during the 1980s and 1990s as they restructured in accordance with shareholder value orthodoxy. Second, the ranks and rewards of managers continued to grow unabated throughout this period. This raises the question of what effect, if any, putatively anti-managerial shareholder value strategies had on managerialism? How do we reconcile the observed trend toward managerial downsizing with the aggregate increases in the ranks and rewards accruing to managerial incumbents? There are three basic overarching sets of answers. I discuss each of these below.</p>
<sec id="section5-0003122412440093">
<title>Countervailing Pressures</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, previous research suggests that corporations’ embrace of shareholder value strategies put real downward pressure on managerial positions and earnings during the late 1980s and 1990s. One way to reconcile this with persistent aggregate growth of managerial employment and pay is to suppose that negative effects of restructuring simply were not strong enough to counter other forces militating toward heightened demand and rewards for managers.</p>
<p>The most likely countervailing factor is the progressive shift in the sectoral composition of employment and compensation from manufacturing toward services and finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412440093">Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin 2011</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412440093">Littler and Innes 2004</xref>). For instance, financial industries tend to employ managers at a significantly higher rate, and pay higher salaries, than does the economy as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122412440093">Scott, O’Shaughnessy, and Cappelli 1996</xref>). Disproportionate growth of industries with high managerial intercepts could lead to aggregate increases in managerial positions and pay despite negative within-industry effects of shareholder value strategies. In other words, the presence of greater numbers of firms in industries with greater managerial intensity and pay levels may have outweighed individual firms’ efforts to reduce managerial costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122412440093">3</xref></sup> By this account, persistent aggregate managerial growth occurs <italic>in spite of</italic> the anti-managerial shareholder value revolution. The countervailing pressures theory predicts that <italic>shareholder value strategies such as layoffs, mergers, and computerization did exert negative (but ultimately feeble) effects on managerial employment and earnings within U.S. industries</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122412440093">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003122412440093">
<title>Strong Managers and Decoupling</title>
<p>A second explanation of the contradictory trends suggests that shareholder value restructuring had <italic>no effect</italic> on managerial employment and compensation because its anti-managerial thrust was largely symbolic. Institutionalized conceptions of control, such as shareholder value, create powerful shared assumptions about the rationality of particular practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412440093">Fligstein 2001</xref>). Institutional theorists have argued that it is precisely this taken-for-grantedness that allows the operative meanings or actuality of practices to become decoupled from their avowed functions, thereby assuming the role of myth and ceremony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412440093">Meyer and Rowan 1977</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412440093">Westphal and Zajac (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412440093">2001</xref>) show how executives symbolically managed shareholder value pressures by announcing but then failing to implement long-term executive compensation packages and stock repurchase programs. Such duplicity offered executives a convenient strategic device to affirm their commitment to shareholder value without compromising their own perquisites. Remarkably, capital markets continued to reward such announcements with stock price increases even as it became clear they were often never implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412440093">Zajac and Westphal 2004</xref>). This view of rampant decoupling dovetails with a broader managerial power perspective in corporate governance, which highlights how political-institutional arrangements and the informational inefficiency of capital markets limit investors’ power to enforce strategic imperatives upon executives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412440093">Roe 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Such dynamics may help account for the apparent ineffectualness of the managerial downsizing project. Executives trumpeted restructurings, replaced workers with computers, and shed redundant units through mergers, largely as cover to assuage Wall Street while quietly hiring more and more highly paid managers like they had always done. Some firms announced layoffs that were either not implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412440093">Hallock 2003</xref>) or were coupled with simultaneous new hiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412440093">Capelli 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412440093">MacDuffie (1996)</xref> points out that Ford Motor Company’s 1985 announcement of restructuring to reduce white-collar positions by 20 percent resulted in actual reductions of less than 1.5 percent by 1989. Similarly, even as executives announced plans to restrain managerial pay costs, existing rent-generating compensation practices may have remained intact. <italic>Empirically, decoupling arguments imply that implementation of shareholder value strategies would have a neutral (i.e., null) effect on the growth trajectories of managerial positions and pay in U.S. industries</italic>. For instance, announced downsizings would never be implemented, or positions eliminated during restructurings would be replaced with new ones, effectively neutralizing any negative effects in the aggregate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122412440093">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003122412440093">
<title>Fat and Mean</title>
<p>A final, somewhat counterintuitive, possibility is that aggressive use of shareholder value strategies during the 1980s and 1990s actively contributed to growth of managerial earnings and positions. In this account, efforts to make firms lean and mean not only failed to halt management growth but actually played a significant causal role in increasing managerial ranks and rewards. This view has been developed most systematically by David Gordon in his 1996 book <italic>Fat and Mean</italic>. Building on neo-Marxist labor process theories, Gordon locates the sources of managerialism in the particularly antagonistic system of labor relations that prevails in the United States. By favoring sticks over carrots, this low-road employment logic breeds managerial control strategies that demand extensive monitoring, thereby boosting the ranks of managers. By this logic, Gordon argues that aggressive efforts to reduce labor costs during the 1980s contributed to managerial growth by increasing supervisory requirements over increasingly squeezed and de-skilled workers. In other words, strategies nominally oriented toward making firms lean and streamlined had the effect of making them fatter at the top.</p>
<p>While Gordon’s thesis focuses specifically on the role of supervisory demands, other convergent arguments suggest implementation of shareholder value strategies created new managerial tasks in the networked formations that emerged in place of bureaucratic hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412440093">Meyer 2001</xref>). For instance, new needs likely emerged for managers to administer external relations in areas like supply chains and labor outsourcing, or to manage shifting assemblages of flexible project teams. This implies that even as restructuring undercut bureaucratic managerialism, the consequent externalization of previously internalized functions had the unintended consequence of creating organizations with ever more elaborate managerial roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412440093">Meyer 2001</xref>). In this variant, the imputed mediating mechanisms center on organizational structure rather than labor control, <italic>but both arguments stress that strategies intended to streamline organizations and reduce managerial labor costs ultimately rendered firms more managerial</italic>.</p>
<p>Shareholder value strategies also may have positively affected managerial earnings by enhancing the institutional conditions under which managers secure rents. The structuralist tradition in stratification research argues that earnings determination depends on the relative power workers, managers, and shareholders have in negotiating each group’s share of firm rents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122412440093">Morgan and Tang 2007</xref>). Reorganizations that attack unions will reduce workers’ power to contest future managerial earnings increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122412440093">Wallace, Leicht, and Raffalovich 1999</xref>). Even though managers were also often targets of restructuring, they might have captured a greater <italic>share</italic> of firm rents to the extent their position was strengthened <italic>relative</italic> to workers. That is, the enhanced ability to siphon rewards from workers might have compensated for any downward pressures that these transformations exerted on managerial pay. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412440093">Kalleberg (2003)</xref> argues that employment restructuring generates new dynamics of segmentation between contingent outsiders, who are treated as costs, and well-rewarded managerial insiders who manage the flexible production and labor utilization processes. While little previous research substantiates such an argument, the dynamic is consistent with the aggregate trend depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412440093">Figure 1</xref>, which shows that almost all labor cost reductions during the shareholder value period were extracted from production workers but recaptured by supervisory employees. <italic>This reasoning implies that implementation of shareholder value strategies would be associated with subsequent increases in managerial earnings</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section8-0003122412440093">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>I model effects of layoffs, mergers, computerization, and deunionization on the growth of managerial earnings and employment within 59 industries from 1984 to 2001. Layoffs, mergers, computerization, and efforts to undermine unions were all prototypical strategies firms employed in accordance with shareholder value logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412440093">Fligstein and Shin 2007</xref>). It is worth clarifying that these transformations vary in the extent to which they were conceived or understood as anti-managerial. Layoffs, mergers, and computerization posed clear threats to middle managers. Although deunionization did not target managers, it represents a mechanism through which labor cost-cutting efforts could contribute to managerial resurgence. I also examine two inferential measures of shareholder value pressures: the degree to which an industry is becoming dominated by publicly traded corporations, and the extent to which ownership is held by institutional investors.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis is the industry-year. The 59 two-digit SIC industries comprise over 99 percent of private non-farm employment in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122412440093">6</xref></sup> There are a number of reasons to use two-digit SIC industries as the unit of analysis. First, industry-level analysis represents a significant methodological advance over previous studies, which adduce relationships between labor cost-cutting strategies and persistent managerial growth from aggregate trends (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>). It is impossible to tell on the basis of aggregate data whether such associations reflect an actual causal link or some other confounding factor. Longitudinal analysis <italic>within</italic> industries allows us to isolate effects of shareholder value strategies from broader compositional shifts in the economy. Second, major industries are a theoretically desirable unit because they most closely approximate the organizational fields that define firms’ competitive and institutional contexts. Firms in a common industry have similar technological demands and face similar resource and regulatory environments. Technologies, strategies, and conceptions of control also tend to diffuse quickly within industries because firms attend closely to their competitors, generating strong pressures toward isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412440093">DiMaggio and Powell 1983</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122412440093">7</xref></sup> Finally, industry groups have long represented a major axis of earnings determination above and beyond variations in workers’ characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122412440093">Morgan and Tang 2007</xref>), and pay-setting benchmarks for managerial positions are often based explicitly on industry averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412440093">Porac, Wade, and Pollock 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although firm-level data would allow for a finer-grained understanding of underlying mechanisms, matched firm and earnings data is only available for top-five executives, and only at large, publicly traded firms. I reduce the risk of ecological fallacy—that is, making unwarranted inferences about lower-level processes from aggregated data—by including variables to control for differences in the composition of workers and firms across industries and over time (see below).</p>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, managers are defined based on the Census Bureau’s 1980 Standard Occupational Classification group Executive, Administrative, and Managerial occupations, excluding legislators and funeral directors. This occupational definition is based on job tasks and organizational position rather than workplace authority relations. The occupational definition represents a useful middle ground between the overly constrictive operationalization of managers as top executive teams, and the overly inclusive supervisory/nonsupervisory classification, which includes low-level supervisors and forepersons who are not engaged primarily in management. The executive, administrative, and managerial category does not include professionals, financial operations personnel, or administrative support occupations. This makes the present measures considerably narrower than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412440093">Bendix’s (1956)</xref> index of bureaucratization, in which he included all salaried employees. Managerial occupations specific to the public sector (e.g., public administrators) are also effectively excluded because the analysis only covers private-sector industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122412440093">8</xref></sup> A complete list of the detailed managerial occupations appears in the online supplement.</p>
<sec id="section9-0003122412440093">
<title>Variables and Data</title>
<sec id="section10-0003122412440093">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>The dependent variable for the managerial earnings analysis is the average real hourly earnings for executives, administrators, and managers in each industry-year. The earnings variable includes all wage and salary income including cash bonuses and performance pay. It does not include equity compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122412440093">9</xref></sup> I constructed the variable by multiplying each managerial respondent’s annual reported earnings by the CPI-U deflator and then dividing by total hours worked. The skewed nature of the managerial earnings distribution might recommend the median over the mean, but top-coding in the CPS survey makes the mean resilient to outliers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122412440093">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dependent variable measure for the managerial employment analysis is the natural log of the total number of executives, administrators, and managers in each industry-year. I used logarithmic transformation to mitigate groupwise heteroscedasticity. Although a scaled measure (managers as proportion of total employees) builds more closely on previous research, I model absolute growth because a proportion measure makes it difficult to distinguish whether observed effects operate through the numerator or the denominator. Equivalent analyses using managers as a proportion of total industry employment are reported in the online supplement. Results are very similar.</p>
<p>I calculated both dependent variables from the IPUMS-CPS March supplement data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122412440093">King et al. 2010</xref>) using sampling probability weights. Only non-self-employed managers are included. Because small cell sizes created year-to-year noisiness in the estimates for some industries, I smoothed both variables using a locally weighted moving average filter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0003122412440093">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>I use the same independent variables in the earnings and employment analyses. Annual counts of <italic>mergers</italic> in each industry were tabulated from the Almanac of Mergers and Acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412440093">Fligstein and Shin 2007</xref>). Mergers were coded according to the industry of the target firm. <italic>Computerization</italic> is measured as the log of total annual industry investment in computers and information technology. Computer investment data come from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412440093">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis national accounts database (2010)</xref>. I measure industry <italic>unionization</italic> as the proportion of all workers in an industry who are covered by a union contract. Union coverage data come from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122412440093">Hirsch and Macpherson (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>I utilize two alternative measures of layoffs in separate model specifications. <italic>Announced layoff events</italic> are measured as a count of events affecting 50 or more employees in an industry during a given year. I tabulated these from a full-text content analysis of the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> from 1984 to 2000 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412440093">Fligstein and Shin 2007</xref>). The advantage of announced layoff events is that annual data are available over the entire study period. However, one might question the use of announced layoffs in light of the institutional decoupling argument: actual layoffs could have a negative effect on managers, but announced layoffs might exhibit no effect due to non-implementation. For this reason I also created a measure of implemented layoffs using available data from the 1994 to 2002 biennial CPS displaced worker surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412440093">Center for Economic and Policy Research 2011</xref>). From 1994 onward, respondents were asked whether they lost a job at some point during the previous three years due to restructuring, plant closing, abolished shift, insufficient work, or some other similar reason. I tabulated displacement estimates by industry for each overlapping three-year time window spanning 1991 to 2001. I then smoothed these into an annualized estimated count and divided this figure by the number of full-time equivalent employees to derive an annual displacement rate per 1,000 employees. Note that this measure is not directly comparable with the announced layoff measure because it is based on the number of workers laid off in each industry rather than the number of layoff events.</p>
<p>Finally, I use two inferential measures of exposure to shareholder value pressures. First is the proportion of all full-time equivalent (FTE) industry employees who work at publicly traded firms. I created this measure by calculating the total sum of FTE employees at publicly traded firms in each industry from the Compustat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122412440093">Standard and Poor’s 2008</xref>) database. I then divided this figure by the BEA’s estimate of total FTE employees in each industry. The second is the proportion of total industry market capitalization held by institutional investors. Institutional investors were among the most aggressive proponents of shareholder value strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412440093">Useem 1996</xref>). This measure captures varying shareholder pressures <italic>within</italic> the population of publicly traded firms. I calculated this measure from firm-level data in the Thomson Reuters database of “13-f” forms, which all large (&gt;$100 million assets) investment funds must file with the SEC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0003122412440093">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>The models include several time-varying controls for industry-level changes. Size and growth measures include the log of full-time equivalent industry employment, the log of industry-specific real GDP, and the annual <italic>rate</italic> of growth in industry GDP. Together, these measures capture industry growth and decline along dimensions of domestic employment and output. Of course, total managerial employment levels will grow as the overall industry grows. These measures also control for potential effects of industry stagnation due to factors such as international competition.</p>
<p>I include an industry’s total profit to asset ratio because increasing profitability from efficiency gains may mediate the relationship between cost-cutting strategies and managerial pay growth. Both lagged and contemporaneous measures are included. As explained below, profitability is treated as endogenous.</p>
<p>I include a control for changes in the firm size distribution within industries because larger firms are associated with higher earnings and managerial intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122412440093">Kalleberg and Van Buren 1996</xref>). While downsizing led to smaller average firm size in manufacturing during this period, retail and service sectors experienced upsizing through consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122412440093">Baumol et al. 2003</xref>). This could have swollen managerial ranks and earnings simply by virtue of the more complex task environments associated with expanding organizational scale.</p>
<p>I control for the proportion of female managers in each industry in case the feminization of management stunts earnings growth or boosts managerial employment levels through title inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412440093">Jacobs 1992</xref>). Finally, I control for changes in the skill profile of managerial incumbents using average years of post-primary education. This accounts for the possibility that managerial employment or earnings growth were driven by increased demand for highly skilled workers in dynamic industries rather than increasing returns to managerial positions. Including mean education should help net out observed association between computerization and managerial earnings associated with skill-biased technological change arguments. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122412440093">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics for all variables.</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>For managerial earnings growth and employment growth, I estimate equivalent dynamic panel models (also known as growth models or lagged dependent variable models). I adopt a GMM approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412440093">Arellano and Bond 1991</xref>), which simultaneously accommodates several modeling considerations. First, the Arellano-Bond estimator allows for consistent estimation in the context of panel dynamics. Growth processes are typically subject to state dependence insofar as past realizations of the outcome variable exert a causal effect on future outcomes, over and above contemporaneous changes in levels of the covariates. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon (1996)</xref> invokes bureaucratic feedback mechanisms to suggest that managerial growth within large firms is self-propelling: past increases in managerial ranks will propel future increases. Including a lagged measure of the dependent variable on the right-hand side of the equation captures this dynamic. However, lagged dependent variable models present estimation difficulties due to the twin facts that (1) the lagged endogenous covariate is correlated with unit effects, and (2) standard techniques to purge unit effects through differencing or time-demeaning (the fixed effects transformation) induce correlation between the transformed endogenous variable and the transformed disturbance. The resulting bias of OLS can be substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122412440093">Kiviet 1995</xref>). The Arellano-Bond estimator overcomes this bias by differencing the equation to remove the unit-specific effects. It then uses lagged differences of the endogenous and exogenous covariates as instruments. GMM achieves greater efficiency than two-stage least squared estimators by utilizing additional past lags as instruments (for an explication, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412440093">Greene 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the GMM framework accommodates additional endogenous covariates. This is important due to the potential endogeneity of variables such as profitability, total employment, and firm size. A difference-in-Sargan test indicates industry profitability is likely endogenous, but not average firm size or total industry employment. Note that using lags to instrument an already-lagged covariate costs an additional panel of data.</p>
<p>Third, the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator accommodates fixed effects. Including industry fixed effects permits estimation of longitudinal processes within industries independent of unobserved, time-invariant characteristics associated with managerial employment and earnings. Like all estimators, GMM rests on certain assumptions. I describe these and associated diagnostic tests in the online supplement.</p>
<p>One final modeling complication is that the control variable for average firm size is only available from 1988 onward, and data on job displacement and layoffs are only available from 1991 onward. To make maximal use of the data, I first specify one set of models without the firm size or displacement measures over the full sample period from 1986 to 2001. I then report a second specification with the firm size variable over a constricted period from 1990 to 2001. In a third specification covering 1992 to 2001, I substitute the job displacement measure for the announced layoffs measure. As shown below, all three sets of models yield very similar results.</p>

<title>Managerial Earnings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412440093">Table 2</xref> reports results of the industry-level managerial earnings analysis. Note that inclusion of the lagged dependent variable on the right side of the equation means that coefficient estimates for the covariates represent effects net of earnings during the previous period. Column one reports the baseline control model. Average earnings grow as industries become more profitable, as their total employment increases, and as managerial incumbents become more highly educated on average. Feminization of management in an industry also has a strong negative effect on managerial earnings, but only when theoretical variables are included in Models 2, 3, and 4. Increasing industry GDP and GDP growth rate are both negatively associated with subsequent managerial earnings growth, although this is likely an artifact of high collinearity with the total employment measure.</p>

<p>Model 2 adds the theoretical variables. Results offer strong and consistent support for the fat and mean theory, which predicted a positive relationship between shareholder value strategies and subsequent managerial earnings growth (negative relationship for union coverage). Coefficients for all the theoretical variables are in the predicted direction, and four of the six are statistically significant. Average managerial earnings increase as firms consolidate through mergers, as they invest greater amounts of money in computer technologies, and as they become less unionized. Managers also reap higher hourly earnings as their industries become more dominated by publicly traded corporations. Increasing institutional investor predominance and announced layoffs exhibit no significant independent effect on earnings growth, although unreported specifications indicate announced layoffs do exhibit a positive bivariate effect (net of the controls).</p>
<p>Model 3 adds the compositional control for average firm size. Note that Models 2 and 3 are not nested because inclusion of the firm size variable constricts the sample to the period after 1989. Changes in average firm size in an industry have no effect on managerial earnings net of the other variables. This is consistent with findings of weakening effects of firm scale on earnings determination during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412440093">Hollister 2004</xref>). Nor does inclusion of firm size and consequent restriction of the sample period to the 1990s substantively affect results for the theoretical variables. Coefficients for mergers, computerization, and corporate predominance remain positive in Model 3, and increasing unionization remains negatively associated with subsequent managerial earnings growth.</p>
<p>Model 4 substitutes the alternative layoff measure (job displacement rate) for announced layoff events, thereby further restricting the sample period to 1992 to 2001. These results show that heightened rates of job displacement in an industry are associated with significant subsequent managerial earnings growth, in contrast to the null effect for announced layoffs. Inclusion of job displacement nullifies the computerization effect, but the pattern of results is otherwise quite similar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122412440093">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>While results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412440093">Table 2</xref> show that organizational transformations associated with shareholder value heightened the rewards attached to managerial positions, they say nothing about changes in the prevalence of these positions. Earnings growth in response to cost-cutting strategies may elide decreases in the number of managers employed, particularly if average earnings are increasing due to hollowing of the lower managerial ranks or if remaining managers experience heightened productivity as they are asked to take on greater responsibilities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412440093">Table 3</xref> presents results of the managerial employment analysis. Results are strikingly similar. Increases in number of mergers, level of computer investment, degree of corporate predominance, and presence of institutional investors are all associated with significant subsequent growth in the number of managerial employees in an industry. The prevalence of managerial positions also increases following declines in union coverage rates. As with earnings, changes in the incidence of layoff announcements have no effect on the growth of managerial positions.</p>

<p>Model 7 adds the average firm size control. Not surprisingly, the number of managerial employees increases as the average size of firms in an industry increases. The only significant difference between Models 6 and 7 is that the coefficient for mergers ceases to be statistically significant. Otherwise the theoretical results are very similar.</p>
<p>Model 8 substitutes the job displacement rate measure for announced layoffs. Unlike announced layoffs, which exhibited no effect, higher rates of overall job displacement in an industry are positively associated with subsequent growth in managerial employment during the period for which data is available (1992 to 2001). This is consistent with the broader pattern of results. One caveat, however, is that Model 8 does not cover the period from 1989 to 1991, when aggregate managerial employment growth stalled. It is unclear whether such a positive effect would attain during those years. Altogether, results of Models 6, 7, and 8 offer consistent support for a positive relationship between implementation of lean and mean cost-cutting strategies and increasing managerial positions within U.S. industries during the shareholder value era.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0003122412440093">
<title>Sectoral Comparisons</title>
<p>The overall results reported earlier assume managerial growth processes played out similarly within different types of industries. Manufacturing, retail, service, and FIRE sectors all saw secular increases in managerial earnings and employment, but within-industry effects of shareholder strategies on these growth trajectories could vary across sectors. To examine sectoral variations, I re-estimated Models 4 and 8 with sector-specific interaction terms. Each theoretical variable is interacted with an indicator variable for retail, service, and financial/real estate industries (manufacturing/extractive is the omitted category). Intercepts remain industry-specific.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122412440093">Table 4</xref> shows results of this analysis. Coefficients for the interaction terms represent the estimated difference between slopes for industries in each respective sector and the omitted baseline manufacturing/extractive sector. The associated <italic>t</italic>-tests indicate whether the difference is statistically significant. These results do not contravene the earlier results, but they do suggest several of the overall effects are driven by transformations within particular sectors. This is particularly so for managerial earnings growth, which is reported in the left-hand column. Coefficient differences indicate that positive effects of increasing corporate predominance are confined to manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, nonfinancial service industries. Layoffs also drove managerial earnings growth to a greater extent in manufacturing and nonfinancial services than in retail or FIRE industries, although in this case the disparities are not statistically significant.</p>

<p>The relationship between shareholder value strategies and managerial employment growth shows less variation across sectors, meaning the results are more consistently positive. The one significant exception is computerization, which has a strongly positive effect on employment growth in manufacturing and retail, but only a very weak effect among service and financial industries.</p>
<p>Overall, sectoral breakdowns indicate that positive effects of shareholder value indicators on managerial earnings growth were driven mostly by processes within manufacturing and nonfinancial service industries. For employment growth, positive effects hold across all sectors, although they tend to be more consistently pronounced in manufacturing and retail. Note that with the possible exception of the cross-product between retail and institutional investors in the earnings equation, in none of the four sectors do shareholder value transformations appear to exhibit negative effects on either employment or earnings growth. Thus there is little evidence that the overall results conceal strongly divergent processes across sectors.</p>

<sec id="section18-0003122412440093">
<title>Summary and Robustness Checks</title>
<p>Despite some variation across model specifications and across sectors, the overall pattern of results suggests the shareholder value revolution and consequent restructuring of U.S. industries significantly contributed to increasing managerial pay and employment. Moreover, the pattern of effects is markedly similar across both dependent variables. The fact that these effects attain <italic>within</italic> industries suggests aggregate managerial growth during this period was not simply a result of shifting industrial composition, but was driven at least in part by shareholder value strategies.</p>
<p>I conducted several further tests to assess the sensitivity of the results. First, I examined the scope of the observed effects by rerunning equivalent models for the occupational group Management-Related Occupations, which includes administrative support positions such as accountants and analysts. None of the shareholder value indicators exhibit significant effects on earnings or employment growth for this group. The one exception is layoffs (displacement rate), which actually has a <italic>negative</italic> impact on management-related administrative employment—in contrast to the positive effect for managers. This implies that the results reported earlier reflect processes specific to managerial positions rather than merely tapping a broader process of administrative proliferation in modern organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412440093">Bendix 1956</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, I examined whether results might be affected by the increasing number of weekly hours managers reported working during this period. For instance, hourly earnings growth could be driven in part by higher marginal compensation for working more hours. Or, increasing demand for managerial labor in some industries could result in increasing hours of work rather than increasing number of positions. Including a control for average hours worked has no effect on the results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122412440093">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Scholars have noted the curious puzzle that managers in the United States continued to grow more numerous and prosperous during the 1980s and early 1990s despite seemingly powerful institutional currents militating against them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412440093">Jacoby 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412440093">Littler and Innes 2004</xref>). This article adds three sets of empirical findings. First, managerial employment and pay continued to increase through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Second, the industry-level analytic results provide consistent evidence that it was through precisely those organizational and institutional transformations commonly associated with managerial downsizing that managerial positions and earnings increased. Third, effects of shareholder value strategies on managerial earnings growth tended to be more pronounced in manufacturing and nonfinancial service sectors, while effects on managerial employment growth occurred throughout the economy.</p>
<p>The findings carry several implications. Most basic, they support the underlying insight of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon’s (1996)</xref> fat and mean thesis. In particular, they present much more rigorous evidence for a causal relationship between labor cost-cutting strategies and managers’ enhanced standing: efforts to make firms lean and mean not only failed to halt the century-long trend toward greater managerial presence in the economy, but they actually helped propel its continued growth.</p>
<p>An important feature of the analysis is that it applies to managerial occupations in general—not just top executives at Fortune 500 firms. That top executives would capture significant gains from labor cost-cutting during this period is not surprising in light of what we know about CEO compensation practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412440093">Brookman et al. 2007</xref>). What is striking about the present results is that strategies nominally oriented toward reducing labor costs and flattening organizational structures by shedding managerial layers were associated at the industry-level with broad-based increases in the number of managers and the valuation of managerial labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122412440093">13</xref></sup> Moreover, the fact that the earnings measure utilized here does not include equity-based compensation means that the observed effects must be operating through labor market and organizational pay-setting mechanisms rather than simply through stock price appreciation.</p>
<p>More broadly, the results speak to ongoing debates in economic sociology about how the shareholder value revolution did and did not transform corporate organizations and stakeholder power in the U.S. economy. The prevailing view is that the incentives for top executives to heighten their power by enlarging management came to an end during the 1980s as executive pay was restructured to favor policies that would redistribute resources from employees to shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412440093">Useem 1996</xref>). The results here point to a more complex story. Rather than reducing total labor costs as a share of business income (i.e., redirecting corporate income from workers and managers to shareholders), the primary effect of prototypical shareholder value strategies was to transfer labor income from production workers to managers. These findings offer a corrective to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412440093">Davis (2009)</xref> insofar as the rise of financial capitalism has actually reinforced key dynamics of the managerialist order, enlarging the managerial class and heightening its members’ ability to capture organizational resources.</p>
<p>One possibility is to interpret these results as an instance of strategic decoupling: executives trumpeted downsizing, replaced workers with computers, and shed redundant units through mergers, all as a strategic device to please Wall Street while quietly hiring more and more managers like they had always done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412440093">Westphal and Zajac 1998</xref>). In this view, shareholder value represents little more than a set of justificatory discourses and practices that management uses to frame its existing prerogatives. Decoupling may be a sufficient explanation for why shareholder value strategies <italic>failed to decrease</italic> managerial compensation, but it does not explain the consistently <italic>positive effects</italic> of these practices on managerial growth. A more plausible interpretation is that organizational transformations in pursuit of labor cost-cutting induced demand for new types of managerial tasks in restructured firms, for instance, to coordinate outsourced supply chains and contingent labor utilization, and to organize short-term, project-based work teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412440093">Meyer 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, managers may have secured new rents as a result of new forms of employment segmentation that attended organizational restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412440093">Kalleberg 2003</xref>). The fact that managerial earnings returns from restructuring were strongest in goods-producing industries likely reflects managers’ ability to capture corporate income that had formerly been allocated to the better paid and more unionized production workers in that sector.</p>
<p>Such arguments suggest that while increasing managerial positions and pay during this period reflected continuity with long-term trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412440093">Gordon 1996</xref>), the shareholder value revolution significantly altered the institutional mechanisms through which this growth occurred. More broadly, it implies that future research in economic sociology should look beyond strategic decoupling and symbolic management of shareholders in order to probe the (often paradoxical and unintended) structural consequences of dominant ideologies and strategies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122412440093">Dobbin and Jung 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Several lingering ambiguities open up questions for future research. First, although the reported industry-level associations are provocative and quite robust, the precise mechanisms underlying them remain somewhat unclear. I have suggested that new organizational task requirements resulting from restructuring created demand for more managers, but more research is needed to substantiate this interpretation. Another possibility is that corporations did not merely adopt Wall Street’s prescriptions to downsize and cut costs, but also increasingly mimicked the financial sector’s own internal modes of employment organization, which couple high levels of managerial intensity and pay with high levels of job insecurity and turnover (for an interesting variant of this argument, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122412440093">Ho 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that the reduction in job stability has itself contributed to increasing managerial pay as highly sought managerial employees are no longer willing to defer earnings in the short-term for the (unlikely) prospect of stability and career advancement. Finally, managerial earnings returns to shareholder value strategies might reflect the operation of pay fairness norms, whereby outsized gains for CEOs trickle-down to benefit lower-level managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122412440093">Wade, O’Reilly, and Pollock 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0003122412440093">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another question is how exactly to reconcile the reality of a labor market that produces ever more highly paid managerial jobs with widespread findings of subjective insecurity and downward mobility among displaced managerial incumbents during this same period. Qualitative studies suggest a selection process whereby younger, market-oriented MBAs supplant older bureaucratic managers who may face declining job prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412440093">Mendenhall et al. 2008</xref>). However, the mean age of managerial incumbents actually increased slightly across the study period, and supplementary analysis of the BLS’s displaced workers surveys shows that managers holding advanced degrees were no less likely to suffer involuntary job loss (results available on request). This is an interesting issue that deserves further research.</p>
<p>Finally, the present analysis focuses on the private sector during the 1990s, but evidence suggests other domains, including universities, are increasingly moving toward top-heavy organizations (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412440093">UC Committee on Planning and Budget 2010</xref>). Not-for-profit organizations may offer an interesting site to extend future research on the linkages between organizational austerity projects and persistent managerial growth in the United States.</p>

<p>Of course, there is no necessary functional link between the goal of increasing shareholder returns and adoption of lean and mean strategies as a means to achieve this. In fact, the balance of evidence suggests layoffs and mergers were adopted in a copycat fashion and failed to boost efficiency or long-term stock values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122412440093">Agrawal and Jaffe 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122412440093">O’Neill, Pouder, and Buchholtz 1998</xref>).</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412440093">Osterman (2008)</xref> questions this explanation because upward trends in managerial intensity occurred within both manufacturing and financial sectors.

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0003122412440093">

<p>Note that I do not directly measure the extent to which sectoral shifts boosted managerial ranks and earnings. Rather, shifting industry composition provides a mechanism for reconciling the ostensibly negative effects of shareholder value strategies with aggregate increases.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0003122412440093">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Of course, there are other reasons why implementation of shareholder value strategies could have no effect on managerial intensity and pay, but decoupling provides a theoretical rationale to expect a null effect in a context where prior theory suggests a negative effect.</p></fn>

<p>Although three-digit industries would permit more granular measurement of the independent variables, it is impossible to generate valid managerial earnings and employment estimates below the two-digit level due to excessively small cell sizes.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0003122412440093">
<label>8.</label>
<p>One other issue concerns the level of occupational aggregation. There are two reasons to conduct a single set of analyses on the two-digit occupational group rather than separate analyses for each detailed three-digit occupation (e.g., financial managers and personnel managers). First, disaggregating to detailed occupations yields industry-occupation cell sizes that are far too small for analysis. Second, although the composition of executives and managers may vary significantly within and across industries, the functional distinctions between detailed occupations do not necessarily capture this variation, as evidenced by the disproportionate growth of the residual category, managers not elsewhere classified. I instead account for compositional changes in the profile of managers in each industry by including a time-varying measure of their average educational attainment.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0003122412440093">
<label>9.</label>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no historical industry-level data on managers’ equity-based compensation aside from top-five executives. Equity pay became increasingly central in executive compensation packages at large public firms over the study period, but it remained far less prevalent overall. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122412440093">Oyer and Schaefer (2005)</xref> estimate that in 1999, only 1.4 percent of all establishments were associated with firms that granted broad-based equity pay to a significant portion of nonexecutives. Exclusion of equity-based compensation from the earnings measure in the present context makes the analyses more conservative by ruling out the possibility that observed earnings gains were driven simply by a shift toward equity pay in conjunction with the stock market bubble.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0003122412440093">
<label>10.</label>
<p>CPS earnings data is top-coded at a time-varying cutoff for confidentiality purposes. This affects observations for the top 1 to 2 percent of all earners each year. To avoid downwardly-biased earnings estimates, I adjusted top-coded cases using annual cell means constructed from internal CPS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412440093">Larrimore et al. 2008</xref>). Even with this adjustment, top-coding effectively compresses the right tail of the earnings distribution. This is advantageous in the present context because it prevents disproportionate earnings growth at the very top from skewing our picture of the broader set of managers on which this article focuses. Even after upward adjustments to compensate for top-coding, the CPS data evidence only a moderate increase in managerial earnings dispersion over time. The overall variance in log hourly earnings increased from .38 in 1984 to .41 in 2000. The relative contributions of within- and between-industry variance remained approximately constant.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0003122412440093">
<label>11.</label>
<p>The differing results for announced layoffs and implemented layoffs offer some evidence to support decoupling arguments. However, given that announced layoffs do exhibit a positive bivariate effect on earnings net of the controls (not reported), I suspect the differing results may also derive from differences in empirical dependence among the theoretical covariates or undercounting of layoff announcements at small firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412440093">Hallock 2003</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0003122412440093">
<label>12.</label>
<p>Another possible objection is that the managerial employment results could be driven by title inflation. There are several reasons to be skeptical that title inflation or some other systematic process of dilution is skewing the quantitative results. First, there are very similar upward trends across multiple definitions of managers. Second, the occupational classification in the CPS data is based on reported job tasks rather than just job title, which means the measures used in the analysis are somewhat resilient to title inflation. Third, title inflation implies that managerial intensity and managerial earnings would go in opposite directions because inflation involves diluting the managerial pool with lower-level workers who are managers in name only. Instead, managerial intensity and managerial earnings moved upward in unison.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0003122412440093">
<label>13.</label>
<p>One caveat is that the broad-based earnings growth examined here is still quite modest compared to gains by top executives. Total compensation for top-five executives at public firms rose over 130 percent from 1995 to 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122412440093">Bebchuk and Grinstein 2005</xref>). The average earnings measure used here is unaffected by these executive outliers, but absolute increases in the typical manager’s earnings should still be understood in the context of significant declines relative to top management.</p></fn>
