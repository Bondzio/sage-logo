<body>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>We would like to bring to the attention of all urology departments an incident which has occurred in our department, reported as a Never Event by our trust and which we suspect has the potential to occur elsewhere.</p>
<p>A female patient attended for a flexible cystoscopy in our department as part of our one stop haematuria clinic. No abnormalities were found. She was then reviewed a few weeks later complaining bitterly of discomfort ‘down below’. On examination a swab was found just within the introitus. We then discovered that a locum registrar was using a swab in selected female patients to aid introduction of the flexible cystoscope. Although swabs are on the cysto-scopy trolley, as the permanent members of the department only used them for cleansing the genitalia, swab counts hadn’t routinely been performed.</p>
<p>Discussion with other local Urology units suggested it is not normal practice to count any swabs on the cystoscopy trolley. It was also not normal practice to insert swabs during a cystoscopy procedure in this way, but a small number of colleagues were aware of this practice having been encountered elsewhere during their career.</p>
<p>We have now changed practice within our department and use a modified version of the WHO checklist for all procedures within our outpatient department that includes a swab check if a pack has been opened</p>
<p>We suggest other Urology units should review their practice where swabs are used in outpatient procedure clinics to ensure they have checks in place to avoid a retained swab such as occurred here, becoming a Never Event in other circumstances</p>
</body>
