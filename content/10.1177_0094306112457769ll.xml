<p>There is no one better prepared to take on such an ambitious thesis as Kathryn Sikkink. Author of many books and articles on international human rights violations and international justice, Sikkink is prepared to tackle the ambitious thesis in <italic>The Justice Cascade</italic>. She defines the justice cascade as the “shift in the <italic>legitimacy of the norm</italic> of individual accountability for human rights violations and an increase in criminal prosecutions on behalf of that norm” (p. 5). She points out—correctly in my view—that what triggered the cascade was the extent and barbarism of atrocities committed by the Nazis. This reign of terror lasted from 1933 to 1945. At the end of WWII and the defeat of the German Reich, spurred by conscience and sheer determination that this must never happen again, the United Nations was founded in 1945, originally with 45 members. In support of Sikkink’s thesis, there are now 192. It has been a cascade. The UN’s member states are committed to the advance of justice as reflected in many UN programs and specialized agencies: the International Court of Justice, UN Development Program, UN Environment Program, UN World Food Program, UN Women, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The Preamble of its 1945 UN Charter makes it clear that its mandate is to promote justice. It states: “We the Peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom…”</p>
<p>Sikkink somewhat downplays the significance of the UN because of its weak enforcement mechanisms, especially with respect to human rights treaties. Here we must be self-critical: the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world has not ratified a single human rights treaty. And it often does not pay its full dues. Were the United States to join other states in ratifying treaties and providing better financial support, the UN could better carry out its human rights mission. Nevertheless, especially since the 1990s, states have revised their constitutions to encompass the provisions of human rights treaties, thereby strengthening the world community’s commitment to human rights.</p>
<p>Here I would like to distinguish between “socially embedded rights” and “criminal violations.” Socially embedded rights are laid out in the majority of human rights treaties and declarations, such as Elimination of Discrimination of Racial Discrimination, Elimination of Discrimination of Women, Protection of the Rights of Migrants, Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention on Cultural Diversity, the Labor Conventions, and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<p>Sikkink, for the most part, deals with criminal violations, not socially embedded rights. Her main thesis is that over the recent decades individual accountability for horrific human rights abuses has displaced political or kangaroo trials, and likewise due process has become the norm, although she concludes that the cascade is slowing. It is important to emphasize, which she fails to do, that respect for human rights is multidimensional, expressed through “a recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family” [which] “is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world” (Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).</p>
<p>The first phrase of the Preamble to the Rome Statute that implements the International Criminal Court is less lyrical, but nonetheless shares the same philosophical underpinnings, but with more apprehension about human motivation and behavior: “Conscious that all peoples are united by common bonds, their cultures pierced together in a shared heritage, and concerned that this delicate mosaic may be shattered at any time…” In other words, I would contend that human rights, on the one hand, and freedom from horrific human rights abuses, on the other, are more closely linked than Sikkink contends.</p>
<p>She covers instances, as case studies, of responses to horrific, criminal human rights abuses that advance the normative framework of accountability. These responses include those that ended the Portuguese and Greek military dictatorships in the 1970s, ended Franco’s regime, and ended state terrorism by the Argentine military regime (the “dirty war” of 1976–1983). She also traces, with considerable intellectual sophistication, the likely routes out of horrific abuses: amnesties, truth commissions, police reform, or persecutions. As an aside, it is easy—on the basis of her analysis—to speculate critically and systematically the direction Syria is headed. We might come to the wrong conclusion, but Sikkink gives us the framework that will lead us toward a better understanding of likely outcomes in Syria, which now matches the brutality of, say, Franco’s reign of terror.</p>
<p>Then Sikkink challenges her readers by asking how do prosecutions for human rights violations affect the transition to democracy, and she presents some exquisite analysis that bear on this question. She also asks why the United States is immune to the justice cascade—a fantastic question (which I also have relentlessly pursued over the past years). One example from this chapter pretty much sums up the unlikelihood of the United States joining other law-abiding countries: when lawyers issued a complaint against Donald Rumsfeld for torture (a crime against humanity) and he was summoned to appear before a French court (that has universal jurisdiction) he simply called a cab and went to the airport to return to the United States. The United States has not ratified the Rome Statute, which implements the International Criminal Court, just as it has not ratified human rights treaties. Kathryn Sikkink helps us to understand why this is the case.</p>
