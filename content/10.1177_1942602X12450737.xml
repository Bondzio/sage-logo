<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advances in treatment for children with congenital heart disease (CHD) has increased survival to adulthood and decreased morbidity. With few exceptions, children with CHD are able to fully participate in all school activities. However, for some children, school participation can be challenging, and concerns remain about their health and safety in the school environment. To optimize the school experience, children, their parents, school personnel, and the child’s health care team must work together to adapt the school program to support the child’s health needs. School nurses and teachers can be excellent advocates for children with CHD.</p>
<p>Since diagnosis and initial management usually occurs in infancy, the most current literature focuses on infants with CHD and does not address the specific needs of school-age children in the school environment. This article provides an overview of the main health issues involving children with CHD, ages 5 to12 years, and highlights students who require special attention. Because individual children may have unique circumstances that affect their care, collaboration with the child’s cardiology team will afford the best information and advice about a particular child’s diagnosis, treatment, and health needs.</p>

<title>Congenital Heart Disease</title>
<p>Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect, present in about 8 out of 1,000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12450737">Park, 2008</xref>). There are more than 35 well-recognized congenital heart defects with a wide spectrum of severity. In the past 30 years, advances have occurred in the diagnosis and management of CHD that have provided treatment options for almost all congenital heart defects. Some children require cardiac surgery to palliate or repair the defect in the first days of life and are left with residual cardiac issues. In others, the heart defect can be completely repaired, usually before the child starts school, and most of these children can lead nearly normal lives without restrictions. At the opposite end of the spectrum are children with mild abnormalities that never require intervention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12450737">Table 1</xref> lists some common defects by classification as acyanotic or cyanotic and further classifies them by hemodynamic characteristics of blood flow. In general, cyanotic defects are more serious and require treatment in the first months of life.</p>

<title>Management of Congenital Heart Disease</title>
<p>All children with congenital heart defects, repaired or unrepaired, are followed periodically throughout their childhood by a pediatric cardiologist to monitor their cardiac health and detect potential problems. Following surgical repair, most children do not require cardiac medications. Common chronic medications for those with residual hemodynamic issues include diuretics, afterload reduction agents, antithrombotic agents, or antiarrhythmic agents. Patients with significant concerns such as congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or arrhythmias may be on multiple medications. Medication schedules can usually be adjusted to avoid the need for distribution during school hours.</p>
<sec id="section4-1942602X12450737">
<title>Diet and hydration</title>
<p>Special diets are not usually indicated for most children. For children with congestive heart failure, a low-salt diet or high-calorie nutritional supplements to maintain their weight may be prescribed. Other special diets may be used in rare circumstances. Adequate hydration is important for many of these children to prevent a drop in blood pressure. Some children may be fluid sensitive or on diuretic therapy and may quickly become pale, weak, lightheaded, nauseous, or faint when dehydrated. Symptoms will usually resolve with rest and fluids. Vigilance about adequate fluid intake during periods of exercise, hot and humid weather, or skipped meals is necessary to prevent dehydration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1942602X12450737">
<title>Cardiac catheterization</title>
<p>Cardiac catheterizations may be done to diagnose or to treat CHD. Common interventional procedures include using balloon catheters to dilate the pulmonary arteries or aorta as well as to dilate obstructed cardiac valves. There are various occlusion devices used to close abnormal connections like a patent ductus arteriosus or an atrial septal defect. Developed in the last 20 years, these techniques are now widely available and avoid the need for surgery in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12450737">Feltes et al., 2011</xref>). Some children require staged treatment that combines surgical procedures and catheterization interventions and may require multiple interventions during childhood. Catheterizations can be performed as same-day or overnight procedures. Children generally recover quickly and can usually return to school within a day or two. Sports and physical education classes may be restricted for a short period but often no restrictions are required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1942602X12450737">
<title>Cardiac surgery</title>
<p>For school-age children undergoing cardiac surgery, an average hospital stay is typically 4 to 8 days depending on the procedure. Children generally remain out of school for 1 to 2 weeks following discharge and return to school after their follow-up cardiology visit. Sports and physical education classes are often restricted for the first 6 weeks postoperatively. On return to school, children may need assistance with climbing stairs, long walks between classes, or carrying heavy books as they regain their stamina. Some children may start school on an abbreviated schedule to ease back into their school routines. Planning school re-entry and developing a 504 accommodation plan, with the advice of the cardiology team as needed, allows for a smooth transition and reduces stress for all involved. For a smaller group of children undergoing more complex procedures or having a prolonged recovery, tutoring or home schooling is needed to help them keep up with their school work. School reentry may be more difficult and require more planning and guidance from the health care team to adjust the school environment and schedule to meet the child’s health needs.</p>

<title>Special Considerations</title>
<sec id="section8-1942602X12450737">
<title>Children With Single Ventricle Heart Defects</title>
<p>Children with heart defects resulting in one functional ventricle have the most complex forms of CHD. Because there is only one ventricle pumping to both the lungs and the body, there is mixing of blood in the common chamber, resulting in systemic cyanosis and an increased workload on the single ventricle. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is the most well known of this group of defects. These single ventricle defects require a multistaged surgical repair with the first stage performed soon after birth, a second stage bidirectional Glenn procedure at 4 to 6 months of age, and the final Fontan procedure typically performed at 2 to 4 years of age. The Fontan procedure diverts all the systemic venous return through the inferior and superior vena cava directly to the lungs through a cavopulmonary anastomosis and an intra-atrial baffle (or extracardiac conduit), thereby bypassing the ventricular pumping chamber. The single ventricle becomes the systemic pumping chamber. The Fontan procedure divides the circulation to relieve cyanosis and decreases the workload on the single ventricle since venous blood is now sent directly to the lungs without going through the ventricular pumping chamber. These procedures are all palliative; while heart function is improved, the circulation remains abnormal. With only one pumping chamber, the heart is less efficient with decreased cardiac output and increased systemic venous pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12450737">D. J. Goldberg, Dodds, &amp; Rychik, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the Fontan procedure, children have reduced exercise capacity despite appearing healthy with normal or near normal oxygen saturations. Progressive functional limitations are due to declining aerobic capacity with age and time post palliation, limited ability to increase stroke volume in response to exercise, mild desaturation with exercise, and decreased cardiac output at rest and with exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12450737">Driscoll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12450737">Graham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12450737">Pike et al., 2007</xref>). Despite this, physical activity should be encouraged and the child should be allowed to set his or her own limits but may need to alternate activity with periods of rest. Diagnostic evaluation is recommended prior to sports participation but, in general, children can participate in low-intensity competitive sports and those with normal ventricular function can participate in more active sports (Graham et al.). Further discussion of exercise and sports participation will appear in Part 2 of this series.</p>
<p>In addition to decreased exercise capacity, there is a substantial risk for long-term morbidity including arrhythmias, thromboembolism, protein losing enteropathy, and ventricular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12450737">Brown, Wernovsky, Mussatto, &amp; Berger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12450737">Driscoll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12450737">D. J. Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). The incidence increases with age and time following the Fontan procedure. For some children with single ventricle defects, transplant is eventually required due to advanced heart failure or intractable protein losing enteropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12450737">Jaquiss &amp; Imamura, 2009</xref>). There is a higher incidence of neurodevelopmental disabilites in children with single ventricle defects compared to other forms of heart disease, and those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are at greatest risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12450737">C. Goldberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12450737">Mahle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942602X12450737">Wernovsky et al., 2000</xref>). In a large multicenter study (<italic>N</italic> = 533), 46% of children who had undergone the Fontan procedure had problems with attention, in comparison to 19% of the reference group, and 42% had learning problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12450737">McCrindle et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for School Nurses</title>
<p>Individualized healthcare plans need to be implemented in the school setting both to protect the student and to allow them to participate as fully as possible in school and athletic activities. The school nurse needs an accurate, updated history of the child’s cardiac status including diagnosis, past treatments, and anticipated future treatments. While most children will have had definitive treatment before school age, some will be left with residual health issues. The child’s medications, dietary needs, and exercise limitations should be reviewed. Unnecessary restrictions should be avoided, and treating the child as normally as possible given their health needs should be the goal. An emergency care plan that identifies school personnel trained in CPR, the location of automated external defibrillators, and when to call 911 is as important for children with CHD as it is for all students.</p>
<p>Communication with the cardiology team about individual students can often be facilitated by the advanced practice nurse in the cardiac referral center. This nurse-to-nurse communication allows both a discussion of the child’s needs and the requirements and limitations of the school setting and encourages joint problem solving.</p>

<sec id="section10-1942602X12450737" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The need for school nurses to be well informed about congenital heart disease and cardiac treatments is greater than ever before. School nurses are in a unique position to advocate for the child’s health needs in the school setting, educate school personnel, participate in the IEP process, and prepare emergency plans. All caregivers share the same goal of a healthy school environment for every child that allows them to reach their full potential. This is the first in a two-part series on children with CHD at school. The second part will discuss neurodevelopmental outcomes and exercise and sports participation. ■</p>
