<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between education and domestic violence among women being offered an HIV test in urban and rural areas in Kenya. A sample selection of women who experienced physical (<italic>n</italic> = 4,308), sexual (<italic>n</italic> = 4,309), and emotional violence (<italic>n</italic> = 4,312) aged 15 to 49 allowed for the estimation of the association between education and domestic violence with further analysis stratified by urban and rural residence. The main outcome of interest was a three-factor (physical, sexual, and emotional) measure for violence with the main predictor being education. Nearly half of all domestic violence, physical (46%), sexual (45%), and emotional (45%) occurred among women aged 15 to 29. After adjusting for confounding variables, women who resided in urban areas and had a postprimary/vocational/secondary and college/university education were 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: [0.64, 0.86]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and 22% (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: [0.66, 0.92]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 less likely to have experienced physical violence compared to those who had a primary education respectively. This was 17% (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: [0.73, 0.94]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and 17% (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: [0.72, 0.96]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 less likely among women who resided in rural areas. A surprising finding was that women residing in rural areas with less than a primary education were 35% less likely to have experienced sexual violence (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: [0.43, 0.99]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 compared to those who had a primary education. These findings suggest that physical, sexual, and emotional violence were prevalent in Kenya among married and formerly married women. This study indicates that more research is needed to understand factors for HIV/AIDS among Kenyan women who have specifically tested positive for HIV or identified as AIDS-positive and the implications for women’s health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Women in Kenya are prone to various forms of abuse including those that are gender based. These gender-based forms of abuse include sexual, physical, and emotional mainly from an intimate partner—referring to the spouses of women with whom they are romantically involved. In this context, abuse includes physical, sexual, or emotional attacks, ranging from mild to lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511431437">Dickson Society, n.d.</xref>). These forms of abuse have certain key components that signify their onset. For instance, being forced to perform types of other sexual acts that one does not want to; threatening, slapping, and pushing; being told something humiliating in front of others would characterize examples of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, respectively. Abuse also includes nonpartner sexual violence (violence that stems from individuals that women are in relationships with but not necessarily married to), sexual abuse of girls (violence that is sexual in nature specifically targeted to girls), and women being trafficked for sex (illegal trade of human beings for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431437">World Health Organization [WHO], 2002</xref>). Forms of violence directed at women remains a global problem. For instance, global reviews of more than fifty surveys based on population-related information show that 10% to 60% of mature women have been beaten by a male who they were romantically involved with at one time or another in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431437">Heise, Ellsberg, &amp; Gotemoeller, 1999</xref>). It is important to note that in reference to this study, domestic violence (physical, sexual, or emotional) is used because the study sample involves married or formerly married women.</p>
<p>African countries estimates indicate that between 25% and 48% of women will suffer from abuse at one point in their lives. For example, 25% of women in South Africa, 30% in Uganda, 30% in Egypt, 47% in Kenya, and 48% in Zambia have experienced abuse with the annual prevalence estimated to range between 10% and 26% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431437">Jewkes, Levin, &amp; Penna-Kekana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431437">Khasakhala-Mwenesi, Buluma, Konǵani, &amp; Nyarunda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511431437">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431437">Koenig, Lutalo, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431437">Mwenesi, Buluma, Konǵani, &amp; Nyarunda, 2003</xref>). In addition, 6% to 47% of adult women have been sexually assaulted at least once in their lives by their intimate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431437">Heise et al., 1999</xref>). Among young girls and women aged 15 to 24, 7% to 48% have experienced sexual coercion during their initial sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431437">Garcia-Moreno &amp; Watts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431437">Heise et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431437">WHO, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0886260511431437">
<title>Women and Abuse</title>
<p>Abuse has significant public health effects that result in injuries, both short and long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511431437">WHO, 1997</xref>). For example, long-term consequences of abuse include but are not limited to being depressed, ever-present pain, gynecological disorder, sexually transmitted diseases, and stress disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511431437">Campbell, 2002</xref>). Recent research indicates there is a relationship that exists between physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, and the likelihood of women experiencing adverse birth outcomes, which include abrupt end to pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck, Els, Kidula, Ndinya-Achola, &amp; Temmerman, 2005</xref>) and child deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511431437">Emenike, Lawoko, &amp; Dalal, 2008</xref>). In addition, studies in the context of Africa show that women who are beaten are susceptible to injuries, which include light bruises to broken bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431437">Koenig, Ahmed, Hossain, &amp; Khorshed Alam Mozumder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431437">Mwenesi et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research shows that when women experience physical violence perpetrated by their male partner, they are more likely to exhibit unhealthy sexual behaviors, norms, beliefs, and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511431437">Wingood, DiClemente, McCree, Harrington, &amp; Davies, 2001</xref>). For instance, women are less likely to practice prevention measures against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases if they are exposed to physical violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of Sub-Sahara Africa, when a man is HIV positive, there is a likelihood of increased violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431437">van der Straten et al., 1998</xref>); the violence could occur when a woman thinks that she is at risk of being infected by the man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431437">Cocker &amp; Ritcher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431437">Koenig, Lutalo, et al., 2003</xref>); a woman discloses her status to her partner; and when they discuss the use of condoms in their sexual relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431437">Gaillard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431437">Wingood &amp; DiClemente, 1997</xref>). Because of fear of violence and low power in sexual relationships, women are more likely to be inconsistent condom users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511431437">Pulerwitz, Amaro, De Jong, Gortmaker, &amp; Rudd, 2002</xref>). It has been documented that when male partners perpetuate sexual violence it is often accompanied by other forms of abuse like emotional and physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431437">Yoshitama &amp; Sorenson, 1994</xref>); thereby, an ongoing sexual relationship is characterized by control and exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431437">Walker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511431437">Wood, 2002</xref>). In Kenya, domestic violence continues to be prevalent (Kishor &amp; Kiersten, 2004). Despite policies that are aimed at improving women’s empowerment, about half of the women have been exposed to violence by age 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431437">Mwenesi et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260511431437">
<title>Abuse and Education</title>
<p>Research has shown there is a robust relationship between the level of education of a woman and partner violence. Previous studies show that women with less education are twice more likely to experience violence from intimate partners than women with more education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511431437">Jejeebhoy &amp; Cook, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431437">Jewkes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431437">Karamagi, Tumwine, Tylleskar, &amp; Heggenhougen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431437">Koenig, Ahmed, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431437">Koenig, Lutalo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431437">Lawoko, 2008</xref>). For instance, a woman with low levels of education is more likely to be beaten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>). In the context of Kenya, recent research shows women who had primary and secondary education were more likely to experience abuse either physical, emotional, or sexual in nature compared to women with postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511431437">Lawoko, Dalal, Jiayou, &amp; Jansson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431437">Martin, Tsui, Maitra, &amp; Marinshaw, 1999</xref>), indicating that empowerment will protect women against violence from their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431437">Jewkes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431437">Martin et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511431437">Lawoko et al. (2007)</xref> also found that women whose education was at par with their partners or higher were expected to report abuse compared to women with lower education levels than their partners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431437">Lawoko (2008)</xref> also reported that education explained attitudes toward abuse among men in Kenya, whose lack of education predicts a greater tolerance of physical violence in the form of wife beating.</p>
<p>However, scholars have also argued that the relationship between education and abuse is not a linear but a curvilinear relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511431437">Hindin &amp; Adair, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431437">Jewkes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431437">Karamagi et al., 2006</xref>). This curvilinear relationship explains the findings that more education increases the risk of physical and sexual violence among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431437">Rao, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431437">Schuler, Hashemi, Riley, &amp; Akhter, 1996</xref>). One reason for this relationship is greater empowerment—a direct effect of education will operate to reduce the risk of violence to a certain point before the effect levels to become protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431437">Rao, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431437">Schuler et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, scholars have argued that the relationship that exists between education and partner violence is specific to a particular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431437">Koenig, Stephenson, Ahmed, Jejeebhoy, &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>). This would mean that in more conservative environments, educated women would still experience increased abuse while in less conservative environments women with a higher education would experience less violence from intimate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431437">Karamagi et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431437">Karamagi et al. (2006)</xref> concluded that since majority of women are at the lower end of the education spectrum, education acts as a protective mechanism to violence, particularly abuse. Because the inverse relationship may be disputed due to the curvilinear debates, and because of the differences in contexts, it is important to reexamine education and abuse prevalence in the context of Kenya. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between education and domestic violence among women who were offered an HIV test in urban and rural areas in Kenya.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260511431437">
<title>Study Design, Data Source, and Sample</title>
<p>This is a cross-sectional study that used the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS-2003). The survey data were collected between April 18, 2003 and September 15, 2003, and the only instrument used to collect information on awareness and behavior in relation to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. For the purpose of this study, only the sample size for women will be used for all analyses. This is because domestic violence questions in the KDHS-2003 were only asked to women who were currently married or formally married. Hence, never married women were not included in the study since it was not collected in the KDHS-2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431437">Central Bureau of Statistics [CBS], 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the KDHS-2003, HIV testing was offered due to the high prevalence and infection of the disease in the country. A total of 8,050 women aged 15 to 49 were offered to be tested for HIV. After accounting for weights in the data set due to clustering effect to avoid over or underestimation of the standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511431437">StataCorp, 2009</xref>), a total of 5,729 married or formerly married women were retained in the data set. Of these, 5,628 were offered HIV testing with only 17% being tested for HIV. A sample selection—physical violence (4,308/5,729—75% response rate), sexual violence (4,309/5729—75% response rate), and emotional violence (<italic>n</italic> = 4,312/5729—75% response rate)—of women who responded to domestic violence questions allowed for the estimation of the association between education and domestic violence with further analysis stratified by urban and rural residence.</p>

<title>Survey Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0886260511431437">
<title>Sociodemographic</title>
<p>Married or formerly married women were asked several questions as it relates to sociodemographics. Age variable seeks to measure women’s age in 5-year age increments, women included in the survey were between 15 and 49 years. This variable was coded “0” if an individual was 15 to 19 years, “1” if an individual was 20 to 24 years, “2” if an individual was 25 to 29 years, “3” if an individual was 30 to 34 years, “4” if an individual was 35 to 39 years, “5” if an individual was 40 to 44 years, and “6” if an individual was 45 to 49 years. Women who were Protestants were coded as “0,” Roman Catholic “1,” Muslim “2,” and other religions “3.” For education, women who had less than a primary school were coded as “0,” primary school “1,” postprimary/vocational/secondary “2,” and college/university “3.” For residence, urban residence was coded as “0” and rural “1.” For ethnicity, Kikuyu was coded as “0,” Luhya “1,” Luo “2,” Kalenjin “3,” Kamba “4,” Kisii “5,” Meru “6,” and Others “7.” Perceived risk of acquiring HIV was coded as “0” if an individual perceived himself or herself to be at no risk acquiring HIV, small risk “1,” moderate risk “2,” and high risk “3.” Wealth was coded as “0” for being poorest, poorer “1,” middle “2,” richer “3,” and richest “4.” Finally, sexually transmitted disease was coded as “0” for No and Yes “1.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260511431437">
<title>Domestic violence</title>
<p>The participants were also asked various questions that measured domestic violence. Domestic violence among spouses was measured in the KDHS-2003 using a Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS; Strauss, 1990, as cited by CBS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431437">2004</xref>). The following questions were asked to evaluate domestic violence with a yes “1” or no “0” response. Women were asked if their last husband/partner ever (a) Say or do something to humiliate you in front of others? (b) Threaten you or someone close to you with harm? (c) Push you, shake you, or throw something at you? (d) Slap you or twist your arm? (e) Punch you with his fist or with something that could hurt you? (f) Kick you or drag you? (g) Try to strangle you or burn you? (h) Threaten you with a knife, gun, or other type of weapon? (i) Attack you with a knife, gun, or other type of weapon? (j) Physically force you to have sexual intercourse even when you did not want to? And (k) Force you to perform types of other sexual acts you did not want to?</p>
<p>Common factor analysis as a technique in identifying patterns while at the same time maintaining the needed information as it relates to domestic violence with minimal loss was used. The retained factors were used for analysis; these factors mostly explained/measured a certain theme, which was renamed for the same. The retained factors that explained most of the total variance were used to generate a dichotomous variable. If an individual responded yes to one of the questions in each factor, then they were coded as yes “1” agreeing to a certain theme to have occurred and “0” if they responded no to all questions in each factor. Weights and correlations between each variable (factor loading) were determined at &lt;0.3 (UCLA, n.d). Three main themes for domestic violence were identified as (a) physical violence, (b) sexual violence, and (c) emotional violence.</p>

<sec id="section9-0886260511431437">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All data analyses for descriptive, bivariate, univariate, and multivariate were conducted using STATA version 11. Bivariate analyses were used in the estimation of prevalence of domestic violence by study independent variables. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used in the identification of the association between the main outcome measure (domestic violence) and independent variables. Last, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted by including variables identified through forward stepwise multivariate regression method. Univariate (unadjusted) and multivariate (adjusted) analyses stratified by urban and rural residence are reported using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, study significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Among women who were offered an HIV test, 85% were married. Furthermore, those who were married also reported physical violence (40%), sexual violence (13%), and emotional violence (22%). Among women who were formerly married, this was 63%, 27%, and 49% respectively. Nearly half of all domestic violence; physical violence (46%), sexual violence (45%), and emotional violence (45%) occurred among women aged 15 to 29 (table not shown). In addition, all three forms of violence were highest among those who had a primary school education (64%, 65%, and 62%) compared to those who had a college/university education (3%, 4%, and 4%), respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511431437">Table 1</xref>). Overall, of the women who were offered an HIV testing 1,805 (experienced physical violence), 606 (sexual violence), and 1,038 (emotional violence) were documented. The prevalence of domestic violence by each category is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260511431437">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Univariate Logistic Regression: Association Between Domestic Violence and Education</title>
<p>Several associations between education and domestic violence were observed.

This was 23% less likely for women who had a college/university education (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: [0.65, 0.92]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Women who resided in rural areas and had less than a primary, postprimary/vocational/secondary, and college/university education were 23% (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: [0.6, 1.00]), <italic>p</italic> = .054; 13% (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: [0.76, 0.99]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and 13% (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: [0.76, 0.99]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 less likely to have experienced violence compared to those who had a primary education respectively.

However, this was unexpected for sexual violence among women residing in rural areas.

<p>The main objective of this study was to examine the association between education and domestic violence among women who were offered an HIV test in urban and rural areas in Kenya. The findings indicate that 48% of the married women reported having experienced physical violence. This finding is similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al. (2005)</xref> found in their study of women who tested positive for HIV at a health facility in Nairobi, Kenya, where nearly half (45%) of women aged 15 to 29 reported being in an abusive relationship.</p>
<p>While physical violence remains common among women in Kenya, this study finds that other forms of violence (emotional and sexual) among women are still rampant, which is consistent with earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511431437">Heise, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431437">Kimuna &amp; Djamba, 2008</xref>). For instance, we found that women living in both rural and urban areas experienced physical violence. However, having a postprimary/vocational/secondary education was more protective for women living in urban areas compared to those with a primary education. On the contrary, having a higher level of education did not protect women against physical violence in rural areas, as those women with less than a primary education were less likely to experience violence compared to those with a primary education. This finding in rural areas could add to the dialogue on the curvilinear relationships between education and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511431437">Hindin &amp; Adair, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431437">Jewkes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431437">Karamagi et al., 2006</xref>), thereby supporting the argument that education may indeed increase the risk of abuse among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431437">Rao, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431437">Schuler et al., 1996</xref>). One plausible explanation of this finding in rural areas in Kenya could be that many people still believe and practice traditions that could put a woman at even higher risk of physical violence. To this end, the findings could corroborate those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431437">Koenig, Ahmed, et al. (2003)</xref> who argued that abuse against women may be context specific.</p>
<p>We were surprised by the finding that even women who are well educated and living in urban areas are also experiencing sexual violence. This finding suggests that sexual violence transcends both geographical regions and education. Even though women who are well educated and living in rural areas have a lower rate of sexual violence than well-educated women living in urban areas, there are still many unanswered questions regarding why this phenomenon occurs. This finding was contrary to our expectations, because traditions among some of the Kenyan people residing in the rural areas such as payment of dowry, polygamy, and giving a woman to her deceased husband’s brother lend itself to situations that could increase a woman’s risk of being sexually violated. In addition, in rural areas many families depend on farming for wealth, and there are less career opportunities for women; therefore, this socioeconomic situation could also increase a woman’s risk of being physically and sexually violated particularly among those who are less educated. In many rural areas, a woman may feel dependent on the husband or male partner for economic survival; therefore, the male partner could be in a position of exerting his power, which could result in sexual violence. Alternatively, this finding could indicate that rural and less educated women are totally subservient to their husbands and thus reduce their chances of being violated sexually.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the following in this article: (a) physical violence is the most common form of abuse; (b) higher education was protective against physical violence in urban areas but not in the rural areas; (c) less educated women in the rural areas were less likely to be sexually violated; and (d) while domestic violence was noted for all forms of abuse, the level of violence varied across all forms of abuse and urban or rural residence. Our results were <italic>limited</italic> in the sense that this study was cross–sectional in nature. It was also not possible to assess the impact of education on the different types of violence over time. In addition, the findings are limited to one context—Kenya; therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to other African countries.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings have significant <italic>policy implications</italic> for women’s health in Kenya. Increasing the level of awareness, and empowering women to know, recognize, and voice their concerns regarding any abuse acts is imperative in achieving better women’s health outcomes, especially those that are brought about by the various forms of violence including mental health. One way of improving women’s health outcomes is to sensitize women on the various forms of violence because if they are not aware that they are being abused, they cannot be in a position to recognize and prevent it. It is important that women recognize and voice their concerns on domestic violence since various studies have shown that violence can lead to various forms of adverse birth outcomes, HIV infection, and other sexually transmitted diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431437">Fonck et al., 2005</xref>). In this regard, the Sexual Offences Act of 2006 needs to incorporate clauses seeking to protect women who have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence. Moreover, programs that target men or both husband and wife should be encouraged to create awareness on why spousal violence in any form is not acceptable. This can particularly be successful through integration of services such as maternal and child health.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study opens up new avenues for further research. Due to the high rates of domestic violence in Nyanza, Western, and Rift Valley, further research is needed to unravel the aspects of ethnic identities and how these principles play a role in abusing woman. This research could go hand in hand with identifying those cultural factors that increase a married woman’s risk of experiencing violence physically, sexually, or emotionally and acquiring HIV. In addition, future research should investigate how male and female church congregants understand their role in relationships based on the church’s teachings. Also, the role domestic violence can play in HIV infections need to be further investigated in Kenya considering the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS currently being experienced. In sum, domestic violence among women remains rampant in Kenya, and education does not seem to be a protective factor against physical, sexual, and emotional violence.</p>
