<sec id="sec1-1742715012444058"><title>Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling and Scott Taylor (eds), <italic>Exploring leadership: Individual, organizational and societal perspectives</italic>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011. 214pp. £50.00. ISBN 978 0 19 954765 4 (hbk)</title>
<sec id="sec2-1742715012444058"><title><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Kevin Morrell, <italic>University of Warwick, UK</italic></title>
<p>In seven detailed chapters, <italic>Exploring Leadership</italic> reviews a great number of themes relating to leadership, at – as the title promises – a number of different levels of analysis: individual, organizational and societal. In doing so it also offers a clear and definite sense of a particular school's perspective on leadership (the Centre for Leadership Studies (CLS) at the University of Exeter). The CLS perspective is one that emphasizes the following values: relevance, curiosity, inconvenience, creativity, closeness and influence. The book stands, or should stand (in the case of influence) as a fine example of each of these values, which is deservedly high praise.</p>
<p>The heart of the book comes in three dedicated chapters (Chapters 3,4,5). These respectively discuss leadership in relation to the individual (e.g. trait accounts, leadership styles), the organizational (e.g. power, culture) and the societal (e.g. globalization, sustainability). These are prefaced by two chapters: (Chapter 1) a brief introduction – framing the text and contribution (this satisfactorily answers the authors' question, ‘not “another” book on leadership?'); and (Chapter 2) an overview of ‘theoretical considerations' – which includes discussion of the origins of leadership theory, the nature of leadership in relation to management and the contested nature of the term. The book closes with two chapters dealing with emerging perspectives and dilemmas, such as gender, toxicity and spirituality (in Chapter 6); and a brief, but focused, conclusion asking, appropriately ‘where next' – which refers to the future of the subject (Chapter 7).</p>
<p>The book is well written, as one would expect from this team of contributors. It covers a great deal of history and theory, and is both comprehensive and authoritative, as well as sprinkled with lapidary cases and examples that make it engaging to read. Chapters are typically around 25–35 pages long and conclude with useful summaries of about half a page. One could get a sense of the book very quickly by reading these, but it also repays much closer reading. The text is well organised at a macro level (in terms of the framework) and also within each chapter (in terms of headings and structure), and this aids readability. It is accessible, even though (in comparison to much in the mainstream of writing on leadership) it includes discussion of some quite challenging ideas and topics (dialectics, critical perspectives, discourse). Right up front is a discussion about the need for critical perspectives on management and leadership, and later chapters deal with topics such as aesthetics and psychopathology.</p>
<p>There are few interruptions in the way of tables or figures; those tables which do make it into the text are important (an introductory table summarizing the values of the Centre for Leadership Studies at Exeter – where each author is based; a concluding table referring to the changing nature of work, society and leadership). The three figures on intervening pages are interesting enough and relevant. Mercifully there is sufficient space given over in this book to uninterrupted prose, there are no distracting devices such as call-out boxes, glossy photographs, lists of relevant URLs, glossary etc.; and – whilst there is much that is summarized (naturally, given such a large field) – lists are kept to a necessary minimum. The book is well researched and has an extensive bibliography (I estimated over 400 references), which includes reference to 14 publications by the lead author, Richard Bolden, indicating relevant expertise and a commitment over time to this topic. It is, interestingly, dedicated to, ‘our students, whose questions have prompted so much thought'.</p>
<p>A potential improvement for future editions, is that there could be separate name and topic indices. The book lists authors referred to which is helpful, but it would supplement the contents at the front were there to be a more detailed topic guide at the back too.</p>
<p>Whilst it helped to provide structure – and the book is certainly clear – I wasn't too sure about the individual, organizational and societal framework in places. My main reason for this was that whereas trait accounts of leadership seem very straightforward to see as individual, some other themes in this section (story-telling and emotional intelligence) appear to me to be mutually constituted, or ‘heavy' with context, rather than being examples of ‘leadership as the property of the individual' (p.67). The example of Queen Elizabeth I’s speech at Tilbury docks (a speech we might recall with the lines ‘body of a weak and feeble woman, but … heart and stomach of a king') (discussed on p.57) is a case in point. It refers to her as, ‘prepared to stand in solidarity on the battlefield with her soldiers' (p.57), which is right, but the impact of the speech surely only makes sense if we attend not just to her rhetoric or personal traits, but to ‘big' contextual factors: patriarchy/gender, divine right of Kings (structure as well as agency might be a way of expressing it). But this is a minor quibble, and occurred to the authors since they make this point in the same chapter: ‘Stories are not only <italic>told</italic>, they are listened to, interpreted and recounted by others' (p.58 original emphasis).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is simultaneously encyclopaedic and engaging, and I would not hesitate in recommending this to anyone who wanted to know more about the current state of the field in leadership studies.</p></sec>
