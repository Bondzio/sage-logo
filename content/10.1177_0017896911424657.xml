<p>Dear Professor Blinkhorn,</p>
<p>The importance of adequate pain control in patients is now clearly recognized. However, expertise in this area is currently lacking in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most physicians who work in the ICU do not have adequate training in pain management and therefore rely on conventional techniques such as small doses of morphine or simply base medication administration on protocols. Many decisions are left to non-physicians, i.e. physician assistants and nurses.</p>
<p>Pharmacologically there have been many advances in the relief of pain and anxiety as well as the psychological sequelae related to critical illness, respirators, and invasive instrumentation and monitoring. The specialty of pain medicine has also developed significantly over the last ten to twenty years, however most pain specialists focus their attention on chronic pain. Pain management physicians’ expertise is under-utilized in the ICU. Many of them are uncomfortable with the severity of illness in patients in ICUs and therefore avoid these areas, allowing the physicians there to make the decisions instead.</p>
<p>At the moment, most critical care specialists have no training or understanding of the short-term and long-term effect of pain medications, the under-treatment of pain, or the excessive use of analgesic and sedative medicines.</p>
<p>We feel that these physicians should have adequate pain management training as part of their ICU training. There should also be a stronger emphasis on this area and the development of a curriculum in medical schools, where at the moment most pain-related lectures are given during the first or second year before the students become involved in patient care.</p>
