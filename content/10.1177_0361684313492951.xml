<p>What is <italic>Cyberfeminism 2.0</italic>? And where have all the cyber feminists gone? The first question is somewhat answered in <italic>Cyberfeminism 2.0</italic>, a frequently interesting, although occasionally dense, compendium of an introduction and 15 edited and loosely associated chapters. The answer to the latter question, according to the majority of the contributing authors, can be summarized as: “in these pages, more so than on the ‘net.’”</p>
<p>According to the media studies critic Susanna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313492951">Paasonen (2011</xref>, p. 335), cyberfeminism refers to the “feminist appropriation of information and computer technology” on both practical and theoretical levels. Holly Kruse’s (p. 101, this volume) activist definition is similar, although perhaps more populist—indicating that during the past decade, cyberfeminism has “urged women and girls to get involved and disrupt the largely patriarchal institutions that govern digital technology.” The technological arena is large and diverse; <italic>Cyberfeminism 2.0</italic> tackles topics as varied as Health 2.0, girls’ tribute videos to horse racing, video game culture, women artists using technology, the Korean cyberfeminist community of <italic>Unnine</italic>, blogs of female doctoral students, and online conversations about breastfeeding and parenting.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is unlikely that readers will find every chapter useful for their interests, research or personal, although they are likely to be introduced to cyber worlds about which they had not previously been aware. For this reviewer, one of many examples was that of BlogHer and Blogalicious, two popular annual blogging conferences that the author, Jessie Daniels (Chapter 2), enjoyably describes using her ethnographic fieldwork. Readers may find some chapters more accessible than others depending on their familiarity with the language of feminist theory, literary theory, and the academic fields of communications and media studies. For that reason, for some readers, the chapter titles may tilt toward the obscure; thus, abstracts or summaries at the beginning of each chapter would have been helpful guideposts for assisting the reader to locate relevant chapters. Furthermore, the division of the book into three sections was not that beneficial an organization because many chapters had the potential to belong to more than one division.</p>
<p>In fact, it may be a shock to readers accustomed to standard scientific format how engaged the authors are in their cyberfeminist projects, rather than scientifically detached. All written in the first person, the chapters, mostly essays, typically exhibit a proud feminist perspective and are often examples of data collected through participant observation. For example, Lauren Angelone (Chapter 3) included her blog as one of the five she subjected to critical discourse analysis. Natalia Rybas (Chapter 14), as part of her exploration of conversations about breast-feeding and parenting, participated in “a virtual nurse-in” on a Facebook social network. Indeed, this blurring of the line between the researcher and the researched was recently tackled in the pages of <italic>Psychology of Women Quarterly</italic>, and these concerns merit our consideration when reading about these projects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313492951">Crawford, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313492951">Wilkinson &amp; Kitzinger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313492951">Yost &amp; Chmielewski</xref>).</p>
<p>Most chapters, such as those in the paragraph above, focus on online community, its contributions and pitfalls to individual Internet users, and the strength of the community’s feminist orientation. When the community coheres, as described in Jessie Daniels’ chapter (Chapter 2) on women’s blogging conferences, there is connection; when it fails, as in Rosalind Sibielski’s work on adolescent DIY (do-it-yourself) media (Chapter 4) and Debbie James’ analysis of the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Audiovisual E-Platform Submission Process (Chapter 6), there is confusion and, perhaps, alienation. For example, Becky Walker (Chapter 12) describes lesbian fan forums’ responses to rape scenes, as defined by the author, on the cable television show “The L Word.” Although Walker considers the online space to be “a form of cyberfeminism that allows deliberation in public over evolving norms for lesbian communities” (p. 242) that is alive and well, she notes that the debates missed important aspects of evolving feminist understandings of power and control within lesbian relationships.</p>
<p>In fact, some authors, such as Erika Kubik (Chapter 7) and Genesis Downey (Chapter 9), indicate that gaming communities, among others, can be just as oppressive as others’ online group experiences. In fact, my “take-away” after reading this thought-provoking book is that there is not as much evidence of feminism in the cyber world as the editors and authors had hoped, though certainly the potential remains for there to be.</p>
