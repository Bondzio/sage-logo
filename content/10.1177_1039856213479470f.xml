<p>The year 2013 marks an important milestone for The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which celebrates its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of College status. From its beginnings in 1946 at Maudsley House as the ‘Australasian Association of Psychiatrists’, the College grew from 39 Foundation Fellows in 1963 to having more than 4800 members across Australia and New Zealand today. Coincidentally, the College reached 1000 members in the same year it was given its ‘Royal’ prefix in 1978.</p>
<p>A dedicated section of the College’s website has been created to bring together information about the College, its achievements and its members in this 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary year. To read about past presidents, browse photographs of historic events, or review a timeline of psychiatric history over the last 50 years, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ranzcp.org/50years">www.ranzcp.org/50years</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Throughout 2013, all members will have the opportunity to attend a series of celebratory events being held throughout Australia and New Zealand in the form of dinners, receptions or balls hosted by College branches. The College’s annual Congress taking place in Sydney in May 2013 will feature an exhibition of nostalgic reminders of the College’s history throughout the venue and integrated into the program, including a golden Gala Dinner to help celebrate our history and achievements over the past 50 years. Many members celebrating close to 50 years with the College will tell stories of their work and life in psychiatry in Psych-e and online each month. Special articles have also been commissioned for both of the College’s Journals, which will make very interesting reading.</p>
<p>We particularly encourage members to browse the 200 plus photos of members at events from the 1940s to the current day. College members are featured both in their official duties and enjoying convivial times at College events.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to the celebration of the College’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary or comment on the website, please email <email>50years@ranzcp.org</email></p>
