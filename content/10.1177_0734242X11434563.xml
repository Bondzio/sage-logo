<abstract>
<p>A new collection model was designed and tested in Catalonia (Spain) to foster the separate collection and recycling of electrical and electronic toys, with the participation of selected primary and secondary schools, as well as waste collection points and municipalities. This project approach is very original and important because small household WEEE has low rates of collection (16–21% WEEE within the EU or 5–7% WEEE in Spain) and no research on new approaches to enhance the collection of small WEEE is found in the literature. The project was successful in achieving enhanced toys collection and recycling rates, which went up from the national Spanish average of 0.5% toys before the project to 1.9 and 6% toys during the two project years, respectively. The environmental benefits of the campaign were calculated through a life-cycle approach, accounting for the avoided impact afforded by the reuse of the toys and the recycling of the valuable materials contained therein (such as metals, batteries and circuit boards) and subtracting the additional environmental burdens associated with the establishment of the collection campaign.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The European Commission’s Directive on WEEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11434563">EC, 2003</xref>) aims to reduce the quantity of WEEE that goes to landfill and also establishes manufacturers and importers as the responsible entities for the appropriate management of these wastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11434563">Khetriwal, 2009</xref>). Generally, in European countries the management of WEEE is carried out using mixed systems where municipalities are in charge of their collection, while manufacturers handle recycling and treatment. Nevertheless, not much WEEE is collected and recycled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11434563">Table 1</xref>). Thus, more efficient collection and recycling networks are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11434563">Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11434563">Liao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11434563">Salema, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11434563">Schmid, 2008</xref>), especially for waste of small electrical and electronic equipment, mainly when considering their high environmental impact, annually increasing production and low recycling rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11434563">Babu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11434563">Chancerel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11434563">Cui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11434563">Gottberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11434563">Ivanus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11434563">Ongondo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11434563">Xanthopoulos, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Small WEEE recycling and reuse represents a challenge because the material composition is complex; small WEEE include widely diverse consumer products, and cost-effective disassembling technologies are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11434563">Chancerel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11434563">Hula et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In Spain, small WEEE is usually disposed of in the kerbside container mixed in with household waste, which is landfilled. To improve its collection and recycling rates, a new collection strategy was designed. This strategy involved a local network with different actors and the waste from electrical and electronic toys was meant to be an educational example to achieve an improvement in the collection of small WEEE. The project, named R-CICLEJOGUINA, aimed to raise collection rates for toys with electrical and electronic components because currently, only 0.5% of these toys are recycled in Spain according to data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11434563">ECOTIC, 2010</xref>).The project involved the design of a collection system for WEEE from toys that reduced the amount of waste going to landfill and effectively promoted both recycling and reuse. The proposed collection system was local, facilitated the reuse of toys and involved educational institutions and municipalities. Two pilot campaigns were carried out in three municipalities during the 2007–08 and 2008–09 academic years to check the strength and weaknesses of the designed collection system. The final results of the project are presented here describing the collection rates, and the associated reduction of environmental impact.</p>
<p>The originality of this research mainly comes from being one of the very few studies addressing small WEEE and additionally the ‘small WEEE collection system’ rather than its recycling as such as this is discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11434563">Chancerel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11434563">Salhofer and Tesar, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X11434563" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Three municipalities with 23 000 to 47 000 inhabitants were chosen and 75 to 90% of their schools voluntarily participated in the campaigns.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X11434563">
<title>End-of-life collection of toys</title>
<p>It was assumed that the collected toys were in addition to those which are normally collected through household hazardous waste collection points, because no specific collection of small WEEE can be found in most of the Spanish cities; that is, it was assumed that the toys collected in the schools would otherwise have been mixed with regular waste and gone to landfill. This point, although very probable, cannot be strictly proved because the waste recycling centres of the three involved municipalities had no specific data on small WEEE collected in the years prior to the campaign.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X11434563">
<title>Evaluation of the environmental benefits</title>
<p>The environmental benefits obtained from the campaign were calculated by quantifying the impacts avoided as a result of reusing part of the collected toys and recycling the rest of them (the possible cost reduction by avoided landfill disposal of these collected toys was considered insignificant). A number of impact categories were selected from the CML 2001 life cycle impact assessment method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11434563">Guinée et al., 2001</xref>), namely: abiotic depletion potential (ADP); acidification potential (AP); eutrophication potential (EP); global warming potential (GWP) and photochemical oxidant formation potential (POFP). Although toxic impacts caused by the landfilling of toys can be very significant given that WEEE are considered hazardous waste, these avoided toxic impacts were not evaluated due to lack of data. The evaluation of the environmental benefits was a simplified evaluation using life cycle thinking and cannot be considered a full life cycle assessment (LCA).</p>
<p>The avoided impacts attributed to the reuse of the toys were quantified using the results of the LCA of a toy with electrical and electronic components published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11434563">Muñoz et al. (2009)</xref>. The impacts per kilogram of toy were calculated given the composition of the toy and the impacts associated with its manufacturing. Additionally, the cumulative avoided impacts were calculated once the total kilograms of reused toys were known. The use phase of the reused toy was considered equivalent to the use phase of a new one.</p>
<p>The collected toys that could not be repaired for reuse went to a recycling plant. The impacts avoided through the recycling of toys were quantified using the results of an LCA of the recycling of electrical and electronic apparatuses published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11434563">Hischier et al. (2005)</xref>. The components of this type of waste that notably reduced impacts when recycled were batteries, metals, and circuit boards. These impacts were calculated per kilogram of recycled batteries, kilogram of recycled metal and kilogram of recycled circuit boards. Given the kilograms of recycled toys and the average composition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11434563">Table 2</xref>) of the aforementioned components, the total avoided impacts due to recycling were calculated. These avoided impacts were calculated with incineration as the baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11434563">Hischier et al., 2005</xref>), thus being usually lower than the real avoided ones in Spain where the baseline is landfilling with no energy recovered.</p>

<p>This composition has been estimated from data on composition of toys, sports and leisure time equipment (category 7 of Directive 2002/96/CE) obtained from a recycling facility, together with the authors experience in LCA studies of four toys’ categories (including the one described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11434563">Muñoz et al. (2009)</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The avoided impacts per kilogram of recycled metal and per kilogram of recycled circuit boards were calculated by subtracting the impacts associated with the recycling process from the impacts associated with the primary production of metal or the circuit board. In the case of batteries, environmental savings were considered null because the environmental costs of the recycling process are high. For the metal recycling scenario, it was assumed that the distance to the treatment plant was 250 km and that 100% of the recovered metal was iron that would be used for the secondary production of steel. In other words, the recovered metals that were not iron were included in the calculation and treated as though they were iron; this is the least favourable scenario given that the avoided impacts from the recovery of more valuable metals such as copper and silver would be far superior to that of iron.</p>
<p>Additionally, the environmental burdens associated with setting up the campaign were taken into account (the burdens associated with repairing those toys that can be easily repaired were considered to be negligible). Specifically:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X11434563" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The impact associated with the production of the communication elements was calculated using the number of kilograms of plastic necessary (plastic collection containers), the plastic moulding process, the kilograms of paper and cardboard (cardboard containers, posters, brochures, manual, etc.) and the kilograms of magnets (magnetic logotypes of the campaign, included as plastic). The impacts associated with the moulding process and the manufacture of 1 kg of plastic (high density polyethelyene), of 1 kg of cardboard and of 1 kg of paper were taken from the GaBi LCA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11434563">PE International, 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The impacts attributed to transport were calculated using the number of kilometres driven on the collection routes and the trips to the recycling plant. The environmental impacts per tonne-km were again obtained from the GaBi LCA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11434563">PE International, 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the overall net environmental benefits of the project were calculated as the difference between the avoided impacts and the additional burdens for each of the considered impact categories (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X11434563">Equation (1)</xref>).</p>

<title>End-of-life toy collection rate</title>
<p>During the first phase (2007–2008 academic year) of the campaign a total of 503 kg were collected (about 42.5 g per student). Out of the total, 78.5 kg were repaired and/or reused.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the campaign (2008–2009 school year), these results improved reaching a total of 612 kg (45.8 g per student), of which only 45 kg were reused, possibly due to the children picking up some toys from the containers in the school for direct reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the second phase of the campaign, various toy stores in Igualada participated and collected a total of 780 kg of defective toys; all of these toys were reused and/or resold. If this number is added to the collection achieved in the school, the total rises to 1392 kg with 825 kg reused. Thus, the R-CICLEJOGUINA campaign would have achieved a collection rate (based upon all toys sold) of 1.9 and 6% in the first and second campaigns, respectively, compared to the 0.5% rate collected in the usual system in Spain during 2006, 2007 and 2008, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11434563">ECOTIC (2010)</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11434563">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the above calculation for each of the impact categories. The total quantity of toys recycled during the project was 424.5 kg, with 95.5 kg in metals and 2.1 kg of circuit boards. These results consider that the fraction of mixed non-metal (which represents 76% by weight of recycled toys) goes entirely to landfill. In the near future the existing facilities are planning to recycle this fraction, composed mainly of plastics, as a solid fuel from waste. To calculate the environmental costs of the R-CICLEJOGUINA campaign it was assumed that all materials were used only once except for the plastic containers that could be used for up to 10 years, taking into account a replacement rate of 10% per year for broken containers. The impact attributed to transport during the campaign turned out to be insignificant in comparison with that of the materials used.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The new collection strategy, tested through the R-CICLEJOGUINA project, proved to be efficient in the collection of toys. The campaign was environmentally beneficial even in the worst case scenario described above: with the lowest collection rates (1.9%), the highest costs of the campaign and only recycling 23% of toy’s composition.</p>
<p>The achieved collection rates (1.9 and 6%) can be increased if the campaign is introduced into the primary and secondary school curricula, thus integrating it into the dynamics of the classroom.</p>
