<p>In market-based economies, there is an unspoken assumption across all sectors that innovation is not only desirable but essential. The private sector believes it must innovate not only to grow but simply to retain its market share. The public sector increasingly argues that innovation is imperative not only to improve public health, but also to improve productivity. For example, last year the Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England called for evidence and ideas about how the adoption and diffusion of innovations could be accelerated across the NHS. The call argued that ‘<italic>unless innovations spread beyond pockets of excellence and into everyday practice, the NHS will struggle to produce the improvements in quality and productivity it requires</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112440076">Young Foundation, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is with that insight that the editorial board of the <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> have introduced a couple of innovations in the first year since the retirement of the Journals founding editor. Our ambition has been unequivocally to retain the mission and purpose of the journal, to populate the territory that makes the links between nursing research and health and social care policy explicit, as well as inform the practices of clinical nursing, education and management. Our innovations have therefore been ‘incremental’ rather than ‘disruptive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112440076">Buchanan, 2003</xref>). Under the guidance of our publishers, we are utilising the potential of information technology to speed up and streamline our reviewing processes and the publication process. Papers are submitted via <italic>Sagetrack</italic> and subject to double-blind peer review via the online system. Once accepted for publication and a review for publication has been secured, the paper and the review are published <italic>Online first.</italic> This online publication provides the author with a timely, citable reference and the editorial team the opportunity to group uncommissioned papers into themed, in-print editions. This, we believe, is good for the authors, good for our editors and most importantly good for our readership. We anticipate that by theming the publication in-print of our uncommissioned papers we will increase the impact of these papers by targeting specific audiences.</p>
<p>Another innovation we have piloted this year has been to invite a leader in their field to guest edit a focus edition of the <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> in partnership with members of the Editorial Board. This edition of the journal is a result of this initiative. Dr Cheryll Adams is a leading international voice in Health Visiting and we have been delighted to work with Dr Adams over the last 12 months on this edition. In particular, we have appreciated her commitment to the cause, for bringing and sharing her expertise and for drawing on her extensive practice and policy networks in the field to help shape this issue.</p>
<p>We hope you like these changes and would welcome your feedback (jrn@sagepub.co.uk), being mindful that these changes are being made at a time when innovation in policy is being seen as less than desirable by many!</p>
<p>The reforms of the National Health Service in England proposed by the UK coalition Government continue to cause considerable controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112440076">McMahon &amp; Meyer, 2012</xref>). Resistance is growing as the professional organisations lodge their concerns and the public is mobilised to lobby their political representatives to oppose the policy reforms.</p>
<p>In the UK, political devolution is asymmetric. Nevertheless, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly have devolved responsibility for health in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. The UK coalition Government therefore only has jurisdiction over health policy within England and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112440076">Greer (2004)</xref> has pointed out, devolution has fostered policy divergence. The UK coalition government argues that their proposed policy reforms of the national health system in England will secure the health service in the face of the global health and fiscal challenges resulting from demographic changes and technological advances. The relatively wealthy nations may appear to be the victims of their own successes in this regard. Economic prosperity has led to better public health and health care. In turn, demand on health services continues to rise because people are living longer and more (expensive) interventions are available. Paradoxically, however, relative wealth is seen as a contributor to a rise in lifestyle related health issues including obesity and substance misuse. The growing numbers of antagonists of the UK Governments health service reforms proffer arguments which include that that the proposals are politically motivated, will lead to the privatisation of a treasured public service and will not achieve the outcomes desired.</p>
<p>So current policy innovation is not without controversy! But it is not alone in that regard. Any innovation proposal is an assault on the status quo and will almost inevitably cause a degree of disquiet, unrest and even resistance. We have seen this before with evidence-based, nurse-led innovations, especially if they are perceived to encroach on the territory of other healthcare professionals. Such innovations include those that may be classified as ‘role-substitution’, where, for example, nurses expand their roles and deliver interventions hitherto provided solely by other health care professionals. An example here is where nurses are undertaking surgical interventions previously undertaken solely by medically qualified professionals, for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112440076">Newey et al., 2006</xref>). Opposition in such cases is rarely received from the recipients of the intervention but from the stakeholder professional groups who either feel that their territory is being inappropriately invaded or expanded and thus posing a threat to their professional identities. The fundamental question about the probity of any innovation must surely be – whose interests are being served? However, it is also important to research innovation and to do this over the long term. Little is known about the micro-level impact of health service innovations over time. In a study evaluating a new role in an acute hospital setting (interprofessional care co-ordinator), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112440076">Bridges et al. (2007)</xref> showed that, in spite of original intention, for this role to provide clerical support to the multidisciplinary team, over time the role shifted beyond its implementation into practice to take on more complex work from registered nurses. This raised actual and potential governance issues that were not attended to by service managers. Current innovation literature suggests that implementation into routine practice represents the end-point of an innovation’s journey. These findings suggest that certain innovations may in fact continue to shift in nature even after this ‘end-point’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112440076">Bridges et al. (2007)</xref> argue the need for innovation to be studied over a much longer period of time.</p>
<p>The coalition Government should consider some of the lessons learnt from nursing research and not only be mindful of the fact that innovation can cause anxiety and conflict, but also the importance of asking ‘whose interests are served’ and ensuring that any change made is based on evidence and is studied beyond its immediate implementation.</p>
