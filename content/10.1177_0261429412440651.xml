      <abstract>
        <p>Many people correctly believe that a majority of innovators come from the population of
          gifted and talented children. If we want to develop innovative abilities of the gifted,
          then a special, new direction in gifted education is needed: innovation education. This
          article introduces innovation education, which refers to a wide range of educational
          interventions aimed at identifying, developing, and transforming child talent into adult
          innovation. Such educational interventions should include, but should not be limited to,
          the 10 interrelated components. This article describes each of them.</p>

      <title>The link between giftedness and innovation</title>
      <sec id="section2-0261429412440651">
        <title>The origins of innovation education</title>
        <p>In 2009 the US National Science Board invited experts to discuss how to develop the next
          generation of innovators in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) disciplines
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429412440651">NSF, 2009</xref>). This event—with
          a subsequent report to Congress and President Obama—showed that the US government is
          interested in developing innovators. However, this is not a new trend on a global scale.
          The novelty consists in that many experts came from the field of giftedness. This is
          because the National Science Foundation correctly assumes that giftedness<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261429412440651">2</xref>
          </sup> is related to innovation.</p>
        <p>There is a consensus today that innovation refers to the implementation of ideas into
          practice in the form of new products, processes, or services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2003a</xref>). Creativity refers to the
          generation of novel, original, and appropriate ideas. Innovation is essentially about the
            <italic>implementation </italic>of ideas. Creators generate ideas; innovators implement
          them into practice. There is, however, a rare group of people who are able to both
          generate ideas and to implement them into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2007</xref>). They are gifted individuals.</p>
        <p>Societies are interested in gifted children because of potential talents which—in their
          adulthood—may significantly enrich the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429412440651">Kholodnaya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429412440651">Simonton, 2009</xref>). The history of human civilization
          can be understood via its inventions and discoveries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2003a</xref>). The progressive development of
          mankind is linked to the ever-growing scientific, technological, educational, political,
          and commercial achievements of the human mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429412440651">Simonton (2009</xref>) demonstrated that a large
          proportion of the contributions to any domain come from a small number of its most
          talented contributors. Therefore, the gifted are responsible for innovations worldwide.
          They move frontiers of innovation ahead. This implies that the degree of societal interest
          in talented children, as well as societal investment in gifted education, will be directly
          reflected in the level of innovations in society, and, as a consequence, in its economic
          prosperity. This is why innovation is highly linked to giftedness, and why giftedness is
          related to economy and public policy and should be among the top priorities on any
          government’s agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429412440651">Shavinina,
            2009b</xref>). Many of today’s gifted children will become tomorrow’s innovators. The
          efforts of the gifted education community should thus be directed to preparing today’s
          gifted to become tomorrow’s innovators.</p>
        <p>Researchers occasionally address the issue of how to develop innovators. From many
          chapters in the <italic>International Handbook on Innovation </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2003a</xref>), only a few of
          them discuss the development of innovators in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429412440651">Root-Bernstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429412440651">Root-Bernstein and Root-Bernstein, 2003</xref>; Shavinina,
          2003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429412440651">Weisberg, 2003</xref>) or the
          development of innovative abilities via the stimulation of creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429412440651">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429412440651">Reis and Renzulli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429412440651">Shavinina and Ponomarev, 2003</xref>). How to develop
          innovators is a new direction in innovation science. The US government is behind a recent
          push for research in this area. As noted above, the National Science Board led the efforts
          of the US administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429412440651">NSF,
            2009</xref>). Experts invited for a hearing in 2009 emphasized policy issues related to
          the development of innovators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261429412440651">Subotnik et al., 2009</xref>), findings from high-ability studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429412440651">Benbow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429412440651">Van Tassel-Baska and MacFarlane, 2009</xref>), and a need
          to change the practice of scientists’ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429412440651">Root-Bernstein, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429412440651">Shavinina (2009g</xref>) underlined the need to study high
          achievers in STEM areas (e.g., Nobel laureates, great inventors, and innovators with
          long-standing records of breakthrough innovations), whose innovation achievements are
          undeniable, as well as a need to focus on innovation education for everyone. Experts agree
          that the existing research base is thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429412440651">Benbow, 2009</xref>), a comprehensive research plan is
          necessary, and there is a need for basic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429412440651">Marrett and Johnson, 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>The main thesis of this article is that if we want to actualize the innovative potential
          of the gifted and develop their unique innovative talents, then we have to concentrate on
          innovation education.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0261429412440651">3</xref>
          </sup> Innovation education is not about innovations in teaching mathematics, physics,
          biology, and other disciplines. These are the so-called domain-specific innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2003a</xref>). Innovation
          education refers to a wide range of educational interventions aimed at developing and
          transforming child talent into adult innovation. It means those societal actions aimed at
          helping gifted children to become adult innovators. These educational interventions should
          include, but should not be limited to, the following: <list list-type="bullet">

        <p>The structure of innovation education can therefore be presented as 10 overlapping elements;<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0261429412440651">4</xref>
          </sup> each of which is discussed below.</p>

        <title>The structure of innovation education</title>
        <sec id="section4-0261429412440651">
          <title>Gifted education programs</title>
          <p>As successful programs for the gifted are well described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429412440651">Colangelo and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440651">Heller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2009a</xref>), the first
            element of innovation education will not be discussed in detail here. Gifted education
            programs are not sufficient for developing innovators. It would be a mistake to suppose
            that gifted education itself will ‘produce’ innovators. There are at least two reasons
            for this.</p>
          <p>First, by definition, innovation is the implementation of ideas into practice. This is
            not about their generation (i.e., creativity). People—and especially the gifted—are far
            better at generating new ideas than implementing them into practice. The implementation
            requires many talents (e.g., executive abilities or the ability to meet deadlines),
            which are not taught in gifted education programs. Consequently, if we want to develop
            innovators, then innovation education should incorporate such elements, which may help
            the gifted cultivate talents necessary for becoming innovators (e.g., to foster their
            intuition and wisdom).</p>
          <p>Second, research on gifted entrepreneurs–innovators demonstrates that many of them
            could not be considered gifted according to prevailing definitions of giftedness and
            practice of gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429412440651">2008</xref>). Entrepreneurial giftedness is a special type of high ability that
            deviates from existing types of giftedness. Its study is a relatively recent enterprise
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2009d</xref>). We
            cannot, therefore, expect that 100% of future innovators will come from today’s gifted.
            To increase chances of the gifted becoming innovators, innovation education should thus
            include other elements, presented below.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section5-0261429412440651">
        <title>Entrepreneurial giftedness</title>
        <p>The most important element of innovation education is entrepreneurial giftedness.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0261429412440651">5</xref>
          </sup> This is because entrepreneurs put ideas into practice via the creation of new
          ventures, which, in turn, create employment and—in successful cases—lead to economic
          prosperity. The essence of entrepreneurship coincides with the nature of innovation,
          because innovation is about the implementation of ideas into practice. Successful
          entrepreneurs are therefore innovators. This is why the following findings regarding
          entrepreneurial giftedness must be at the corner of innovation education:</p>

            rewards. For example, creativity has always been behind the entrepreneurial motivation

        <title>Scientific talent: lessons learned from Nobel laureates</title>
        <p>Future innovators will benefit from learning from Nobel laureates in science. Nobel
          laureates’ discoveries are scientific innovations. The nature of innovation is
          cross-disciplinary: it begins from great ideas in any field (Shavinina, 2003b, 2004).
          Winning a Nobel Prize represents the pinnacle of accomplishment possible in science. It is
          associated with a high degree of intellectually creative achievement that testifies to the
          innovative minds of its recipients.</p>
        <p>In childhood, Nobel laureates in science encompassed a wide range of human abilities
          including the gifted (e.g., Marie Curie or Gertrude B. Elion), the gifted underachievers
          (e.g., Albert Einstein), twice-exceptional children, and children without any special
          talents (e.g., Barbara McClintock). Different profiles of abilities and divergent
          trajectories of talent development led to the same outcome: great discoveries, which means
          that those who made them possess exceptional abilities. At the end, all the various
          trajectories of talent development led to the same result: astonishing scientific
          achievements. Among many factors that made it possible, Nobel laureates’ extracognitive
          abilities and their objectivization of cognition played important roles (Shavinina, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429412440651">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429412440651">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429412440651">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429412440651">2009f</xref>). Extracognitive abilities refer to:<disp-quote>
            <p>specific intellectually creative feelings: feelings of direction, harmony, beauty,
              and style, including the sense of ‘important problems’, ‘good’ ideas, ‘correct’
              theories, elegant solutions; and feelings of ‘being right or being wrong’;</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>specific intellectually creative beliefs and intentions (e.g., belief in elevated
              standards of performance);</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>specific preferences and intellectual values (e.g., the ‘inevitable’ choice of great
            mentors); and</p>

          <p>intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429412440651">Marton et al.,

        <p>For instance, Barbara McClintock noticed that ‘feeling for organism’ was behind her
          discoveries in genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429412440651">Keller,
            1984</xref>). It is useful for future innovators to know how extracognitive abilities
          helped Nobel laureates to be innovative.</p>
        <p>Lessons from Nobel laureates’ childhood and adolescence are another important facet of
          learning from them. I am currently working on a project, A Study of Early Childhood and
          Adolescent Education of Nobel Laureates and the Implications for Gifted and General
          Education: Developing Scientific Talent of Nobel Calibre. It starts with the first
          laureate, who received his prize in 1901, and ends with the laureates of 2010 (<italic>n
          </italic>= 611). Its goal is to discover the unique aspects of the early childhood and
          adolescent education of Nobel laureates that contributed to their superior intellectual
          and creative development and led to their excellent achievements in science.</p>
        <p>Another important and unexpected aspect of learning from Nobel laureates came from a
          talented 10-year-old boy, Alexander, who became interested in this project. When he
          started to read books about Nobel laureates written for children, he discovered many
          interesting things. Alexander heard many times that Nobel laureates were excellent
          students. However, he found that Guglielmo Marconi was not a good boy at school.
          Nonetheless, it was <italic>he</italic> who pioneered radio communication. Einstein was
          expelled from his school in Munich, but <italic>he</italic> had one of the greatest minds
          of the 20th century. Banting was not good at school either, but <italic>he</italic>
          discovered insulin and saved the lives of millions of diabetics worldwide. The father of
          McClintock told teachers not to give any homework to his children; he believed that eight
          hours at school was enough for learning.</p>
        <p>Alexander, therefore, originally thought that the Nobel laureates in science were great
          students. However, he has since found out that they were not. To be more precise, many of
          them were not the best in school. This made their stories so much more interesting to the
          boy. As the principal investigator on the above-mentioned project, I was intrigued by
          Alexander’s findings and suggested that other children and adults might also be
          fascinated. As a result, he is currently working on a book about young Nobel laureates’
          educational stories that will be of interest to children, their parents, and teachers. The
          stories of Nobel laureates are very encouraging and motivating for today’s gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429412440651">Ponomarev, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that at a time when researchers think of how to stimulate
          children’s interest in science, Alexander has found some useful ways to do this. In a
          presentation to the US National Science Board on how to develop innovators, with a
          subsequent report to Congress and President Obama in 2009, I discussed Alexander’s case.
          Specifically, his first degree of interest was why not all Nobel laureates were good
          learners at school. Then this initial interest motivated him to learn more about their
          discoveries. This was Alexander’s second degree of interest. As a result, he is becoming
          seriously interested in science, which can be considered the third degree of interest. A
          deep involvement in science might be a desired final outcome and this is the highest
          degree of interest. His book on how ‘supposed’ delinquent boys and girls in school still
          managed to make great discoveries and became Nobel laureates is a ‘by-product’ of
          Alexander’s developing interest in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429412440651">Ponomarev, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Gifted educators should thus learn from today’s talented children as to how they get
          interested in science and use those lessons.<sup>

        <p>Polymathy is another element of innovation education. The concept of polymathy refers to
          the cases of multiple-talented individuals who made significant major contributions to
          multiple domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429412440651">Root-Bernstein,

          specialization is a requirement for adult success, that skills and knowledge do not
          transfer across domains, and that the domain dependence of creativity and giftedness makes
          general creativity and talent impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429412440651">Ericsson et al., 2009</xref>). The absence of people who

          research challenges all three legs of the specialization thesis. He identified individuals
          who have made important contributions to several domains, and thus demonstrated polymathy
          among creatively gifted adults. Today’s gifted or future innovators will greatly benefit
          from the knowledge about the phenomenon of polymathy that must be included in innovation

          human wisdom. (Auto)biographical accounts on great innovators show that they have highly

          can progress today only by innovating; therefore, every effort should be made to develop
          wisdom in today’s gifted children and adolescents—tomorrow’s innovators.</p>

          </sup> in today’s gifted: lessons from great managers</title>
        <p>As noted above, innovators are able to put into place all the organizational, human, and
          ‘environmental’ structures necessary for implementing their ideas into practice. The human
          aspect is important. As David Ogilvy, the legendary founder and chief executive officer of
          the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide repeated, ‘people are the only thing
          that matters, and the only thing you should think about, because when that part is right,
          everything else works’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429412440651">Wademan,
            2005</xref>: 36). Innovators should therefore be good at managing people. This is why
          managerial talent is a critical ingredient of innovation talent. Many famous innovators
          are excellent in managing people. See, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261429412440651">Shavinina and Medvid (2009</xref>) for a case study of
          Richard Branson as a great manager. Lessons from such managers should be an important
          element of innovation education. Knowledge of their unique approaches to managing people
          will be an asset for today’s gifted—tomorrow’s innovators.</p>
        <p>The second part of learning from great managers should be based on the Gallup’s study of
          80,000 best managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429412440651">Buckingham and
            Coffman, 1990</xref>). The gifted will benefit from knowing how and why the great
          managers in the world break all the rules of conventional management wisdom. Practical
          cases with exercises will help develop the gifted’s managerial abilities.</p>

        <title>Deadline management</title>
        <p>A new research direction has recently emerged within administrative sciences: deadline
          management. Projects—including innovative ones—have their beginning and end. The same is
          true for any innovation that often depends on timely efforts: time needed to develop it,
          to introduce it to the marketplace, and so forth. A shorter period of time is better for
          innovation. It means that with respect to innovation those individuals and organizations
          who are fast in the innovation process will win. This is why deadline management should be
          an essential part of innovation education and should include the understanding that
          deadlines bring out the best in people; there is a need to cultivate a positive attitude
          to deadlines, as well as to develop a culture conducive to deadlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429412440651">Amabile et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429412440651">Gersick, 1995</xref>).</p>

        <p>Innovation education will not be comprehensive without some general ‘know what’ and ‘know
          how’ about innovation, such as the individual differences principle of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2007</xref>); the tyranny of
          success—when winners often become losers—(i.e., when companies lose their innovative
          edge); conflicting organizational pressures (i.e., functioning efficiently today while
          innovating effectively for tomorrow); problems associated with partial views of
          innovation; multiple barriers to innovation; how innovation can help increase performance;
          why it is important to work on many types of innovation simultaneously, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2003a</xref>). The gifted are

        <title>Courage: much needed but untrained talent</title>
        <p>Innovators are very courageous people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429412440651">Shavinina, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429412440651">2008</xref>). Courage is much needed for potential
          innovators. When they are about to implement great ideas into practice, and thus introduce
          breakthrough innovations that have not existed before and nobody can predict the response
          from markets, they should not be afraid to go ahead. Markets simply do not exist for
          revolutionary innovations. It is innovators who have to create them. They should thus be
          courageous enough to convince everyone around them that the market will exist. Akio Morita
          is a great example.</p>
        <p>When he—a co-founder and then Chairman of Sony—decided to develop the Walkman, he faced
          resistance. Nobody liked his idea. The Walkman appeared despite strong marketing input to
          suggest there was no demand for this product. The marketing department even resisted using
          the word ‘Walkman’, because it did not exist in the English language and sounded strange
          to English speakers. Morita’s intuition made the Walkman possible. At the peak of strong
          resistance to the idea of the Walkman, he threatened to leave the chairman position if
          Sony did not sell 100,000 Walkman in the first six months. Sony sold much more, and Morita
          was later awarded by a Royal Academy (UK) for his contributions to the development of
          English by introducing the words <italic>Sony</italic> and <italic>Walkman</italic>. He
          emphasized later that creativity ‘requires human thought, spontaneous intuition, and a lot
          of courage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440651">Morita, 1987</xref>:
          83).</p>
        <p>Nobody teaches today’s gifted to be courageous in pursuing their unique interests and
          implementing ideas into practice. This element of innovation education will thus fill an
          apparent niche in gifted education.</p>

        <title>Innovation education for today’s adults: the case of INNOCREX</title>
        <p>So far, innovation education for gifted children has been discussed. However, it should
          be accessible to all members of society. In this case the elements of innovation education
          should be slightly modified. INNOCREX (www.innocrex.com) is an example of such
          modification. Its mission is to develop adults’ abilities via a series of one-day
          workshops on creativity, innovation, excellence, managerial talent, entrepreneurial
          giftedness, practical intuition, and applied wisdom. Teachers working with gifted children
          find these workshops useful for their professional development. They learn important
          practical tools (for example, intuition and wisdom), which help them to channel their
          talent, motivate their students to be more creative, solve everyday problems in innovative
          ways, and perform professional activities at the level of excellence.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This article introduces innovation education as a new direction in gifted education. Its
        structure consists of 10 elements discussed above. The article emphasizes that giftedness is
        highly related to innovation and the economy. If gifted educators are concerned about the
        future of the gifted and the future of our world, then they have to focus on innovation
        education. Policy makers have an important role to play in helping educators and parents to
        achieve this goal. Successful realization of this goal will mean the fulfillment of one of
        the most important missions of any government: economic prosperity for all.</p>

          <p>Everyone would benefit from innovation education: the gifted and those individuals who
            were not identified as gifted. Innovation can come from any person in society. The

            “giftedness,” “talent,” and “high ability” are used interchangeably. They refer to
            individuals demonstrating extraordinary abilities and/or achievements in one or many

            they will innovate. Similarly, if the ultimate goal of gifted education is to produce
            innovators, and the majority of students do not become innovators, then it probably
            means that programs were not quite successful.</p>
