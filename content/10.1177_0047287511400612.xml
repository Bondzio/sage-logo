<abstract>
<p>The importance of the online travel search environment is well documented. In this context, trademarks play an instrumental role in resolving customer confusion in the search environment. An important element of the online search environment is the organic search output that is typically displayed on the left side of the search results screen on major search engines. This study evaluated the organic search listing performance in a U.S.-based search context of hotel trademarks (websites) on three search engines (Google, Yahoo! and MSN [later Bing]) across four countries (United States, United Kingdom, China, and India) over two separate time periods (years 2007 and 2009) for three tiers of lodging operation (economy, midscale, and upscale). Findings indicate that there are significant differences across countries, across lodging tiers and over time periods. The study draws attention for hoteliers to focus on website optimization and trademark control in the online information space.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Trademarks foster the flow of information in markets and enable sellers to create reliable manifestations for identification purposes and subsequently reduce search costs for consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400612">Dogan and Lemley 2004</xref>). On the Internet, the primary manifestation of a seller’s trademark is the website, which serves as a transactional gateway for consumers to seek direct access and buy products/services. In this context, hotels have also sought to bring consumers directly to their websites so as to enhance direct distribution and subsequently leverage greater control over inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400612">O’Connor 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On the Internet, websites are indexed by search engines such as using software popularly known as either spiders or crawlers. These indexes are built using proprietary algorithms and routines unique to individual search engines and serve as the information base for organic search output when users enter search queries. Organic here means the listings that are typically displayed on the left of the screen and are not paid for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287511400612">Ramos and Cota 2008</xref>). This is compared to paid search output that typically appears on the top and to the right of the screen output and is always paid for.</p>
<p>Significantly, not all hotel websites (manifestations of trademarks and used in the context of this study from here onwards throughout the paper) can be easily found on search engines when actively sought for. This can be attributed to a combination of technological factors and market characteristics as proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287511400612">Figure 1</xref>. Technological factors address the underlying sophistication of the search technology itself. For example, one search engine enjoys greater credibility in search primarily because of is superior search algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511400612">Xing and Lin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511400612">Telang, Rajan, and Mukhopadhyay 2004</xref>). Market characteristics because the quality of information retrieval is largely dependent on the nature of information indexed. The web is a large collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous documents where there is very little control over what people can publish on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511400612">Brin and Page 1998</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>At the technological level, the sophistication of underlying search ranking algorithms of search engines is instrumental in finding specific hotel websites. Also known as algorithm effectiveness, it highlights a search engine’s efficacy in satisfying the information needs of searchers served largely through crawling and indexing algorithms, the database index, and subsequently search and retrieval interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511400612">Xing and Lin 2006</xref>). Another measure of search engine efficacy is algorithm robustness, which reflects the ability of an algorithm to reduce noise and bias in search results and subsequently improve search rankings for relevant searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511400612">Xing and Lin 2006</xref>). At the website owner’s end, it is also up to hotel websites to be “search engine optimized,” which in turn has an impact on search ranking. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a combination of techniques deployed on a website’s code and design, which is aimed at improving its ranking in the organic search listings of search engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400612">Malaga 2008</xref>). Here, the level of e-commerce adoption by hotel operators is also a significant technological factor in determining the searchability of hotel websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400612">Dutta and Manaktola 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As for market characteristics, depending on the market in question, factors such as (1) the level of organization of the hotel industry, (2) relevance of trademark laws, and the (3) nature of supplier–intermediary relations potentially manifested through agreements between supplier (hotels) and intermediaries can also affect the performance of hotel websites in Internet search rankings. In the case of market organization, the U.S. lodging market is considered to have undergone significant consolidation and is relatively more mature when compared with markets in Europe and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511400612">Matovic and McCleary 2003</xref>). Greater consolidation combined with a relatively more refined market structure of the U.S. lodging industry means that the practices and the leverage of hotel trademarks are arguably more robust. In China and India, studies have found that online travel intermediaries literally crowd out popular hotels in generic keyword searches such as midscale hotels etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400612">Dutta and Manaktola 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511400612">Wu 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance of trademark laws is also important to address when viewing the extent to which firms protect and publish their online trademark manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400612">Dogan and Lemley 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511400612">Pink 2005</xref>). For example, in the United States and United Kingdom, courts have ruled in favor of trademark infringement when third-party trademarks are incorporated in one’s website code (tags, keywords, and descriptions) without relevant permissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400612">Coviello 2009</xref>). Ostensibly, countries where trademark laws are relatively relevant and reasonably up to date with the fast pace of change in the technological landscape are less likely to see abuse of trademarks on the Internet by intermediaries as opposed to those where trademark laws and governance are weak.</p>
<p>At the industry level, the nature of relationships as articulated through agreements between hotels and intermediaries regarding the use of trademarks on websites can also be a factor in determining the extent to which hotel trademarks perform in Internet search rankings when sought after directly. For instance, intermediaries can extract signed contracts from hotels so as to enable the integration of hotel trademarks onto the source codes of their own websites. This is largely possible in markets where the emphasis is more on indirect distribution (intermediaries) as opposed to going direct.</p>
<p>Therefore, when all three market related factors are combined, that is, an unorganized market, lack of relevance of trademark laws, and greater intermediary control of hotel room distribution, the performance of hotel websites in Internet search rankings will be negatively affected. How then are hotels performing with their trademarks in the organic search results of major search engines? Has the growth and maturity of search engines had an impact on the searchability of hotel websites? How does this vary at a national level as well as across the key segments of the lodging industry? Past research has addressed search engine results of hotel trademarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400612">O’Connor 2009</xref>), although the study was limited in sample size (90 hotels), and predominantly focused on paid search. While paid search is a fast-growing segment of the search engine business, several trade press reports indicate that organic search listings outperform paid search listings either in terms of what is clicked first (organic over paid), or for credibility purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511400612">iProspect 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400612">Hitwise 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the organic search listing performance of hotel trademarks (as manifested through their individual websites) along two separate time periods (2007 and 2009), in a multinational context (United States, United Kingdom, China, and India), and along the three prominent tiers of industry operations (economy, midscale and upscale). Findings highlight a key issue for lodging marketers to improve/refine their search optimization practices. Secondly, individual countries can articulate policies and legislations that reduce confusion for customers seeking to buy travel products online through effective trademark legislation and enforcement. The context of change between 2007 and 2009 provides added impetus to industry marketing professionals about the extent to which hotel searchability is gaining relevance on the Internet.</p>

<title>Travel Information Search</title>
<p>Information search is integral to the travel purchase decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287511400612">Vogt and Fesenmaier 1998</xref>) and in this context, travel websites serve as both informational and transactional gateways in the travel decision-making process (Beldona, Morrison, and O’Leary 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287511400612">Pan and Fesenmaier 2006</xref>). More specifically, hotel websites are essential information sources that highlight features, attributes, and amenities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511400612">Law and Hsu 2006</xref>). Given the ongoing battle for control over electronic room distribution between hotels and intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400612">Carvell and Quan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400612">Nayar and Beldona 2010</xref>), hotels have for long sought emphasis on direct distribution by enabling travelers to reserve directly on their own websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511400612">Jeong, Oh, and Gregoire 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511400612">Law and Hsu 2006</xref>). The importance of booking directly on the hotel websites is underscored by the emergence of strategies such as “best rates guaranteed” etc. that are aimed at luring value-based customers. Although results are mixed in terms of whether hotels have achieved greater leverage from these programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400612">Gazzoli, Kim, and Palakruthi 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400612">Demirciftci et al. 2010</xref>), the emphasis on direct distribution and greater inventory control is a priority for suppliers in the travel distribution network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400612">Nayar and Beldona 2010</xref>). Therefore, the ease of searchability of a hotel website in addition to its functional relevance as an informational/transactional resource influences hotels’ revenue performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400612">O’Connor 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400612">Kracht and Wang 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of Search Engines</title>
<p>Over the past 10 years, search engines have become essential components of the global, networked, digital infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287511400612">Rangaswamy, Giles, and Seres 2009</xref>, p. 59). Search engines serve as one of the primary “gateways” for travelers to access the online tourism domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287511400612">Xiang, Wober, and Fesenmaier 2008</xref>, p. 141). Trade press reports suggest that nearly 80% to 90% of all website traffic originates on generic search sites such as search engines and directories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400612">Law and Huang 2006</xref>). In addition to this, the ranking of the website in the search engine results is crucial for generating traffic and sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287511400612">Ramos and Cota 2008</xref>). One study goes to point that 68% of search engine users click a search result within the first page of search term’s organic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511400612">iProspect 2008</xref>). Specific to travel, novice web users are believed to begin their search for travel information on search engines such as Google (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400612">Buhalis and Law 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of search engines on any typical day in the United States has increased from 49% in 2002 to 69% in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511400612">Pew Internet Report 2008</xref>). In India, the use of search engine use increased from 35% to 75% of active Internet users from 2004 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511400612">IAMAI-IMRB 2008</xref>). Specific to China, the number of Chinese search engine users had reached 235 million, which is an increase of 54.49 million (34%) from 2008 to 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400612">China Report 2009</xref>). This is understandable given the evolution and expansion of search technologies in the recent years. For example, Google provides five formats of search, namely, text, images, local business through maps, mobile, and video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511400612">Google Inc. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As for the importance of organic search results, a majority of Internet users identified organic search results as the most relevant to their query (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511400612">iProspect 2008</xref>). In addition, it is also believed that users typically do not look past the first page of a search’s results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400612">Hitwise 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511400612">Lewis 2009</xref>). Therefore, being on the first page of search engine listings is imperative if the search term is directly seeking one’s hotel website. The analysis of click stream data indicates that people’s attention concentrates on the top portion, especially the first place, of the first page of search results amounting to 42.13% of the total clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511400612">Enquiro 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400612">2006b</xref>). This importance on organic search has spurred marketers to try to manipulate the software called spiders, which are used by search engines to crawl the web, classifying each page they encounter and adding it to its database that will subsequently list in search results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400612">O’Connor 2009</xref>). This underlies the importance of not only being in the first page of search engine listings, but also on top of the first page when it comes to a firm’s own trademarks.</p>
<p>There are two ways usually chosen by marketers: first, organic search engine optimization (SEO), and second, paid placement. In SEO, the website code is manipulated with keywords and related augmentations such that it represents itself accurately. Typically, these effects become visible after a few weeks although there is no guarantee that the website will rank on the top, and more so consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287511400612">Green 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511400612">Sen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400612">Evans 2007</xref>). The reason that there is no guarantee that a website will rank at the top of search listings based on one or many keywords is because search engine algorithms employ other parameters such as the number of external links etc. that establish a website’s credibility for the keyword(s) in question. Search engine algorithm technology for ranking websites based on keywords is extremely complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511400612">Sen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400612">Evans 2007</xref>). Complexity is compounded by competing websites with the same keywords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400612">O’Connor 2009</xref>) and to ensure consistent performance on the top of the results, the website needs to be continuously updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511400612">McKinsey 2007</xref>) and also generate traffic relevant to the keywords that have been architected to draw customers in. For example, Google is believed to have up to 200 signals (parameters) to establish rankings of websites based on keywords in organic search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511400612">Hansell 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287511400612">
<title>Legal Issues of Trademarks in Organic Search</title>
<p>Given that search engine technology is driven by keywords, which in turn can also be trademarks, the legal implications of use are significant. In organic search, the impact of trademark misuse typically stems from a nonowner incorporating trademarks that belong to third parties onto the software code of its website. More specifically, meta tags and title tags, which are key descriptions of a webpage that spiders draw information from are filled with keywords representing third party trademarks. For example, an online travel intermediary can include trademarks of established brands in its website code so as to appear higher in the rankings, thereby compromising the ranking of the website that actually owns the trademark. In the United States, this is legally protected under the “initial interest confusion” doctrine, from which trademark dilution is a typical consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511400612">Pink 2005</xref>). Put differently, a consumer’s frustration with finding a specific trademark will result in confusion of the search environment because intermediaries have integrated this trademark into their website codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400612">Dogan and Lemley 2004</xref>). In such cases, search engines do not serve as gatekeepers of such illegal acts and almost always ask affected trademark owners to directly contact the website(s) engaging in such practices (Coviello 2008).</p>
<p>In the hotel information search context, initial interest confusion for consumers can take place either through transactional intermediaries or informational intermediaries such as destination marketing organizations, convention and visitor bureaus, travel blogs, and related consumer-generated media. Often, travel websites serve in both capacities (transactional and informational), for example, TripAdvisor. In many scenarios, the “initial interest confusion” is itself negated because the rich amount of information can actually enrich the consumer’s decision making. For example, a consumer looking for a particular hotel enters a search query only to see reviews of the property on review sites at the top of the search rankings. Using this information, the consumer makes a more informed choice. However, this does not diminish the importance of hotels to have greater control over organic search results given that it is their own trademark. Put differently, the greater ranking of a hotel’s own website when consumers seek information directly about it is a reflection of the trademark’s efficacy.</p>
<sec id="section5-0047287511400612">
<title>Hotel Websites and Direct Distribution</title>
<p>A hotel trademark’s efficacy also depends on the extent to which it can draw consumers to its site to book directly. Recent developments such as the <italic>Expedia vs. Choice</italic> standoff highlights potential conflicts as hotels and online travel agencies/intermediaries (OTAs) seek to wrest/retain control of hotel room direct distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287511400612">PhocusWright Connect 2009</xref>). Hotels and intermediaries have been engaged in price wars for some time and hoteliers have gradually ceded control of their inventory availability and pricing to OTAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400612">Carroll and Siguaw 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287511400612">Miller 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287511400612">Tso and Law 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400612">Carroll and Siguaw (2003)</xref> emphasize the need for hotels to buck the trend of commoditization wherein price becomes the main (or only) consideration for booking a room. Trade press estimates indicate that in the United States, hotels have conceded nearly 10% of their distribution share to online intermediaries between 2007 and 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287511400612">Starkov 2009</xref>). In addition, OTAs, such as Expedia, Hotwire, Priceline, and Travelocity all have slightly increased their share of search traffic, with Expedia capturing 26% of all search traffic, including both paid and organic on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287511400612">Drew 2008</xref>). The significance of these trends indicates the importance for hotel websites to appear high in search listings when actively sought for.</p>

<sec id="section6-0047287511400612">
<title>Market Maturity and E-commerce Trends</title>
<p>The state of organization of the lodging industry and its market characteristics also plays a role in determining the relative efficacy of hotel trademarks. Upscale hotels seek greater prominence in the Internet marketplace primarily because of the enhanced positioning of their offerings. While the same can be said of midscale hotels (albeit to a marginally lesser extent), economy hotels have relatively fewer resources to expend into SEO practices at large. In the case of the United States, the lodging industry is relatively more organized along franchised and independent hotel lines. Given this state of consolidation, brands are well organized along tiers (economy, midscale, and upscale). Also, hotels that are largely franchised are better represented through websites with transactional capabilities to book rooms directly from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511400612">Wu 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the industry is relatively less organized in China and India when it comes to electronic distribution through the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511400612">Hsu, Zhub, and Agrusac 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400612">Dabas and Manaktola 2007</xref>). In the case of China, findings indicate that domestic brand hotels do not use the Internet to its full potential as opposed to international brand hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511400612">Wu 2008</xref>). An earlier study comparing Mainland China hotels with Hong Kong hotels also showed that hotel websites of Mainland China performed relatively lower than Hong Kong hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400612">Huang and Law 2003</xref>). In the case of India, despite the limited amount of research pertaining to the country, findings show that midscale hotels depend more on traditional distribution channels (global distribution systems, call center, etc.) as opposed to leveraging the direct interactive capabilities of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400612">Dabas and Manaktola 2007</xref>). Another more recent study found that not a single midscale hotel in the New Delhi market appeared on the first page of the search engine’s results based on generic keywords (not trademarks) and that only wholesalers (intermediaries) occupied all this space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400612">Dutta and Manaktola 2009</xref>). Also, India’s economy segment has been less organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400612">Dutta and Manaktola 2009</xref>) when compared with the United States and to some extent the United Kingdom, and the same can be said of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511400612">Wu 2008</xref>). Arguably, therefore, there is room to contend that the maturity levels of the three tiers vary significantly across the four countries.</p>
<p>The following research questions served as signposts for the larger objective of this paper. First, given the rapid pace of technological change, one has to prevail that there have been significant developments in search engine technologies from 2007 and 2009. Add to this, search engine optimization as a practice has gained prominence over the years. Therefore:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In the first step of the sampling procedure, major online travel intermediaries from each country were identified, from which 300 brands (100 from each tier) were drawn. Subsequently, a stratified random sampling procedure was adopted, wherein every second hotel brand was picked from the initial data pool, which in turn resulted in 150 hotel brands (50 each from the three tiers) from each country. The category of each hotel website was clarified by either visiting their websites or validating the same from external sources. Note that although the two samples comprised the same hotel websites in 2007 and 2009, the brands across the four countries were not the same. Each country had its own representative sample for each tier of operation as described below.</p>
<p>The final sample comprised 50 hotel brands from three prominent lodging tiers (3 = economy, midscale, and upscale) across four countries (United States, United Kingdom, India, and China). This was done across the two years (2007 and 2009). Therefore, the overall sample used for the study was 1,200 (50 × 3 × 4 × 2 = 1,200). The sample outline detailing the search engines used is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287511400612">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>According to research from ComScore, in 2007, Google was the world’s most popular search engine, with a global average usage share of 65.0%, followed by Yahoo! and MSN (19.6% and 8.40%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511400612">ComScore Report 2009</xref>). These three search engines were identified to conduct searches. In 2009, the rankings of the search engines in terms of market share remained largely the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511400612">ComScore Report 2009</xref>). One change was that MSN’s Live was changed to Bing, which can still be accessed through old web address.</p>
<p>Data were collected in two stages: the first collection was in October 2007; the second time was in August 2009. Hotel brands were used as keywords and put into the three search engines in four countries. Researchers observed the first page of search results only. The ranking of the hotel brands’ websites were then recorded. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400612">Table 2</xref> outlines sample search queries used pertinent to each lodging segment across the four countries. Also, when any Online Travel Agency (OTA) appeared higher than the hotel brand website on the first page, the rankings of both the hotel brand website and the OTA appearing first were recorded. The same procedure was followed exactly in 2009. Note that data were collected from researchers based in the Northeastern United States. Search engine results typically vary based on the region from where the search was conducted. Therefore, it is imperative to note that the study prevails within the context of U.S.-based travel information seekers only.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Three categorical variables, namely, country (four levels: United States, United Kingdom, China and India), year (two levels: 2007 and 2009) and lodging tier (three levels: economy, midscale, and upscale) comprised the independent factors of analysis.</p>
<p>A hotel website’s rank in a search query based on a search of its trademark comprised the dependent measure of the study. There was a separate dependent measure for each of the three search engines (Google, Yahoo! and MSN). When a hotel’s website did not show up on the first page of the search results, a score of 0 was assigned. Subsequently, a hotel that appeared first on the organic search listing was given a score of 10; the second rank was given a score of 9, third rank was given a score of 8, etc. Hence, the coding system was developed wherein greater the number allocated for analysis, higher was the rank that the website earned on the organic search listing. Note that a search engine’s organic search results typically comprise 10 in each page. Going by the notion that the first page is the most important in a search engine’s results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400612">Hitwise 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511400612">Lewis 2009</xref>), only the first page’s results were used in the analysis.</p>
<p>An alternative analysis was conducted primarily to ascertain the relative positioning of hotel websites with OTAs. Here, a dichotomous variable with codes 1 or 0 was created (1 = Hotel Website Higher in Rank Compared to 1st OTA, and 0 = OTA Ranked Higher Compared to Hotel Website). This score for each of the three search engines was averaged, and if the mean was greater than or equal to 0.50, it was coded as 1 meaning that the aggregate rank of the hotel website across the three search engines was greater than that of OTAs. Alternately, if the mean score was less than 0.50 across the three search engines, it was coded as 0 meaning that the aggregate rank of the hotel website across the three search engines was lesser than that of OTAs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0047287511400612">
<title>Statistical Method</title>
<p>Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) was used to compare groups formed by categorical independent variables (country, year, and lodging segment) on group differences in a set of three interval-dependent variables (organic search listing on Google, Yahoo! and MSN). Multivariate GLM keeps the Type I error rate down when dealing with multiple dependent variables that are somewhat correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287511400612">Weinfurt 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400612">Garson 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To ascertain the relative positioning of hotel websites in comparison with OTA, simple cross tabulations were conducted between the dichotomous variable (1 = Hotel Website Higher in Rank Compared to 1st OTA, and 0 = OTA Ranked Higher Compared to Hotel Website) and the categorical variables of country, year, and lodging tier.</p>

<p>The first main effect comprised the year variable (2007 and 2009). Findings indicate that there are significant differences in organic search listings performance between 2007 and 2009 at large. Univariate statistics indicate significant differences across all three search engines here. The second factor that comprised the main effect (country = 4 levels) showed the strongest significant differences, which is also evident from the partial eta-squared value, which stands for practical significance. This value of .147 (nearly 15% of the variance) is the highest across all other factors. Significant differences between lodging tiers was also strongly evidenced across all three search engines.</p>
<p>Factor 4 addressed enhancements in search listing performances over the two years across the four countries, and here too there were significant differences. This is also visually supported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511400612">Figure 2</xref>. Note, however, that the practical significance value here is relatively low (.015). The reason for this can be attributed to significant changes in Yahoo! and MSN, but lack of significance in Google search listings. Factor 5 sought significant differences based on the lodging tier over the two years. Although this was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt;.01 level, its practical significance value was below .01 at .008, and so it was not considered in the realm of valid differences. One can surmise here that all three tiers have improved in their search listing performance. Here again, the difference was not prevailing with Google based on univariate results.</p>

<p>Factor 6 (lodging tier × country) indicated significant differences across all three search engines. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287511400612">Figure 3</xref> that highlights the visual plots of mean scores. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287511400612">Figure 3</xref>, on Google, the United States reported marginal differences based on the tier of operation. In comparison, China reported the greatest differences between lodging tiers. Upscale hotels in China reported significantly higher levels of searchability over their counterparts in the midscale and economy tiers. In United Kingdom, the differences were evenly spaced out on Google and Yahoo! but when it came to MSN, there were no differences between midscale and upscale hotels, but both these tiers were noticeably higher than economy tier. In India, upscale and midscale hotels reported considerable distance to economy while trivial difference between each other. Lastly, with Factor 7, where the search listing performance of three lodging tiers in four countries between two years was evaluated, the difference was not significant.</p>

<p>In the second phase of the analysis, the relative positioning of hotel websites compared to OTAs was conducted. Cross tabulations and the resultant percentages are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287511400612">Figures 4</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0047287511400612">5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287511400612">Figure 4</xref> is a visual representation of percentages wherein hotels were found to be higher than OTAs in the search listings. Among all, the United States represented the best performance, with 100% of hotel brand websites listing higher than OTAs in 2007 but followed by a marginal decline by 4% in 2009, that is, 4% of OTAs listed higher than the hotel brand websites when searched with the brand name as the keyword in search engines. As for the United Kingdom, 78% of hotel websites were ahead of OTAs in 2007 when sought for by their brand names. This figure increased to 93% in 2009. In contrast, India and China reported significantly lower levels of performance when compared with the United States and United Kingdom. India however improved from 55% in 2007 to 68% in 2009 as opposed to China, where an actual decrease was observed in hotel trademark performance, from 29% in 2007 to 28% in 2009.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0047287511400612">Figure 5</xref>, the relative positioning of hotel websites when compared with OTAs across the three hotel tiers between two time periods is illustrated. In addition to the stable increase of the organic search engine performance versus OTAs when it comes from the economic/budget tier all the way to the full-service tier, each tier presents an observable improvement from 2007 to 2009, among which the economic/budget tier represents the highest improvement. However, the full-service tier still retains the best performance either with or without taking OTAs into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0047287511400612" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>First, the United States has the highest organic search listings performance of hotel brand websites compared to the United Kingdom, China, and India. Also, this did not change significantly from 2007 to 2009 across all the three search engines when compared with the other three countries. While this highlights greater market organization, greater relevance of trademark laws, as well as finer practices of search engine optimization in the United States most certainly, one should be mindful that the searches were conducted in United States itself. To some extent, it is possible that given Google’s origin in the United States and the resultant familiarity of the search engine with its parent market, resulted in greater levels of searchability compared to countries outside its origin.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the incremental performance of hotel websites in search rankings is palpable across all three search engines studied here. India reported greater improvements on Google and MSN (later Bing), but significantly greater when it came to Yahoo! Lastly, China reported the lowest level of organic search listing performance across both years when compared to the remaining three countries, although they did show significant improvements in performances between the two years across three search engines. In China’s case, one cannot but revert to the heterogeneity of documents and how this may have (to some extent at least) affected searchability from Chinese websites. For example, the Chinese language uses a logographic system wherein concepts develop meaning from a collection of symbols and, subsequently, English-language search engines need to adapt to this script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511400612">Luk and Kwok 2002</xref>). In addition, it has been argued that structure of the Internet in terms of inbound and outbound links as well as the heterogeneity in web design across multiple provinces that are culturally unique render English-language–based search engines less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287511400612">Yu, Li, and Manning 2006</xref>). In fact, this is the central argument over Google’s lack of market leadership in China, where a search engine (Baidu) developed specifically for the Chinese market leads in overall market share of close to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511400612">Chen 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Needless to say, a palpable aspect of the findings is the relatively high maturity of Google’s search engine performance when compared with Yahoo! and MSN. In academic terms, Google’s performance in <italic>algorithm effectiveness</italic> and <italic>algorithm robustness</italic> was significantly better compared to Yahoo! and MSN (later Bing). Needless to say, the search engine market is growing, with nearly several formats of search evolving such as spatial search, visual search, semantic search, etc. This will in turn affect the search for hotels and subsequently how hotels leverage direct distribution capabilities. For instance, Google is considering the implementation of hotel search results through maps with prices of hotels as and when users enter queries related to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400612">Parr 2010</xref>). This in turn further improves direct distribution potential for hotels and subsequently emphasizes the importance over how hotels seek this direct leverage using search engines.</p>
<p>When taking OTAs into the comparison across four countries or three hotel tiers, the results are moderately significant. Among four countries, the United States represents the highest level of organic search listing performance versus OTAs, with China having the lowest level. When it comes to the comparison across the three hotel tiers, the full-service tier reports better performance than the midscale tier, followed by the economy/budget tiers. Although the United States showed a marginal 4% decline in 2009 when compared with 2007, it ranked first when compared with the remaining three countries. The United Kingdom and India both reported relatively remarkable increases in hotel searchability from 2007 to 2009.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, China’s lodging sector reported the lowest level of performance when compared with OTAs. This can be attributed to the relatively thriving intermediary sector combined with the relatively less organized midscale and economy tiers in the country. According to the Chinese Tourism and Hotel Association (CTHA), by 2002, there were 8,880 star-rated hotels in China, of which only 1.97% were five-star hotels and 7.15% were four-star hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511400612">CTHA 2010</xref>). In addition, there are thousands of hotels without stars in China. For example, there were 4,452 unrated hotels in China in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511400612">Pine and Phillips 2005</xref>). Most of the unrated hotels and low-rated hotels such as one-star, two-star, and three-star rated hotels are with limited sizes, for example, fewer than 99 rooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511400612">Pine and Phillips 2005</xref>). Most of these small hotels either do not have their own websites or are not optimized because of enhanced intermediary control over Internet-based distribution. In contrast, in addition to certain major national OTAs, almost each city in China has several OTAs that cover online hotel bookings for most of the hotels in that city. Besides, unlike the United States, the travel agencies, both physical and virtual, retain greater importance in the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Marketers and policy makers in China and India need to put the findings in perspective for marketing purposes. On one hand, trademark laws need to be tightened to ensure that intermediaries do not significantly encroach into the travel information space and subsequently cause confusion for travelers seeking specific hotels. This leads to greater confusion in the minds of buyers and subsequently serves as a deterrent in converting browsers to buyers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400612">Matzler and Waiguny 2005</xref>). Hotels need to understand that weaker searchability of websites weakens the relationship between the supplier and the customer at the prepurchase stage. If intermediaries occupy much of the virtual space of hotel brands, the loss of trademark control on the Internet can lead to faster commoditization of the product category at large.</p>
<p>The study’s findings are useful for hotel practitioners and academic researchers to better understand the trend of the organic search listing performance development. From the view of the industry, this article serves as a reminder to hotels to examine their websites management and as to how their trademarks are being used. This is more important given the ensuing battle for customer control taking place between hotels and online intermediaries. Websites of hotels have to be increasingly responsive to searches from customers who seek to book directly. Put differently, hotels need to make the best of enhancing direct distribution efforts, leverage loyalty programs, and subsequently increase the profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400612">Gazzoli, Kim, and Palakurthi 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of this research can also help hoteliers to identity their positions in the website SEO and trademark protection campaign. Academically, this research presents the important truth in terms of organic searching listing performance at a typical point of time after 20 years of development of the Internet in hospitality and tourism industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400612">Buhalis and Law 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>For the most part, every study has its share of limitations. This one is not different. One limitation of the study is that the analysis comprised only the first page of the search results. However, extending the measure to more pages would have given only a marginally more detailed perspective given the importance of the first page in the search results. In addition, the study was less about the <italic>process</italic> of travel information search and more about the searchability of trademarks, which is why the first page’s results were largely decided upon.</p>
<p>Second, the study is a review of the results only collected from one geographical zone (the United States). Although the context of the study was travel information seekers from the United States, search results vary based on the geographic location of where the search is being conducted. More importantly, heterogeneity in scripts (Chinese scripts, for example) and web structure need to be accounted for especially when taking into consideration cross-national differences. Future studies can investigate this across multiple geographic contexts.</p>
<p>Lastly, while it can be argued that online travel information seekers use generic keywords more as opposed to hotel brands as keywords, this study’s scope was limited to performance of hotel trademarks when actively sought. Future research can expand into the context of generic keywords and build on the findings of this study.</p>
