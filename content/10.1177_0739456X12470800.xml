<p>What is the role of entrepreneurship in urban and regional economic development? Does entrepreneurship lead to economic growth and productivity gains? If so, how and in what ways do new firms contribute to a region’s economic development? And why are some regions more entrepreneurial than others? In short, what do we know about entrepreneurship and its role in the process of economic renewal and change? A new book edited by Zoltan Acs, professor at George Mason University and director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy, sheds light on these questions. <italic>Entrepreneurship and Regional Development</italic> is a compilation of already published articles and papers in the emerging field of entrepreneurship studies. Seminal research by scholars such as Michael Porter, Allen Scott, Ed Malecki, Timothy Bartik, Olav Sorenson, David Audretsch, Paul Reynolds, Maryann Feldman, and Richard Florida was compiled for this book, which students and scholars can use much like a research handbook or reference book. This reviewer finds this book very useful because it presents a range of arguments and evidence for questions that are central nowadays around the associations between technological change, knowledge creation, and economic growth.</p>
<p>Most of the book’s contributions fit into the paradigm of new growth theory, which treats technological change, innovation, and entrepreneurship as endogenous. In particular, entrepreneurship is seen as an endogenous economic force and entrepreneurs are understood as “agents of change and growth in a market economy and they can act to accelerate the generation, dissemination and application of innovative ideas. . . . Entrepreneurs not only seek out and identify potentially profitable economic opportunities but are also willing to take risks to see if their hunches are right” (OECD definition cited on p. 128). Unlike capital and labor, factors like innovation, knowledge, and resulting new firm creation are inherent to economic change. Yet, traditional neoclassical theories of economic growth treat them as exogenous and therefore cannot explain long-run economic expansion. Essentially, such neoclassical growth theories fall short in trying to explain why certain regions continue to be economically successful even if traditional economic accounts would predict decreasing marginal productivity and a resulting equalization of factor productivities. This is where new economic growth theory is helpful because it assumes increasing returns to scale, particularly as a result of knowledge creation and innovation. Entrepreneurship is seen as a way through which these innovations are exploited and utilized economically.</p>
<p>The book is divided into eight parts and the contributions represent overview articles that introduce the reader to the topic, theory papers that provide the conceptual basis, papers that present empirical evidence, and one chapter with policy suggestions. Together the contributions help the reader understand entrepreneurship from a variety of perspectives. The key findings of the book can be summarized as follows: Entrepreneurship is a spatially uneven process and there are regions that are more entrepreneurial than others. Entrepreneurial regions generally have a large advantage over others because the opportunities that enable individuals to take risks and start ventures vary across regions (contributions by Bartik, Reynolds et al., Stuart and Sorenson, and Acs and Armington in Part III). Why are some regions more entrepreneurial than others? First, clusters of industrial activity can encourage entrepreneurship because they offer lower barriers to entry for entrepreneurs (Porter). Second, these regions are better endowed with entrepreneurial capital (e.g., individuals who take risks, an entrepreneurial milieu, networks, social acceptance of entrepreneurship, financiers and investors) and are therefore able to foster new firm creation (Audretsch and Keilbach). Third, these regions use entrepreneurship as a conduit for knowledge spillovers; economic opportunities are realized through this conduit (Acs et al.). In addition, successful regions have started to be on a successful path of development a long time ago, indicating the importance of long-term influences (Audretsch and Fritsch). Regions that have more new firms also show higher levels of productivity (Holtz-Eakin and Kao). However, higher death rates among firms are not related to productivity growth, therefore indicating that Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction might not be associated with productivity gains. There can also be the wrong kind of entrepreneurship, which may lead to zero or even negative growth (Mueller et al.). This may be the case when individuals are incentivized to start entrepreneurial ventures even though they do not have the right type of skills and when the right type of market opportunities are missing. The book presents some additional caveats: Audretsch and Fritsch show that regions differ in terms of their economic growth patterns and as a result they find that there are four different kinds of growth regimes. Among them are regions that have high levels of startup activity (a so-called entrepreneurial regime), regions with high levels of entrepreneurial activity but below the median employment growth (a so-called revolving door regime), regions that have a below the median entrepreneurial rate but a relatively high growth rate (i.e., a routinized regime), and regions that are downsizing (i.e., a downsizing regime). This implies that there are many different possible ways to develop economically. In sum, the book highlights the importance of entrepreneurship as a mechanism to transfer and put to use knowledge and innovation. This process, however, is highly dependent on the nature of the environment. The more specific resources that are available—mostly associated with urban environments—the better these transfers work.</p>
<p>The book’s main contribution lies in the richness of the theoretical discussion and the in-depth presentation of sound empirical results. Readers will be able to cross-reference the papers and draw from the contributions in a variety of ways. The book, however, also prompted a few questions and critical observations. First, the book presents insights into the phenomenon of entrepreneurship as it unfolds in the urban context. Therefore, the results seem to be confined to the perspective of metropolitan agglomerations. Yet, this reviewer found herself asking the question about the validity of the insights for rural areas, for declining regions or for restructuring cities. In what ways can we understand entrepreneurship in these different geographic contexts? While the book provides a fantastic account of entrepreneurship as a conduit for knowledge spillovers and, therefore, as a catalyst for economic growth, the reader will not have gained a deeper understanding about the limitations of entrepreneurship, particularly as they arise at different geographic scales and circumstances. Second, the policy recommendations are confined to one chapter (a working paper developed jointly by a range of scholars and the Kauffman Foundation). Planning scholars and practitioners might expect more and may be disappointed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Acs compiled an impressive amount of knowledge about the connections between entrepreneurship and urban and regional economic development. The book combines contributions from the best thinkers in the field of entrepreneurship studies and it is a must read for every scholar and student interested in the topic. The book might be useful for graduate classes on the topic of entrepreneurship and economic development. Unfortunately, the high price will preclude students from buying this book. The book’s main contributions to knowledge and planning scholarship lie in the wealth of insights it presents on the questions why and in what ways the formation of new firms contributes to regional economic success. Economic developers, planning practitioners, and scholars need to know the answers to these questions in order to develop sound policies that support entrepreneurship.</p>
