<sec id="section1-0363546512462677">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Rotator cuff repair has a relatively high (20%-90%) chance of retears. Patients with an intact rotator cuff 6 months after surgery have better subjective and objective outcomes at 6 months and 2 years after rotator cuff repair than those who do not have an intact repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512462677">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine if, and if so which, intraoperative factors predict an intact repair 6 months after rotator cuff repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512462677">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512462677">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The study consisted of a cohort of 500 consecutive patients who had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair performed by a single surgeon and an ultrasound evaluation using standard protocols of the repair 6 months after surgery. Exclusion criteria included previous fracture or shoulder surgery, incomplete or partial rotator cuff repair, and concomitant arthroplasty. Rotator cuff tear size was measured intraoperatively and mapped. The quality of the tendon, tendon mobility, and repair quality were assessed and ranked based on predetermined scales (1-4) and recorded on a specifically designed form. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with cuff integrity at 6-month follow-up as the dependent variable and tear/repair factors as the independent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512462677">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The overall postoperative retear rate was 19% at 6 months. The best predictor of rotator cuff integrity was preoperative tear size (correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic> = 0.33; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Patients with small (≤2 cm<sup>2</sup>) rotator cuff tears were least likely to have retears (retear rate, 10%). As the tear size increased, the retear rate increased in a linear fashion: ≤2 cm<sup>2</sup> (10%), 2 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup> (16%), 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup> (31%), 6 to 8 cm<sup>2</sup> (50%), and &gt;8 cm<sup>2</sup> (57%). Other surgeon-ranked intraoperative assessments did correlate with retears, but the correlations were relatively weak: repair quality (<italic>r</italic> = −0.17; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), tendon mobility (<italic>r</italic> = −0.15; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and tendon quality (<italic>r</italic> = −0.14; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Regression analysis showed that the retear rate at 6-month follow-up was best predicted from the preoperative tear size and the surgeon-ranked repair quality: chance of retear = 0.38 + (0.02 × tear size in cm<sup>2</sup>) – (0.08 × repair quality). Tendon quality and tendon mobility did not contribute significantly to this prediction.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546512462677">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Tear size was the best intraoperative predictor of repair integrity after rotator cuff repair, with tears less than 2 cm<sup>2</sup> twice as likely to heal than tears greater than 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Rotator cuff retears after repair are associated with inferior shoulder function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512462677">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512462677">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462677">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512462677">25</xref></sup> There have, however, been very few studies that have identified and quantified possible factors that predict rotator cuff integrity after repair. Several studies have suggested that preoperative tear size and age are important predictors of rotator cuff integrity after repair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512462677">‡</xref></sup> However, the cohort numbers of these studies were often small (less than 100, with the largest being 210), and the rotator cuff integrity at follow-up was either not the primary outcome measure or there was not a systematic analysis of the relationship between cuff integrity and potential predictive factors. Oh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512462677">21</xref></sup> demonstrated the predictive role of fatty degeneration in the rotator cuff muscles; however, the study was limited by a relatively small cohort size. Gladstone et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462677">11</xref></sup> demonstrated that although fatty atrophy of the cuff muscles was related to poor shoulder function, it did not predict cuff integrity. The aim of this study was to determine if, and if so which, intraoperative factors predict an intact repair 6 months after rotator cuff repair.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512462677">
<title>Study Design and Patient Selection</title>
<p>The study was a retrospective cohort study; the primary outcome measure was rotator cuff integrity at 6-month follow-up. Ethics approval was obtained from the South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service, Human Research and Ethics Committee–Central Network.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for the study were (1) arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by the senior author (G.A.C.M.) and (2) repairs performed using Opus Magnum metallic knotless suture anchors (ArthroCare Corp, Sydney, Australia) between January 2006 and February 2009. Exclusion criteria were (1) partial or incomplete cuff repairs, (2) inability to have an ultrasound evaluation of the shoulder at the 6-month visit, (3) previous surgery to the shoulder or redo of the rotator cuff repairs, (4) ipsilateral grade 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) glenohumeral osteoarthritis, (5) a concomitant shoulder fracture, and (6) isolated subscapularis repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512462677">
<title>Surgical Technique and Rehabilitation</title>
<p>The surgical methods for repairing rotator cuff tears arthroscopically using knotless anchors have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462677">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512462677">26</xref></sup> In brief, repairs were performed with the patient in a beach-chair position under interscalene block. The arthroscope was inserted into the glenohumeral joint through a standard posterior portal, a lateral portal was created, and the torn tendon was visualized and repaired from its undersurface (undersurface repairs). Alternatively, after the evaluation of the glenohumeral joint, the arthroscope was directed into the subacromial space, and the torn supraspinatus tendon was visualized and repaired from its bursal side (bursal side repair). The torn tendon was grasped with an Opus SmartStitch Suture Device (ArthroCare Corp), which would deliver 1 inverted mattress suture to the tendon per grasp. Both strands of the suture exited above the tendon, creating a tension band effect. An anchor hole was then punched on the greater tuberosity of the humerus with a T-handle through the lateral port. Both limbs of the mattress suture were then passed into the anchor (Opus Magnum Knotless Implant, ArthroCare Corp), and the anchor was inserted into the prepunched hole and deployed. Finally, the TensionLock winding mechanism (ArthroCare Corp) was used to wind the suture through the anchor, reduce the tendon onto the bone, and lock the suture in the anchor in a knotless manner. The whole procedure was repeated if more anchors were required as a result of a larger tear. In these cases, all mattress sutures were usually placed in a single row in the tendon in an anterior-posterior orientation. Sutures were usually placed prior to anchor placement and deployment.</p>
<p>Patients were discharged on the same day, and the operated arm was placed in a sling with a small abduction pillow, for example, the UltraSling (DJO, Vista, California). The patients were initially started on pendulum exercises. At the 2-week postoperative follow-up, the patients were introduced to passive external rotation range of motion exercises. At the 6-week postoperative visit, active range of motion and simple isometric strengthening exercises were initiated. Finally, at the 3-month follow-up, the patients were allowed to proceed to free overhead-throwing activities and lifting 5 kg or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512462677">26</xref></sup>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Preoperative rotator cuff tear size was measured intraoperatively under direct arthroscopic visualization and mapped based on the size of the head of the shaver used, which was either 4.0 mm or 5.5 mm. The area of the torn cuff was calculated by multiplying the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior dimensions of the tear and expressed in cm<sup>2</sup>. The quality of the tendon (1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, 4 = excellent), tissue mobility (1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, 4 = excellent), and quality of repair (1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, 4 = excellent) were assessed intraoperatively and scored as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512462677">Table 1</xref> and recorded on a standardized form.</p>

<p>The repair was considered to be weak when sutures used to pull the torn tendon to the greater tuberosity were insecure and be easily pulled out and the tendon was difficult to mobilize to the landing site. Repair was considered strong when the repair was robust, when the tendon was easily attached to the landing site, and the sutures were unlikely to be pulled out when the shoulder was placed through a range of motion intraoperatively.</p>
<p>All patients were followed up at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Six-month follow-up was chosen as studies have shown that the clinical outcomes do not demonstrate significant changes thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462677">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462677">19</xref></sup> Ultrasound evaluations of rotator cuff integrity were made for all patients at the 6-month visit. Ultrasonography was carried out with a General Electric Logiq 9 (GE Healthcare, Sydney, Australia) using a 12-MHz linear transducer by an experienced sonographer (L.B.) following standardized protocols as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512462677">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462677">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462677">19</xref></sup> Retears were defined as a full-thickness defect in the supraspinatus tendon that could be smaller or larger than the original tear. The medial-lateral and anterior-posterior dimensions of the tear size were measured and recorded on a standardized form.</p>

<sec id="section11-0363546512462677">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed using SigmaStat version 3.5 and SigmaPlot version 10.0 (Systat Software Inc, Richmond, California). Correlations were tested using the Spearman rank-order correlation for each of the independent variables (preoperative tear size, age, tendon quality, and mobility, as well as repair quality) against the rotator cuff integrity at 6 months. Stepwise forward and backward regression analyses were used to determine the relative significance of each of the independent variables in contributing to the cuff integrity at 6 months. Regression analysis was also used to establish a mathematical equation for predicting the likelihood of the rotator cuff retear rate at 6 months.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period (between January 2006 and February 2009), 722 rotator cuff repairs were performed. Of these, 667 repairs were performed using the Opus Magnum knotless anchor. A total of 167 patients were excluded on the basis of the exclusion criteria: 14 patients were excluded because of previous shoulder surgery or redo of rotator cuff repair, 22 were excluded for incomplete or partial cuff repairs, 38 were excluded for moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the shoulder, 10 were excluded for isolated subscapularis repair, 1 patient was excluded because of a greater tuberosity fracture, and 82 patients were excluded because they were lost to follow-up or no ultrasound was performed at 6 months. The remaining 500 patients form the study cohort.</p>
<p>Of 500 rotator cuff repairs that form the study cohort, 308 repairs were for the right shoulder (62%). The mean ± standard deviation age of patients enrolled in the study was 60 ± 11 years (range, 28-89). The number of patients who were found to have a retear in their rotator cuff as demonstrated by the 6-month ultrasound was 94, corresponding to an overall retear rate of 19%.</p>
<sec id="section13-0363546512462677">
<title>Correlation</title>
<p>The preoperative tear size had the largest positive correlation with retears of the repaired cuff at 6 months, with the correlation coefficient being .33 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Age also demonstrated a moderate positive correlation, with the correlation coefficient being .23 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>There was a weak negative correlation for the tendon quality (correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic> = −0.14; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), tendon mobility (<italic>r</italic> = −0.15; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and repair quality (<italic>r</italic> = −0.17; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) with rotator cuff integrity at 6 months. Lower (poorer) intraoperative scores were associated with a higher rate of rotator cuff retears.

<title>Multivariate Regression Analysis</title>
<p>Forward stepwise regression was then performed using the 6-month rotator cuff integrity (tear vs no tear) as the independent variable and tendon quality, tendon mobility, repair quality, preoperative tear size, and age as the dependent variables. Preoperative tear size was the most significant factor in predicting cuff integrity at 6 months (<italic>F</italic>-to-enter value = 45; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Age of the patient was the next most significant predictor (<italic>F</italic>-to-enter = 14; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) followed by repair quality (<italic>F</italic>-to-enter = 5.1; <italic>P</italic> = .02). Tendon quality (<italic>F</italic>-to-enter = 0.9; <italic>P</italic> = .33) and tendon mobility (<italic>F</italic>-to-enter = 2.1; <italic>P</italic> = .15) did not contribute significantly to the prediction of the cuff integrity at 6 months.</p>
<p>Similar findings were also obtained when backward stepwise regression was performed using the same independent and dependent variables. Preoperative tear size (<italic>F</italic>-to-remove value = 23.5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), age (<italic>F</italic>-to-remove = 12.6; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and repair quality (<italic>F</italic>-to-remove = 5.1; <italic>P</italic> = .02) were the 3 significant variables that remained in the regression analysis.</p>

<p>The predictions made by the latter equation were not statistically significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = .08) from those made by the equation containing just 2 independent variables (preoperative tear size and repair quality). Different values could be used as end points to indicate the possibility of cuff retears, although a value of .2 had the most diagnostic accuracy. When .2 is used, the likelihood ratio of the first equation = 4 (sensitivity = 68%, specificity = 83%), and the likelihood ratio of the second equation = 3.7 (sensitivity = 74%, specificity = 80%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that preoperative tear size was the most significant factor in predicting rotator cuff integrity after repair. Patient age and surgeon-ranked repair quality were the next important predicting factors. Surgeon-determined rotator cuff tendon quality and tissue mobility were not significant predictors of cuff integrity after repair. The retear rate increased linearly as the preoperative tear size increased. A preoperative tear size less than 2 cm<sup>2</sup> had a less than 10% chance of retears at 6 months, increasing to 57% when the preoperative tear size was greater than 8 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In the study, the overall rotator cuff retear rate at 6-month follow-up was 19%. This result is comparable with, although lies at the lower end of, the current published results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512462677">§</xref></sup> Chung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462677">8</xref></sup> reported a similar retear rate of 23% in a recent publication. Miller et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512462677">20</xref></sup> however, reported a higher retear rate of 41% for repairing larger rotator cuff defects (&gt;3 cm).</p>
<p>There are several studies that have found similar effects of tear size on rotator cuff repair integrity. Huijsmans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref></sup> found that for a preoperative tear size of less than 1 cm in the medial-lateral axis, the retear rate at the final follow-up was found to be 12%. For a tear size between 1 to 3 cm, the retear rate was 7%. This increased to 22% for a preoperative tear size between 3 and 5 cm. This then increased significantly to 53% for massive tears greater than 5 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref></sup> Sugaya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512462677">24</xref></sup> demonstrated similar findings. Small preoperative cuff tears had a retear rate of 13% in single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and this increased to 44% for large tears. Galatz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512462677">9</xref></sup> demonstrated an even higher retear rate of 94% in patients with large to massive rotator cuff tears.</p>
<p>In our study, we were able to demonstrate a mathematical relationship between preoperative tear size and cuff integrity at 6 months. We postulate that some of the variances in rates of retears reported by various studies may be directly related to the average tear sizes that were operated on. For instance, Bishop et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462677">2</xref></sup> demonstrated a higher rate of retears compared with Huijsmans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref></sup> (47% vs 17%), and this may merely reflect that 52% of the Bishop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462677">2</xref></sup> cohort had a preoperative cuff tear size &gt;3 cm while only 27% of patients in the Huijsmans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref></sup> cohort had a preoperative cuff tear size &gt;3 cm.</p>
<p>Some studies have demonstrated that age is a significant predictive factor for cuff integrity after repair, with younger patients achieving superior functional and anatomic outcomes after repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512462677">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512462677">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462677">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512462677">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512462677">23</xref></sup> However, the findings are not entirely conclusive, as Oh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512462677">22</xref></sup> in their more recent work in 2010 demonstrated that although age was a significant predictive factor of cuff integrity using a univariate analysis, the significance was not found when a multivariate analysis was performed. They suggested a possible reason was that age was a significant confounder to most of the independent variables studied, such as preoperative cuff tear size and fatty degeneration of the cuff muscle. The present study demonstrated that age was a significant predictive factor for rotator cuff integrity after a multivariate analysis. The significance, however, was not as great as preoperative cuff tear size. The correlation coefficient for age and retears was also lower than for tear size and retear rate.</p>
<p>Charousset et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512462677">7</xref></sup> demonstrated that poor tendon quality and tendon mobility as assessed by the surgeon at the time of surgery were related to higher repair failure. Huijsmans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462677">13</xref></sup> showed that poor quality tendons as assessed by the surgeon at the time of surgery were related to a higher chance of cuff retears. No correlation or multivariate analysis was performed in these studies. The present study demonstrated that there were weak negative correlations between the tendon quality, tendon mobility, repair quality, and repair integrity at 6 months. Tendon quality and mobility did not remain as significant predictive factors when logistic regression analysis was performed. Therefore, our study suggests that tendon quality and mobility by themselves are not adequate in making any reliable clinical predictions of the rotator cuff repairs: frail and immobile tendons do not necessarily produce poor results.</p>
<p>The stepwise regression analysis was helpful in formulating an equation that would assist in predicting the chance of rotator cuff retears after repair using only the significant predictive factors. For instance, for a patient who had a preoperative rotator cuff tear size of 3 cm<sup>2</sup> and had a good rotator cuff repair, say, a repair quality score of 3, the chance of cuff retears at 6-month follow-up will equal 0.38 + (0.02 × 3) – (0.08 × 3) = .2, or 20%. This value is nearly identical to the prediction by the different analysis as plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512462677">Figure 1</xref>, which gives a 19% retear rate for a preoperative tear size between 2 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The study has several strengths. To date, it has the largest cohort number with 500 enrolled patients, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. All repairs were performed by a single surgeon at a single center. The data were collected in a standardized format.</p>
<p>There are, however, some limitations to the study that should be considered. First, the intraoperative scoring system was subjective and has not been validated. These scores were from a single surgeon; therefore, bias was inevitable. Furthermore, when establishing a mathematical model to predict the chance of retears after repair, the retear rate is assumed to be linearly related to the contributing variables, which may or may not be the case. Only 5 intraoperative factors were analyzed in this study, and there are possibly more intraoperative contributing factors that we are unaware of, or for which we have not collected data, which can affect the retear rate after rotator cuff repair. Fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus muscle may be another potential risk factor for retears of the repaired cuff; however, because the cuff integrity was assessed using ultrasound, this potential risk factor could not be evaluated. Finally, the surgery was performed by a single senior surgeon at a single center using 1 technique, and the results may not translate to other surgeons in other centers using their techniques.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Preoperative tear size, age, and surgeon-ranked repair quality were significant factors in predicting rotator cuff integrity after repair, whereas cuff quality and mobility assessed by the surgeon at the time of the repair were not. Preoperative tear size was linearly related to the retear rate, and the chance of cuff retears at 6 months could be predicted by the following equation:</p>
