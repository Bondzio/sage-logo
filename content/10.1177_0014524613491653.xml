<abstract>
<p>Thomas F. Torrance (born 1913) is chiefly remembered for his work on the early dialogue between theology and natural science. Out of tune with the liberal theology of the 1960s which he labeled as ‘dualist’, the dialogue with science was just one way whereby Torrance steered towards realism in an attempt to recover the classic structures, doctrines and forms of the Christian tradition. This short paper looks at the neglected topic of his theology of ministry. During the wary and fenced ecumenism of the 50s and 60s, Torrance systematically reconnected church order with the servant ministry of Jesus Christ. He recognised the temptations of ministry either to seek worldly credibility and prestige or to become otherworldly and merely pious. He eschewed both, but refused to over-specify ministry, insisting that the actual form it took is ambiguous, provisional and unfettered. That conception of ministry is tested against Torrance’s criticism of what he saw as a ‘detached’ understanding of the episcopate in the Church of England of the 1960s and in his support for the ordination of women. He maintained that those who obstructed the ordination of women argued as though the Incarnation had made no change in the order of fallen humanity. In his lifetime, Torrance never engaged with the issue of the ordination of gay persons, but the structures within which he understood ministry would be hospitable to any who committed to the servant ministry of Jesus.</p>

<p>A small conference generously convened by Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in April 2013 to celebrate the centenary of Thomas F. Torrance’s birth persuaded me to address my father’s theology of ministry<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524613491653">1</xref></sup>. The short paper which follows is based on the oral presentation I gave. I pay very close attention to his text and though I rearrange things, I often use or paraphrase his words. My aim is clarity and I begin with some context setting.</p>
<p>My father was born in Chengdu, in Szechuan Province in China in August 1913. He was the second of six children born to Thomas Torrance and Annie Elizabeth Sharpe. My grandfather arrived in China in 1890, during the Qing dynasty, and he met my grandmother there. My grandmother was English, an Anglican and a missionary in China in her own right. She was a woman of formidable acumen, steeped in an Anglican perspective and the Biblical theology of the Book of Common Prayer. After my grandmother took the 6 children home to Scotland in 1927, she had so many views on things that matter that she took to writing letters to a national newspaper under her maiden name. I am told this provoked the comment, ‘Sharpe by name and sharp by nature’. The combination of having an Anglican mother and later having an Anglican wife always raised the question of Anglican orders in a personal as well as a theological way for my father.</p>
<p>My great-grandfather was a farmer from near Shotts, in the central belt in Scotland, closer to Glasgow than Edinburgh. He was dismayed when his son announced that he wanted to be a missionary. He said he would support him financially, if he would become a minister of the Church of Scotland, but not as a missionary. I only mention this to indicate that my father’s background was what we call ‘Auld Kirk’. The Church of Scotland divided with the so-called ‘Disruption’ in 1843 which saw the birth of the Free Church of Scotland. My great-grandfather’s family stayed with the parish church, and the tradition, ethos and theologians of the Auld Kirk became my father’s inheritance.</p>
<p>When I was ordained as minister of Northmavine Parish in the Shetland Islands in January 1982, I remember fretting to my father about my uncertainties in my new role. He wasn’t interested in my woeful inexperience in preaching or pastoral care. He simply said, ‘You are ordained to bless the people in the name of God’. Among the books he gave me was G. W. Sprott’s <italic>The Worship and Offices of the Church of Scotland</italic>, published in Edinburgh in 1882<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524613491653">2</xref></sup>. The book was dedicated to William Milligan, Professor of Divinity at Aberdeen, with the words, ‘Who, in a time of unbelief, schism, and confusion, has witnessed for Catholic truth, unity, and worship’. It was an attempt at a time of schism and deep uncertainty, to draw together what was worth retaining in the tradition of the Auld Kirk and to express a particular vision of ministry.</p>
<p>I read it and found that Sprott describes the Benediction as God’s answer to our worship and as its proper close. He said, ‘In [the benediction] God’s Ministers put His name upon the people, and He blesses them. That a blessing is thus imparted from on high, through the channel of an ordained ministry … is asserted in all the standards that have at any time been of authority in the Church. This was so well understood formerly, and the blessing was so highly valued, that, in order to induce people to come twice to church, it was sometimes not given until the second service’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524613491653">3</xref></sup>. Sprott continues, ‘Not only have the old ideas on this subject died out for the most part, but some of the clergy have been known to denounce them as “involving a blasphemous assumption of sacerdotal power”. Many ministers never bless at all, but use a form such as the following, which … would deserve to be called a rigmarole: “And now may grace, mercy, and peace be with us, and all the Israel of God, here and everywhere, now, henceforth, and for ever, world without end, Amen”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524613491653">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There is a particular vision here of the minister’s calling, standing and purpose to which I believe my father subscribed all his life. We will see more of this later. When in 1960<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524613491653">5</xref></sup> with Ronald Selby Wright my father thoroughly revised and edited Wotherspoon and Kirkpatrick’s little book, <italic>A Manual of Church Doctrine according to the Church of Scotland</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524613491653">6</xref></sup>, the calling of a minister <italic>to bless the people in the name of God</italic> is embedded<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524613491653">7</xref></sup>. This may be neglected now or not noticed, but it was a formative element in his understanding which he transmitted faithfully to me.</p>
<p>Such a belief, of course, raises questions. From whence comes such authority? Is it a sacerdotalising act of pretence? What does a ‘calling to bless’ amount to? I am using this as a point of entry to my father’s theology of ministry.</p>
<p>In 1952, my father was a delegate at the Faith and Order Conference at Lund, which considered the doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ and organic union between the churches. Following that, in the mid to late 1950s, with others like John Baillie, A. C. Craig, William Manson and J. H. S. Burleigh, he committed himself to a narrowly unsuccessful attempt to bring the Church of Scotland and the Church of England into organic union, with bishops in presbyteries<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524613491653">8</xref></sup>. This led him into a critical examination of church order, inter-communion and the validity and authority of church offices.</p>
<p>My father in fact took a step still further back, and began by considering the notion of ‘order’ generally. In the Biblical narrative, the notion of ‘order’ is set over against ‘disorder’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524613491653">9</xref></sup>. Without the intervention of God’s creative Word, the world was ‘without form or void’. When God made the world, God made it ‘in order’ and everything was set in its due proportion. However, the ordered cosmos as created and intended by God has been disturbed by the disordering of sin. Through sin, the world fell out of order, and if it were it not for God’s persistent love, the world would head towards disintegration and chaos. Furthermore, the Biblical narrative tells us that in the fullness of time, God will provide salvation, a new order and a new creation, in which things will be reordered in their perfection and in the purpose of their creation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524613491653">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Importantly, my father saw ‘order’ as a different concept from ‘natural law’, which is ‘an order immanent in natural processes’ and ‘capable of being brought to its self-expression’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524613491653">11</xref></sup>. My father maintained that there is an order of creation which is not discernible by mere observation of creation, but only by observing the creative purpose of God<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524613491653">12</xref></sup>. In due course, the creative will of God will restore its lost order to creation, and such ordering is shadowed forth in the law given in the Hebrew Scriptures. As yet, that law is revealed primarily in its negative aspect of judgment and restraint, but ultimately the purpose of that restraint is ‘to point beyond itself to the new law, the new order of the new Covenant’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524613491653">13</xref></sup>. And importantly again, this order is something which is creative, joyful, obedient yet not submissive or crushed. It is to do with living at something’s full potential.</p>
<p>My father taught that the ‘new order’ first came into the world in Jesus Christ. ‘In the Incarnation, the Word of God entered into the Word’s own disordered world; the Light shone into the darkness; the divine economy entered within … creaturely existence’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014524613491653">14</xref></sup>. His point is that God’s new order was not and is never violently or coercively imposed from outside, but entered in the form of a child into a broken world. The mode of God’s condescension and re-ordering is the way of Jesus Christ the Servant and it is displayed in healing, forgiveness, welcome to the outcasts and enduring rejection. This says something about the mode, tone and style whereby Jesus ushers in that creative, and non-natural order and we will return to this.</p>
<p>So far we have a <italic>general</italic> notion of God’s ‘order’. My father then applied this to ‘church order’ and in that context, understood ‘order’ as ‘the co-ordinating of the life of the Church in its fellowship, worship, and mission <italic>in the service of the glory of God</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014524613491653">15</xref></sup>. Even more specifically, the ordering of the Church’s <italic>ministry</italic> is ‘the ordering of its life and work <italic>through participation in the obedience of Christ</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014524613491653">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>So ministry is <italic>ordered</italic> through participation in the obedience of Christ. That is its fundamental grammar. Does my father elucidate this further? Yes, he does, in an essay entitled ‘Service in Christ’, which was included as a contribution to the second <italic>Festschrift</italic> presented to Karl Barth on the occasion of his 80<sup>th</sup> birthday<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014524613491653">17</xref></sup>. Here he notes that ‘we have been accustomed to expound [the] ministry of Christ in terms of His threefold office as the anointed Prophet, Priest and King’ but that ‘this has tended to obscure or to discount two essential aspects of His ministry’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014524613491653">18</xref></sup>. My father saw these two aspects as (a) the fact that Jesus fulfilled his ministry as a human office <italic>within the conditions of the community that he served</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014524613491653">19</xref></sup>. I take this as being a statement of awareness of social context. Jesus did not offer an unrelated and other-worldly ministry. It was related creatively and often surprisingly to the very situation in which he found himself. And (b) that Jesus gave his ministry content and pattern by his actions of love and compassion in his healing of the sick and in his support of the outcast. My father observed that the fundamentally <italic>diaconal</italic> nature of Jesus’ ministry of mercy has been undervalued, and that ‘the Church throughout history has had great difficulty in relating to their proper source and ground not only the diaconal office within the Church, but the deaconing of the whole community’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014524613491653">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>My father suggests that ‘Christ was Himself the <italic>diakonos</italic> par excellence whose office it was <italic>not only</italic> to prompt the people of God in their response to the divine mercy and to be merciful themselves, <italic>not only</italic> to stand out as the perfect model or example of compassionate service … <italic>but</italic> to provide in Himself and in His own deeds of mercy <italic>the creative ground and source</italic> of all such <italic>diakonia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0014524613491653">21</xref></sup>. Jesus was able to do that because in him the very being of God condescended to share with human people in their misery and distress, absorbing the sharpness of their hurt and suffering into himself, and Jesus still remains able to do that because he is the outgoing of the innermost being of God, the boundless mercy of God at work in human existence, unlimited in his capacity to deliver them from trouble<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0014524613491653">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>All of this is a characteristically T. F. Torrance move: we see a strongly Christological reorientation of what might tend to be seen as the church office or appointment of a minister/pastor/deacon. And he presses the logic of his argument still further. Jesus healed <italic>not</italic> as a doctor but as a Saviour; he helped <italic>not</italic> as a wonder-worker but as the Holy One who absorbed into himself the affliction of those in distress. Though it was by the Spirit of God that he brought divine power to bear upon the realm of evil, he fulfilled his ministry <italic>in meekness and lowliness</italic>. Furthermore, the true and faithful servant does not arrogate authority to himself or build up around himself or herself instruments of power or even an aura of prestige through which she may exert pressure to attain her ends, or otherwise she would betray the essential nature of her service <italic>as service<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0014524613491653">23</xref></sup></italic>. ‘Jesus warned His disciples, as He washed their feet … to beware of allowing their service in His name to gather a worldly prestige in which its nature <italic>as service</italic> would be lost or take the form of a munificent patronage that could lord it over [humankind]’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0014524613491653">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>My father was aware that this uncompromising perspective, designed as it was to retain ministry <italic>as service</italic>, brought a twofold temptation to the Church. <italic>On the one hand</italic> ‘the Church is tempted to use worldly power to secure the success of its service. As an organized community within the national, social, and economic structures of human life, the Church cannot isolate its ministry … from the organized services of the State for the welfare of people’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0014524613491653">25</xref></sup>. Consequently, ‘the Church is constantly tempted not only to <italic>institutionalize</italic> its service of the divine mercy but to build up power structures of its own … by means of which it can exert pressure to attain its ends and impart power to its service in order to ensure its effectiveness. What church is there that feels deeply the burden of human need … that does <italic>not</italic> fall into this temptation?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0014524613491653">26</xref></sup> And then, ‘<italic>[o]n the other hand</italic>, the Church is tempted to leave the corporate responsibility for the need of [people] wholly to the State and to restrict itself to the ministry of forgiveness’. He commented, ‘This could take a quietist and other-worldly form through the restriction of Christian service to inward “religious” concerns, but it could also take the form of a flight into the anonymity of “religionless” behaviour or the so-called “meta-christianity” of the “new man”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0014524613491653">27</xref></sup>. But in either case the Church would decline the burden of human need at its sharpest point and deflect the real force of Christian witness, and so run away from the agony of being merciful as God is merciful’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0014524613491653">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>From hindsight, we may not agree that those are the only alternatives, or even if they are, that we would characterise them in quite that way.</p>
<p>I do not believe my father had any doubt about the dismay and puzzlement with which this would be heard by many socially committed Christians. His stance did not imply a lack of concern or social commitment on his part. His stance troubled him and he sought a theological justification. ‘Can the Church engage in the pressure groups of organized society in order to ensure the success of its own enterprise … without <italic>compromising</italic> its real nature as the Body of Christ?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0014524613491653">29</xref></sup> ‘Can it follow Christ, the Servant of the Lord who steadfastly resisted every temptation to use compelling demonstrations of glory and power to fulfil His ministry, without like Him suffering the hostility and ridicule and ignominy that are heaped by the world on powerless and selfless service of God’s mercy? … Can the Church go forth from Christ clad with His image in the form of a servant <italic>without</italic> laying aside the pride and glory and power of the nations, and without taking into its own mouth in triumphant agony His cry before the judgment of Pilate: “My kingdom is not of this world”?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0014524613491653">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, ‘how can the Church go forth from Christ to engage in authentic service in His name without immersing itself in the need and misery and desperate plight of [people] in complete solidarity with the world under the judgment and grace of God …?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0014524613491653">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In partial answer, my father wrote: ‘Difficult though it is for the Church … to carry this burden and fulfil the role of a servant, God in His mercy has instituted within it special ministries’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0014524613491653">32</xref></sup>. Thus, ‘<italic>The service of the Word</italic> is the <underline>ministry</underline> of the Word and Sacrament through which Christ is pleased to be present … But it is a <italic>service</italic>, a <italic>diakonia</italic>, in which ministers only <italic>serve</italic> the proclamation of Christ and cannot make that proclamation effective by imparting to it their own strength’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0014524613491653">33</xref></sup>. And ‘<italic>[t]he service of the response to the Word</italic> is the <underline>ministry</underline> of the divine mercy to the people in which Christ Himself is pleased to be present, acting as their Representative in lifting them up to the face of the Father … [b]ut it is a <italic>service</italic>, a <italic>diakonia</italic>, in which deacons only <italic>prompt</italic> the people in their responses of prayer and praise and do not act on their behalf …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0014524613491653">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This is a severely purist theology of <underline>ministry</underline> and it may be too constrained for the kinds of pluralism we see today. As we will see, my father did allow himself some wriggle room of a kind, and before dismissing his perspective as too limited, one has to remember that he had a childhood experience until the age of 14 in China, where organised Christian social action would have been meaningless; he had seen the rise of the Third Reich and the temptation for the churches to become complicit; and finally, remember that this uncompromising statement was written as part of a <italic>Festschrift</italic> to Karl Barth who was no stranger to absolute positions. I think that my father’s personal stance was deeply to abhor any attempt to tie down the Gospel to inflexible institutional forms. He distrusted self-flattery and had boundless faith in our ability to delude ourselves. That wasn’t cynicism and he wasn’t cynical. It was partly realism, partly an acceptance of human weakness without God.</p>
<p>We have seen that he provides a Christological re-orientation of the <italic>content</italic>, <italic>tone</italic> and <italic>style</italic> of ministry. How are we to understand its parameters, or the juridical limits within which ministry is authorised? As was seen earlier, my father understood the trajectory of the promised new order of creation established in the humanity of Jesus as ‘<italic>the praise of creation</italic> for the Creator’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0014524613491653">35</xref></sup>. He saw ‘church order’, as opposed to ‘general order’, as being ‘the co-ordinating of the life of the Church in its fellowship, worship, and mission <italic>in the service of the glory of God</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0014524613491653">36</xref></sup>. Such a service and trajectory of praise cannot simply be a wooden <underline>imitation</underline> of the historical obedience of Jesus. It is through the work of the Spirit that Christians are enabled <italic>to share</italic> in the obedience of Jesus, but that is <italic>no mere external conformity</italic> but what my father called an ‘inner and outer sharing’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0014524613491653">37</xref></sup>. The Spirit is not a law of nature but an animating and creative presence. My father suggests that in consequence ‘<italic>actual order</italic> as we see it and have it in the historical Church on earth is essentially ambiguous’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0014524613491653">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>I find this and the use of that word extremely important and of course it is disconcerting for scholastic followers of T. F. Torrance, who like to see him as Mr All-Buttoned-Up. As we saw earlier, my father acknowledged that the actual details of Jesus’ earthly ministry fitted the historical circumstances in which he found himself. There happened to be despised tax collectors, people isolated by contagious disease and a priestly caste and he ministered to all of them. Similarly today, and here is a quotation, ‘the Church is sent into history to live out its new life in the form of a servant under the law – <italic>not fettered</italic> by the law, <italic>not to be schematized</italic> according to the forms and patterns of this age, … <italic>not to be legalized</italic> in its life, but to use the patterns and forms of the law of this age in the service of its new life in the risen and ascended Lord. Thus <italic>all order</italic> in the historical Church is essentially <italic>ambiguous</italic> because it is order in the overlap of two ages’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0014524613491653">39</xref></sup>. My father amplified this. ‘[A]ll order in the historical Church is essentially eschatological’ … it is ‘ambivalent and provisional’, an ‘order that visibly reflects its life hid with Christ in God’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0014524613491653">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Use of the words ‘ambiguous’, ‘ambivalent’ and ‘provisional’ do not in any sense release ministry from its profound calling to act as servant, but those words were important to my father because they denied finality, self-justification and inflexible institutional forms to ministry at any one period. His fear, expressed in various places, was that ‘we repeat the failure of the medieval Church to see the limited nature and [limited] sanctity of many institutional patterns, and, in claiming to fight for essentials, we have often betrayed them by confounding them with time-conditioned forms that rarely have historical support from the New Testament or even the Early Church’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0014524613491653">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We are left then with an urgent sense of ministry as a vocation that shares in the creativity of the new order, obedient yet deliberately underdetermined except in its servant nature, and ordered towards blessing. What then are its threats and temptations?</p>
<p>I have already pointed to my father’s concern that ministry is tempted either to bolster its visible success by acquiring its own power structures and thereby to some extent becoming self-justifying, or to eschew the concrete conditions under which the people of God actually suffer and to take refuge in an otherworldly message. Rightly, I think, he gave no specific instruction on how to navigate that pathway. He did, however, give two indications. One emerged from his long dialogue with the Church of England in the 1950s and the other related to the ordination of women in the 1980s and 90s.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, my father’s mother was an Anglican and he married an Anglican. His little book, <italic>Royal Priesthood: A Theology of Ordained Ministry</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0014524613491653">42</xref></sup>, first published in 1955, was dedicated ‘To the Church of England, the church of my mother and my wife, and to the Church of Scotland, the church of my father, in the earnest prayer that they may soon be one’. Through birth and marriage, he knew enough to be an insider of a kind, but felt frustrated and to some extent rejected that his status as a minister of the Church of Scotland was not counted.</p>
<p>An anecdote may illustrate this. At the age of 14 I went to the boarding school near Bath where my mother’s brothers and father had been pupils. Her grandfather had been a significant benefactor of the school and the pulpit in the chapel was in memory of him. It was a place where I felt welcomed and at home. I was at an age when I was thinking of becoming confirmed, and my father discussed my standing with the bishop. The attitude then - not now - was that if I were a communicant member of the Church of Scotland, I would be denied access to communion in England. What was agreed was that I would be confirmed first by the Bishop of Taunton, and then subsequently admitted as a communicant member of the Church of Scotland by act of the Kirk Session of Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0014524613491653">43</xref></sup>. That is what happened, and so I am confirmed in the Church of England and ordained in the Church of Scotland. My father seriously discussed joint ordination with me, but we didn’t go that far<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0014524613491653">44</xref></sup>. The barrier to my receiving communion, of course, was that of <italic>episcopal</italic> confirmation.</p>
<p>Barriers of that kind were a testing ground for my father’s radically Christological re-orientation of church office and his line of criticism is still instructive. Though an enthusiast for Cranmer’s <italic>Book of Common Prayer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0014524613491653">45</xref></sup></italic>, he was uneasy with the romantic side of the Oxford Movement and its identification of the episcopate ‘as the one principle which <italic>per se</italic> constitutes the Church’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0014524613491653">46</xref></sup>. He saw this as an unjustifiable isolation of one church office - the episcopate – from its embodiment in the corporate mission of the church. Historically, it was understandable enough as the Church of England had been intimidated by the Westminster Assembly<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0014524613491653">47</xref></sup> and had ‘barricate[d] itself behind the episcopate as the self-sufficient and self-perpetuating essence of the Church’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0014524613491653">48</xref></sup>. However, this perfectly illustrated what he saw as our human tendency to fasten upon the limited nature and limited sanctity of a time-bound institutional form. The Puritan revolution and later Methodism absorbed large numbers of people who, though still ‘dialectically’ Anglican could not return to the Church of England until it became ‘theologically and spiritually big enough to hold them as differences within a recovered and enriched unity’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0014524613491653">49</xref></sup>. Perhaps surprisingly, my father continued, ‘[The Church of England] must learn as a Church to understand the conscience of the Free Churches and how to give rest to their God-given convictions within itself before it can really realize its own corporate life in the nation’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0014524613491653">50</xref></sup>. His recipe was to re-think the doctrine of Church and ministry Christologically and after a repentant willingness to learn from one another, he believed that ‘without sacrifice of principle or truth we can actually advance from our given unity to manifest reconciliation’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0014524613491653">51</xref></sup>. The notion of a ‘detached episcopate’ is an interesting one, and in other debates today we may be suffering from a ‘detached’ understanding of ministry.</p>
<p>And then there was the issue of the ordination of women. At one level, this was a challenge to him personally and to the ‘Auld Kirk’ tradition with which he had been brought up. It also appeared to go against the Apostle Paul and he had to decide whether Paul’s advice was a time-bound institutional structure which was out of kilter with where Christians are today. He also had to ask himself whether far more fundamental principles of Christology were at stake. From the early 1970s my father became a convinced advocate for the ordination of woman. The reasons for his conviction are interesting. He was not overly impressed in this context by human rights based argument drawing on natural law. As we have seen, that was not the kind of order he believed to be definitive here. He was wary of those who spoke about power, whether withholding it or demanding it. He was sharply critical of those who denied the ordination of women on the grounds that only a male can represent Jesus at the Eucharist, maintaining that they argued ‘<italic>as though</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0014524613491653">52</xref></sup> the Incarnation had made no change in the order of fallen humanity in which man was held to be the head of the woman within and beyond marriage; and <italic>as though</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0014524613491653">53</xref></sup> in [the] Incarnation the Son of God, the Creator in whom all women and men live and move and have their being, had not assumed <italic>all</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0014524613491653">54</xref></sup> humanity, female as well as male, in order to redeem and save them. Although Jesus was of course physically male, divine nature and human nature, divine being and human being, were perfectly and indivisibly united in his one incarnate <italic>Person</italic>, and it is as the incarnate <italic>Person</italic> of the Son of God, not as male, that he is our Lord and Saviour<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0014524613491653">55</xref></sup>. My father went on: ‘the mistaken idea that it is not the priest <italic>as person</italic> but only <italic>as male</italic> who can represent Christ, not only involves a form of Nestorian heresy in dividing between the divine and human natures of Christ, but conflicts sharply with the great soteriological principle of the ancient Catholic Church that “what has not been assumed has not been saved”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0014524613491653">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As faithfully as I can reconstruct it, and giving him plenty of his own words, this is my father’s theology of ministry. I am largely convinced by it. Though these are not the arguments generally passed around, I do not believe they are dry as dust, dead as a door nail. My father never engaged with the issue of today, namely the ordination of gay persons. He was not unaware of the issues and he knew perfectly well that I engaged with them. I believe that his theology, with its thorough-going critique of the order of natural law and of time-limited human institutions with their various forms of self-justification, would not rule out such an initiative, and could provide theological support, provided the persons concerned were prepared to live Christ’s servant ministry.</p>

<title>A Study Edition of the Thanksgiving Psalms</title>
<p>Eileen M. Schuller &amp; Carol A. Newsom, <italic>The Hodayot (Thanksgiving Psalms): A Study Edition of 1QHa</italic> (Atlanta, GA: SBL, 2012. £12.99. pp. xii + 110. ISBN: 978-1-58983-692-1).</p>
<p>Based on their edition of the same text in DJD 40, Eileen Schuller and Carol Newsom have published an excellent study edition that makes available the Hebrew text and facing English translation to a readership beyond the cabal of Qumran specialists. Stripped of all the technical details in the <italic>editio princeps</italic> this study edition will become, if my prediction be true, the book that most scholars will use. The text of 1QHa is reproduced, and cross-references point interested reader to parallels in 4QHa-f. Only minor corrections, primarily for consistency, are introduced into the English translation. A useful ‘Word List’ is appended to the end to facilitate understanding and access of the Hebrew. It is hoped that this volume will bring an end to the confusion of order and enumeration of the Thanksgiving Psalms. From now on scholars will have ready access to the reconstructed numbering of Stegemann/Puech and not have to rely on the old system that Sukenik devised. A comparison of the two systems is included for those who need to convert the numbering of the column/fragment and line numbers from one to the other when reading books and articles of past decades.</p>
