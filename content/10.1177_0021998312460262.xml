<p>Multifunctional structure-battery composites were developed using fiber reinforced marine composites for structure function and rechargeable lithium-ion cells for energy storage and structure function. Laminate, sandwich, and modular beam configurations were fabricated and tested to determine flexural stiffness and strength, energy storage capacity versus discharge rate, and buoyancy (density). The structure-battery composites exhibited higher flexural stiffness but lower strength than equivalent unifunctional designs, energy storage capacities between 40 and 60 Wh/L, and buoyancies bracketing the unifunctional specimen values. Issues requiring further attention include: improved bending strength, simplified fabrication, reversible attachments for modular components, electrical wiring and connections, and battery management circuitry.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312460262" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multifunctional materials and material-systems are capable of performing more than one primary function simultaneously or sequentially in time. The purpose of multifunctionality is to achieve improvements in system-level performance through the elimination of redundancy between sub-system materials and functions. The use of system-level performance as the metric for the design of multifunctional materials distinguishes them from unifunctional materials, which typically use one or more material property values as the metric. As a consequence, material property values associated with the constituents of an optimized multifunctional material/system may not always be maximal or minimal. The emphasis on optimal system performance versus material properties arises in the difference between a material’s “function” and its “properties.” Function is a group of related actions performed by a material or material-system that contribute to a larger (system) action; functions are usually associated with a “sub-system.” Property is a “quality, attribute, or distinctive feature”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021998312460262">a</xref></sup> of a material or material system that influences its capability in performing some required function(s).</p>
<p>The distinction between “multifunctional (Mf) material” and “multifunctional material-system” resides in the scale (length) of function integration. Mf materials are assumed to preserve their multiple functionalities as the volume is arbitrarily sub-divided into smaller pieces whereas Mf material-systems suffer a loss of one or more functionalities as the volume is arbitrarily sub-divided. That is, Mf materials are function-capable to smaller length scales than Mf material-systems; how small is the question of philosophy. At some point, all materials become “composite systems” comprising assemblies of distinct components (i.e., atoms, molecules). In the sequel, Mf materials and material-systems will be denoted as Mf systems.</p>
<p>Mf systems may be “coupled” in different ways. There may be coupling between field quantities, as in deformation-electric field coupling with piezo-electric materials (e.g., Cao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312460262">1</xref></sup>), or they may only be coupled in the sense of sharing physical space or a boundary. They may or may not be functionally coupled with interactions between the physical processes associated with each function. For example, structural loading of a Mf structure-battery system may not affect the electrical energy storage capability, and similarly, charge or discharge of the stored energy may not affect the structural deformations, stresses, or load-carrying capacity.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, there are new opportunities and challenges associated with developing Mf systems for unmanned applications. Design of Mf systems requires knowledge of the intended system’s performance in terms of sub-system functions and materials in order to identify material redundancies, possible functions to combine, and potential system performance gains. There may be a specific metric available for system performance such as flight endurance time for an electric unmanned air vehicle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref></sup> or range for an unmanned underwater vehicle (see below), or there may only be generic metrics like system/sub-system mass or volume. Once a system-level metric has been identified, formal selection procedures can be used to identify and quantify candidate materials and architectures for composite Mf systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312460262">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec2-0021998312460262"><title>Multifunctional structure-power composites</title>
<p>The Synthetic Multifunctional Materials Program, started in 2000 under the auspices of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), introduced Mf systems as a new topic area in materials R&amp;D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312460262">4</xref></sup> A recent review by Gibson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312460262">5</xref></sup> highlighted the increasing number of research publications over the past decade related to the mechanics of multifunctional composite materials and structures; over 900 total published journal articles were noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312460262">Figure 1</xref> of Gibson’s paper. He defined multifunctional materials and structures as those capable of simultaneously performing combinations of multiple structural or structural plus non-structural functions and included in his review the literature related to structure-plus-energy harvesting/storage multifunctionality.

<p>Mf systems with structure plus energy storage, generation, and/or harvesting functionality, which will be denoted as multifunctional structure-power (SP) systems, are confined in practice to electrical-based power functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021998312460262">b</xref></sup> Such Mf SP systems integrate structure function with a variety of energy storage, generation, and/or harvesting technologies. Batteries and capacitors are used to provide energy storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312460262">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312460262">11</xref></sup> Fuel cells are used to provide conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to electric power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312460262">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312460262">13</xref></sup> Piezo-/magneto-electric and electromagnetic generators are used to provide electric power from structural vibrations and ambient flows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312460262">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312460262">16</xref></sup> Thermoelectric technologies are used to provide electric power from thermal gradients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312460262">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312460262">18</xref></sup> and photovoltaics are used to provide electric power from photonic sources (solar, lighting, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312460262">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312460262">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312460262">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>A spectrum of technical approaches from basic-to-applied are used for developing Mf SP systems. The more applied approaches integrate and/or embed commercial energy storage and harvesting devices with various structural components and elements. Intermediate applied–basic approaches develop new or modify one or more components in existing energy storage, generation, or harvesting devices to add structural functionality. For example, particle-based carbon anodes in Li-ion battery cells have been replaced by carbon-fiber anodes to increase tensile stiffness and strength. More basic approaches seek to develop energy storage, generation, or harvesting devices with inherent structural functionality from the ground-up. The applied approaches offer more near-term opportunities for creating Mf SP material systems with appreciable structure and energy storage, generation, or harvesting capabilities. The more basic approaches are longer-term efforts, but they offer the best opportunities for achieving fine-scale integration of the multifunctionality (i.e., Mf material) that may be necessary for improving performance in some systems, particularly smaller-scale systems where parasitic mass (e.g., unifunctional device packaging, power and communications conduits, functional redundancies, etc.) can severely degrade performance and render the system non-viable.</p>
<p>The next subsection provides a review of Mf structure-battery systems based on two battery cell technologies: lithium-ion pouch cells and solid-state lithium (SS-Li) cells. It will begin with a review of more applied efforts, then applied–basic efforts, and finally the more basic efforts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998312460262"><title>Multifunctional structure-battery systems</title>
<p>There are numerous battery cell technologies (chemistries) that have potential for use in Mf SB systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312460262">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312460262">21</xref></sup> Lithium-based chemistries offer the highest gravimetric and volumetric energy storage capacities (Wh/kg or Wh/L) of the secondary (rechargeable) cells. Within this class, lithium-ion (or lithium polymer) “pouch-cells” possess high gravimetric (125–250 Wh/kg) and volumetric (200–600 Wh/L) energy densities and show excellent Ragone performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021998312460262">c</xref></sup> These cells are commercially available at reasonable cost in high-energy or high-power delivery models, operate at a relatively high average voltage (∼3.8 V), have 5–10 years shelf-life, and can undergo 100–1000 s of charge-discharge cycles before losing their charge storage capacity. They come in rectangular-prismatic shapes with width and length dimensions ranging from ∼5–500 mm and thicknesses from ∼1–15 mm, depending on cell capacity. They are laminate constructions with active battery bi-cell layers that are stacked, wound, or Z-fold configured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312460262">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312460262">23</xref></sup> The active core is imbibed with a liquid electrolyte that is completely absorbed, and then vacuum-packed in a flexible, polymer-aluminum laminate packaging (“pouch”) with positive and negative electrode tabs extending out (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312460262">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>There are advantages and technical challenges associated with using commercial Li-ion pouch cells to create Mf SB components. The most important advantage relates to the fact that these battery cells have been highly optimized through years of worldwide research and development investments made by industry and governments. The energy storage (or power-delivery) performance of these cells (gravimetric, volumetric, and Ragone) has been maximized, cell-to-cell electrical variations have been minimized, cycle-life and shelf-life have been maximized, and cell costs have been minimized. Cells are available from multiple commercial sources in a range of capacities from 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> Ah. It is possible to make these cells with irregular planar-shapes, non-uniform thickness, and curvature in one-dimension for conformal integration with a structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312460262">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312460262">25</xref></sup> Custom-shaped cells, however, are not readily available from commercial sources at the present time. The thin-layered nature of commercial pouch-cells also lends itself to a variety of embedding/integration schemes within high-performance fiber-polymer composite systems.</p>
<p>From a structure-function perspective, there are several technical challenges that must be addressed in the design process. Pouch cells have inherently low interlaminar shear stiffness and strength through the active core layers and at the core-packaging interface, and low out-of-plane tension and planar (in-plane) compression stiffness and strength. Mechanical failure of the cells may be preceded by electrical failure if the active layers are delaminated or significantly deformed. To compensate for these weaknesses, structural embedding/integration design strategies that appropriately shield the cells from undesirable modes of loading must be utilized. Designs that lead to favorable cell deformation modes like out-of-plane compression and planar (in-plane) tension must be utilized and emphasized. The lower cell stiffness and strength modes for these cells may also facilitate structural damage when they are embedded in a structural composite. Additional structural reinforcements in the region of the embedded cells may become necessary to mitigate these modes of failure initiation.</p>
<p>Another technical challenge is the limit on cell temperatures above 70–90°C, which can degrade the energy storage performance and cycle-life. Many structural composites require curing at temperatures above this limit, so more complex designs and fabrication processes are required. Marine composites typically cure at lower temperatures, (e.g., 80°C), and these materials have been utilized in this work along with multi-component adhesive-assembly type designs that combine high- and low-temperature cured parts.</p>
<p>In prior work, Thomas and Qidwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312460262">3</xref></sup> developed an analysis framework to extend the Ashby material-performance index approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312460262">26</xref></sup> to include multi-material composites. Procedures were given for deriving material-architecture performance indices (structure-function metrics) that are based on one or more system-level metrics. Application of this type of analysis with other considerations for the design of multifunctional structure-power systems was demonstrated in Thomas and Qidwai.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312460262">3</xref></sup> Structure and energy storage metrics could be traded-off in system-level performance optimizations. The methodology was demonstrated in an evaluation of notional SB components for increasing the flight endurance time of electric unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The analysis showed that Mf SB can increase endurance by increasing the on-board energy and/or decreasing the UAV weight, however, reducing weight was 1.5 × more effective than adding more energy. In another analysis work, SB wing skin for the Wasp micro-air vehicle was shown to be capable of providing a maximum of ∼26% increase in flight endurance time versus the same vehicle utilizing a standard unifunctional battery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312460262">25</xref></sup> Various SB prototypes using Li-ion pouch cells were also designed, fabricated, and tested for UAV and truss-structure applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312460262">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312460262">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Roberts and Aglietti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312460262">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312460262">29</xref></sup> bonded Li-ion pouch cells to the walls of an aluminum honeycomb core material for use in spacecraft applications. Their motivation was savings in mass through elimination of the battery housing and attachment hardware. They estimated that the parasitic housing/attachment mass constitutes ∼20% of the total battery mass. If bonding the Li-ion pouch cells to the walls allowed them to be thinner, then the mass savings could be as much as ∼25% of the total battery mass. This translated to a reduction of launch mass by ∼0.5% for smaller satellites and ∼1% for larger satellites. They also developed and performed an innovative series of vibration experiments to quantify apparent shear modulus of the Li-ion pouch cells as a function of shear stress (i.e., apparent tangent shear modulus). Their results showed non-linear decreasing shear modulus with applied shear stress; ∼45–55 MPa at ∼10 kPa stress and ∼5 MPa at 80–100 kPa stress. Low shear modulus was expected considering the architecture of these cells, but they also found that the cells could provide good shear damping at the higher-load conditions, which might be useful for reducing satellite structural vibrations. Based on the measured cell properties, they designed a prototype sandwich panel with cells bonded to the honeycomb core walls. The panel was tested and analyzed under simulated launch vibrations. The results showed potential reductions in mass and volume and smaller structural deformations during launch.</p>
<p>In a later study, Foster and Aglietti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998312460262">30</xref></sup> analyzed the thermal environment during simulated mission profiles for cells integrated with a multifunctional solar composite panel. They showed many possible satellite orbits where thermal control of the cells would not be necessary; in orbits where thermal control would be necessary, they suggested possible passive thermal control methods.</p>
<p>Intermediate applied–basic efforts to improve the structural performance of Li-ion pouch cells and their components have also been conducted. Philips Research Laboratories has developed “Lithylene” technology consisting of through-thickness (Z-) “pinning” of the active bi-cell layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998312460262">31</xref></sup> “Rivets” are created through the cell electrode layers by extrusion of interspersed polymer layers under heat and compression loading through perforations made in the electrodes. This significantly improves cell interlaminar shear and bending stiffness and strength. ID Enabler Corporation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021998312460262">d</xref></sup> currently advertises for custom designed lithium-ion pouch cells with the Lithylene technology. Note, however, that load transfer between the active Lithylene cell core and the vacuum-sealed (exterior) packaging is still limited. Interface resistance to shear is by mechanical contact friction forces only, and resistance to packaging pull-away from the core occurs only through the interior–exterior pressure differential (i.e., ∼100 kPa resistance max). Achieving maximal mechanical performance from Li-ion pouch cells will require the development of methods for adhesively (or otherwise) bonding the packaging to the active cell core.</p>
<p>Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998312460262">32</xref></sup> developed a lithium-ion polymer cell with improved structural properties by adding fibers and making other material changes to the active electrode layers. In commercial cells, carbon black particles are used as the main constituent in the anode layers and as a conductive filler in the cathode layer. Liu et al. replaced much of the carbon black with carbon nanotubes, adopted glass-fiber reinforced PDVF as the separator layer, and increased the molecular weight of the PVDF binder in the anode, cathode, and separator layers. In three-point bend testing, their modified cells exhibited a tensile modulus of 3.1 GPa and showed large reductions in hysteresis during cyclic stress–strain loading over a ∼0–40% strain range. Energy storage-wise, their cells demonstrated a gravimetric energy capacity of 35 Wh/kg. Optimization of these cells would improve the energy storage capacity and mechanical performance, perhaps significantly. For example, the cathodes in the prototype cells had roughly half the amount of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> incorporated as do commercial cells, which lowered the energy storage capacity by approximately 50%. This effort illustrates some material substitution strategies that can used for improving the structural performance of Li-ion pouch cells and the trade-offs that invariably occur between energy storage and mechanical performance when the cells are modified.</p>
<p>At the component level, Hossain et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998312460262">33</xref></sup> developed carbon–carbon (C-C) anodes made of disordered carbon fibers for use in Li-ion pouch cells. The C-C anodes had better mechanical properties than typical carbon anodes comprised of high-loadings (high percentage) of carbon-black in polymer matrices. Mechanical properties reported for the C-C anodes were: 45–50 MPa flexural and compression strengths, and 155–160 MPa tensile strength. The C-C anodes bestowed additional beneficial features to Li-ion cells including: high reversible (energy storage) capacity, good cycle and shelf lives, and a tolerance to over-charging and over-discharging conditions (i.e., charge/discharge beyond the 4.2–2.8 V operational window for these cells).</p>
<p>In other work, Snyder et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998312460262">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998312460262">35</xref></sup> developed novel solid polymer electrolytes composed of monomer mixtures, with constituents selected for combined ionic transport and structural (compression) performance. Monomer proportions could be adjusted to balance multifunctional performance of the battery cell (i.e., IR losses and ion-flux capacity effects on energy storage and layer compression stiffness and strength). Ding et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998312460262">36</xref></sup> synthesized and characterized two electrospun-fiber cell separator membranes made of P(VdF-HFP) and PMMA + P(VdF-HFP) and compared their performance. They showed that adding PMMA enhanced electrolyte uptake, lowered electrolyte leakage, improved ionic conductance, and led to higher tensile stiffness, strength, and strain to failure.</p>
<p>An example of a more basic approach was given by Ekstedt et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312460262">9</xref></sup> who created carbon fiber-reinforced lithium-ion based battery prototypes with electrolyte matrices composed of gel or solid polymer. The carbon fibers carried current in the anode as well as provided load-bearing capability. Based on the theoretical calculations and measurement of nominal voltage, the stiffness of this battery and specific energy density were predicted to be 35 GPa and 268 Wh/kg, respectively. Without experimental verification, however, the feasibility of this design concept remains untested.</p>
<p>Another lithium cell type has been prevalent in the creation of Mf SB systems. These are the rechargeable, thin-film, solid-state lithium (SS-Li) cells that are produced by vapor-deposition processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998312460262">37</xref></sup> Standard configurations consist of a single active layer comprising a lithium metal anode, a lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte-separator, and a lithium intercalation compound (e.g., LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) cathode. The active layers are deposited on a substrate (metal, silicon, mica, etc.) with current collector electrodes (+ and −) and then sealed with a packaging layer to prevent exposure to air and moisture. The active cell core is ∼1–100 µm thick; the substrate and packaging layers constitute the primary proportion of cell thickness, volume, and mass. The energy storage and discharge current capacities (∼10–1000 µAh/cm<sup>2</sup>) are quite low. The average voltage is 1.5–3.8 V depending on the specific cell chemistry. Their cycle life is quite good (∼1000–10,000 + charge-discharge cycles), and they have long shelf lives. Cells are commercially available, however, they are more expensive ($/Wh) than Li-ion pouch-cells.</p>
<p>Marcelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998312460262">38</xref></sup> created structural honeycomb core materials with SS-Li cells deposited on the walls for satellite applications. The concept was called LiBaCore. Linear arrays of cells were deposited on both sides of multiple aluminum strips. The “cell-ribbons” were welded together at periodic locations along the lengths, and compression along the length direction “buckled” the ribbons to create the honeycomb core. This work was a precursor to that described earlier by Roberts and Aglietti,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312460262">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312460262">29</xref></sup> who used Li-ion pouch cells embedded as core structure to reduce mass.

<p>ITN Energy Systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998312460262">40</xref></sup> developed “PowerFibers” in an applied-basic technical approach, which consisted of several SS-Li cell configurations (with and without lithium metal) vapor-deposited on sapphire, SiC, carbon, borosilicate glass, copper, stainless steel, Inconel, NiTi shape memory alloy, and Ti6-4 fibers with diameters ranging from 33 to 150 µm. Their analysis showed that a row of fiber cells 25 µm in diameter (or less) would provide significantly more surface area (&gt;3×) for energy storage than the projected planar (cell) area of the fiber row. They demonstrated a prototype with five PowerFibers (100 µm diameter Sapphire fibers) with an active cell area of 0.8 cm<sup>2</sup> over 5 cm length connected in parallel. Their best measured energy storage performance with the five-fiber system with a 0.63 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> constant current discharge rate showed: 43 µWh/cm<sup>2</sup> energy density delivered at 1.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power density with a midpoint discharge voltage of ∼3.2 V. Mechanical performance of the fibers was not assessed, and making reliable electrical connections with fiber-battery systems may be a challenge. Also, processing became significantly more difficult as the fiber diameter decreased below 100 µm.</p>
<p>In a more recent work, Pereira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998312460262">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998312460262">44</xref></sup> investigated Mf SP systems comprising SS-Li cells with and without photovoltaic energy harvesting devices embedded/integrated with carbon-epoxy composites. They characterized the energy storage performance of isolated cells under flexure loading up to an 8% bending ratio, defined as the ratio of bending deflection to span, and pressures up to 2 MPa, which is well above the 550 kPa pressure required for autoclave curing of the carbon-epoxy materials. They also investigated the energy storage performance of cells embedded in two different carbon-epoxy materials, cured at 177 and 120°C, subjected to tensile loading, and the effect of the embedded cells on the ultimate strength of test specimens. The results show no changes in energy capacity with flexure up to 1.8% bending ratio, pressures up to 2 MPa, and tensile loading of cells embedded in carbon-epoxy up to ∼50% of the specimens’ ultimate strength. There was no observed degradation in the tensile strength of carbon-epoxy specimens with embedded SS-Li cells. Their work demonstrated the viability of creating Mf SB composites using the SS-LI cell technology. Further work would be needed to optimize the SB designs to better match cell failure (energy storage degradation) under tensile loading with structural failure of the carbon-epoxy composite.</p>

They found that PAN-based carbon fibers showed slightly better electrochemical and mechanical properties than pitch-based fibers but that pitch-based fibers may be more appropriate in applications requiring good thermal conduction. Also, fiber sizing did not appreciably affect electrochemical performance.

<sec id="sec4-0021998312460262"><title>Multifunctional structure-battery for marine applications</title>
<p>Composites are used in UAV applications to minimize weight. In contrast, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and other marine applications are often less concerned with weight and more concerned with volume and buoyancy. In addition, marine composites must account for possible structural degradation and galvanic corrosion (metal in contact with carbon fibers) in seawater environments. When electrical power is involved, there is also a need for water-tight electrical connections and interfaces with appropriate electrical-isolation safety features.</p>
<p>Typical UUV structures can be exposed to axial, flexural, torsional/shear, and low-velocity impact loads, and potentially large (hydrostatic) pressure loads when operating at significant depths in the water (∼10 kPa per meter depth). Particularly large loads may occur with the vehicle out of the water. For example, loading/unloading the UUV from a ship deck into and out of the water can produce significant vehicle bend-loading. Typical composite structural components on a UUV include laminate skins, casings, and bulkheads, and foam-cored (buoyant) sandwich frame-support members and hull-skins for depth-pressure loading. The reinforcements are carbon- and glass-fibers or woven cloth. Thin fiberglass coating layers are typically applied over water-exposed surfaces of carbon-epoxy components for electrical insulation and galvanic isolation in the seawater (carbon is extremely noble in the galvanic series). The core materials are either a closed-cell foam or syntactic foam depending on the design depth rating.</p>
<p>Mission endurance time and/or range are important system-level metrics for UUVs. Strategies for enabling long-duration missions on UUVs involve the use of hybrid power sub-systems consisting of fuel cell (e.g., proton-exchange membrane or solid-oxide types) with on-board fuel and possibly an oxidizer plus a battery. The fuel cell provides constant power for steady-state cruise-propulsion and battery re-charging while the battery provides power for transient sprint-propulsion and higher-power payload tasks. Battery systems in existing commercial electric UUVs (sometimes called autonomous underwater vehicles or AUVs) are located within the hull. Pressurized hull space is expensive and may be used for only the more sensitive payload equipment. “Flooded” hull designs with the interior exposed to the ambient water and pressure are common, and batteries placed in a flooded hull space must be capable of withstanding and operating under the hydrostatic water pressures at depth. The amount of fuel (and oxidizer) that can be carried for the fuel cell depends on the available hull space. A battery located within the hull obviously reduces the space available for fuel/oxidizer. Embedding battery cells within the hull skin or structural frame components can free-up hull space for fuel-oxidizer or additional payload.</p>
<p>UUV range or endurance (range/velocity) is related to the available energy, discharge power, and propulsion-related factors through the force balance between fluidic drag and propulsion force at some steady-state cruise velocity, <italic>V</italic><sub>∞</sub>:

<p>In this work, we have embedded commercial Li-ion pouch cells in laminate and sandwich beam prototypes and have measured their mechanical and electrical performance to provide an assessment of their potential usefulness for marine system applications. Similar unifunctional prototypes (without cells) are used to provide a baseline for comparison. The Mf SB prototypes have been designed to achieve: (1) volumetric energy densities of 50 Wh/L or greater; and similar or better: (2) flexure properties, (3) buoyancy levels, and (4) dimensions compared with their unifunctional counterparts. Marine-grade glass- and carbon-fiber reinforced epoxies, closed-cell polymeric foams, and adhesives are used for making the Mf SB and unifunctional prototypes, and performance is assessed under mechanical flexure loading and Ragone discharge testing.</p>

The results are reported and discussed including comparisons between Mf and unifunctional performance and the implications for advancing and inserting the technology.

<p>Three structure-battery beam-prototype designs were developed to assess their mechanical and energy storage performance and their potential for underwater marine applications. The first is an integrated SB laminate “skin” beam design with two Li-ion cells “framed” in a closed-cell foam channel for position control and buoyancy compensation. The foam-cell frames are bonded to a flat (prepreg) laminate on one side and then covered on the other side by a conformal (wet-layup) laminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312460262">Figure 2</xref>). The second design is a modular SB stiffener beam with two Li-ion cells framed in a foam channel bonded to a thin flat (prepreg) laminate on one side (structural skin attachment side). The foam frame is topped on the other side by a (prepreg) laminate, which is then covered with thin conformal (wet-layup) glass layer that extends down to the flat base layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312460262">Figure 3</xref>). The third design is a SB sandwich beam with three Li-ion cells embedded in a foam core at the center (i.e., approximate neutral axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312460262">Figure 4</xref>). Unifunctional laminate skin and sandwich beam specimens without embedded cells were also designed and fabricated to provide a baseline for comparing mechanical performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312460262">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>The SB laminate and sandwich designs are intended to serve as replacements for existing marine structural components (e.g., skin and skeletal frame). The modular SB stiffener is intended to serve as a removable structural stiffener for redesigned (less substantial) structural components (e.g., skin) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref>). Modular SB components should be relatively easy to remove and replace on the system structure to avoid costly and time-consuming replacement of the SB component in the event of cell failure or degradation.

<p>The specific materials (fibers and resins), layups, and specimen thickness configurations were selected based on typical structural components used in small to mid-sized unmanned underwater vehicles. Specimen dimensions were selected to: accommodate the Li-ion cells adopted for embedding; meet the energy density, structural performance, buoyancy, and SB-unifunctional size parity objectives; and satisfy mechanical testing recommendations. For example, the prototype lengths were increased beyond their designed “unit cell” lengths to allow the beams to extend beyond the outboard flexural loading points, which define the bend-fixture span. The span-to-thickness (specimen) ratios were kept large (&gt;16 in all cases) to minimize shear effects in the deflection values.</p>
<p>Features of the SB composite designs include: braided copper strips for power bussing; epoxy-carbon layers for structural performance; epoxy-glass layers for electrical insulation of the power-busses and cells and for galvanic corrosion isolation on all the exterior surfaces; and low density, closed-cell foam cell frames sized to achieve neutral buoyancy for the combined cell-bussing-foam components (1027 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, same as seawater). The SB beam prototypes have either two or three embedded Li-ion cells wired in parallel providing a nominal output voltage of 3.7 V (same as the individual cells) and a total charge storage capacity equal to <italic>n</italic> (cells in parallel) times the nominal individual cell-capacity (2.1 Ah).</p></sec>

<p>High-performance carbon- and glass-epoxy materials (prepregs and wet layup) and resins and adhesives from Gurit SP-High Modulus were used for specimen fabrication. These materials are recommended for marine applications and are compatible with extended exposure to seawater environments.</p>
<p>The specific choice of resin system and cure cycles were guided by limitations on the maximum temperature the Li-ion cells would experience during fabrication. Based on cell manufacturer recommendations, materials were selected and fabrication procedures were devised to limit cell exposures to temperatures less than 60°C. Several compatible and co-curable epoxy resin systems and an adhesive were used. Prepregs used the SE84 LV resin (80°C cure), wet layups used the Ampreg 22 resin (50°C cure), and for potting the battery cells in the foam channels, the Prime 20 LV epoxy (50°C cure) was used. Certain fabrication assembly bonding operations were performed using Spabond 345 paste adhesive, a two-part formulation with high shear strength (30–42 MPa on steel substrate) and compatibility with the other resins.

<p>Kokam USA rechargeable lithium-ion cells (type SLPB 356495) with nominal dimensions: 3.7 mm ×<!--&#x02009;-->64 mm (68 mm with side tabs extended) × 95 mm were used as the energy-storage elements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312460262">Figure 1</xref>). These cells are nominally rated at 3.7 V and 2100 mAh, weigh ∼42 g with packaging, and have a recommended operating temperature range of −20 to 60°C. Kokam advised that short-term storage of the cells up to 80°C is possible with only slight degradation in energy capacity. Preliminary testing showed that exposures to only 60°C led to an apparent slight decline in energy storage performance (described in the discussion section). This led to the decision to limit cell exposure during processing to less than 60°C. Testing subsequent to specimen fabrication showed that these cells could in fact withstand exposures to 85°C without a measureable decline in energy storage capacity <italic>if</italic> they are first discharged to a low state-of-charge and then placed under a vacuum (e.g., composite autoclave fabrication) during the high temperature exposure. Further discussion of this and the implications for simplifying future fabrication of SB components has been included in the discussion section.</p>
<p>The outer layer of the cell packaging was nylon, and the cell had Ni-Al bimetallic strips spot-welded to each electrode for electrical connections. In preparation for assembly, the as-received cells were fully charged and then discharged to 25% state-of-charge. They were then sent out for commercial plasma-etch treatment followed by dip-coating in PRIME 20LV epoxy resin to create a protected bondable surface coating. This cell surface pre-treatment led to much improved bonding strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998312460262">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electrical wiring of the cells within the Mf SB composites was accomplished using silver-tinned, braided copper strips. A pair of 12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) strips with lineal mass density of 36.2 mg/mm was used for the main power-bus, and 18 AWG strips with lineal mass density of 8.3 mg/mm were used to connect the battery cell electrodes to the power-bus lines.</p></sec>

<p>Fabrication steps requiring temperature excursions above 60°C were performed before integrating with any battery cells. All of the flat laminate components were fabricated using the SE 84LV resin prepregs with autoclave curing for 12 h at 80°C, vacuum bagging, and 40 psig external pressure. All other (non-prepreg) fabrication and assembly steps were performed using Prime 20 or Ampreg 22 resins or Spabond 345 adhesive, all of which could be cured at 50°C. The prototype beams were fabricated in plates (three or four beams/plate), which were subsequently saw cut to create the individual beam specimens.

<p>The S-1800 SAN closed-cell structural foam was procured in 19 mm thick panels that were saw cut and then planed into 4 mm thick plates. In the foam plates slated for cell-framing, windows were cut out to hold the cells and slots were milled in the surface to accommodate the cell electrodes and embed the power buses. The surface-prepped cells were pre-wired in foam core mockups. The 18 AWG braided Cu leads were soldered to the cell terminals and the 12 AWG braided Cu bus strips with strain relief folds (see the upper two photos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312460262">Figure 7</xref>). Later, these battery-and-bus harness assemblies were carefully placed into the foam sheets of the prototype specimen plates for final potting. Examples of cells wired in-place prior to final assembly are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312460262">Figure 7</xref>.

<p>The integrated SB laminate beam of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312460262">Figure 2</xref> was fabricated starting with a pre-cured (prepreg) 5-ply base-plate of glass- and carbon-epoxy [G/C<sub>3</sub>/G], on which a 4 mm plate of machined S-1800 SAN foam framing was bonded using the SPABOND adhesive and allowed to cure at room temperature for &gt;24 h. Prime 20LV resin was used to pot the battery-and-bus harness into the foam-core frame, and the entire assembly was covered with a peel-ply and oven cured for 16 h at 50°C. A 5-ply [G/C<sub>3</sub>/G] cloth layer wetted with Ampreg 22 resin was used to cover the foam-cell plate core (conformally) down to the prepreg base, then vacuum bagged and cured at 50°C for 16 h. Three SB laminate beam specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312460262">Figure 8</xref>) were then saw-cut from the plate to the final width and length dimensions for mechanical and electrical characterization.

<p>The first step in making the modular SB stiffeners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312460262">Figure 3</xref>) involved fabricating a pre-cured (prepreg) 5-ply laminate plate of glass- and carbon-epoxy [C<sub>4</sub>/G] and then saw cutting it into 80 mm wide strips. A pre-cured (prepreg) 1-ply base-plate of glass-epoxy [G] was made, and three foam-frames (4 mm thick and 80 mm wide) were bonded to it using the SPABOND adhesive and allowed to cure at room temperature for &gt; 24 h. The battery-and-bus harnesses were placed into the foam-frames, potted with Prime 20LV epoxy, covered with peel-ply, and oven cured for 16 h at 50°C. The three pre-cured [C<sub>4</sub>/G] strips were then adhesively bonded to the tops of the battery-foam frames (glass side to foam) and allowed to cure at room temperature for &gt; 24 h. Finally, a 1-ply [G] cloth layer wetted with Ampreg 22 resin was used to cover the entire plate (conformally) down to the glass prepreg base, then vacuum bagged and cured at 50°C for 16 h. Modular SB stiffener prototypes were then saw-cut from the plate to the final width and length dimensions for mechanical and electrical characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312460262">Figure 9</xref>). Several of the modular SB stiffeners were subsequently bonded to 100 mm wide strips of pre-cured (prepreg) 4-ply glass- and carbon-epoxy [G/C<sub>2</sub>/G] laminate with SPABOND adhesive, allowed to cure at room temperature for &gt;24 h followed by curing at 50°C for 16 h, to create the specimens shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref>. The Spabond 345 adhesive creates a permanent bond, so this method of attaching a SB stiffener to structure would not normally be used as it defeats the capability for easy removal and replacement.

<p>The SB Sandwich beam of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312460262">Figure 4</xref> was made starting with two pre-cured (prepreg) 5-ply base-plates of glass- and carbon-epoxy [G/C<sub>4</sub>], on each of which a 4 mm layer of S-1800 SAN foam was bonded (carbon side) using SPABOND adhesive and allowed to cure for 24 h at room temperature. A foam-frame layer 4 mm thick for the cell-bus assemblies was then adhesively bonded to the foam of one of the above subassemblies and allowed to cure for 24 h at room temperature. The cell-bus assemblies were then placed in the foam frames, potted with Prime 20 LV epoxy, covered with peel ply and cured at 50°C for 16 h. Finally, the other prepreg-foam subassembly was bonded to the cell subassembly with SPABOND adhesive and allowed to cure at room temperature for &gt;24 hrs followed by curing at 50°C for 16 h. SB sandwich prototypes were then saw-cut from the plate to the final width and length dimensions for mechanical and electrical characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312460262">Figure 10</xref>). Unfortunately, the thickness varied substantially in the finished prototype specimens from 17.8 mm at the edges to 20.8 mm in the center due to the non-uniform thickness of the final applied Spabond adhesive layer (further details provided in the Discussion section).

<p>The unifunctional (skin) laminate specimens were saw-cut from a pre-cured (prepreg) 10-ply plate of glass- and carbon-epoxy [G/C<sub>8</sub>/G] to the final width and length dimensions for mechanical characterization. Unifunctional sandwich specimens were fabricated using the same three-layer foam core configuration as was used with the SB sandwich specimens to maintain consistency in the structural performance comparisons. All five layers (two face sheets and three 4 mm thick foam core sheets) were bonded together with Spabond adhesive, clamped and allowed to cure for 24 h at room temperature followed by curing at 50°C for 16 h. Unifunctional sandwich prototypes were then saw-cut from the plate to their final width and length dimensions for mechanical characterization.</p></sec>

Testing on the non-sandwich specimens was conducted using a long-beam flexure fixture (Wyoming Test Fixtures; three-point bending with 350 mm span) on an MTS Insight 100 test system with a 10 kN load cell. The span to thickness ratio for the laminate specimens was ∼35 or greater, which was expected to be sufficient to minimize transverse shear effects in the bending deflection measurements. A contact deflectometer (0–12 mm travel) was used to measure specimen deflection under the load application point at mid-span. The sandwich configurations (both unifunctional and SB) used the same flexure fixture and span, but required the use of a 100 kN load cell. The span to thickness ratio for the sandwich specimens was ∼16 or slightly higher, which is at the lower end of recommendations for avoiding transverse shear effects. Displacement of the sandwich specimens was measured at mid-span under the load application point using a large travel extensometer (MTS XLT; 0–970 mm displacement with optical encoded measurement) with one arm attached to the bottom of the specimen under the load application point at mid-span and the other arm attached to the base of the bend fixture (“mechanical ground”). SEM “pin stub mounts” with double-sided adhesive on the mount face were bonded to the specimens and bend fixture to provide attachment to the extensometer.

<p>All of the stiffness measurements were conducted in the elastic regime with applied deflections limited to one-quarter or less of the predicted failure deflection corresponding to tensile failure of the fiberglass outer ply-layer on each specimen. All specimens were tested at least twice (once in each orientation, face-up, face-down). Owing to the non-flat conformal surfaces of the integrated SB specimens, 6.35 mm thick butyl rubber pads were inserted between the uneven upper surface of the specimens and load fixture pads. Load-deflection data were recorded at 10 Hz during the test and then averaged post-test (either 100 or 50 points per average) to generate load-deflection data for use in slope analysis and plotting (at least twenty data points per test). Apparent bending stiffness was determined using least-squares fitting of a line to a section of the averaged load-displacement curve. Assuming negligible shear contributions, and using the slope of the load-displacement curve, it was calculated using:

<p>Strength measurements were conducted on two specimens for each unifunctional and SB configuration. Load-deflection data were recorded at 1 Hz during the test. The failure loads are identified as the maximum load achieved during testing.</p>
<p>For Ragone charge storage capacity testing, the cells were charged using commercial power-supplies/chargers with automatic CC (constant current) to CV (constant voltage) cross-over. Linden and Reddy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312460262">17</xref></sup> have provided an explanation of proper Li-ion cell charging procedures. The SB composites were charged under CC conditions at 2100 mA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021998312460262">e</xref></sup> until the voltage reached ∼4.0 V, at which point the charger would convert to a CV mode at 4.2 V applied voltage until the charging current declined to ∼1–4 mA, at which point the specimen was considered to be fully charged. Full recharging took 3–5 h depending on whether there were two or three cells in the specimen. Once fully recharged, the energy storage capacity was characterized using constant-current discharge tests at four discharge rates (C/4, C/2, 1 C and 2 C) using an Agilent 6060 B electronic load controlled by a LabView program. Discharge was terminated when the measured voltage decreased to 3.0 V. Ragone curves (volumetric: energy density vs. power density and gravimetric: specific energy vs. specific power) were determined via integration of power (voltage times current) over time. Temperature measurements were also made during some discharge tests using thermocouples mounted on the top of the SB specimen surfaces at cell mid-point locations to assess for possible overheating during discharge (particularly at the 2 C rate).</p>
<p>Specimen dimensions and weights were measured and then used to calculate mass densities corresponding to “unit-cell” lengths of the three SB prototype beam specimens; unit cell length is the distance between identical features on two adjacent cells in a given prototype beam (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312460262">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312460262"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312460262">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec>

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312460262">Figure 12</xref>, the two SB laminates have similar stiffness values, but the failure load for the Modular SB with Skin was much larger (∼2.3×) than that of the SB Laminate. Both failed by delamination along the Spabond adhesive layer contiguous with the embedded cells, on one side only between the center and an outer load point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312460262">Figure 13</xref>). For the sandwich configurations, both have similar stiffness values, but the failure load for the uni-sandwich specimens was also ∼2.3 × that of the SB Sandwich specimens. Having the same 2.3 × strength difference factor is probably just coincidence. The failure mode for the uni-sandwich specimens was compression (fracture) overload in the face-sheet. For the SB sandwich specimens, the failure mode was similar to that experienced by the SB laminate specimens; delamination along the non-uniform Spabond adhesive layer contiguous with the embedded cells, on one side only between the center and an outer load point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312460262">Figure 13</xref>).

<p>As reported in Rohatgi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021998312460262">48</xref></sup> temperature measurements were made on the specimen surfaces during discharge at the 2 C rates.

<sec id="sec11-0021998312460262" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The SB specimens have larger bending stiffnesses than their unifunctional counterparts. The SB laminate and modular SB stiffener with skin have bending stiffnesses &gt;7 × that of the unifunctional laminate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998312460262">Table 4</xref>). Clearly, the SB designs are over-designed stiffness-wise as structural replacements for unifunctional laminate skin. The skin laminate used with the modular SB stiffener was significantly reduced in thickness relative to that of the unifunctional laminate skin: 1.4 mm versus 4 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312460262">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">6</xref>). The SB designs have moved the carbon-layers out from the neutral axis due to the internal foam-cell frames, thus enhancing the bending stiffness. Multiple carbon-epoxy layers can be eliminated from the SB laminate designs, which will reduce their bending stiffness and thickness to better match those quantities in the unifunctional laminate skin they are meant to replace.</p>
<p>Strengthwise, the SB laminate failed at ∼44% of the load exhibited by the modular SB stiffener with skin. The failure mode for both configurations was delamination of the Spabond adhesive layer contiguous with the embedded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312460262">Figure 13</xref>). Fracture may have initiated by interlaminar shear and then combined with a buckling tendency of the composite ply layers on each side of the embedded cells. The modular SB + skin specimens failed at the adhesive interfaces between the foam frame + cells and the glass-epoxy and skin prepreg layers. The SB laminates failed at the Ampreg 22 (wet-layup) epoxy interfaces between the foam frame + cells and flat prepreg base and the conformal wet lay-up plies. Better bond strength with defect-free consolidation for the wet lay-up along the sides may be achieved using tapered edges on the foam frames for a more gradual transition of the conformal layer from top to prepreg base. Including some form of transverse-shear reinforcement (e.g., “z-pinning”) between the conformal and prepreg base layer interfaces along the sides of the foam frames would also significantly improve shear resistance and bending strength.</p>
<p>The SB Sandwich beams were slightly stiffer (∼1.2×) than their unifunctional counterparts, but failed by delamination in the adhesive layer at ∼43% of the load carried by uni-sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312460262">Figure 13</xref>). The higher stiffness can be attributed to the slightly larger thickness of the SB specimens that resulted as a consequence of a non-uniform adhesive bond layer thickness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312460262">Figure 10</xref> left). Recall that the 12 mm thick SAN foam cores for both sandwich configurations were made up of three 4 mm thick layers adhesively bonded together; the cells in the SB sandwich were incorporated in the second (middle) layer. They were fabricated as a plate with four beam specimens per plate. Unfortunately, non-uniform clamping pressure during bonding of the SB Sandwich plate allowed adhesive to squeeze out along the edges while trapping it in the middle. This created a significant bulge in thickness of the SB Sandwich beams at the center that did not occur in the unifunctional sandwich specimens. The non-uniform thickness results in a bowing of face sheet outwards from the specimen centerline (neutral axis), which might have produced tensile delamination stresses in that adhesive layer via face sheet buckling. Including fixed-thickness spacers in the adhesive layer (e.g., monofilament segments) and ensuring a more uniform clamping pressure can prevent this from occurring in future builds.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned factors that could affect the strength of the SB laminate and sandwich specimens, the low shear resistance of the embedded pouch cells may also have contributed to the initiation of delamination damage along the cell-composite interfaces during bending. Shear resistance of the beam in the vicinity of the embedded cells is influenced by the construction of the cells and their placement in the beam relative to the neutral axis.</p>
<p>Lithium-ion pouch cells are comprised of stacked bi-cell layers vacuum-packed in a thin, flexible laminate packaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref> of Thomas and Qidwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref></sup>). Dissection of multiple commercial brands of Li-ion pouch cells has uncovered no evidence of physical or chemical bonding between the active bi-cell core and pouch packaging. Therefore, load transfer between the core and the external packaging can occur only through frictional shear and normal compression. The vacuum inside of the packaging creates a compressive squeezing of the core at atmospheric pressure (∼100 kPa). Shear loading of the cell is resisted by frictional forces between the packaging and core, the core’s inherent shear resistance, and the shear resistance of the packaging pouch structure. The cell’s shear resistance depends on its stacking configuration and the nature of the contact/bonding between: individual bi-cell layers, the active cell core and packaging, and the cell packaging exterior and surrounding composite.</p>
<p>The Kokam pouch cells have a “Z-Fold” configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref>a in Thomas and Qidwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref></sup>) with a continuous separator layer folded at alternating edges of the cell (width) and anode and cathode material-conductor plaques alternately placed into the fold pockets. The separator layers are thin laminates of microporous polypropylene and polyethylene (e.g., PP/PE/PP, Celgard 2320) that can provide minimal shear resistance in the folds. A rolled cell configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref>b in Thomas and Qidwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref></sup>) offers better shear resistance due to bi-cell layer continuity through the folds. Stacked layers with no interlayer continuity offer the least shear resistance. The Lithylene riveting technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312460262">Figure 6</xref>c in Thomas and Qidwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312460262">2</xref></sup>) used with rolled configurations or the Z-fold configuration can provide much improved shear resistance within the active core.</p>
<p>In general, compression perpendicular to the cell plane (out-of-plane) can be accommodated to high loading levels as long as no contact occurs between the separated active layers, which will produce electrical shorting. Compression also helps to maintain cell integrity and can actually increase the cell energy capacity at high current discharge rates. This is because it reduces the thickness of the separator layers, which reduces IR losses associated with ion conduction through the porous separator. Out-of-plane tensile loading will delaminate the active core of the cell when the stress exceeds ∼100 kPa. In-plane (planar) tensile loading is resisted by parallel tensioning of the packaging and active core materials. Compression loading in the plane of the cell can lead to delamination of the bicell layers and electrical failure by layer buckling deformations. Based on these considerations, Li-ion pouch cell loading are ranked from most to least desirable: out-of-plane compression, planar tension, planar shear, out-of-plane shear, planar compression, and out-of-plane tension. Multifunctional designs should locate and orient cells within the composite structure to emphasize out-of-plane compression and planar tension modes of cell loading.</p>
<p>All load transfer through the cells must occur through mechanical contact with the packaging exterior. The Kokam cell packaging exterior is nylon, which necessitated surface treatment to achieve good adhesive bonding. The cells were plasma-etched (Fluoro-Seal's Adhesion Treatment) followed by Ampreg 22 epoxy dip-coating. Fluoro-Seal measured a 65% increase in surface energy of the cell packaging (34 dynes to 56 dynes) following their plasma treatment. Mechanical peel testing of the packaging with various surface treatments showed a 10 × increase in strength with the surface treatment (see Figure 22 of Pogue III et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998312460262">47</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>None of the SB designs met the energy density target of 50 Wh/L except for the modular SB stiffener without skin. The next best design was the modular SB stiffener with skin that came close to meeting the objective at the two lower discharge rates (C/4 and C/2), followed by the SB laminate and SB sandwich designs.</p>
<p>The ability to achieve a particular energy density in a SB specimen depends solely on the ability to control its final volume, provided of course that the embedded cells do not degrade during fabrication. The fact that the design target was not met for most of the SB specimens can be attributed to the differences between the fabricated thicknesses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312460262">Table 3</xref>) and their design dimensions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312460262">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312460262"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312460262"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312460262">5</xref>). These occurred primarily because the adhesive layer thicknesses in the SB assemblies were not taken into account during the design process. Non-uniform adhesive layer thickness, especially with the SB Sandwich specimens, also contributed. If the design thicknesses for the SB specimens had been achieved, then the 1 C capacities would have been: 75 Wh/L, 59 Wh/L, 55 Wh/L and 51 Wh/L, for the modular SB stiffener without Skin, modular SB Stiffener with skin, integrated SB laminate and the SB sandwich designs, respectively.</p>
<p>Reviewing the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998312460262">Table 4</xref> shows that the SB specimens met, or came close to meeting, three of the four design objectives with a trade-off between thickness and buoyancy. The only way to satisfy all four objectives simultaneously is to use battery cells that possess identical mechanical and physical (density) properties as the unifunctional structural material being replaced. The original mechanical and physical properties are then retained with an added bonus of electrical energy storage capability. The improbability of finding such battery cells, however, reinforces the notion that the primary focus of multifunctional design must be on improvements in system performance rather than specific material property values.</p>
<p>The Mf SB composites developed in this effort were designed to provide an increase in UUV range by increasing the net energy storage capacity of the system. Their utility vis-à-vis the existing unifunctional counterparts should be judged primarily by that metric. A higher-level assessment of multifunctional technology for increasing UUV performance would ideally compare two independent UUV system designs: one that utilizes multifunctional structure-battery components and the other that does not. The two UUVs might look very different as each would be optimized to take full advantage of the multifunctional or unifunctional capabilities offered. However, it seems unlikely that such an expensive and time-consuming development would ever be attempted. Ad-hoc comparisons and computational design studies are probably the best that can be achieved. This is clearly an area where additional research would help.</p>
<p>Some improvements can be made to the current designs and fabrication methods. The modular SB stiffener offers key advantages over SB Laminates if they can be easily removed and replaced in the event of cell failure or degradation. In this work, they were bonded to the thin laminate skin using the Spabond adhesive, which is a permanent attachment. Some form of reversible attachment that offers sufficient attachment stiffness and strength at the joint is required. Possible reversible attachment methods include: hook-and-loop (e.g., Velcro) systems or a mechanical interlocking joint design. Such attachment material/components may have significantly lower shear stiffness and strength compared with permanent adhesive bonding, and they may be much larger in thickness. These will affect the structural bending response (stiffness and strength). Solutions to this attachment challenge must be addressed in future works.</p>
<p>Integrating battery cells and wiring with structural composites significantly increased the time and complexity of the fabrication process. A key factor was the assumed high temperature limitation on the cells (∼60°C). Marine composites generally use lower temperature curing epoxies (e.g., 80°C), but cell exposure to even this low temperature level was initially thought to produce degradation in energy storage capacities. Researchers have described the decomposition of lithium-based cell electrolytes beginning at 80–85°C and possible volatility, which produces cell “puffing”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021998312460262">49</xref></sup> The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the lithiated carbon electrode (anode) can start to breakdown at these temperature levels allowing continuous reactions to occur that affect cell capacity. On the cathode, the SEI can grow in thickness, which increases the internal impedance and degrades the power delivery capability.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the clear advantages of being able to co-cure structure-battery composites at 80°C would have offset minor degradations in battery performance. A retrospective series of tests was therefore conducted to determine the effects of state-of-charge and ambient pressure (vacuum) on energy storage capacity of the cells. Three states-of-charge (10%, 50%, and 90%) and standard composite vacuum-bagging were applied to cells prior to their being exposed to 75 and 85°C for 12 h, followed by Ragone testing. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312460262">Figure 15</xref> show little apparent degradation in cell performances across the range of discharge rates. A slight decrease in specific energy was observed in the earlier tests with the cells exposed to 60 and 70°C at atmospheric pressure. The newer data indicate that short term exposure (∼12 hours) of the cells to 80–85°C under vacuum and at low states-of-charge (10% best) for curing the epoxy are acceptable. Consequently, the structure-battery composite fabrication process can be significantly simplified and shortened in time by co-curing all of the components in one-shot, which will eliminate multiple assembly steps.

<p>Finally, not addressed in this work is the need for battery management circuitry to avoid over-charge and over-discharge conditions, which can damage or ruin lithium-ion cells and/or lead to thermal runaway and consequent combustion of the cell. Battery management circuitry provides charge/discharge control for long cell life and operational safety (particularly with serial connections). Individual Li-ion pouch cells with integrated battery management circuitry are available commercially, but large capacity batteries with many cells generally require customized battery management. The separated, distributed nature of battery cells in Mf SB designs offers a safety advantage through cell-to-cell thermal isolation. Large increases in temperature in one cell are less likely to create a thermal runaway condition that can ignite neighboring cells. Also important is the need for marine-grade electrical conductors and connections capable of handling the full range of electrical currents with minimal volume/weight and little or no effects on structural performance.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998312460262"><title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>Three beam configurations of multifunctional structure-battery (SB) marine composites have been designed, fabricated and mechanically and electrically characterized in this work. The results show that multifunctional integration of battery cells with structural composites can provide significant electrical energy storage capacity while maintaining the flexural stiffness and buoyancy values associated with unifunctional counterparts. However, the SB composites developed in this work experienced degraded strength levels relative to the unifunctional counterparts and some inconsistencies in the fabricated thickness dimensions.</p>
<p>The materials and architectures associated with lithium-based cells (Li-ion and SS-Li) will never achieve the levels of mechanical performance possible with high performance fiber-polymer composites. However, the mechanical performance of Li-ion pouch type cells can be significantly enhanced from current commercial capabilities through structural transverse “Z-pinning” and cell core-package bonding strategies. Potential degradation of structural performance by embedded cells can also be minimized by intelligent integration of the cells at structural locations with deformation modes that are favorable relative to the cells’ capabilities.</p>
<p>Permanent integration of SB materials with system structure may cause problems if the cells degrade or fail or if continuous usage of the system without time for re-charging is required. Modular SB components that can be easily removed and replaced can circumvent these problems, but the integration of modular SB components with the host structure while maintaining good multifunctional performance is more challenging.</p>
<p>The key issues that must be addressed in future work include: improving the bending strength, simplifying fabrication, developing reversible attachment methods for the modular SB components, improving the electrical wiring with integrated waterproof connections, and selecting and integrating battery management circuitry.</p></sec>
