<abstract>
<p>Educators continually seek innovative methods by which to engage students. Kolb’s experiential learning theory was a catalyst for designing and incorporating a pop-up retail consignment store into a junior level retail promotion course. After five years of use and refinement, the project has proven to be a powerful method to engage students in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to add to the experiential learning literature by discussing the design, implementation and evolution of this project. A content analysis is discussed along with outcomes and future plans.</p>

<title>Experiential Learning</title>
<p>Higher education evolves to meet students’ and employers’ needs. Curricula are modified and delivery methods change with the goal of preparing successful graduates. Employers increasingly prefer educated and experienced graduates. In an effort to bridge students’ knowledge gap between “knowing-what” and “knowing-how,” educators adopt various strategies. Although typical class activities, including role-play, simulations, and case studies provide valuable practice in problem solving and reinforce course content, they often pertain to lower level applications of content in controlled situations that are ordered and manipulated by the professor.</p>
<p>A more robust choice is to engage students in experiential learning (EL). Although EL is not a new concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312460763">Dewey, 1938</xref>) it is increasingly being used by educators in recent years who typically cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460763">Kolb (1984)</xref>, who states that EL differs from cognitive learning by placing emphasis on the affect that behavior has on the learning process rather than the cognitive process itself. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460763">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> theory, EL consists of four learning modes that form a vertical continuum and a horizontal continuum, which cross one another. Abstract Conceptualization (thinking) and Concrete Experience (experiencing) form the endpoints on one continuum and Active Experimentation (doing) and Reflective Observation (reflecting) are on opposite ends of the other. EL leads students to use different learning styles throughout the learning process as well as shift between active and reflective behaviors as they move back and forth along and between continua. This makes EL suitable for a wide range of students and disciplines, including business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312460763">Gremler, Hoffman, Keaveney, &amp; Wright, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475312460763">Karns, 2005</xref>), wildlife education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312460763">Millenbah &amp; Millspaugh, 2007</xref>), psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312460763">Muir &amp; van der Linden, 2009</xref>), and engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312460763">Lee, McCoullouch, &amp; Chang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>EL involves placing students in situations where they are exposed to concepts and encouraged or required to use or manipulate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312460763">Millenbah &amp; Millspaugh, 2007</xref>). This causes students to use previous knowledge and experience and expand both in a fluid environment where actions or inactions affect the situation. As a result, a synergistic process emerges between knowledge and experience through which learning is accomplished making the material more memorable and enjoyable to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475312460763">Karns, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Examples of EL activities include internships, student teaching, cooperative education, consulting, and service learning. An in-depth discussion of different EL activities and pedagogical issues is offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312460763">Moore (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312460763">Carver (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460763">Daly (2001)</xref>. These authors present historical reviews and comparisons of EL activities and provide information that can help instructors make choices for their own needs. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312460763">Millenbah and Millspaugh (2007)</xref> present an example of how experiential learning activities can be combined in a single course.</p>
<p>Increasingly, more immersive forms of EL are being used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312460763">Millenbah &amp; Millspaugh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312460763">Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475312460763">Toncar &amp; Cudmore, 2000</xref>), where students have more control of the learning environment and the outcomes affect the real world. As such, major advantages of EL apart from learning content are building and improving skills related to critical thinking, problem solving, discussion, and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312460763">Carver, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As the use EL increases, professors seek information on the design and execution of EL activities to use as a model and to spark innovative ideas of their own. The purpose of this article is to add to the EL literature by discussing the design, implementation, and evolution of an EL project involving a pop-up retail consignment store that has been used for 5 years.</p>

<title>Pop-up Retailing</title>
<p>Historically called “seasonal” or “temporary” stores, pop-up retailers became trendy in 2003. Pop-ups enable retailers to test markets for a short period of time or build interest in new brands or products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312460763">Gregory, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312460763">Kingston, 2006</xref>). During the recent economic recession, retailers further turned to pop-ups to entice shoppers and garner exposure of their merchandise to new consumers without investing in long-term leases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312460763">Gregory, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Pop-up retailers are a natural manifestation of the obsolescence central to fashion retailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312460763">Kingston, 2006</xref>). Today, pop-ups are associated with chic shoppers who know where and when these retailers will appear and are able to take advantage before they disappear, creating an “insider-only” atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312460763">Gregory, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312460763">Kingston, 2006</xref>). Pop-ups have been successfully used by Target, JCPenney, Apple, and Isaac Mizrahi, indicating versatility across store and product type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475312460763">Howard, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0273475312460763">
<title>Students as Retailers</title>
<p>There is evidence of middle school, high school, and university students operating retail stores as part of their educational experience; however, for the most part, they are operated by student groups or volunteers outside the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460763">Daly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312460763">Hatten &amp; Ruhland, 1995</xref>). In other cases, students work with retailers with limited involvement, offering consulting, merchandising, or assembling displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475312460763">Heriot, Cook, Jones, &amp; Simpson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312460763">Manikowske &amp; Sunderlin, 2012</xref>). Though these designs offer benefits to students, they limit the risk, depth of involvement, and ownership that running an actual business involves.</p>
<p>The closest example of students operating a retail store is presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460763">Daly (2001)</xref>. Daly describes an on-line store operated on a continual basis as part of a retail management course. Store operation is continued beyond the 15-week semester through a partnership with the student marketing association. Major differences between the store described by Daly and the pop-up store in this article include, respectively, online versus in-store format, continual versus pop-up, and new merchandise versus consignment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475312460763">
<title>Course Background and Store Description</title>
<p>The project was designed for juniors enrolled in a retail promotion course in the College of Business at a mid-sized southern university consisting largely of a commuter student body. Students are traditional and nontraditional with varying degrees of prior retail experience. Handling commuters and nontraditional student issues is left to the students as a management issue related to store operations.</p>
<p>The course is part of the AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accredited fashion merchandising (FM) program. It is required for students pursuing a fashion merchandising degree and serves as an elective for marketing, management, and other business students. The prerequisites are the introductory fashion merchandising and marketing courses. The course is offered in the spring with enrollment typically between 15 and 30 students. The semester consists of lecture for approximately 8 weeks with the remainder of the semester centered on completing the project.</p>
<p>The project consists of designing, producing, operating, and analyzing the outcomes of a pop-up retail consignment store on campus. Operating a full-time retail store is impractical at the University, but a pop-up retail store offers the same basic benefits and gives students added experience of a grand opening and closing of the store location. A consignment store was chosen over a more traditional retail store for a couple of reasons. First, consignment eliminates the cost of purchasing merchandise. Second, consignment helps build relationships and fosters a feeling of coownership between the students and consignors, who include individuals and area retailers.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to provide students with practical experience in store planning, promotion, merchandising, logistics, accounting, and customer service while enhancing critical thinking and teamwork skills. Net profits fund scholarships, travel grants, honors thesis research projects, and competitive awards for students. More than 48 students have benefited financially as a result of the project since Year 1.</p>
<p>The room used is a typical, multipurpose space of 3,600+ square feet in the university student center. The store’s décor varies yearly based on what is loaned by area retailers and students. Dressing rooms are created by hanging fabric panels from the suspension ceiling system. Fixtures and mannequins have been donated over the years and loans from area retailers are used to round out the needs each year.</p>
<p>The store sells current styles of men’s and ladies apparel and accessories, ranging from formal to casual wear. Twice, students decided to add home furnishing and dorm décor to their offerings. Students decided to exclude swimwear, sleepwear, and foundation garments, and the store does not accept items suspected of being counterfeit or black market.</p>
<p>A computerized, bar-coded point-of-sale (POS) system is used to track sales, manage consignor accounts, and prepare sales reports. Credit and debit cards are accepted using PayPal Merchant Services. The customer base is primarily student, faculty, and staff; however, as student workers and customers graduate they continue to come back each year to consign and shop.</p>

<title>Considerations Prior to Project Implementation</title>
<sec id="section6-0273475312460763">
<title>Administrative Permissions</title>
<p>Several issues were addressed prior to project implementation. Administrators were informed of the planned project, followed by a meeting with campus bookstore management to discuss selling items they may have viewed as competitive to their own offerings. Permission was granted to sell non-university branded apparel and accessory items as well as home-related goods and accessories not sold by the bookstore. The room was then reserved in the student center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0273475312460763">
<title>Federal and State Compliance Issues</title>
<p>Once permissions were obtained, forms were filed with the State Tax Commission. The store operates under the University’s business license and was filed as a temporary business, which makes filing sales tax reports simpler. An Employer Identification Number was secured from the Internal Revenue Service. This made it possible to open a checking account in the store’s name, allowing the professor to maintain control of the checking account without owing individual federal income taxes on the store’s profits. Sales tax forms are filed online each year and taxes are paid electronically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475312460763">
<title>Securing a Website</title>
<p>The Internet is the method by which potential consignors can learn about the store, the consignor policies, and find tips on selecting, preparing, and pricing merchandise for sale. An inexpensive package was found online for site hosting, including a free web domain and webpage design program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1and1.com">1and1.com</ext-link>). The contract is renewed yearly and no changes have been made to the package.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0273475312460763">
<title>Store Checking Account</title>
<p>A checking account was opened in the store’s name, with two professors holding signature authority. The account was originally established as a student account, but has since been reclassified as a small business account. The checking account is used to pay consignor commissions, dispense monies to students as earlier described, pay for the website, and pay state sales taxes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0273475312460763">
<title>Project Objectives</title>
<p>The university’s teaching and learning office was consulted during the development of project objectives and student learning outcomes to insure they were measureable and appropriate for the project, for assessment, and AACSB accreditation purposes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312460763">Figure 1</xref> shows the relationship between the relevant type of program goal, project objectives, learning outcomes, and potential measurement sources for assessment purposes. Project objectives link to an FM program goal as well as two learning outcomes. Additionally, each learning outcome is linked to multiple sources and types of measures. The project scope allows for an extensively wide range of potential objectives and learning outcomes. Because the course varies year to year based on students’ decisions, these have been left general, rather than specific, to make compiling assessment data easier and to provide continuity between semesters.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section11-0273475312460763">
<title>Assigning Duties to Students</title>
<p>Year 1 students were assigned to committees based loosely on the store divisions common to retail organizations, a method also used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460763">Daly (2001)</xref>. It quickly became evident that the effectiveness of the committee system was lacking because students tended to work only on their assigned tasks rather than gaining broader experience across many types of tasks.</p>
<p>The committee system was replaced with the current system, which is based on individual tasks rather than sets of related tasks. Students apply for positions similar to submitting an application for a real job and faculty assign/“hire” students to tasks based on their application packets. By creating a competitive “hiring” process, students must consider their strengths and weaknesses and work on promoting themselves. Now each student has responsibilities in each area formerly spanned by the committees through a process of ranking their preference for specific tasks. Assigning tasks using this process is more difficult than the committee method but the outcomes are significantly better. Each year, the list of tasks and responsibilities are refined to remove those no longer necessary. The current list (Year 5) is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460763">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>How to Evaluate Student Work</title>
<p>When developing a new project, a major component is designing rubrics to assess students’ contributions. Using the project objectives as a guide, a variety of methods were devised that span different learning styles. Additionally, provisions were made to allow customers to evaluate the project through a customer service survey regarding their opinions and attitudes toward the store itself. These are discussed in greater detail in following sections.</p>

<p>Stage 3 occurs after the store is disassembled.

<title>Stage 1: The Hiring Process</title>
<p>The project is discussed on the first day of class. Students are given a week to complete a competitive application packet that includes a current resume, a semester course schedule, a ranked list of tasks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460763">Table 1</xref>), and a one-page summary of their qualifications. Students are “hired” (assigned tasks) by faculty using the following criteria: a diverse level of student experience assigned to each task, at least one student with related prior experience assigned to each task (e.g., retail experience, related work experience, internships) if possible, and the student’s desire to gain experience in a particular area. Over the years, the professor has developed a sense for which tasks are more or less demanding on students’ time and effort and which tasks are more or less in demand, making it easier to divide the tasks more equitably.</p>
<p>During the semester, students work on their assigned tasks, determining for themselves the specific steps that needed to be completed and the methods by which to accomplish them. During course lecture, the project is used as an example to bring concepts into a real life context. The execution of the project itself is also discussed daily in class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 1: Promotional Calendar and Promotional Activities</title>
<p>To track students’ progress, a master promotional calendar is used. Students post self-imposed deadlines for tasks and target dates for promotional and other activities. These are adjusted by the professor when necessary. The names of responsible students are included with each task to provide accountability. The development and use of the promotional calendar serves several purposes. Foremost it gives students an opportunity to use a promotional calendar in much the same way it would be used by a retailer. Also, it serves as a method for keeping tasks on track. Over time, a pattern emerged showing the amount of time certain tasks required to plan and complete and which tasks most directly affected other tasks. This makes it easier to assist students in setting goals and assigning students to specific tasks. The calendar was changed from paper to an electronic version saved in Dropbox, a free, cloud storage service, which allows easy access to students the ability to track when changes were made and by whom.</p>
<p>Each student bears responsibility for promotional activities. In the first year, the budget for promotional activities was zero. Since Year 2, a small promotional budget of approximately $100 is set aside from the preceding year’s proceeds. Students also benefit from the class before them from the analysis of the results of the previous year’s promotional activities.</p>
<p>A typical promotional plan includes use of Facebook, university-wide e-mail blasts, e-mails to past consignors and shoppers, submissions to community event calendars on local radio and television stations, creation and distribution of press releases to local media, and information tables around campus. Students keep what worked in previous years and modify or eliminate what did not. This has resulted in greater overall continuity and more targeted promotional activities.</p>
<p>As each year’s store-related efforts become more tested and well-established, students tend to become braver in adding promotional events. Also, the professor has a better sense of what will work and what the students can actually accomplish successfully in the available time. Year 2 students painted large banners and posted them around campus. Year 3 students secured store sponsorship by Saks, Inc., who provided table cloths, signage, and a series of advertisements in the campus newspaper. Year 4 students produced a fashion show and store launch party to benefit a local charity. Year 5 students developed a “Visit Day” for area high school students to come and hear industry speakers, tour campus, and visit the store. By allowing the class to experiment with the promotional activities, they have the ability to design an event that is of particular interest to them. As a result of their autonomy, students rise to the occasion and encourage one another toward success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 1: Website Creation and Management</title>
<p>A website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.passionforfashion.org">www.passionforfashion.org</ext-link>) was created in Year 1 that continues to serve as the primary means of communicating information to the public regarding the store. In Year 1, this was the largest task undertaken. The website is composed of several pages. The Home page has a brief introduction to the sale and an appeal for consignors and shoppers. An About Us page describes the project’s purpose and has links to the FM program information page on the university’s website. A Consignor page includes instructions for becoming a consignor, suggestions, and guidelines for preparing and pricing merchandise and instructions for dropping off items and collecting unsold items.</p>
<p>A Store Information page includes the dates and times the store is open, parking information and a link to a campus map. A Sponsor page gives acknowledgment to businesses and individuals who loan or donate items for the execution of the project. A Photo and FAQ page are also included. Today, the website requires only minor changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 1: Consignor and Store Policies</title>
<p>Year 1 students formed store policies to deal with merchandise holds, chain of command, and managing consignor accounts. These students also adopted a set of consignor policies that serve as a contract between the store and consignors. Items include statements as to ownership of merchandise, liability, and payment procedures. These policies have remained largely unchanged over the years. Year 2 students created an employee manual that established policies for student workers. This manual undergoes minor revisions each year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 1: Quantifiable Goals</title>
<p>Goal setting provides ownership and establishes accountability. Using data from previous years as a guide, students set four goals that they will later use to evaluate the success of their store: (a) the number of consignors who provide merchandise for the store, (b) the total number of items targeted for the store’s inventory, (c) gross margin (gross sales minus consignor profit), and (d) the percentage of unsold merchandise to be donated to charity by individual consignors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 1: Scheduling Students</title>
<p>Scheduling students to work is perhaps the element that has undergone the most change over the years. This was originally accomplished using pen and paper sign-up sheets posted near the faculty offices. The addition of the POS system has made this an electronic task. The system allows students to sign up for shifts online and sends automatic e-mail reminders of upcoming shifts.</p>
<p>Year 1 students were required to work three shifts of 3 hours each, which was adequate for staffing, but did not give students a “whole picture” of operating the store. Additionally, the students were quite busy assisting customers, making it difficult for faculty to work with them in small groups. Because of the unexpected success of Year 1, staffing was expanded in Year 2 and beyond to allow students from other courses in the FM program to work a 3-hour shift for extra credit with approval of their respective professors. In Year 3, the retail promotion students were given managerial authority over students in other classes. Another significant change during Year 3 was a new requirement that students enrolled in the FM program’s introductory course work a 3-hour shift. This provides them with monitored retail experience and exposes them to the store that they will eventually manage.</p>
<p>Retail promotion students are currently required to work 2 full days during Stage 2: one during Phase II (retail operation) and one during either Phase I (setup) or Phase III (disassembly). Student managers experience of a full day of retail operation as well as experience managing the set-up or disassembly of the store. The number of student managers on duty each day varies between three and five, providing them with the ability to rotate duties and accomplish their team-determined daily goals. Since work schedules are finalized prior to the beginning of Phase I, management teams are able to set daily goals and plan orientations for workers from other courses. Student management teams visit the introductory class prior to the store opening to discuss store policies, goals, and employee policies. This process works much better than anticipated and allows the professor focus more on spending time with small groups of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 2: Store Operations</title>
<sec id="section21-0273475312460763">
<title>Phase I: Store setup</title>
<p>During this phase, students gather fixtures loaned by various retailers and assemble the selling floor, cash wrap, and dressing rooms while other students receive merchandise from consignors. As time permits, students begin merchandising items for sale. A recurring challenge is having the appropriate type and quantity of fixtures. Because of the nature of consignment, students are unsure of the type and quantity of merchandise to expect, therefore 3 days (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312460763">Table 2</xref>) gives students time to troubleshoot unexpected situations and decide on solutions prior to the store opening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0273475312460763">
<title>Phase II: Retail operation</title>
<p>Phase II is when the store is open to the public. The number of days the store is open has changed from year to year. Five days (Monday through Friday) is the optimal length of time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312460763">Table 2</xref>). Each day begins prior to opening with managers counting the starting cash for registers and preparing to open the store. During each shift, students take turns working different areas in the store, including cash wrap, dressing rooms, visual merchandising, and customer assistance. Only managers handle money and operate the POS system. Students are encouraged to experiment with layout and visual merchandising. The store atmosphere allows the professor to demonstrate merchandising principles to small groups in a hands-on manner. Approximately 30 minutes before the store closes, students work in zones, straightening merchandise and making sure the store is clean for the next morning. After closing, managers reconcile the register, update consignor accounts, and prepare deposit slips.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0273475312460763">
<title>Phase III: Store disassembly</title>
<p>Phase III involves disassembling the store, final reconciliation of consignor accounts and sorting unsold items for donation to charity or for consignor pick-up. As merchandise is cleared, fixtures are dismantled and returned to their owners. This phase has evolved from 1 to 3 days since Year 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312460763">Table 2</xref>), greatly relieving the confusion of so many tasks being completed at the same time in the same space. The third day is typically reserved for cleaning the space, tying up loose ends, and giving donated merchandise to charity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0273475312460763">
<title>Stage 3: Reflection</title>
<p>Stage 3 begins after the disassembly of the store and spans the remainder of the semester. Students analyze sales data, consignor records, and shopper surveys to determine the effectiveness of their promotional strategy and the store. Students also prepare their peer evaluations and critical analysis of the project as well as submit their reflection journal at this time.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0273475312460763">
<title>Evaluating Students</title>
<p>The project accounts for approximately half of the students’ course grades. This may seem high, but the project covers several assignments that would have been assessed separately had a traditional research project and assignments been given. For example, instead of creating a mock promotional calendar, students create one that they actually use. By doing so, they experience the challenges that arise when trying to coordinate several groups’ activities and are able to learn from experience the importance of proper timing and planning for achieving their goals.</p>
<p>In addition to studying promotional strategies in class, students create their own promotional plan based on research related to the store’s target customers. They contact print and broadcast media outlets, give interviews, design promotional fliers, write web page copy, write press releases, and communicate with local businesses for support.</p>
<sec id="section26-0273475312460763">
<title>Individual Evaluations</title>
<p>In Year 1, students were evaluated in committees. This was changed to individual evaluations in Year 2. Although students must still work together, individual evaluations allow students to get direct feedback on their own contributions across a variety of tasks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0273475312460763">
<title>Peer Evaluation</title>
<p>Early in the semester, the class brainstorms the characteristics necessary for effective teams and individuals. This is refined through discussion and converted to a 5-point Likert-type scale that is used for peer evaluations. The items included rarely vary from year to year but the exercise is continued because participation in the creation of the evaluation criteria makes students more aware of the evaluation criteria and gives them ownership of the process. Categories typically include openness to criticism, characteristics affecting success, communication skills, cooperation, organizational skills, team skills, and work habits. Students take peer evaluation seriously, often writing detailed explanations. Results are distributed to students in aggregate form, including written comments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0273475312460763">
<title>Reflection Journal</title>
<p>Each student is required to prepare a journal outlining the type, magnitude, and effects of their individual and class contributions. They are also required to reflect on what they learned from the project, focusing on how previous course and work experience affected their decisions, how their experience with the store and the project in general might influence their future course work and career plans, and how different decisions would have affected outcomes. In addition to serving as a tool for the course, it also provides a record of their activities that can be later referred to when preparing their resumes and for interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0273475312460763">
<title>Performance Evaluation</title>
<p>The professor uses a performance evaluation form in which 20 characteristics are evaluated (e.g., oral/written communication, judgment, social interaction, critical thinking, customer service, work ethic). Evaluations are based on behavior throughout the semester, including all stages of the project. At the end of the semester, the professor meets with each student individually to discuss the evaluation similar to the way in which an employee performance evaluation would be discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0273475312460763">
<title>Critical Analysis</title>
<p>At the conclusion of the semester, students are required to submit a written critical analysis of the project as a whole and the store phases specifically. This takes place along with a class discussion of the project in which students analyze strengths and weaknesses of the project process and execution, including ways to make improvements. As part of this process, results of the customer survey are considered. These analyses are given to students the following year as a way of passing along the history of the store and to assist them in setting goals and making their own decisions.</p>

<p>Totals vary because of rounding.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Results show that students’ responses did span each of the four modes. The mode with the highest percentage of total responses was Reflective Observation (reflecting; <italic>n</italic> = 2,015, 29.8%) followed by Abstract Conceptualization (thinking; <italic>n</italic> = 1,827, 27%), Active Experimentation (doing; <italic>n</italic> = 1,771, 26.2%), and Concrete Experience (experiencing; <italic>n</italic> = 1,152, 17%). Given that the purpose of the reflection journal was for students to discuss what they learned and how prior knowledge was used, it is not surprising that the largest majority of responses fell into this mode. Similarly, the purpose of the critical analysis was to make students think about their project- related experiences, draw conclusions, and make recommendations, therefore providing a possible explanation for the high number of responses here as well.</p>
<p>Reflection leads to learning by allowing students to link experiences with prior knowledge in a way that leads to new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460763">Kolb, 1984</xref>). Within Reflective Observation, students’ responses were further grouped into 13 categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312460763">Table 4</xref>). Some categories relate directly to the store experience (e.g., visual merchandising, promotional planning, customer service) while others were more abstract (work ethic, self-reliance). The project allows students to think through possible courses of action and draw comparisons and conclusions from past experiences. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460763">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> model, this is called Abstract Conceptualization. The content analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312460763">Table 4</xref>) made it clear that students engaged in critical thinking. Aside from thinking about the project itself, students reported thinking about career goals, building their skill sets and professionalism in general.</p>
<p>In EL, actively “doing” involves manipulating and experimenting with concepts and situations. Students are able to see the results of their actions and make determinations as to their effectiveness. The content analysis showed that “doing” may have positive or negative results and both can lead to learning. In executing the promotional plan, students found out that sometimes good ideas only work on paper (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312460763">Table 4</xref>, Active Experimentation). In this instance, the same level of learning would not have been possible if this had been a case study or similar project.</p>
<p>Meaningful learning is rooted in experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312460763">Dewey, 1938</xref>). Through planning and executing, the project students are provided with experiences that ground course concepts. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312460763">Table 4</xref>, Concrete Experience is composed of subcategories related to putting concepts into practice. Students seemed to understand that the project afforded experience that was unique, valuable, and different from lecture-based settings as evidenced by the sample comments.</p>
<p>Results of the content analysis show a movement between doing, experiencing, thinking, and reflecting within the scope of this project. Together they provide evidence of the transformative nature of learning that takes place in an experiential environment.</p>

<sec id="section33-0273475312460763">
<title>Other Findings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312460763">Muir and van der Linden (2009)</xref> found that students who were able to show or teach others had a greater understanding of concepts than students who were unable to show or teach others. This project encourages typically quiet students to take the lead in various areas. With this leadership, they are more vocal in class discussions and appear more confident overall. Other students, whose coursework can best be described as marginal, exhibit substantial changes in class as well. Not only does their effort and grades show improvement, they assume the role of teacher to their classmates in different ways, for example demonstrating merchandising principles or how to run sales reports.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312460763">Bergsteiner, Avery, and Neumann (2010)</xref> found that the change from a passive (lecture) learning environment to an active learning environment (EL) enables students to better connect their experiences to course concepts. Students’ ability to communicate what they learned in relation to past experiences and future goals through their reflection journals and critical analyses points to more than the rote level of learning. Additionally, the project gives students real experience to use in resumes, job interviews, and later, in their careers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312460763">Lee et al. (2008)</xref> found a positive correlation between student performance and the use of EL. Although data were not formally analyzed, students’ course grades and attendance are higher than years prior to the project and fewer students miss exams than in past years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0273475312460763">
<title>Positive Outcomes</title>
<p>Through the execution of this project, students really get to know one another. They achieve a closeness as a result of working together that continues in their senior level courses and beyond. This benefit continues to bear fruit, as students graduate and develop into a network of colleagues.</p>
<p>The FM program has steadily seen an increase in public awareness. Statements and e-mails of support and curiosity were initially received during Year 1. These have given way to future expectations and requests for the store to open twice a year. Media exposure continues to grow as well. In Year 5, exposure included publicity in two local magazines, five area newspapers, coverage on two local television affiliates and two radio stations. Consignors have come from as far as 250 miles away to include their merchandise in the sale and shoppers have reported coming from as far as 100 miles away. There is also a loyal consignor and customer following. Many consignors have participated all 5 years, and there are customers that line up on opening day year after year.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for graduates to return each year to visit the store, shop, and swap stories with current students. They are curious to see how “their” store changes each year under the new management. This helps to link alumni to current students and keeps alumni active with the faculty and program. The profits the store generates are a secondary benefit, but one that has made possible the enrichment of a number of student’s educations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0273475312460763">
<title>Future Plans</title>
<p>Year 5 students think the project should be expanded and offered as an elective course for which they could enroll for an hour of credit over several semesters allowing more experienced student managers to mentor newer students. An MIS faculty member has asked about using store data as a class case study. Future plans include partnering with interior design students who will use the store as a client and working with a graphic design class to develop more professional signage and logos. Perhaps, the most interesting suggestion involves franchising the store at other universities. This would enable students in similar and complimentary programs to interact and would allow the professors to share information about the process, leading to refinement and overall strengthening of the project.</p>

<sec id="section36-0273475312460763" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As an EL project, the pop-up retail consignment store has proven to be successful. It requires students to draw from past experience, think about course content in abstract and concrete ways, actively adjust to real situations, and reflect on their actions. The interaction between students with differing backgrounds and differing business majors adds to the richness of their experience. The overall result is students who are better prepared to meet the employers’ expectations. From a teaching standpoint, the project affords valuable opportunities and is enjoyable to execute. The time devoted to the project, especially in Year 1, is great (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475312460763">Table 3</xref>), more than any other project this professor has developed, but the rewards are equally as great. Results indicate that EL is a positive addition to the FM program curriculum and that student learning occurs across the modes that make up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460763">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> EL theory. There are a number of benefits to students and faculty beyond the learning that takes place. Faculty and students get to know one another better, strengthening students’ connections to the FM program and helping faculty provide better career advising. The FM program gains publicity and has the opportunity to reach out to industry, the community, and charities. The project provides a basis for connecting with high schools for educational and recruiting purposes. There are financial and educational benefits to students who receive funding from store profits.</p>
<p>Potential exists for many courses to adopt or adapt this project, including retailing, promotion, merchandising, or management courses. The time span, type of merchandise sold, location, and semester can all be altered to fit student and course needs. The key to success is planning and flexibility on the part of faculty and students.</p>
