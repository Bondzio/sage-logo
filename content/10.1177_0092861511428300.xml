            <p>Patient nonadherence is one of the most complex problems facing clinical investigators. It not only affects clinical trial results but also could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of a medication after it has been approved for usage in the general population. Research shows that up to 30% of clinical trial participants may be discarding their study medications prior to study visits. Undetected poor adherence can result in overestimation of the dosage and underestimation of the adverse event profile. Patients in the general population will be at risk if they take the study dose but have a higher rate of patient adherence than the study participants in the clinical trial. This becomes an issue if patients after the launch receive more effective patient education than study participants in clinical trials and are more adherent. Several interventions to increase study participant adherence are recommended. The goal of study investigators should be to reach a high clinical trial participant adherence level that will not require an increase in sample size to maintain power of the study. This will give health professionals assurance that patient safety is not in danger because the dose and adverse event profile would be based on a higher level of patient adherence than would be expected in the general population after the launch.</p>

         <title>Impact of Study Participant Nonadherence</title>
         <p>Study participant nonadherence is one of the most complex problems facing clinical investigators. It not only affects clinical trial results but also could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of a medication after it has been approved for usage in the general population. The study design of a clinical trial could be flawless, but the results could be misinterpreted if study participant adherence variables are not addressed. When an adherence strategy is not built into the study design, the recommended dosages determined by a clinical trial may be too high, and adverse effect profiles could underestimate the associated patient safety concerns.</p>
         <p>The purpose of this article is to stimulate research on the impact of study participant adherence on clinical efficacy and safety as well as ways to better meet the needs of patients and improve study participant adherence during clinical trials.</p>
         <p>The possibility of a correlation between study participant adherence in clinical trials and postmarketing patient safety has not been well addressed in the literature. Between January 1969 and December 1972, only 19% of 324 clinical trials published in the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> and <italic>Lancet</italic> attempted to assess study participant adherence.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511428300">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511428300">2</xref>
            </sup> Between 1997 and 1999, clinical trial participant adherence was assessed in 47% of the studies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511428300">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511428300">3</xref>
            </sup> For medications approved during these periods, there is a possibility that study participant adherence was not assessed in the clinical trial. Many of these medications are still on the market.</p>
         <p>This issue is becoming more relevant as health professionals, insurance companies, and national consumer organizations are focusing more attention on patient adherence and taking steps to routinely teach their patients how to better incorporate the medication regimens into their daily lifestyles.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511428300">4</xref>
            </sup> This raises a potential patient safety issue if patients in the general population are more adherent in taking the full dose than were study participants in phases II and III.</p>
         <p>The following examples led to the concern that as patient adherence increases after the launch and more patients take the approved dose based on the clinical trial results, there is a possible clinical impact if patients after the launch have a higher adherence rate than the study participants in the clinical trial:<disp-quote>
               <p>1. After patients participated in a patient education program, they started developing signs of toxicity after taking the same dose they had taken before the program.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>A disease management program was developed in the early 1990s to help patients manage their disease, diet, and lifestyle and to motivate patients to take their medication correctly and stay in therapy. Customized patient education and behavior motivation strategies were integrated into both the content and design. A few months later, physicians started reporting that some patients were experiencing an increased incidence of toxicity. This was perplexing because these patients were prescribed the same approved dose they had been taking before the patient education program. Was the rate of patient adherence after the launch higher than that in the clinical trial because of patient education and motivation?<disp-quote>
               <p>2. Patients who were prescribed half the lowest Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–recommended dose showed clinical efficacy and decreased toxicity.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Several years later, Cohen<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511428300">5</xref>
            </sup> observed that his patients received the desired clinical response and had lower incidences of toxicity when he prescribed half the recommended dose.</p>
         <p>In 2005, the FDA announced that celecoxib had been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. The FDA encouraged the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. The FDA recommended 200 mg/d as the lowest recommended dose and that it should be prescribed for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511428300">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511428300">7</xref>
            </sup> Use of the lowest effective dose of celecoxib is critical because the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal toxicities are dose related.</p>
         <p>Cohen<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511428300">5</xref>
            </sup> concluded that 200 mg/d of celecoxib is not the lowest effective dose. He referred to a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week multicenter study of 1003 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee that reported higher doses of celecoxib (200 mg/d and 400 mg/d) performed best.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511428300">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511428300">8</xref>
            </sup> But the 100-mg/d dose of celecoxib provided significant improvement in all main efficacy parameters. The incidence of discontinuation of the drug because of adverse events was also lower with the lower dose of celecoxib: 8% with placebo, 9% with celecoxib 50 mg bid, 16% with celecoxib 100 mg bid, and 10% with celecoxib 200 mg bid.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511428300">8</xref>
            </sup> Patients prescribed half the lowest FDA-recommended dose showed clinical efficacy and decreased toxicity.</p>
         <p>Cohen<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511428300">5</xref>
            </sup> concluded that because a dose 50% lower than the FDA-recommended effective dose has shown efficacy for some patients, more studies are needed to determine the lowest effective doses and to make these dosages available for use.<disp-quote>
               <p>3. The FDA recommends half the previous recommended dose to decrease risk.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Recently, an alert was issued by the FDA revising the prescribing information for a cholesterol-lowering drug that the 80-mg dose should be replaced by a lower dose not to exceed 40 mg daily.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511428300">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511428300">10</xref>
            </sup> The changes were based on the review of a 7-year study that analyzed adverse events of patients taking the drug. The results indicated that patients taking the 80-mg dosage were at higher risk of developing serious muscle and liver adverse effects than those taking lower doses.</p>
         <p>The product was originally approved by the FDA in 1991.</p>
         <p>These observations led to the current questions:</p>

         <title>Impact of Study Participant Decision Making</title>
         <p>Decisions study participants make during the clinical trials can significantly affect trial results. If clinical trial participants do not understand medication instructions or are not motivated to take the study medications correctly in the clinical trial, study participant adherence will decrease.</p>
         <p>Clinical investigators often assume that medications taken during clinical trials are taken correctly. Although it is unreasonable to expect 100% compliance in a clinical trial, study investigators need to identify the adherence level that will be appropriate for the specific study medication and which needs to be met so that the power of the study is not reduced.</p>
         <p>Study participant nonadherence must be built into the methodology of every clinical trial and considered during the statistical analyses. Study participant adherence should be considered one of the outcomes of a drug trial.<sup>

            <title>Inaccurate Sample Size</title>
            <p>Although adherence in clinical trials has been reported as better than that in the general population, there is evidence that these rates overestimate actual adherence because study participants can easily manipulate measures such as pill counts and self-reports.<sup>

            </p>
            <p>A small degree of nonadherence can have a large effect on the sample size needed to detect a difference between groups. For example, a 20% to 30% decrease in medication adherence may result in the need for a greater than 50% increase in sample size to maintain equivalent power.<sup>

When this happens, the dose determined to achieve the desired therapeutic effect will be inaccurately high. Thus, poor adherence in a clinical trial may result in an overestimation of the dosage requirement of a new drug and may lead to falsely low adverse reaction rates.<sup>

            <p>Open and honest dialogue is key to developing strategies that will help improve study participant adherence. Although compliance monitoring devices can provide the study team with useful “after-the-fact” information about study participant compliance, it is equally important to take steps to motivate study participants to become more adherent and to obtain their honest feedback. Clinical trial participants can provide extremely helpful information if they understand why it is important for them to be completely honest with their study team. Once honest dialogue occurs, the study team will be able to help improve study participant adherence.</p>
            <p>Study participants also need to understand the important role they play in the clinical trial and how their actions and feedback will affect the accuracy of the study results as well as affect future patients who will be taking the study medication once it has been approved. Once study participants understand why it is important for them to take the study medications as prescribed, they will feel “safer” providing honest feedback to the study team. Study participant feedback must be recorded and analyzed because it is critical to the outcome of the study.</p>

               <p>A biomedical company has developed a “smart pill” technology that will track the ingestion of a study medication during clinical trials by using a microchip attached to the pill. When ingested, the microchip communicates with a patch on the body. When the study participant is within 30 feet of a cell phone, the information is transmitted to a computer, doctor’s office, or the investigator site. The “smart pill” has the advantage over electronic monitoring devices that can only detect a medication bottle being opened because it is able to monitor actual ingestion of the medication.<sup>

               <p>Early research shows that cell phone communication and text messaging may be an effective tool to help improve drug adherence in clinical trials. A literature review (1987-2008) on the impact of electronic monitoring of adherence in study participants on antihypertensive medications showed that giving feedback on adherence levels to clinical trial participants and physicians is a promising strategy to improve study participant adherence.<sup>

               </p>
               <p>Text messaging is a personal, discreet, and low-cost approach to increase adherence. Texting was used to determine whether it would improve medication adherence in adolescents who had orthotopic liver transplants. If the study participant did not respond within a timeframe set individually, then a message was sent to the caregiver. The study demonstrated text messaging significantly improved study participant adherence and reduced rejection episodes.<sup>

               </p>
               <p>Text messaging and cell phone communication were found to be efficient because a single health care worker could manage 1000 study participants through texts as opposed to calling only 33 participants per week. Also, study participants appreciated the messaging system because they felt “like someone cares.”<sup>

               <p>Although monitoring of study participant adherence during a clinical trial is critical, it is also after-the-fact. It is equally important to take steps to improve study participant adherence during the clinical trial. This requires gaining the trust of study participants so they provide honest feedback, providing informed consent documents and treatment instructions in language clinical trial participants can understand, and using effective packaging and reminder alerts when appropriate.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Study participant mismanagement of medications, whether intentional or not, is a complex and potentially major variable in clinical trials that could be affecting the statistical analyses. Undetected poor adherence or failure to increase sample size to maintain the power of the study can result in overestimation of the dosage and underestimation of the adverse event profile. Patients in the general population will be at risk if they take the study dose but have a higher rate of patient adherence than the study participants in the clinical trial. This is becoming an issue as patients after the launch are receiving better patient education than study participants did in clinical trials.</p>
         <p>The key to improving study patient adherence during the clinical trial is to identify all the potential adherence barriers and then develop evidence-based educational and behavior modification strategies.</p>
         <p>The goal of study investigators should be to reach a study patient adherence level that will not require an increase in sample size to maintain power of the study. This will give health professionals assurance that patient safety is not in danger because the dose and adverse event profile would be based on a higher level of study patient adherence than would be expected in the general population after the launch.</p>
