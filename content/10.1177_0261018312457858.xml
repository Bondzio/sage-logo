<abstract>
<p>Job loss has negative consequences for health and evidence shows that the agency of workers experiencing job loss is affected by labour market and welfare policy. The policy environment into which workers emerge after losing their jobs strongly influences the way job loss and its aftermath is experienced. This article draws on findings from two waves of in-depth semi-structured interviews with 33 retrenched South Australian automotive workers. It discusses how, within the context of Australian welfare and industrial policy, workers experienced the consequences of mass job losses that occurred at Mitsubishi Motors during 2004 and 2005. Key findings include largely negative experiences associated with negotiating welfare-to-work policy, and a more precarious employment environment further entrenched under industrial relations policy. Job loss is both a personal and a structural story and we use an agency and structure perspective to examine how workers’ agency was enabled, but more often constrained, by policy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organizational downsizing and layoff of millions of workers in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261018312457858">Cascio, 2003</xref>) has included mass job loss in the automotive industry. Job loss results from the termination of a worker’s employment due to planned company closure or downsizing, economic change, company organization, or increased use of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261018312457858">Parker et al., 1971</xref>). Job loss is also a discrete life event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261018312457858">Holmes and Rahe, 1967</xref>), with potential for a range of adverse impacts. This ‘chain of adversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261018312457858">Price et al., 2002</xref>: 302) has long-lasting effects including depression, health problems and impaired psychosocial functioning. Job loss has consequences for workers in declining manufacturing industries, as many full-time jobs have been increasingly replaced by casual, insecure and part-time work in the last few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261018312457858">Carney and Hanks, 1994</xref>). Workers engaged in these more precarious or ‘flexible’ forms of work are named the ‘precariat’ – ‘dependent variables acted on, rather than actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261018312457858">Lipsig-Mumme, 2005</xref>: 25, 26). Welfare state policies play an important role in mediating job loss and/or its aftermath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457858">Castel, 2005</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457858">Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, 2007</xref>: 41) by either exacerbating or ameliorating the consequences for workers who are retrenched (i.e. laid off because their jobs have become redundant and so have been terminated).</p>
<p>Australian job loss research has primarily taken a quantitative approach, especially on labour market outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261018312457858">Wooden, 1987</xref>). While some more recent Australian qualitative research has focused on agency and subjective experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457858">Lambert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261018312457858">Pond et al., 2002</xref>), there is a gap in the literature regarding how policies shape these experiences. Ignoring policy and structures shaping job loss may lead to workers being blamed for being the victims of broader economic and social forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261018312457858">Willis, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure and agency perspective on job loss</title>
<p>This article presents research that explored the structural and policy context of workers’ experiences as they responded to job loss at Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL) in South Australia during 2004 and 2005. The research focuses on retrenched workers’ experiences of wider industrial and welfare reform, including engaging with welfare-to-work policy through privatized Job Network employment agencies. Two typologies of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457858">Hoggett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261018312457858">Lister, 2004</xref>) help theorize workers’ perspectives. Lister’s typology focuses on agency and participation embedded in unequal economic relations. Agency responses are conceptualized in terms of ‘(just) getting by’ and the more strategic ‘getting out of’ (constrained circumstances) at the individual level; and ‘getting back at’ (constraining agents and/or structures) and ‘getting organized’ strategically for collectively overcoming constraints at the political or collective level. Hoggett’s model also acknowledges constraints to agency from individuals’ unique interior selves, represented under different subject positions spanning the ‘active agent’ and the ‘passive object’ at different times and under different circumstances. A structure and agency perspective helps theorize the impact of job loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261018312457858">
<title>The restructuring of Mitsubishi Motors in South Australia</title>
<p>Industry restructuring and job loss at Mitsubishi occurred in response to an adverse global operating environment and decline in Australian market share from 13.7% in 1993 to 7.4% in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457858">Lansbury et al., 2006</xref>: 72). In May 2004 Mitsubishi Motors Japan announced the closure of its South Australian engine plant and partial downsizing and closure of its assembly plant. The resulting acute incident of mass job loss affected more than 1000 workers by 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457858">Baker, 2007</xref>). At this time the national unemployment rate was 5.3% and 45,800 South Australians were unemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261018312457858">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This mass redundancy became a trigger for both political and policy action, especially as Australia was facing a federal election in 2004. Half the Mitsubishi workforce lived in the federal electorate of Kingston in South Australia, located in southern Adelaide and held by the Howard Coalition Government with a margin of only 0.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261018312457858">Hutchinson, 2004</xref>). The federal government’s response was an $AUS50 million Structural Adjustment Fund including $AUS10 million for employment and training, job search support, career counselling, retraining and other assistance for retrenched workers. This was through a Job Seeker Account, a notional account for each Job Network agency, attracting credits according to a job seeker’s locational or labour market disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457858">Australian National Audit Office, 2007</xref>). Self-employment assistance was available for business start-up, and negotiable employer subsidies of up to $4000 were incentives to hire retrenched workers.</p>
<p>$AUS40 million was allocated towards attracting local investment. The South Australian Government also allocated $AUS5 million towards employment and industry diversification in southern Adelaide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261018312457858">Spoehr, 2004</xref>). Job loss was therefore experienced within a unique Australian political and financial context, albeit as part of an enduring neoliberal policy trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261018312457858">Beeson and Firth, 1998</xref>). While this research was conducted during the era of the Howard Government (a Liberal [conservative] and National Party [conservative] coalition), the two preceding Labor Governments had also embraced neoliberal economic reforms. However, these had been implemented within the context of a Prices and Incomes Accord negotiated between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with policies favourable to social security beneficiaries and low wage earners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261018312457858">Eardley, 1997</xref>). Assistance to job seekers was provided as part of evolving and contested welfare and industrial relations policies that mesh to shape job loss experiences.</p>

<sec id="section4-0261018312457858">
<title>Job loss policy context: Welfare and industrial relations</title>
<p>Under the liberal welfare state of the second half of the 20th century, the welfare of unemployed people was a broader societal responsibility exercised through the mechanism of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261018312457858">Harris, 2001</xref>). In the late 20th and early 21st centuries when more neoliberal policies held sway, unemployment has been understood as a moral state, with bi-partisan support for individuals taking greater responsibility for their own welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457858">McDonald and Marston, 2005</xref>). From the last quarter of the 20th century Australian income support has itself been in ‘an almost seamless process of retrenchment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261018312457858">Cook, 2004</xref>: 123). The welfare state has been reconceptualized as a generator of risks rather than a protector against risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261018312457858">Williams, 1999</xref>), with functions shifting from meeting needs to managing risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261018312457858">Giddens, 1994</xref>). The corresponding shift in nomenclature is from a welfare or providing state to an ‘enabling’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261018312457858">Giddens, 2010</xref>), motivating individual welfare recipients’ agency through welfare reforms.</p>
<p>At the time of the Mitsubishi restructure industrial relations changes introduced under the Howard Coalition Government (1996–2007) were instigated in tandem with changes to welfare policy: twin pillars of welfare reform. The policy context for retrenched Mitsubishi workers was Mutual Obligations welfare policy and Work Choices industrial relations policy that converged when a person left a job or was made redundant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261018312457858">
<title>Mutual Obligations welfare policy</title>
<p>In the decade from 1996 welfare dependency was addressed through the unambiguously named ‘Work for the Dole’ programme. While signifying continuity with earlier bi-partisan neoliberal policies, Mutual Obligations demanded that recipients give something back in return for income support. ‘Work-first’ policy was predicated on a view that the best approach to re-employment was to find any job as quickly as possible, regardless of pay or conditions; often resulting in a ‘one-way transition into low paid work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261018312457858">Peck and Theodore, 2000</xref>: 119). Mutual Obligations policy largely discounted structural issues including labour market transformation, economic cycles, and other constraints creating the need for welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457858">Henman, 2002</xref>). Demands for participation shifted from a policy of welfare-to-work to ‘welfare-as-work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261018312457858">Ziguras et al., 2003</xref>). Policy aimed to replace dependency, ‘free-loading’, ‘dole-bludging’, passivity and demoralization with activity, purpose, responsibility and enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261018312457858">Dean, 1995</xref>). A newly created social security agency, Centrelink, referred clients to a network of private for-profit and not-for-profit Job Network service providers which took over from the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) established in 1946. These changes were in tandem with industrial relations policy reforms.</p>

<sec id="section6-0261018312457858">
<title>Work Choices industrial relations policy</title>
<p>Legislative changes in the 1990s sought to marginalize the role and power of unions vested in collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457858">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>). The Keating Labor Government gave first formal recognition to direct bargaining. This was strengthened under the Howard Coalition Government, culminating in Work Choices legislation enacted in 2005. Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) were lodged with the Employment Advocate in place of the Industrial Relations Commission as an ‘independent umpire’. The Australian Fair Pay Commission set minimum wages and awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261018312457858">O’Neill et al., 2007</xref>), with free market economist Ian Harper appointed first Fair Pay Commissioner. Exemptions to unfair dismissal laws were extended from workplaces with up to 20 workers, to workplaces with up to 100 workers. Unions’ rights to workplace entry and industrial action were curtailed. AWAs no longer required the application of a no-disadvantage test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457858">Hartman and Darab, 2006</xref>). This policy was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261018312457858">Hall (2006</xref>: 292) as ‘the most fundamental revolution in industrial relations since Federation’ on 1 January 1901. Work Choices policy would impact on retrenched workers’ agency when transitioning out of Mitsubishi.</p>

<sec id="section7-0261018312457858">
<title>The employment policy interface: Job Network</title>
<p>Retrenched workers and other welfare recipients mainly experience industrial relations and welfare policies when engaging with frontline human service organizations or ‘street-level bureaucrats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261018312457858">Lipsky, 1980</xref>). By 1998 the contractually-based Job Network commodified workers’ welfare within a job ‘market’: a quasi-market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457858">Le Grand, 2003</xref>) funded by the state and executed through competitive tendering. Job Network’s integral role and scope in respect of the Mitsubishi retrenchments was highlighted by the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457858">Andrews, 2005</xref>) who explained that over half the former workers had been helped into new jobs through the Job Network. While not indicating the types or duration of jobs, Minister Andrews highlighted the importance of welfare-to-work policy for transitioning out of retrenchment.</p>
<p>Job Network, a work-first policy underpinned by sanctions, had been promoted by the then Minister for Employment Services Tony Abbott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261018312457858">Abbott, 2000</xref>) as a ‘generator of social capital’ and ‘creator of happier, more fulfilled individuals living in stronger, more dynamic communities’. Yet research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261018312457858">Marston and McDonald (2008</xref>: 259–260) identified three ways in which Job Network was experienced negatively by clients. Firstly, frequent face-to-face or telephone contact from providers did not result in jobs; secondly, the requirement to undertake generic job search training was not tailored to individual needs; and thirdly, there was a perception of ‘under-trained and overworked employment consultants offering “unhelpful” advice’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261018312457858">Marston and McDonald (n.d.)</xref> state that their research with both employees and users revealed that neither agency workers nor clients were happy with Job Network. The researchers concluded that the policy interface between frontline case managers and clients was not conducive to good outcomes because of the clash of rationalities between New Public Management practices and the normative goals and functions of human service organizations. These organizations incorporate a guiding principle of social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261018312457858">Jones and May, 1992</xref>). The research question in this paper asks how welfare and industrial relations policies shaped job loss experiences and affected Mitsubishi workers’ agency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261018312457858">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>The qualitative research discussed in this article used data generated from a two-year longitudinal study (<italic>n</italic> = 371) examining the impacts of job loss from Mitsubishi’s two automotive plants in southern Adelaide in 2004–2005. Ethics approval was granted by the Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee prior to commencement. The study was multidisciplinary, conducted together by housing, health, and labour market researchers using mixed methods to collect three waves of survey data and two waves of semi-structured in-depth interview data. It focused on job loss impacts on social capital, health and well-being, housing, employment and labour market outcomes. After their first survey, participants were asked if they would participate in an in-depth interview about their job loss. Forty interviewees were randomly selected from the 264 respondents who agreed and were interviewed across two waves of qualitative research between November 2005 and July 2007. Framework analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457858">Ritchie and Spencer, 1994</xref>) was employed for data analysis. This involves five steps spanning a familiarization process, identifying a thematic framework, coding, rearranging data into charts to aid the writing-up process, and mapping and interpretation. By using this framework we have drawn out the ways in which the industrial relations and day-to-day translation of welfare policies by street-level bureaucrats were part of the complexity for retrenched workers responding to job loss.</p>
<p>This article is based on data from the 33 respondents who completed both interviews. The interview sample comprised 27 men and six women, reflecting the employment gender balance of both the longitudinal study and the Mitsubishi workforce. Their median age was 47.4 years with an age range from 29 to 63 years, and the median employment term at Mitsubishi was 19 years, spanning 1 to 39 years. Workers held diverse positions within the corporation ranging from managerial to process or production work. One respondent earned more than $130,000; three earned between $78,000 and $130,000; nine between $52,000 and $78,000; ten between $41,000 and $52,000; and ten below $41,000. This was when average wages in Metropolitan Adelaide in 2004 were $37,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261018312457858">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A research strength is that the cohort was vocationally diverse, spanning production workers to managers, whereas other studies have often focused on one occupational group. A weakness is that the longitudinal study only represented approximately one third (371) of workers facing retrenchment, and the qualitative interviews included only 33 of these 371 respondents. In representing the gender mix of the research cohort and the Mitsubishi workforce, the research was largely male-focused.</p>

<sec id="section9-0261018312457858">
<title>Findings: Retrenched workers and the policy terrain</title>
<p>This section presents findings on the retrenched workers’ policy interface, with welfare policy acting in concert with industrial relations policy to affect their agency. Overall, our findings revealed commodification of workers’ welfare, stricter welfare conditionality, constraints to union power, and more precarious employment. Workers’ subsequent employment or post-employment status and experiences are outlined below to contextualize the broader findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261018312457858">
<title>Post job loss employment</title>
<p>At the time of their second interviews 21 of the 33 workers (64%) were in some form of paid employment. Three held full-time and two held part-time permanent positions, with the others engaged in a range of work spanning relatively secure to more precarious forms of casual or short-term contract work. Two workers (6%) were unemployed and looking for work. Ten workers (30%) were no longer in the labour force: five were on Disability Support Pensions, two were receiving a carer’s allowance, one was living off her partner’s redundancy package, one was on Austudy (a government support scheme for people aged 25 or older who are studying or under a full-time Australian apprenticeship), and one was retired. These employment outcomes, while favouring those who are not in the labour force (most probably due to such workers having more time to participate in a research study), in general reflect the sample of workers in the broader sample at a similar time after redundancy (74% of whom were employed, 5% unemployed and 20% not in the labour force).</p>
<p>The pay and conditions at Mitsubishi were in contrast to those many of the workers experienced in precarious new employment. Tracy stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got two agencies that I work for just to keep the work up because every now and then you might get 20 hours one week and then you’ll get 50 hours the next week … you’ve got to take it while it’s there because the next week it might not be. And you don’t get holiday pay and sick pay. (Tracy, age 31, production worker who became a personal carer: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ronald also experienced precarious employment, explaining:
<disp-quote>
<p>The guy I’m working for is not in a very good financial position. I’ve drawn up a wages bill that’s getting a little bit out of hand and he can’t pay me. So all sorts of promises and I’m looking at going somewhere else. I have been to a couple of other places on contract but only for a week at a time and there’s nowhere else to go so I may as well go back there, ’cause I don’t feel like hanging around here [home] all the time. (Ronald, age 62, draftsman on contract positions: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Raymond, aged 51, a maintenance fitter who became a part-time security officer, stated in his first interview: ‘There doesn’t seem to be jobs around for people my age and particularly or almost definitely no permanent job. It seems to be casual. They’ll take you on for maybe a couple of days’.</p>
<p>However, compared with outcomes for many other workers made redundant, these broader structural changes in the labour market were mediated for many Mitsubishi workers by an enabling financial buffer. Mitsubishi was widely recognized as a good employer who negotiated comparatively generous redundancy packages with the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) based on employment longevity. Workers acknowledged that redundancy packages were ‘better than other companies’, ‘a big help’, or ‘made life a lot better’; even though negotiated under industrial relations policy entrenching the decline in union power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261018312457858">
<title>The impact of industrial relations policy</title>
<p>One way workers have historically gained employment protection is from being part of the collective agency of union membership. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457858">Lansbury et al. (2006)</xref> explain, there has been a low level of industrial disputes in the automotive sector. As borne out in respondents’ accounts, the union mainly focused on negotiating higher redundancy packages for retrenched workers. Some workers described or alluded to the impact of Work Choices industrial relations policy within the context of their subsequent employment, and their understanding of constraints to union power. Wally criticized this policy through his comments about
<disp-quote>
<p>What [Prime Minister] Howard’s trying to do with the workers now because even though we say the workers at Mitsubishi are highly skilled, they’re not trades people and I believe that trades people and professional people would be all right under this legislation [Work Choices] but I don’t think us type of workers will do so, yeah. I think if I was a violent person I think Mr Howard would be a nervous person because of what he’s done. I think he’s betrayed the working-class people of Australia, to be quite honest. (Wally, age 63, vehicle auditor who became a Disability Support Pension recipient: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several workers explained that although the union was helpful, its ‘hands were tied’. One worker claimed ‘the only thing probably the union went for was how much we were worth while we were getting our payouts’ (Owen, age 56, sand plant operator who became a security worker: first interview). The union’s curtailed role was a common theme, with workers stating there was ‘not a lot they [the union] could do’, or ‘in a global marketplace there are no guarantees’. In making a three-way conceptual link between welfare and industrial relations policies and the normative role of unions Ralph claimed
<disp-quote>
<p>They [the union] probably should have been more involved with seeing how all this money’s been handed out to the Job Network mobs and whether they’re using it for the workers or just using it to line their pockets, because that is what I reckon they’re doing. (Ralph, age 39, trainer in casual work: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Subjective accounts revealed that many workers had negative experiences of transitioning from Mitsubishi to more precarious forms of employment; experiences compounded by welfare-to-work policy and engaging with Job Network.</p>

<p>Workers’ accounts of engaging with Job Network often included responses that bring to mind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457858">Bourdieu’s (1999)</xref> concept of <italic>social suffering</italic>, incorporating both material and psychosocial elements. A majority of interviewees called upon Job Network as one of three formal post-redundancy support structures, the others being MMAL and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU). While several workers spoke positively about Job Network, our findings suggest that the experience was overwhelmingly negative, and acted to constrain their agency.</p>

<sec id="section13-0261018312457858">
<title>Positive experiences</title>
<p>Workers’ positive accounts of Job Network included that ‘they helped as much as they could’, that they ‘offered more than lip service’, and that the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) for small business start-up was a valuable post-retrenchment option. Mitsubishi workers were fast-tracked in their labour transition by being officially classified as long-term unemployed, thereby becoming eligible for more intensive assistance. Rosslyn stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>We got all the assistance. You [usually] have to be unemployed for a good 12 months before you get half the assistance that we got, so that was really good. (Rosslyn, age 45, personal assistant who became an office worker: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Likewise, Keith, aged 39, a former machinist, claimed to have received helpful and friendly service and had quickly found a suitable job. However, positive experiences were in a clear minority.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0261018312457858">
<title>Negative experiences</title>
<p>Workers’ negative accounts of Job Network included: a mix of perceived ‘hassling’ and also a lack of personal attention; paternalism; limited or incorrect information provision; and lack of transparency and equity in service provision.</p>
<sec id="section15-0261018312457858">
<title>‘Hassling’: Meeting agency administrative requirements</title>
<p>‘Hassling’ of retrenched workers describes the unhelpful and perceived unwarranted intrusions by Job Network providers as part of complying with demanding administrative requirements under outsourced service provision. In both sets of interviews workers spoke of frequent unhelpful and disruptive telephone calls from Job Network:
<disp-quote>
<p>They [Job Network] keep changing, they call them case managers. I think every time I go [in] there they’ve got someone new looking after me. And I keep getting phone calls or messages on the internet telling me I’ve got an appointment at such and such a time to talk about a job. I just get sick of ringing them up. (Owen, age 56, a sand plant operator who became a security worker: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ronald spoke of ‘hassling’ by providers who were
<disp-quote>
<p>absolutely hopeless, absolutely hopeless. When I went to them they did provide a little bit of training and that’s alright but since I left Mitsubishi all they do is hassle me. They ring me up every fortnight and ask me how many hours I have worked. (Ronald, age 62, draftsman in casual work: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tracy told of being constantly interrupted in her new work:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you’re at people’s homes you’re not supposed to get phone calls, and they [Job Network] were constantly ringing me, ‘Oh hi, [Tracy] are you getting enough work?’ I’d go, ‘I’m actually at work at the moment, can you not ring?’ And they’d ring me nearly every week when I was at a job. (Tracy, age 31, production worker who became a personal carer: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>‘Hassling’ of a different kind was experienced by Doreen, volunteering under Mutual Obligations policy but also obliged to apply for five jobs per week, alongside other negative experiences. The demand to seek paid work was later overturned by Centrelink as it had been imposed in error, but only after what Doreen described as a ‘big battle’ in which she felt:
<disp-quote>
<p>They [Job Network] treated me like I’m a dole bludger, if you understand what I mean? I’ve worked since I was 15 and I’ve got a pretty solid history of employment. They just treat everyone the same, like you’re just really trying not to work. I’m not like that at all. Service providers were professional bullies because they just try and intimidate with words and they just try and make you feel as though you’re not doing your job, looking for work properly and I know I was and they’re not prepared to listen …They’re not finding jobs for me at all. They [Job Network] may for other people. If I had a trade of some sort I’d probably be very easy to place but I haven’t. They don’t help you get a job, they try and make you do all the work. The comment was that if I get a job I have to tell them where I’ve got it so they can then say to Centrelink, or whoever, it is the payment for placing me. (Doreen, age 59, canteen worker who became a volunteer: second interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While some workers felt they were ‘hassled’, others claimed they had little contact with Job Network providers, or received unhelpful or limited service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0261018312457858">
<title>‘Not what I needed’: Unhelpful or limited service provision</title>
<p>Respondents’ accounts cited limited contact with service providers, and/or unhelpful or inappropriate assistance under active welfare policies in which individuals are required to take greater responsibility for managing their own labour market transition. Sylvia, a sewing machinist who found her own job as a casual cleaner, commented on the low level of service provided to her partner who had experienced concurrent retrenchment from Mitsubishi. She claimed:
<disp-quote>
<p>They’re all young kids, a lot of the ones that he’s been to are these young kids straight out of school and it’s ‘Oh yeah we’ll get you a job’ and that’s it, [husband] never hears anything from them. (Sylvia, age 55: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Workers’ comments indicated that Job Network often did not provide directly helpful interventions. Instead, respondents claimed they were ‘offered so much and provided with so little’, or that ‘you never heard from them [service providers]’. As Michael explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>So I joined [named employment agency] but when I walked into them and said ‘Well this is my CV, there’s my degree, that’s my salary’, even the girl that I was with [employment service provider] turned around and said ‘Well basically we can’t help you. I can get you a job as a furniture packer, I can get you a job as a fruit packer, I can get you a job, maybe as a team leader on night shift on something or other’. But none of it was geared up for salary positions. So all of my interviews and all of my own letter writing, and all of that, were done by myself. (Michael, age 39, maintenance manager in a lesser management role: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261018312457858">Kerr et al. (2002)</xref>, contractualism involves the risk of fragmented services; a point made by Michael who stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>It just highlighted as a person seeking employment that the Job Network providers are not even linked … at least when we had the CES [Commonwealth Employment Service] everything was all with the CES. If there was a job advertised it was advertised with the CES. It was all connected: you didn’t have these private little registries all getting government grants and employing all sorts of people to do wonderful things.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another respondent stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>They just took our name and put us on their books and that was it. They got our money and that sort of thing so I was very, very, disappointed in the whole employment thing. (Richard, age 45, process engineer: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Reflecting back in his second interview Richard claimed:
<disp-quote>
<p>They were hopeless, totally hopeless … The resume they gave me wasn’t any good so I had to redo the resume … [There was] no training, no individual training, no exit training that I needed …[They] had money but I don’t know where all that money went to. It didn’t come to us.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other workers spoke of limited or incorrect information provision from Job Network and Centrelink. Dudley, aged 53, a maintenance fitter who chose the flexibility of contract work, presumed that limited information on available income support was predicated on distrust, or what the US welfare-to-work policy architect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261018312457858">Mead (1997a)</xref> views as unemployed people seeking to maximize their own self-interest. Dudley stated in his second interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>If they [Job Network providers] let out too much information everyone would want to get on the bandwagon and perhaps some – they were concerned about abuse of the system perhaps. So that’s why they kept things tight to their chests. So, clearly, it’s very difficult because you really didn’t know what you were entitled to.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In one instance, incorrect Centrelink information on Austudy provisions led to the loss of several weeks’ pay for Garth, aged 37, a trainer undertaking tertiary study. In Garth’s view, at the time of his second interview this situation had still not been properly resolved following a formal appeal. He explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>They were okay to start with but they did let me down big time overall … This last semester they said my time and money had run out. Well my money hadn’t, because I know I’d done my sums … So I’m on my own now. I’ve got to fund the last year of my studies on my own.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section17-0261018312457858">
<title>‘You’ve got to be more motivated’: Experiencing paternalism</title>
<p>Paternalism is a feature of active welfare policies, with welfare recipients deemed to lack the motivation which must be instilled by persuasion, compulsion or both: a combination of aid and structure or ‘help and hassle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261018312457858">Mead, 1997b</xref>: 62). Some Mitsubishi workers felt they were treated as if requiring the services of contracted ‘employment accelerators’ or ‘motivators’, despite many having worked for over 30 years and being keen to find other positions. Highlighting again workers’ experiences of ‘hassling’ on the one hand, and lack of contact from providers on the other, Rex explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>They had this other thing, this motivation when outside people come in. They did quite a bit. Like I think the week they were there I reckon they might have got four of the people out of twelve a job. They were called Employment Accelerators. They were purely motivational people. They did help you but they did get a bit pushy, push, push, which I suppose is good. I went to two inductions from that but I didn’t hear anything back. (Rex, age 60, trainer seeking work: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, this strategy was highly contentious for Ralph, aged 39, a trainer in casual work who complained in his first interview that ‘They [Job Network] did nothing. They just sat there and said “you’ve got to be more motivated” and all that’. In his follow-up interview Ralph reflected:
<disp-quote>
<p>And then I find out at the end when I signed off and got a full time job that they had taken $1500 out for that one day [motivational] course. I thought ‘You’ve got to be joking me, this is pathetic!’ They didn’t tell me that course was going to cost $1500 out of that payment, you know what I mean? … I think all the money, the whole lot of the money that is set aside for getting a job should be given to the person, and like monitored by the government; not given to the Job Network or whatever, who really do nothing.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section18-0261018312457858">
<title>‘Ripped off’: Lack of transparency and equity in resource provision</title>
<p>As well as experiencing hassling, unhelpful and seemingly arbitrary provision, and paternalism, workers also cited perceived lack of transparency and equity in service provision. Businesses were offered wage subsidies or incentives for hiring retrenched workers. While a potentially beneficial strategy for employers, retrenched workers and the state, Reg questioned the longer-term security provided by a 13-week employer subsidy scheme, stating:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m there for the thirteen weeks, because the government have offered a Workskil incentive. I think it’s the $4000 government grant for every employee that is used to help you in regards to certification and in regards to finding areas that you want to be in, and I got told that it only runs for 13 weeks and then after 13 weeks they drop you off the face of the earth. (Reg, age 41, section manager who became a bus driver: first interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Reg reflected in his second interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>To be honest with you I think it’s all a big scam … the people that employ you take advantage of that too because they’re being wage subsidised by the government to take me on, you know. They should be taking me on my merit, not for the simple fact that they’re getting a hand out from the government to take me on … My biggest gripe would have to be the fact that people out there were able to take advantage of Mitsubishi employees in regards to wage subsidy and all that sort of stuff – cheap labour, cheap pay and just exploitation as far as I can see. Like some of these places were paying like $14, $15 an hour you know. That’s crap for an adult employee. That’s what a kid gets working at McDonald’s. That’s not an Australian decent wage.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Perceived lack of transparency and equity in Job Network service provision related to both financial resources and providers’ personal effort. Richard stated in his first interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really had a go at them [service providers]. I couldn’t get hold of the person who was in charge of me and I wanted their assistance which I didn’t get. Some people got assistance, some people didn’t … I heard other people got laptops, it was really a selective system, a few that knew the system. Nearly all my friends were all managers, they got all that, where the workers didn’t. I was an engineer but some engineers got it but some missed out because we weren’t told we were entitled to it. (Richard, age 45, process engineer in contract work)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ralph, aged 39, a trainer in casual employment, claimed in his first interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>What it has done is you learn never to trust anything to do with any of those Job Network mobs. It was a big scam. It’s got to be …Went to one bloke’s 40th [birthday] and that’s all we discussed, how all the money’s getting ripped off everyone and no-one is getting anything for it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Maxwell understood that Job Network was ‘a business like any other business’ but did not know how accountable they were. He also surmised that the focus was not on securing longer-term employment, stating:
<disp-quote>
<p>Then it all happens again. You know the person then loses that job and away you go again and they get another $2000 bucks or whatever – I don’t know how it works but it seems like that … They promised a fair bit of help initially but then because I was one of the last to leave, towards the end then they started talking about, ‘Oh, the dollars have all been used and this and that’ … ‘Not as much money left in the kitty’, so I can’t have as much as what some of the others got. (Maxwell, age 34, maintenance manager who became a small business owner: second interview)</p>

<p>Workers’ accounts reveal the largely negative experiences associated with not only negotiating a more precarious employment environment following job loss, but also the additional structural barrier of welfare-to-work policy.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section19-0261018312457858" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our research explored Mitsubishi workers’ experiences of job loss as a result of industry restructuring and the decline in the automotive sector. Many workers moved into precarious employment including casual, part-time, and short-term work. This occurred within the context of global imperatives under which entrepreneurial risk is passed from corporations to workers in order to achieve workplace changes understood as necessary for corporate survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457858">Abbott and Kelly, 2005</xref>). Economic globalization, a key factor in industry restructuring, has taken the form of tariff cuts, trade liberalization and other policy measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261018312457858">Baum, 2008</xref>). These become structures impacting on workers’ agency.</p>
<p>The Mitsubishi workers’ accounts of interacting with broader policy structures also revealed the ways in which industrial relations and welfare policies converge as another structural layer impacting negatively on their agency: potentially ameliorating, but mainly compounding, more insecure employment arrangements. Already difficult experiences were often exacerbated in negative ways at a particularly challenging time in respondents’ lives. More constraining industrial relations policy was experienced within the context of declining union power and poorer employment conditions. Welfare policy was experienced within the context of negotiating with the privatized Job Network. While some workers cited positive experiences, many more spoke of ‘hassling’; unhelpful, limited, or fragmented service provision; paternalism; and perceived lack of transparency and equity.</p>
<p>Although we only have workers’ accounts of engaging with the privatized Job Network, and not a comparison with the former Commonwealth Employment Service which was part of the Australian Public Service, the literature suggests that some specific negative features come into play with privatization. Firstly, service users often lack sufficient information to make informed choices about the private provider they wish to engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261018312457858">Lowery, 1998</xref>). Secondly, providers’ knowledge about the market is constrained by organizational behaviour which promotes secretiveness, especially in respect of contract negotiations and in-built commercial-in-confidence provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457858">McDonald and Marston, 2008</xref>). A report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457858">Catholic Social Services Australia (2006)</xref> on the appropriateness of services, provider incentives, and government administration of Job Network, states that financial and ratings incentive systems do not provide maximum support for the government’s stated objectives in assisting job seekers. The report states that the Job Network provider incentives lead to perverse outcomes including delayed service provision and placement; shorter-term placements that have higher provider rewards but lead to clients’ earlier return to welfare dependency; poorer quality placements that are sometimes supported by excessive wage subsidies to employers; and fewer placements for more disadvantaged clients. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261018312457858">Cowling and Mitchell (2003</xref>: 216) explain that incentives lead to practices of ‘creaming’ or ‘cherry picking’ of those clients most likely to be easily re-employed, with a high proportion of clients being ‘parked’ (left unassisted) once they are found to require intensive assistance or are deemed ‘hard to place’ in new work.</p>
<p>Workers’ responses to job loss may be understood from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261018312457858">Lister’s (2004)</xref> agency perspective. Respondents did not engage in collective action either for ‘getting back (at)’ Mitsubishi, or for ‘getting organized’ by taking industrial action or collectively advocating for longer-term change. With the lack of enabling policies agency responses were instead individualized, and using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261018312457858">Lister’s (2004)</xref> agency matrix, we can see that more enabling policies may have led to agency responses that moved beyond limited ‘(just) getting by’ or coping, by facilitating more strategic or ‘getting out of’ responses for overcoming unemployment and gaining longer-term security. Enabling policy structures allow individuals to shift, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457858">Hoggett’s (2001)</xref> terms, from being constrained ‘passive objects’ to more ‘creative, reflexive agents’.</p>
<p>Our findings confirm the importance of the complex interplay between agency and structure and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457858">Carpenter et al. (2007)</xref> point out, this interplay also underpins remedies or alternative policy paradigms. Respondents’ accounts therefore raise the question of how public policy may better support retrenched workers’ agency in the face of job loss. An implication is the need to reinstate a welfare culture largely lost under neoliberalism: treating people humanely and not as commodities. Retrenched workers’ successful reintegration into the workforce requires time devoted to a more service-oriented and client-centred policy approach, instead of focusing on individuals’ own problem-solving. This would facilitate expanding individuals’ capacity for creative agency and responsibility, as social protection, incentives, and capacity building all go hand-in-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261018312457858">Carney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to gauge the extent to which Mitsubishi workers’ job loss experiences were the direct result of welfare and industrial policies, or were mainly due to the ongoing decline in automotive manufacturing. This decline is in part the result of changing automotive consumer preferences, local manufacturers’ falling profitability levels, appreciation of the Australian dollar since 2002, and competition in a low tariff environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261018312457858">Commonwealth of Australia, 2008</xref>). Multi-factorial explanations include the complexities of different interacting structural levels: i.e. global, national, state, industry and corporate. While these structures account for the high job losses, the prevailing policy environment largely accounts for workers’ post-retrenchment experiences. This is due to the hegemonic link between globalization and changes to capitalism, and the prevailing neoliberal economic theory underpinning welfare and industrial policies. Job Network is one expression of welfare policy implementation under a neoliberal policy paradigm designed to enable work participation but, in practice, most workers in our study found it mainly dis-abling. Irrespective of industry sector, the overall decline in manufacturing means that casualized and more precarious employment outcomes are likely to remain an enduring feature of the Australian employment landscape. Arguably, without a policy shift, the negative post job loss outcomes experienced by Mitsubishi workers will endure for other Australian workers facing inevitable future job losses. In the first wave of redundancies since the Mitsubishi closure, Toyota cut 350 jobs in January 2012. A former head of Mitsubishi has stated that local automotive assembly plants have a limited future in Australia. Both Ford and Holden could close within seven years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457858">Hannan, 2012</xref>), with workers dealing with job loss consequences within the context of prevailing welfare-to-work policy.</p>
<p>However, even with the limitations of the Australian welfare ‘safety net’, as framed and delivered under neoliberal policies and reflected in workers’ comments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261018312457858">Newman et al. (2009)</xref> point out that, unlike in some countries, in Australia this safety net is still a critical factor for ameliorating the more catastrophic impacts of structural job losses. Together with Australia’s universal health system it provides a range of state benefits, albeit contested in the scope of their provision. Another enabling structure for Mitsubishi workers was the funding of relatively generous redundancy packages negotiated between Mitsubishi and the AMWU, despite declining trade union power. These benefits represent a vestige of, and stand as a testament to, earlier aspirations for more enabling policies in western nation states.</p>
<p>With economic globalization and neoliberal economic hegemony now underpinning welfare and industrial relations policies, the extent to which retrenched workers can exert their agency is limited. A more enabling policy approach would allow for intervening positively in the lives of retrenched workers and other welfare recipients; mediating the focus on engaging individual agency to the extent that this denies the power of structural forces. In light of our research findings confined to the automotive sector, future research may provide insights on the impact of industrial relations and welfare policies on workers’ job loss experiences in other industry groups, and the specific experiences of women.</p>
