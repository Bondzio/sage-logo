<p>Anita Prazmowska, the noted historian of Poland’s tribulations in World War Two, now tackles the wider picture of Poland since 1918. Her Introduction is broadened further to consider the period of Partition – from 1795 – when Poland disappeared from the map. The purpose of the retrospective is to highlight a main theme that, whilst Western Europe pursued modernization through free markets and widened electoral representation, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe concentrated on national self-determination. During this process ‘Polish nationalism, from being associated with progressive thinking, became exclusive, inward-looking and ultimately provincial’ (xi). Nor did rebirth in 1918 alter this introspection: Poles continued to assert their own independence, whilst denying a similar right to eastern neighbours.</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson’s Thirteenth Point had singled out Poland as a deserving national group, but fell short of declaring when Polish statehood would be restored and also left unclear its future borders, though his focus on land inhabited by ethnic Poles suggested that claims to Lithuanian, Belorussian and Ukrainian territories would not be supported. The subsequent Versailles Treaty and the founding of the League of Nations mark the high point of idealism in International Relations, but were overshadowed for Poland by territorial ambitions in the East. The survival of the Bolshevik Revolution, despite its defeat on the Vistula (1920), was a further complication. By the end of the 1930s, Poland was ‘ruled by a regime which was no more than a military coterie’ (xi) and – despite heroic military resistance – fell easy prey to the Nazi–Soviet Fourth Partition. From 1941, Franklin Roosevelt supported national self-determination as a means of countering empire, but also pursued a policy of accommodation with Stalin’s territorial aspirations. In earlier books, the author has shown Churchill’s championing of, but inability to restore, Poland’s independence. Geo-politics prevailed, thus dividing the European continent.</p>
<p>The Soviet model of modernity was very different from Polish aspirations. Whilst any post-war government would have faced the same tasks of reconstruction and rebuilding, Stalinism from 1948 imposed its own ideological agenda. Its main features, state ownership of industry, collective agriculture imposed by force, and anti-clerical campaigning, continued after Stalin’s death. The immediate post-Stalin uprisings in East Germany and Czechoslovakia had no Polish counterpart. But the first uprising, at Poznan in June 1956, a mass workers’ rally for improved supplies and working-conditions, became within hours a nationalist demonstration. Such uprisings were extinguished brutally.</p>
<p>Poland escaped the fate of Hungary in autumn 1956, largely because of Khrushchev’s willingness to trust Gomulka, who was restored to the Party leadership from which he had been purged in 1948. The Soviet non-invasion of Poland is an interesting puzzle which the author will be able to elaborate in her forthcoming biography of Gomulka. In the end, it was a further uprising on the Baltic Coast in 1970 which led to his downfall and ushered in a decade of opening Poland to the West. But the costs of the Western borrowing became unsustainable by the mid-1970s, leaving the authorities with the tricky task of imposing hefty price rises on the population. These led to the most famous occupation in Gdansk in August 1980, after which the authorities reluctantly sanctioned the Solidarity trade union.</p>
<p>Despite the set-back of martial law (December 1981), the union survived underground and was able to re-emerge in mid-decade, more or less simultaneously with the Gorbachev accession. There follows a complex series of shifts in Soviet policy. Gorbachev initially disfavours Solidarity but later he comes tacitly to accept its re-emergence. From mid-1988 he presses Polish leaders to grant it a place in government. His quiet, behind-the-scenes-diplomacy comes to fruition in spring and summer 1989, with Poland in the vanguard of political transformation. Post-communist Poland is a state returned to sovereignty, but paradoxically, its entry into the European Union ‘ends the nationalist dream of self-determination’ (262).</p>
<p>This dramatic story is clearly told and not overloaded by detail. Whilst politics is paramount, the approach is impartial. The author gives appropriate attention to economic policy and shifts in social structure. A proneness to misprints could be corrected in a second – or perhaps Polish – edition, which could also use the new Polish historiography of the communist period. Here Prazmowska has given us an excellent and balanced account of modern Polish history, enhanced by a fine series of black-and-white illustrations. Her Gomulka biography should be an apt sequel.</p>
