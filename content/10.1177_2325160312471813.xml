<p>The number of adults with diabetes using insulin in the United States is approximately 29%, about half the number that experts say it should be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Incorporating research and science into the application of improved therapies and clinical practice has historically been a slow process. It is well-known that it takes years to change clinical practice habits. However, with the increased access we have to review new science through web-based articles, reviews, and discussion forums, as well as a continually growing cadre of clinical journals, the hope going forward is that the time from bench research to clinical practice will be greatly decreased, therefore improving patient outcomes and decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes. That’s what the department of Capsules is all about.</p>
<p>In this department, we’ll explore the latest findings related to the field of diabetes and attempt to formulate and condense this plethora of knowledge into practical sound bites you can apply to your real-world clinical practice. All this being said, it segues nicely into the gist of this issue’s topic.</p>
<sec id="section1-2325160312471813">
<title>Old Habits and Beliefs Are Hard to Break</title>
<p>We all have our favorite way of teaching and explaining a subject—our favorite meter, the insulin or insulin pump we’re most comfortable working, the props we work with—and as a result it takes more than a casual bump to move us out of our comfort zone. (See this month’s <italic>Mind Sights</italic> article.) So it’s completely logical that when it comes to needle length and injection technique, we may read and hear one thing yet find it hard to come to grips with changing our everyday practice to reflect what we’ve learned.</p>
<p>Despite all the evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of insulin therapy, the number of adults with diabetes using insulin in the United States is approximately 29%, about half the number that experts say it should be. There are numerous reasons given for this, the main ones being “psychological insulin resistance” and physician and patient “needle phobia.”</p>
<p>The latest evidence regarding needle length and injection technique may go a long way in helping to resolve this reluctance to use insulin, provided that diabetes educators and clinicians alike understand and adopt new thinking. As fear of injection is one of the primary causes of this dilemma, diabetes educators can contribute greatly to solving this issue by understanding the latest evidence concerning needle length and injection technique.</p>

<title>Shorter Needles, More Insulin Use?</title>
<p>Recent research about adequate needle length and injection sites versus skin thickness may change the way clinicians and patients view insulin therapy. The latest evidence sheds new light on how needle length affects glycemic control along with hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events among all our patients, including those who are overweight and obese.</p>
<p>The goal of insulin and insulin injection is to deliver medication into the subcutaneous space, meaning that the needle has to get through the outer layer of skin (epidermis and dermis) without inadvertently going too deep and entering the muscle (IM injection). If an injection is too deep, insulin is absorbed faster, possibly causing hypogly-cemia but also not lasting as long and maybe being more painful. If the injection isn’t deep enough, the insulin goes into the skin, which affects the insulin’s onset and duration of action as well as causing leakage from the injection site to occur.</p>
<p>The belief that has been held for many years and is common among clinicians today is that a longer needle is necessary for adequate absorption from injection sites in obese individuals. Newer evidence shows that previously recommended needle lengths, such as the 12.7 mm or half-inch needle, are too long for many adults. In addition, needle lengths thought to be adequate for children, such as the 8 mm needle, actually increase the risk of IM injections and hypoglycemia.</p>

<title>Research Shows Shorter Needles Work</title>
<p>A study conducted by Gibney and associates concluded that the 4 mm insulin pen needles worked as effectively as the 5 mm or 8 mm needles in maintaining glycemic control in patients whose BMI ranged from 20 to 49. Issues of possible leakage from injection sites with the shorter needles were also laid to rest as it was comparable (no statistical difference) for each of the 3 needle lengths used. The fact that leakage occasionally did occur to some degree at each site demonstrates the need to remind patients to count slowly to 10 after each pen injection. Also of interest in this study was that patients reported less pain with the shorter 4 mm pen needle than with either the 5 mm or 8 mm needle.</p>
<p>Combining the newer shorter needles with insulin pen devices may add an even greater acceptance of insulin use by patients and possibly an increased adherence rate. What better way to decrease the angst in a patient than to pull out a demo pen and needle to show them what we’re really talking about! If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the real thing has got to be priceless. We keep these demos around just to show patients early on that if the progressive nature of diabetes does lead to insulin injections, then this is what we’re talking about.</p>

<title>The Closing Argument</title>
<p>A consensus panel (the Scientific Advisory Board for the Third Injection Technique Workshop) consisting of 127 injection professionals from 27 countries reviewed 292 articles related to injection issues. The key recommendations from the consensus panel concerning injection technique and needle length are:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471813" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is no clinical reason for using needle lengths longer than 8 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Needle lengths less than 8 mm are adequate for passing through the skin and reaching the subcutanous layer in most adult patients. Skin thickness is relatively constant across genders, injection sites, and BMI, which allows for adequate penetration with the shorter needles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 4, 5, and 6 mm needles may be used by any adult patient regardless of BMI and generally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>do not require a lifted skin fold, especially when using the 4 mm needle. Injections with these needles should be given at a 90 degree angle to the skin surface for all but slim individuals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Slim individuals may need to pinch up a skin fold, especially when using a 5 or 6 mm needle, to avoid possible IM injections.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients should count slowly to 10 before withdrawing an insulin pen needle from the skin after injection to prevent leakage at the injection site, regardless of needle length. Larger doses may require counting longer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Injection site rotation is often overlooked and still needs to be emphasized in insulin injection training.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is no medical reason for recommending needles longer than 6 mm for use by children and adolescents. When using the 6 mm needle, an injection angled at 45 degrees may be used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While the 4 mm needle may be inserted at 90 degrees for many children without the aid of a skin fold, thinner children may still need to inject using the skin fold technique.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use special care to avoid indenting the skin upon injection in children to decrease the possibility of an IM injection of insulin. If injecting into an arm, a skin fold should be lifted.</p></list-item>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence-based studies such as these and those mentioned by the consensus panel provide us with the data needed to change clinical practice in a shorter time span—clear and concise guidelines for clinicians to refer to with confidence. Bringing this new science to our patients in ways that they can understand, along with reinforcing safe, effective, and more comfortable insulin injection techniques, aligns perfectly with our roles as diabetes educators.</p>
<p>My hope for the department of Capsules is that we can explore issues such as these along with the latest in science and studies and find new ways to incorporate our learning into clinical practice. Any ideas that you might have as to articles or subjects that address these areas are welcome. Please accept this formal invitation to submit them to this department as we share new paths to better care. ■</p>
