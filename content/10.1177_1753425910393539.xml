<abstract>
<p>Otitis media (OM), a common infectious disease in children, is associated with bacterial middle ear (ME) infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important mediators of innate immune responses, and TLR9 specifically recognizes the unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs in bacterial DNA. Additional sensors of foreign DNA have recently been identified. The role of DNA sensing and TLR9 was investigated in a murine model of OM induced by non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi). Expression of genes related to DNA-sensing pathways involved in innate immunity was assessed via DNA microarray, qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Middle ear responses to NTHi were examined in wild-type and TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice by histopathology and bacterial culture. Expression of TLR9 signaling genes was modestly up-regulated during OM, as was TLR9 protein in both ME mucosal cells and infiltrating leukocytes. However, genes known to be regulated by CpG DNA were dramatically up-regulated, as were genes involved in DNA sensing by DIA, Pol-III and AIM2. Toll-like receptor 9 deletion significantly prolonged the inflammatory response induced by NTHi in the ME and delayed bacterial clearance. The results suggest that DNA sensing via TLR9 plays a role in OM pathogenesis and recovery. Alternative forms of DNA sensing may also contribute to OM.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1753425910393539" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Otitis media (OM) is an extremely common pediatric disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425910393539">1</xref></sup> While uncomplicated OM typically resolves without treatment, about 10–20% of children develop more serious chronic or recurrent disease requiring antibiotic therapy or surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910393539">2</xref></sup> The cost of OM, including treatment and lost productivity, is estimated at more than $5 billion annually in the US.</p>
<p>The etiology of OM is complex. Eustachian tube dysfunction, cognate immune status, prior viral infection and allergy are all known to contribute to susceptibility to OM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910393539">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910393539">4</xref></sup> However, bacterial infection is the ultimate cause of most acute and/or recurrent OM, with non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) the most commonly isolated pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425910393539">5</xref></sup> Otitis media is characterized by inflammation of the middle ear (ME), mucosal hyperplasia, the development of effusion, and leukocytic infiltration of the tympanic cavity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425910393539">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910393539">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>While cognate immunity is critical for the defense of the body against infection, it requires the naïve organism 1–2 wk to mount an effective cognate response to a new pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910393539">8</xref></sup> Therefore, the first line of defense against infection must be served by innate immune responses that do not require prior sensitization. Innate immunity is mediated by receptors that recognize molecules produced by pathogens, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including proteins, lipids, lipoproteins and nucleic acids. The best-characterized of these innate immune receptors are the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425910393539">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910393539">10</xref></sup> but there are many other types of receptors that participate in innate immune defense, including the NOD-like receptors (NLRs).</p>
<p>Non-typeable <italic>H. influenzae</italic> produces a variety of PAMPs that are recognized by innate immune receptors. These include endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide, similar to LPS) recognized by TLR4, as well as lipopeptides recognized by TLR2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910393539">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910393539">12</xref></sup> It is likely that NTHi also produces peptides and lipopeptides that can activate the NLRs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910393539">13</xref></sup> and bacterial RNA has been shown to activate both TLRs (including TLR3 and TLR7) and NLRs, especially the NALPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910393539">14</xref></sup> However, bacterial and other forms of non-self DNA are very important PAMPs, and several pathways for their recognition exist. All of these receptors for DNA are intracellular, requiring internalization of DNA for recognition. However, internalization of NTHi by respiratory epithelial cells has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910393539">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425910393539">17</xref></sup> While this internalization occurs independently of DNA receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910393539">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910393539">16</xref></sup> it would potentially expose the receptors to bacterial DNA.</p>
<p>Toll-like receptor 9 is localized to endosomes, and recognizes unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs that are common in bacterial, but not mammalian, DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425910393539">18</xref></sup> Access of TLR9 to bacterial DNA is enhanced by the modulator HMGB1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910393539">19</xref></sup> Exposure of TLR9 to bacterial DNA results in the recruitment of signaling molecules, leading ultimately to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425910393539">18</xref></sup> Toll-like receptor 9 is also thought to contribute to the development of effective cognate immunity through facilitating development of the inflammasome. In this role, TLR9 has been targeted, employing immunostimulatory sequences of DNA (ISD), to enhance immune responses to pollen allergens for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425910393539">20</xref></sup> Other non-self DNA receptors have recently been described, which are cytoplasmic and which activate innate immune effectors such as cytokines and IFNs. These include DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factor (DAI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425910393539">21</xref></sup> absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425910393539">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910393539">23</xref></sup> and RNA polymerase III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910393539">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425910393539">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The signaling cascades activated by receptors for pathogen DNA are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910393539">Figure 1</xref>. Like other TLRs, TLR9 utilizes the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88, which leads, via the activation of NF-κB, to the production of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. We have shown previously that MyD88 and TNF-α are important for the resolution of OM caused by NTHi infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910393539">26</xref></sup> However, the role of TLR9 in this disorder has not been well characterized. Toll-like receptor 9 has been found to be a significant mediator of inflammation at other sites, and to synergize with other TLRs that we have found to be involved in OM pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425910393539">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425910393539">29</xref></sup> Moreover, in a model of sepsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425910393539">30</xref></sup> mortality was reduced by its inhibition or in its absence. In addition, reperfusion injury in the liver has been shown to be decreased by inhibition of TLR9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425910393539">31</xref></sup> These studies emphasize the potential for TLR9 signaling to contribute to disease and injury pathogenesis.

NTHi internalized as intact bacteria or fragments releases DNA, which can interact with specific pathogen DNA receptors. Toll-like receptor 9, located in endosomes, signals primarily via MyD88 to stimulate NF-κB and cytokine production. DAI can activate IRFs, leading to type I IFN production, via several intermediaries. Pol-III can convert bacterial DNA into dsRNA, also activating IRFs. DNA interaction with AIM2 recruits ASC and procaspase1 to form an inflammasome, leading to caspase1 activation and IL-1/IL-18 maturation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753425910393539-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>With respect to other pathways able to recognize pathogen DNA, DAI signals via a complex of proteins associated with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum to activate IRF3 and IFN production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425910393539">21</xref></sup> Pol-III transcribes bacterial DNA into RNA, where it is sensed by RIG-1 and also induces IFN production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910393539">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425910393539">25</xref></sup> Upon interaction with bacterial DNA, AIM2 complexes with (ASC) and pro-caspase 1 to form an inflammasome, leading to caspase 1 activation and subsequently to maturation of IL-1 and IL-18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425910393539">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910393539">23</xref></sup> The role of these innate immune DNA sensing pathways in OM also remains unexplored.</p>
<p>Simple injection of bacterial DNA into the ME seemed unlikely to be informative, since all of the receptors noted above are intracellular and entry of DNA into cells is most likely dependent upon other bacterial elements. To determine whether pathogen DNA plays a role in bacterial OM, we characterized, using DNA microarrays, the expression of genes involved in the DNA sensing pathways described above, as well as genes known to be induced by their activation, during the course of OM induced by NTHi in mice. In addition, we evaluated OM in mice that are genetically deficient in TLR9 (the only non-self DNA sensor for which a gene deletion mouse is commercially available) using a well-established model of NTHi inoculation of the mouse ME.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425910393539">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425910393539">33</xref></sup></p>

<p>For DNA microarrays, 40 C57BL/6:CB F1 hybrid mice per time point were used. The TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> and C57BL/6 mice were divided into groups of six mice for each experimental time point (3 each for histopathology and bacterial culture).

<p>Expression of selected genes involved in DNA sensing was evaluated in wild-type mice by DNA microarray. Forty wild-type ME mucosae were harvested at each of the following intervals: 0 (no treatment), 3 h and 6 h, as well as 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 d after NTHi inoculation. The tissue was homogenized in TRIzol™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and total RNA was extracted. RNA was labeled and hybridized to two Affymetrix MU430 2.0 microarrays. This procedure was then duplicated for each time point to obtain an independent replication.

<p>To assess the functional role of TLR9, we investigated the ME response to NTHi inoculation in TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice, as compared to wild-type controls. The wild-type mice exhibited a typical response to NTHi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910393539">26</xref></sup> This response included hyperplasia of the ME mucosa, which reached a maximum thickness 2 d after inoculation with NTHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910393539">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Mucosal thickness remained elevated at 3 d, and then recovered to baseline by 5 d. Toll-like receptor 9<sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited modestly, but significantly, greater thickness of the ME mucosa prior to NTHi administration, compared to wild-type mice. However, in contrast to wild-type mice, NTHi induced no significant increase in mucosal thickness for the first 3 d after inoculation. Thickness then increased from days 5–14, with recovery not complete at the longest post-inoculation time point examined.</p>
<p>The infiltration of cells into the ME lumen of TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice after NTHi inoculation was assessed by measuring the percentage of the ME lumen covered by cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910393539">Figure 4</xref>A). Infiltration peaked at 2–3 d in wild-type mice and then declined to low levels. No cells were present in the ME lumina of uninoculated TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Moreover, after inoculation, ME cellular infiltration in TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice was not significantly different from that observed in wild-types. However, when individual cell types were assessed, significantly fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes were observed in the ME exudates of TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice at 1 d and 3 d after inoculation, when compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910393539">Figure 4</xref>B). Macrophage infiltration was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910393539">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, two TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> MEs showed both neutrophils and macrophages at 14 d after NTHi inoculation, more than one week after these cells had been cleared from all wild-type mouse MEs. In these two cases, the kinetics of both cell types might have been delayed by lack of TLR9.

The TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> MEs were very similar to wild-type MEs from days 1–3 after NTHi inoculation, with 3/6, 4/6 and 2/6 MEs positive for bacterial colonization, respectively. In contrast to wild-type, CFUs could still be detected at 5 d and 10 d, with two culture-positive MEs out of 6 at each time. This observation suggests that bacterial clearance is compromised in the MEs of TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice, compared to wild-type animals.

<sec id="sec22-1753425910393539" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this investigation, we obtained evidence that detection of DNA by intracellular innate immune receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of NTHi-induced OM in mice, and also plays a role in bacterial clearance and OM recovery. After NTHi infection of wild-type mice, the expression of genes encoding DNA sensing receptors and many associated downstream signaling genes, as well as a number of target genes, was up-regulated. Moreover, animals deficient in TLR9 exhibited altered OM, consisting of prolonged and enhanced morphological signs of mucosal hyperplasia and inflammation, as well as a delay in bacterial clearance and OM recovery.</p>
<p>Interestingly, TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed greater baseline thickness of the ME mucosa than wild-type mice, in the absence of overt signs of inflammation such as effusion or leukocyte infiltration. The reasons for this are not clear. It seems unlikely that TLR9 would directly influence mucosal growth. However, it is possible that prior ME infections with bacterial species unrelated to NTHi are responsible.</p>
<p>Genes encoding proteins that participate in the DAI/Pol-III signaling pathway were most strongly up-regulated during OM, suggesting the potential for a significant role for these DNA sensing cascades in this disorder. However, genes that are known to be directly regulated by this pathway, including type I IFN genes, showed only brief, modest up-regulation. Interestingly, genes that negatively regulate these pathways were also up-regulated. This implies that inflammation produced in response to the activation of these pathways is tightly regulated. This may help to explain why DAI/Pol-III target genes were only briefly up-regulated.</p>
<p>The DNA sensing pathway that showed the least gene regulation of its signaling molecules during OM was TLR9, with only one adapter molecule and one negative regulator showing strong up-regulation. In contrast, the expression of genes that are known to be preferentially regulated by the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425910393539">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425910393539">42</xref></sup> were dramatically enhanced. Moreover, OM in TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice was more severe and prolonged than that in wild-type animals. These disparities may be clarified by the results of immunohistochemistry for TLR9 protein. Little TLR9 protein was detected in the resting ME, and only scattered mucosal cells were positive for TLR9 during OM. However, more TLR9 was present in infiltrating leukocytes, which may bring TLR9 protein into the ME pre-formed.</p>
<p>The small amounts of TLR9 induced in epithelial cells may nevertheless be important. The lower level of neutrophil infiltration observed in the MEs of TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910393539">Figure 4</xref>B) was particularly noteworthy. NTHi up-regulated the neutrophil chemokine, CXCL5, in wild-type mice more than 30-fold at 3, 6 and 34 h after inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910393539">Figure 2</xref>B and Supplementary Table 2). Since CXCL5 is known to be preferentially induced by CpG DNA via TLR9, it is possible that a reduction in the production of this mediator may contribute to reduced neutrophil chemotaxis in response to NTHi infection in the TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> ME.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we and others have found that the TLR signaling molecule MyD88 plays a significant role in OM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910393539">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425910393539">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425910393539">45</xref></sup> In fact, this adapter can be required for OM recovery, since OM induced by NTHi in MyD88-null mice persists for weeks, and bacteria can be cultured from some MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> MEs 6 wk after bacterial inoculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910393539">26</xref></sup> While TLR9 primarily employs MyD88 to activate downstream signaling and target gene expression, and MyD88 gene expression was up-regulated during OM, the more severe phenotype observed in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice reflects the demonstrated role of other receptors that signal via this adaptor, including TLR2 and TLR4<sup>9</sup> and IL-1 receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425910393539">46</xref></sup> Deletion of TLR2 or TLR4 also prolongs OM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425910393539">29</xref></sup> Thus TLR9 participates as one component of a broader innate immune response to NTHi that is mediated via MyD88.</p>
<p>Evidence for a complex role of TLR9 is provided by the behavior of cytokines in the ME of TLR9-deficient mice. The expression of cytokine genes is preferentially regulated by NF-κB, which often functions downstream of MyD88. This can include cytokines that are either pro- or anti-inflammatory. We noted significant changes in the expression of mRNA encoding indicator cytokines chosen to represent each category, TNF-α and IL-10, respectively. Initial expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α during OM was unchanged in TLR9-null mice, but expression was higher at later times, in a biphasic manner, when compared to wild-type. However, expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was also dramatically up-regulated later in OM in the mutants. Interestingly, the peak of IL-10 production in the TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> ME exactly corresponded with the trough in TNF-α production. These results cannot be explained by a simple model of signaling disruption. They, therefore, underscore the complex interplay of different elements of the innate immune response during the response to NTHi in the ME, and the importance of balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. The significant delay in bacterial clearance observed in TLR9-null mice indicates that this receptor plays an important role in recovery from OM. However, the strong up-regulation of KLRA17, a negative regulator of TLR9, in wild-type mice suggests that this receptor is tightly regulated, presumably to limit potential damage to tissue.</p>
<p>The existence of parallel DNA signaling pathways in addition to TLR9 further suggests the potential for both redundancy and synergy in the response to pathogen DNA. An example of the latter is provided by IL-1β, the inactive precursor of which is encoded by an important target gene of CpG DNA via TLR9, and is strongly up-regulated during NTHi-induced OM. The simultaneous up-regulation of AIM2 signaling genes which we also observed provides a substrate for formation of the inflammasome, with subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-1 into its active form.</p>
<p>It should be noted that both our gene array and qPCR cytokine data were obtained from homogenates of ME tissue that include a number of mucosal cell types as well as inflammatory cells, and we cannot identify the cellular sources of gene expression. Especially in the case of cytokines, it is likely that infiltrating leukocytes contribute significantly to our data and indeed to ME pathogenesis during OM. However, epithelial cells can also produce all of the cytokines assessed in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425910393539">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, while we have discussed DNA signaling in the ME globally, it should be noted that this signaling may vary between different cell types. Given the many different cell types that participate in OM and may be exposed to bacterial DNA, including epithelial and stromal cells as well as many types of leukocytes, the situation in the ME is doubtless complex. Additional research will be required to explore fully the role of bacterial DNA in the pathogenesis and resolution of OM. The development of gene deletion models for other DNA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1753425910393539">48</xref></sup> will be helpful in this regard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1753425910393539" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results of the present study demonstrate that many genes associated with innate immune responses to pathogen DNA are up-regulated during OM. Thus the substrates for innate immune response to DNA are present in the ME during OM. Moreover, the data also support a significant role for TLR9 activation by NTHi nucleic acids in OM pathogenesis and recovery. Modulation of responses mediated by pathogen DNA may offer new means of treating OM.</p>
