<abstract>
<p>The effect of urea–formaldehyde adhesive and polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates adhesive on the manufacture of particleboard using coffee waste as a raw material was investigated. The coffee waste was blended with the urea–formaldehyde or polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates, then hot-pressed at 140°C at two pressure levels. The particleboards were tested to certify their density, moisture content, thickness swelling, water absorption, bending strength and modulus of elasticity. The density, moisture content and bending strength of the sample increased, but thickness swelling and water absorption decreased with increasing quantity of the urea–formaldehyde and polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates. The particleboard with urea–formaldehyde and polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates at the same quantity, the density, moisture content, thickness swelling, water absorption, bending strength and modulus of elasticity of polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates were better than urea–formaldehyde adhesive. At the same adhesive content, the urea–formaldehyde adhesive samples above 18% urea–formaldehyde content and all of the samples with PMDI adhesive met the Thai industrial standards.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311426624" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1930s, particleboards were first made. The particleboard industry first developed out of the shortage of lumber and the need to dispose of large quantities of sawdust and agricultural waste material produced by other wood industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311426624">1</xref></sup> Particleboards are currently manufactured from particles of wood or other lignocellulose material, formed and pressed together by the use of an organic binder together with one or more other binding agents, including heat, pressure and catalysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311426624">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many studies have been done on the properties of particleboard. For example, Wu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311426624">3</xref></sup> manufactured particleboard from hammer mille bagasse. A combination of two adhesive contents (5% and 8% polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanates (PMDI)) and two density (0.72 and 0.88 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) levels were used. Performance characteristics of the particleboard including modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bond (IB) strength, hardness, linear expansion (LE) and thickness swelling (TS) were evaluated. The author observed that an increase in resin content level reached higher strength and less TS in general. Nacar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311426624">4</xref></sup> studied some of the physical and mechanical properties of particleboard made from eucalyptus (<italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>). Bending properties of the samples produced using two levels of adhesive content (7% and 8% urea–formaldehyde (UF)) and density was found to be statistically different from each other. They suggested that overall mechanical properties increased with increasing particleboard density, press time and adhesive content. Another researcher Nemli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311426624">5</xref></sup> studied the effects of particle, moisture content, shelling ratio and the addition of wood dust on the mechanical properties (static bending, MOE and IB) and physical property (TS) of particleboard made from Alder (<italic>Alnus glutinosa subsp. Barbata</italic>). The addition of 10% wood dust to the particles decreased the TS, MOE and bending strength, while increasing internal bonding. Particleboards produced from particles with 1% moisture content had lower IB, MOE and bending strength and higher TS values than those produced from particles with 4% moisture content. Increasing the face: core ratio from 30:70% to 45:55% also improved the physical and mechanical properties of the particleboards. Furthermore, Pan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311426624">6</xref></sup> used a rice bran adhesive (RBA) to replace part of the PMDI adhesive in rice straw-based particleboard to evaluate the properties of particleboard by measuring mechanical and water absorption (WA) properties. They tested RBA to replace 10%, 20% and 30% of PMDI adhesive. The properties of the resulting mixed adhesive products were then evaluated and compared with particleboard bond with only PMDI. Up to 30% of the PMDI could be replaced with RBA to yield products with properties similar to those of PMDI bond particleboard.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that there are many factors which can affect the physical and mechanical properties of particleboard. Kelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311426624">7</xref></sup> proposed that the two most important factors controlling the average final density of a particleboard are the raw material density and the compaction of the mat in the hot press. Any change in one of these factors requires an alteration of the other if the average board density is to remain constant. Similarly, either of these factors can be changed to increase or decrease the average particleboard density. However, higher density panels produced by increasing the compaction level will not have properties equal to the same-density panel produced with higher density wood furnish. The bending strength depends on the density of the particleboard, particle configuration, adhesive type and level and pressing condition. The MOR and MOE increase with board density when all other factors (particle configuration and orientation, species, adhesive content, pressing conditions, etc.) are constant. The reviewed literature does not have any reported decrease in MOR and MOE when average board density increases. The effect of particle geometry on the resultant panel MOR values appears to be fairly well established. Particles of high length/thickness ratios, in which structural damage is minimal, normally produce particleboards with superior MOR values. The MOE is strongly dependent upon chip length. The particleboards produced from longer chip were found to have substantially higher effective MOE. Moreover, increasing the adhesive content increases the MOE in generalc.</p>
<p>Recent interest in environmentally friendly materials has led to the use of agricultural residues as raw material to produce particleboard from coconut chips,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311426624">8</xref></sup> bagasse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311426624">9</xref></sup> and waste tea leaves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311426624">10</xref></sup> Further, coffee husk and hulls can be used to produce a value-added product such as particleboard or building insulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311426624">11</xref></sup> Solid waste from coffee brewing is a major contributor to the total worldwide waste since coffee is a popular beverage and people around the world drink coffee about 1000 million cups per day. Coffee is today grown in more than 60 tropical counties around the world and is a primary export of many developing countries. Coffee is one of the most valuable traded commodities and comprises about 1% of the overall value of world trade. The two most commonly grown varieties are the highly regarded <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> and <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> (Robusta).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311426624">12</xref></sup> In 2009, the total world production of coffee was 7.4 million tons, valued at US$ 18.9 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311426624">13</xref></sup> In Thailand, the crop area of coffee is 57,098 ha and production is 51,508 tons. The Thai Government has encouraged planting to further decrease dependency on foreign imports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311426624">14</xref></sup> In order to reduce coffee waste, many studies have been carried out on the application of coffee. Coffee pulp represents a valuable source of energy and can be used for anaerobic biogas production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311426624">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311426624">16</xref></sup> In addition, coffee wastes can be used to extract oils and convert to fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311426624">17</xref></sup> and biodiesel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311426624">18</xref></sup> However, there is no researcher using coffee waste as raw material to manufacture panels such as particleboard.</p>
<p>The main ideas in this study was to produce particleboard from coffee waste and to study the effects of UF and PMDI content on the physical and mechanical properties of the resulting materials.</p>

<p>Coffee waste materials were obtained with Arabica and Robusta in a ratio 1:1 from the coffee shop at Science Building 2, Chiang Mai University, Muang, Chiang Mai, Thailand. UF adhesive was purchased from Toa-Dovechem Industries Co., Ltd., Thailand. PMDI adhesive was purchased from Hustsman Polyurethanes, Thailand.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311426624"><title>Raw material preparation</title>
<p>The coffee waste was dried at 105°C for 6 h in a hot-air oven (Model: 1370FX-2E, Sheldon Manufacturing Inc., Cornelius, OR, USA). After drying, the moisture content of the coffee waste was about 8% then sieved with a 20-mesh size (Sieve Shakers, Octagon 200, Endicott Ltd., NY, USA). The moisture content of the coffee waste was determined for calculating the ratio between adhesive content and coffee waste.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998311426624"><title>Board manufacture</title>
<p>The coffee waste was weighed about 100 g. The UF adhesive was measured at 15, 20, 25 and 35 ml that were equal to 11, 14.5, 18 and 25%w/w coffee waste, respectively. The PMDI adhesive was measured at 32, 42, 52 and 72 ml that were equal to 11, 14.5, 18 and 25%w/w coffee waste, respectively. Next, the coffee waste was blended with UF or PDMI (11%, 14.5%, 18% and 25%) and the mixture was formed into a mat 160 × 160 mm in a 6-mm-thick stainless steel frame. The mat was pressed using hot compression (Carver, MA, USA) at 140°C with two pressure levels (44.48 and 66.72 kN for 7 and 8 min, respectively) and cooled to room temperature within 8 min.</p>
<p>Prior to property evaluation of the mechanical properties, the board samples were cut and then sanded to certify their density, moisture content, TS, WA, bending strength and MOE complied to Thai industrial standards (TIS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311426624">19</xref></sup> The samples were then conditioned in 65 ± 5% relative humidity at about 25 ± 2°C, until reaching constant mass except for density and moisture content.</p>

<p>In particleboard manufacturing, the UF content is usually set to be around 6–10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311426624">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311426624">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311426624">22</xref></sup> However, when using coffee waste board blended with a standard amount of UF, the content did not consolidate because the coffee waste consisted of tiny particles. Therefore, to produce coffee waste board, higher UF content was required than for other materials. This is in-line with Bekalo and Reinhardt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311426624">11</xref></sup> who used 15% UF content to produce the particleboard from coffee husk and hulls.</p>
<p>The differences in density between the coffee boards are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311426624">Figure 1</xref>, where the density values increased with increasing quantity of the adhesive. As expected, increasing the solid content of the adhesive results in an increased density. According to Iskanderani,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311426624">22</xref></sup> a second contribution to the density arises from the UF polymer. UF having a higher density than that of wood makes a measurable difference in the density. The higher the percentage of UF, the higher the density of the particleboard. The most important factors controlling the density of a particleboard are the raw material density, the adhesive density and the compaction of the mat in the heating press.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311426624">7</xref></sup> In addition, the density of the PMDI-bonded board was found to be lower than UF-bonded board due to the lower specific gravity of PMDI adhesive.

<sec id="sec14-0021998311426624"><title>Effect of UF and PMDI on moisture content of particleboard from coffee waste</title>
<p>The effect of adhesive content on the moisture content of particleboard from coffee waste is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311426624">Figure 2</xref>. The moisture content of UF- and PMDI-bonded particleboards measured 2.52–4.37% and 2.35–3.22%, respectively. The higher UF content means more polarity to react with water. The higher moisture content for UF-bonded boards can be traced back to the hygroscopic behavior of the alkali in the UF adhesive. Thus, more water is adsorbed which is why the moisture content increased with increasing UF content. The moisture content values of PMDI-bonded board were lower than UF-bonded board. PMDI adhesive consist of oils, which is unlike UF adhesive, which is an alkali that can absorb more water.

All these properties were higher for 24 h of water immersion than water immersion for 2 h. When soaking time increased the WA value increased.

<p>The results obtained in this study showed that coffee waste could be successfully used as a raw material to manufacture particleboards using UF and PMDI adhesive. Particleboards bonded with PMDI were superior to those bonded with UF. It is likely that this reflects on differences in the chemistry of the two resins. The density, moisture content, MOR and MOE of the sample increased and TS and WA decreased with increasing quantity of the adhesive. This shows that adhesive content is the main parameter which correlates with the physical and mechanical properties.</p>
