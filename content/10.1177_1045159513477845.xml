<abstract>
<p>Over time, research has suggested there are sometimes tensions arising from differences in the way African Americans and Black Caribbean immigrants in the United States perceive each other as part of the African diaspora. In this autoethnographic study, I explore personal experiences with cross-cultural misperceptions between Black female students in three U.S. higher education settings. I use critical race feminism and dialogue education to tell my story, analyzing my encounters and cultural frame of reference and its relationship to Black identity in the United States, and calling for increased dialogue between and among diverse Black females in adult education settings.</p>

<p>“This qualitative study used an autoethnographic approach, which is critical in describing and analyzing personal experiences to understand cultural experiences.”</p>
<p>Dear Diary,</p>
<p>Here I am fulfilling my dream of studying in the United States . . . grades on target, faculty helpful and friendly, food I’m adapting to. But somehow, there’s kind of a strange feeling I get when I hang out with some American females around school that look like me. I’m Black and so are they, but sometimes—just sometimes . . . not with every one of them—I come away from the conversation feeling that I’m “different” . . . maybe a different kind of Black female? One friend told me over lunch that I “certainly don’t act Black . . . I’m so soft-spoken.” Maybe to be Black in America is to redefine “me” racially. (Personal journal entry, 2008, p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The idea of an underlying misperception as it relates to ways of knowing or cultural coding between some members of varying African descent in America may seem far-fetched at first mention. Some would argue, are we not all Black? How, then, could an African American and a Black Caribbean immigrant,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1045159513477845">1</xref></sup> despite similarities with past slavery experiences, <italic>not</italic> be able to synchronize with each other easily in light of how they view themselves, the world—and how they identify racially? However, over the past several years, data have emerged to undergird the notion there are significant differences in the way African and Caribbean immigrants in the United States perceive themselves, each other, and their racial identities within a traditionally racialized U.S. context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477845">Alfred, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477845">Edmonson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159513477845">Vickerman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045159513477845">Waters, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045159513477845">Ross-Gordon (1990)</xref> in her work on serving culturally diverse adult learners explains that African and Caribbean immigrants come with distinct cultural backgrounds and educational needs that are different from those belonging to African Americans, and as such “Blacks cannot be seen as monolithic” (p. 6). In addition, there has been a plethora of foci on multiple identities within education, ranging from curriculum relevance and effectiveness for diverse Black student groups in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159513477845">Delpit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159513477845">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>) to claims of Black immigrant privilege in U.S. higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477845">Edmonson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159513477845">Ludden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159513477845">Rimer &amp; Arenson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This article seeks to add to the discourse by exploring autobiographical experiences with cross-cultural misperceptions between African American females and Black Caribbean female immigrants as observed in three higher education academic settings. In my experience, females within both of these groups have actively expressed the need for a feminist approach to challenge the patriarchal and racist systems that oppress them (e.g., racism and sexism in corporate, social, and academic settings). Yet, both groups have struggled to identify with each other to form meaningful alliances to this end. Thus, the article further points to the ways in which cross-cultural misperceptions void of dialogue may perpetuate a (a) potential stifling of a very necessary unified feminist movement particularly in the academy and (b) lack of true solidarity among <italic>sisters</italic> even of similar ethnic grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477845">hooks, 2000</xref>). As a critically reflective piece, this article explores a shifting of my lenses in light of my racial identity, how that has occurred overtime, and implications for adult higher education.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Critical race feminism and dialogue education are the primary concepts that frame my research. I particularly embrace critical race feminism in light of three of its core tenets. First, critical race feminism maintains an antiessentializing emphasis that focuses largely on intersectionality, recognizing the multiple identities and locations that women of color inhabit. Second, it uses an interdisciplinary approach drawing on Black feminist thought and its related scholars. Third, work framed within critical race feminism maintains a social justice agenda and uses nontraditional data, such as narratives, poetry, and storytelling to inform the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159513477845">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159513477845">Few, 2007</xref>). Dialogue education is rooted in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159513477845">Paulo Freire (1970)</xref> and asserts, that as an adult educational practice, it can “facilitate learning to read and write the word and the world . . . [with the] potential to transform the world . . . [it is] the essence of revolutionary action” (p. 135). Similarly, contemporary adult education scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045159513477845">Tisdell (2001)</xref>, contend the telling of personal stories brings the structural formation of identity to consciousness. A critical part of adult education is dialoguing for mutual understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045159513477845">Vella, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>I used these frames to analyze personal experiences with cultural misperceptions as a Black, Afro-Caribbean woman in American higher education, examine my cultural frame of reference and its relationship to Black identity in the United States, and echo the call for increased dialogue between and among diverse Black females studying and teaching in college settings to increase cultural understanding, networking, and inclusion. As dialogue and networking persist “women gain support, their identity is shaped and affirmed, knowledge is constructed and communities are changed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159513477845">Nanton, 2009</xref>, p. 20).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This qualitative study used an autoethnographic approach, which is critical in describing and analyzing personal experiences to understand cultural experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159513477845">Chang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159513477845">Ellis, Adams, &amp; Bochner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159513477845">Holman Jones, 2005</xref>). Rooted in a constructivist paradigm, this approach embraces narrative as a meaningful way of deconstructing individual lived experiences authentically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159513477845">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>). Because the central purpose is to explore my encounters with cross-cultural misperceptions between African American and Black Caribbean females, personal narrative work allowed me, as a Black Caribbean immigrant female within the U.S. academy, to be a participant and researcher and for my experiences to be included in the analytical texts.</p>
<p>I sought to first establish a general research question to guide my data collection:</p>
<list id="list1-1045159513477845" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How have personal interactions with female African American peers in U.S. college settings shaped my understanding of my identity and challenged or impeded Black female solidarity?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477845">Brookfield (1986)</xref> asserts that as learners, critical self-reflection is key in examining our belief systems, values, and framework—and how they affect our daily life. Similarly, acknowledging our identities and sociocultural histories through critical self-reflection must be a precursor to the creation of a democratic, multicultural learning community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477845">Alfred, 2003</xref>). Self-observation has been noted as a particularly useful data collection tool in autoethnography, as it brings cognitive processes such as conscious and subconscious emotions and motives to the surface and allows for concurrent analysis and interpretation of the authentic self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159513477845">Chang, 2008</xref>). Collected data include excerpts of written reflections from a personal journal, opinions cited in academic essays, and critical reflections on my personal interactions with African American female college peers over a combined 6-year study period. Interactions took place in the context of three higher education institutions in the northeastern and southwestern United States, none of which are predominantly Black campuses.</p>
<p>Autoethnographers are highly considerate of relational concerns as an important dimension of inquiry throughout the writing and research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159513477845">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, prior to submitting this piece for publication, I asked others, to whom I may have implicitly referred, to express their feelings on how I represented them in writing. I analyzed the data by exploring and highlighting common threads throughout each collected piece with a view to culturally study and discover the self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159513477845">Chang, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>First Words: Coming to America</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Diary,</p>
<p>I sat in my class today and I noticed that I kept identifying myself emphatically as “Jamaican,” while other African Americans identified emphatically as Black—and couldn’t understand how come I didn’t “right off the bat.” “You in America . . . you Black.” But for me, being Black is a “given,” my obvious skin color . . . my culture is what I identify with first right? It’s about all the things that make me Jamaican—right? (Personal journal entry, 2009, p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In coming to America for college, I first realized I had to define my race and ethnicity because I had to keep saying it—on forms, in undergraduate and graduate classes, in telephone interviews—“I am Black.” Like many members of other Black immigrant groups, this was something I perceived as somewhat strange, as the custom in a primarily Black nation would be to describe yourself based on the country you are from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045159513477845">Waters, 1999</xref>). For example, I would immediately identify by saying, “I am Jamaican.” Being Black is, however, something I did not seem to say clearly with my actions or verbal expressions. My skin color seemed not to give credence to or be a significant match with the behaviors that characterized me (academically and otherwise). To the White female, I was a <italic>standout . . . intelligent Black student from the Islands</italic> (once they found out I wasn’t African American). To the African American female, I was <italic>different . . . Black in skin but not like us . . . not hangin’ out with us</italic>. Many would ask, “How come? How come you keep saying you’re Jamaican first and not Black first?” I learned repeatedly I was <italic>. . . tryin’ to be all that . . . .sounding and actin’ all White</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu (1993)</xref> makes a critical distinction between what he terms <italic>voluntary</italic> and <italic>involuntary</italic> minorities in his work on cultural frames of reference. <italic>Voluntary</italic> minorities are those who made their own decision to move to the United States, believing this would lead to greater socioeconomic opportunity and a better overall life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477845">Alfred (2003)</xref> states, “Since the abolition of slavery on West Indian plantations, West Indians have viewed migration as a way of sustaining their livelihoods” (p. 243). As such, “the basic reason why immigrants come to America is the gap between life’s aspirations and expectations and the means to fulfill them in the sending countries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159513477845">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1996</xref>, p. 12). However, <italic>involuntary</italic> minorities do not necessarily perceive the United States as a land of opportunity because they did not arrive as voluntary immigrants, nor did their ancestors who arrived through slavery. They may, instead, perceive their involuntary immigration as “an unforgettable loss of freedom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu, 1993</xref>, p. 488).</p>
<p>In light of my experience, African Americans’ instinctive definition of themselves as Black goes beyond merely skin color and is rooted in a history within which they were traditionally excluded and regarded as unequal. Thus, their identity is tied to their cultural frame of reference, which was “developed in the context of conflict between the minority and dominant group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu, 1993</xref>, p. 491). Conversely, having moved here voluntarily, my cultural frame of reference is my Caribbean home country and I do not necessarily perceive a threat to my sense of identity by having similar norms of the majority group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159513477845">Foster, 2004</xref>), for example, speaking in a way that may sound <italic>White</italic>. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu (1993)</xref> writes in the context of schooling, his work is helpful in understanding the differences in cultural frames of reference between African Americans and Caribbean immigrants and the potential for misperceptions in cultural coding when both frames coexist in an academic setting.</p>
<p>My most vivid recollections regarding cultural frames of reference occurred during my attendance at several social events on different campuses. At one get-together, for example, I sat engaged in conversation with a White female student for an extended period of time. The individual had interesting stories about experiences on campus, so I listened keenly, entertained. While exiting the building at the end, an African American female student caught up with me and, in introducing herself, explained she could not understand how I did not converse or sit at the table with her for a much greater part of the session. This action, she reasoned, should have been my natural inclination as a Black student, perhaps as a code of solidarity. As such, my failure to do so confused her and she may have maintained a negative perception of me if we had not dialogued. Even though I felt I talked to everyone at some point, it was clear, because I am Black, there was a sense of collective identity that should have been acknowledged through spending more time building relations with other students of color. Perceptions like these may be held by some African Americans who encounter African or Caribbean immigrants through interactions that may signal (a) our values and behavior seem more often aligned with those of White Americans than African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477845">Edmonson, 2006</xref>) and (b) we do not fully fit into an alliance category as it relates to the struggle against female oppression in the African American context, though we too are Black.</p>
<p>Even as I have used a limited lens at this leg of my journey to interpret the actions of others, I must use a magnifying glass to analyze my own initial stance within the discourse. In critically reflecting, I noticed I had formed opinions of some African Americans that may not have emerged from a <italic>soundproof</italic> contextual reality. I, like several of my female colleagues who were Black Caribbean immigrants, found some African American norms or behaviors offensive or strange. Although empathizing with their challenges, we often struggled with the issue of joining their coalition movements or needing to passionately argue in and out of class for their continued liberation. I felt a need to be separate. “Efforts in creating alliances with African Americans <italic>should</italic> come almost naturally,” I thought. After all, both groups are Black in America and at risk for the same levels of racism and sexism that pervade society by way of patriarchal oppression. Yet, I have come to learn that cross-cultural misperceptions, like these between African Americans and other Black Caribbean immigrants, that can cause strained relationships, apprehensive friendships, and negative rumors are not unique to me. Many of my colleagues report similar experiences. In addition, the literature indicates African American Blacks, in general, have “not readily forged coalitions with their foreign-born Caribbean Black counterparts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477845">Alfred, 2010</xref>, p. 231) and “Black Caribbean immigrants in the U.S. experience both voluntary and involuntary exclusion” (p. 231). In reflecting and engaging in dialogue over time, I have concluded any recurrence, no matter how small or subtle, may indicate a need to come to a place of understanding—consistently and consciously.</p>

<title>Shifting Lenses?</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Diary,</p>
<p>Today I went to the store with my friend. I love hanging out with her but then you know how it is—we get into this discussion about the future and then about identity and ways of knowing. She tells me that “they must teach something different in the Caribbean” because I seem so “confident” I don’t seem daunted by the potential threat that a historically racist country like the US could have on my career or life. I feel a bit confused as I look at her and think . . . how in the world a brilliant female with such great potential could still have that idea of the system going against her in her mind just because she’s Black. I ask her and she gets annoyed, as if I should understand. (Personal journal entry, 2010, p. 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I did not understand—at least not fully. I grew up hearing my parents say education was <italic>the</italic> key to success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477845">Alfred (2003)</xref> captures the essence of my reality when she summates “in the West Indian Culture, academic success was engineered, nurtured and rewarded with upward social mobility and high visibility” (p. 256). For me, education is the one variable most able to stand against social barriers to mobility. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu (1993)</xref> explains African Americans may not have that level of trust in the system given the historical inequalities and a racialized present-day America. As we talked, I learned there is a way in which anger can stimulate and promote action and so this conversation, though ending-up almost fiery, helped us break some silent barriers to what we really did not understand about each other—and to find value in honest conversation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477845">Pilcher (2001)</xref> reminds us,<disp-quote>
<p>Qualitative researchers [need] to create spaces for “honest talk” that opens our hearts and minds to the pains and joys of social diversity. In this moment, qualitative researchers are challenged to write through the lens of difference. (p. 282)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I later found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159513477845">Vickerman (1999)</xref> provided an insightful example in his work on Caribbean immigrants that would begin to inform my level of understanding regarding the historical context that framed African American and Afro-Caribbean perspectives. According to one Caribbean immigrant and research participant who had settled in the South,<disp-quote>
<p>Here I was coming from the West Indies and the Englishman said to me: Listen, if you go to school . . . whether it was true or not, I believed that; that if I made good in school, I could achieve. But here . . . they were saying to the American Black: Your skin is black and you can only get this far but you cannot go any further. In other words, you are being held at a certain level . . . and they [tend to] grow up in that environment thinking . . . “Don’t care what I do, I’m condemned to this level, so why try?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159513477845">Vickerman, 1999</xref>, p. 151)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045159513477845">Tatum (2003)</xref> asserts as we become aware of the daily challenges of living in a society with racial tones, it becomes more and more helpful to share experiences with persons who have lived the experience. For me, honest dialogue began the proverbial <italic>shifting of lenses</italic> as I began to engage in real and painful lived African American experiences.</p>

<title>Dialoguing for Cultural Decoding</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477845">hooks (2000)</xref> points to the need for women to learn each other’s “cultural codes” (p. 58)—a notion clearly as relevant to interactions between females of the same skin color (e.g., Korean/Chinese or African American/Jamaican) as to females of different racial backgrounds (e.g., Hispanic/Black, Black/White, Latino/Asian). The tendency, for example, of many African American females to speak loudly or be animated in diverse settings is sometimes interpreted by Black Caribbean females as a sign of hostility toward the person being spoken to and as poor manners—especially if voices are raised within an otherwise quiet environment or raised to the point where persons not involved in the conversation can hear them. Some African Americans interpret Black Caribbean females’ attitude toward being loud as passive, weak behavioral expression perhaps rooted in conformity to the perceived male dominance in the Caribbean household context. Similarly, some Caribbean immigrants interpret African Americans’ unique use of variant dialect, as shared racial identity or to avoid being labeled as embracing the dominant group’s speech patterns (e.g., saying sistah vs. sister or not including “ing-s” in some words; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159513477845">Delpit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu, 1993</xref>), as <italic>bad</italic> or improper use of the English language. In turn, Caribbean academics are often chided as <italic>sounding White</italic> and being more accepted by the dominant culture because of their emphasis on diction while speaking. An alleged superior confidence and low-level psychological handicap in terms of the stigma of race seems to form the basis for the argument that White sisters are more comfortable working with Black Caribbean sisters and gives us preferential treatment in instances of matriculation to higher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477845">Edmonson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these examples are simple, the implications for Black female exclusion within academia and its potential to stifle progress in the feminist movement are in no way simplistic. In my experience, African American and Black Caribbean females struggle, with little or no success, to come to a kind of utopia which I describe as <italic>solidarity in sameness</italic>. We have sought solidarity, but have gone about it with a view to looking for uniformities between us as the sole <italic>yardstick</italic> by which we connect. The result, perhaps more often than not, is unresolved suspicion and unhealthy competitiveness (if true dialogue is not promoted). Our failure to create true connections and solidarity may be rooted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477845">hooks’s (2000)</xref> discussion of the fact that women do not have “monolithic experiences that we can identify as . . . Black experiences . . . [so that] we will not automatically feel solidarity” (p. 59) even though our ethnic groups may be similar. As such, she concludes women must <italic>work</italic> to develop sisterhood. We need not function in opposition, but should pool our efforts toward compatibility mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477845">hooks, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045159513477845">St. Pierre (2000)</xref> asserts meaning is generated through difference rather than identity and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477845">Asher (2005)</xref>, in stressing the need to create spaces for unique voices, assures us “engaging the other does not cancel out engaging the self” (p. 1089). Misperceptions void of clarifying dialogue restrict our ability to expand beyond ourselves. In doing so, the feminist mantra, “the personal is political” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477845">hooks, 2000</xref>), remains stifled at the beginner stage. We are unable to go beyond—to a broader perspective or to transformation of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477845">hooks, 1989</xref>) through an understanding of the unique worlds of the Black sisterhood—whether a <italic>sistah</italic> or <italic>sister.</italic> Yet, this is critical to examine the structures that hold discrimination in place for both groups. As women, if we neglect to counter our misperceptions of each other and consistently act in a negative way toward each other, we run the risk of reinforcing the same patriarch-constructed binaries we seek to eliminate—those that define us as being the lesser, more reactive, and emotional when compared with the male identity for example rational/irrational or logical/emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045159513477845">St. Pierre, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As I continued to dialogue with African American colleagues, I was struck by the extent to which erroneous knowledge from the media and lack of knowledge of each other via the curriculum reproduced harmful stereotypes. Interestingly, neither African nor Caribbean nations undergo studies in American history or the work of women in American history at the high school level. Yet, these nations are currently most influenced by North American culture. Similarly, nowhere in the U.S. high school curriculum are African American female students alerted to shared lived experiences or the work of Caribbean female icons who have fought for the liberation so closely aligned with their cause. How can we know each other better for increased cross-cultural understanding as adult educators and students if cultural information is lacking? As feminist curriculum study is concerned with ideologies that may be implicit or not consciously revealed in the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477845">Dentith, Brady, &amp; Hammett, 2006</xref>), a critical look at the structure of educational curricula for global cultural understanding as a means of advancing the feminist movement is necessary—again and again.</p>

<title>Conclusion: The Journey Continues</title>
<p>Within this narrative, I attempted to analyze personal experiences with cultural misperceptions as a Black, Afro-Caribbean woman; examine my cultural frame of reference and its relationship to Black identity; and echo the call for increased dialogue between and among diverse Black females in American higher education. I identified three significant themes. First, as Black women, we must be willing to engage in open, honest, and sometimes uncomfortable dialogue to eradicate negative stereotypes. This is necessary for interactions inside and outside of classes in any adult education setting. Knowledge decreases fear of the <italic>other</italic>. I embrace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477845">Ogbu’s (1993)</xref> work on distinguishing cultural frames of reference as a starting point, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159513477845">Guba and Lincoln’s (1989)</xref> rules for successful dialogue: (a) work from a position of integrity, (b) share power, (c) change, (d) reconsider value positions as needed, and (e) commit time and energy. Second, narrative is a powerful tool to develop critical consciousness. Narratives are “ideal bridges across the personal barriers of the mind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159513477845">Johnson-Bailey, 2010</xref>, p. 9). In this space, I was able to come to terms with identity of the self and other. The use of this tool in adult education classrooms as a precursor or complement to dialogue exercises on cultures in education may prove essential to facilitating true inclusion for adult learners of diverse ethnicities. These learners, in turn, will leave the classroom more fully equipped to influence others positively. Third, we must dialogue to model unity and avoid reinforcing the negative, patriarch-constructed binaries we oppose. To whom do we appear exclusive, even within the process of generating closed spaces toward being more inclusive?</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of misperception between African American and Caribbean immigrant females as described in this article certainly will not exist in every adult academic setting or college setting as the observations here reflect a limited context. Yet, any recurrences by way of experience or evidence from the literature indicates that work remains to be done and that honest dialogue is the point at which we should begin as well as the place from where we should continue toward true solidarity.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this article, the term <italic>African American</italic> refers to individuals who are Black or of African descent, and who were born in the United States. The term <italic>Black Caribbean immigrant</italic> and <italic>Afro-Caribbean</italic> are used interchangeably to describe individuals who are Black or of African descent, but who emigrated from a Caribbean country to the United States. Although the author uses these terms in a comparative sense, it is important to note that <italic>nationality</italic> usually precedes ethnic self-identification in a Caribbean context.</p>
