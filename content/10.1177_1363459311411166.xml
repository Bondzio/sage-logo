<abstract>
<p>This article analyses nursing expertise with a particular focus at the level of clinical and organizational practice. Through an examination of a specialist team of hospital nurses, and drawing on the concept of a community of practice, the article provides a critique of discussions of nursing expertise which can be overly normative, individualistic or divorced from practice. The theoretical background to our analysis is the division of labour in health care; the case study on which this analysis is based is a particular health policy: the introduction of critical care outreach services. The empirical portions of the article are based on a qualitative study of eight such services in England. In the first part of the analysis we elaborate on three ways in which ‘expertise’ can be deployed in practice: teaching and training; consultancy and advice; and practical clinical action. Each of these is shown to be related to the development of a community of practice. In the second part of the analysis we examine in more detail the impact of outreach nurses on the division of labour in health care and on traditional occupational hierarchies. A general implication of our findings is that expertise has fundamentally social characteristics which need to be acknowledged in academic and policy discourse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article we examine the role and effects of a group of expert nurses in hospitals, in particular some of the practical and institutional consequences of the formation of a team of specialist nurses. While there is increasing recognition, indeed advocacy, of developing nursing expertise, research on expert nurses tends to be concerned with the narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411166">Benner, 1984</xref>) or discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311411166">Hardy et al., 2002</xref>) of expert nurses themselves, with less information on how other workers are affected as nursing expertise gets played out in the day to day work of health care settings. In addressing this knowledge gap, therefore, we seek to answer the question of how the introduction of specialist nurses affects the division of labour in the hospital environment, and how this expertise is perceived by different groups of health care workers.</p>
<p>The general background to our article is health policy developments, particularly those related to the health care workforce and its organization and management. The introduction of ‘New Public Management’ (NPM) in the 1980s was characterized by expectations of flexible and interchangeable working among different professional groups, an emphasis on cultural change in health care organizations, ‘person-centred care’ and the demand for improved accountability of public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311411166">Baggott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311411166">Dawson and Dargie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311411166">Dopson, 2009</xref>). The particular focus of the article is the United Kingdom, and the development of critical care outreach services (CCOSs), which demonstrates some of the post-1997 New Labour government’s discontinuities as well as continuities with NPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311411166">Dopson, 2009</xref>). On the one hand, the official encouragement of CCOSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>) can be taken as an instance of NPM’s desire to promote increasing flexibility among the health care workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 2000b</xref>) and, especially, enhancing the working roles of nurses, midwives and health visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311411166">2002</xref>). CCOSs also came into being at the same time as reductions to junior doctors’ working hours and, in a shift away from NPM policies, a large financial investment in the ‘modernization’ of the NHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptual background to this article centres on the division of labour in health care. Health care remains a particularly fruitful field of inquiry on matters related to the division of labour, since it is a ‘dynamic, technologically-rich environment, which … [comprises] professions, occupations, unwaged caregivers, managers and technicians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311411166">Allen and Pilnick, 2005</xref>: 683). The dynamic character of health care and the associated dynamic character of professional boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311411166">Nancarrow and Borthwick, 2005</xref>) is axiomatic to our analysis: we are interested in how other workers react when a group of expert nurses is given an expanded role and a remit to provide expert advice to other health professionals.</p>
<p>The structure of the article is as follows. In the next section we elaborate the background on the division of labour in health care, nursing expertise and the specific policy of Critical Care Outreach. There then follows a description of the methods of data collection and analysis. In the analysis we first bring out the different ways that ‘expertise’ can be deployed in practice: it may be thought of in terms of training, advice or action, each of which has different effects on health care. This is described more fully in the second part of the analysis, where we highlight the impact of CCOS nurses on traditional occupational boundaries, hierarchies and the division of labour. We conclude the article by considering the implications of our findings for the concept of nursing expertise and its relationship to the division of labour in health care.</p>

<title>Background</title>

<title>The division of labour in health care</title>
<p>Sociological analysis of occupations can be considered at two relatively distinct levels: the macro-level of political and legal structures and the micro-level of localized interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311411166">May and Fleming, 1997</xref>). At the macro-level, analysis has tended to focus on issues such as occupational knowledge, power and domination, especially by the medical profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311411166">Freidson, 1988 [1970]</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363459311411166">Turner, 1995</xref>). This in turn leads to consideration of strategies of professionalization and labour market security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311411166">Freidson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363459311411166">Witz, 1992</xref>). Health care occupations have provided much material for understanding the legal and political contexts of occupational relations, although it is now widely acknowledged that the field was side-tracked by a focus on the category of ‘profession’ as an ideal type rather than considering the medical profession as an instance of the category ‘occupation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311411166">Dingwall, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311411166">Friedson, 1994</xref>). For the domain of health care, another problem was that there had been comparative neglect of non-medical participants in health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311411166">Elston, 1991</xref>), rather than following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311411166">E.C. Hughes’ (1958</xref>: 77) injunction to ‘look at any system of work from the points of view of all the kinds of people involved in it’.</p>
<p>Where investigators have examined work itself (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311411166">Strauss et al., 1997 [1985]</xref>), the predominant model of the division of labour has been one of social interaction and a negotiated order perspective which brings out the situated character of work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311411166">Allen and Pilnick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311411166">Friedson, (1994 [1975]</xref>). The situated character of work roles can be approached analytically in two main ways. The first, with theoretical links to macro-level analyses of medical dominance (as described above), is in terms of the power relationships between occupations. The second, in a more interactionist tradition, is to analyse a contrast between formal and informal divisions of labour.</p>
<p>Micro-level analyses of medical hegemony, often with particular reference to clinical decision making, have tended to portray two occupations in conflict. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411166">D. Hughes (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311411166">Porter (1991)</xref> both identified several subtle and informal strategies used by senior nurses which had the effect of reducing (although not eliminating) the power differential between doctors and nurses. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311411166">Coombs (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311411166">Coombs and Ersser (2004)</xref> identified medicine as being in an unchallenged, structurally dominant position, such that nursing influences on clinical decision making were strictly limited. A radical difference between professions, and even professional epistemology, has also been assumed of doctor–nurse relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311411166">Harvey, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311411166">1997</xref>). Lending some support to such an occupational conflict thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363459311411166">Walby and colleagues’ (1994</xref>: 21) extensive study of nurse–doctor relationships found that the majority of conflict-related issues reported by doctors and nurses could be attributed to ‘professional boundaries in question’. That said, some of the tensions between the professions has been noted to lie in the different spatial and temporal occupancies within hospitals - nursing staff tend to be restricted to one or two wards whereas medical staff have a wider remit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459311411166">Snelgrove and Hughes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363459311411166">Walby et al., 1994</xref>: 92). Other studies have also shown how the immediate organizational context can affect the quality of cross-professional working relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311411166">Anspach, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311411166">Carmel, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311411166">Melia, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459311411166">Reeves and Lewin, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Interactionist studies in medical sociology have shown the difference between medicine and nursing to be more apparent in the formal division of labour than in practice. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311411166">Allen (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311411166">Hughes (1988)</xref> described nursing processes and practices which came close to, or even overlapped, medical tasks such as diagnosis and prescribing medication, even as nurses formally asserted their separate jurisdiction (although Allen commented that nurses tended to cross professional boundaries only in the absence of medical staff). Boundary-blurring has become a well-established concept in recent medical sociology, with several authors showing how occupational boundary-blurring can occur in routine practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311411166">Allen and Hughes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311411166">Carmel, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411166">Goodwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311411166">Svensson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363459311411166">Tjora, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311411166">Allen (2001)</xref> has also shown how nurses negotiated boundaries with other classes of health care workers.</p>
<p>This corpus of micro-level research in medical sociology, in both the interactionist and conflict traditions, demonstrates that some of the dimensions of professional relations lie beyond the immediate interaction – for example, professional knowledge and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311411166">Dingwall, 1983</xref>: 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311411166">Goodwin et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, as we turn to consider critical care specifically, it is worth noting that there are organizational boundaries which are more or less independent of an occupational and professional division of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311411166">Durand et al., 2010</xref>). The organization of critical care in most hospitals usually comprises organizational sub-units – intensive care units and high dependency units. These units are staffed by specially trained nurses and specialist doctors, and in routine work these specialists can exhibit a loyalty to the unit which transcends, to some extent, loyalty to their profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311411166">Carmel, 2006a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1363459311411166">
<title>Critical care outreach services</title>
<p>Critical care outreach services can be seen as a particular instance of political developments such as changes in patterns of medical working and neo-liberal managerial principles, where health care policy is focused on increasing flexibility among the health care workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311411166">2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311411166">2002</xref>). Furthermore, the formation of teams of critical care trained nurses also exemplifies a factor identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311411166">Nancarrow and Borthwick (2005)</xref> – that is, a large financial investment in health care creating room for occupational expansion. The immediate occasion of the creation and funding of Critical Care Outreach Services (CCOSs) in the UK was the convergence and binding together of two predominant perceptions: first, that hospitals did not have a sophisticated approach to their very sick patients (Sinclair, 2007, personal communication); and second, that critical care was inadequately funded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>). A sizeable financial investment in critical care services became a political necessity once the idea that UK hospitals did not have a sophisticated approach to their very sick patients became commonplace. In May 2000 such a financial investment was announced: £150 million was promised for critical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459311411166">NHS Executive, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this investment, heralding the establishment of CCOSs, also followed hard work and lobbying by critical care practitioners over a number of years. For some time, there had been a sense that ways needed to be found to organize intensive and critical care in the most effective and efficient ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311411166">Bennett and Bion, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311411166">Bion, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459311411166">Singer et al., 1983</xref>). CCOSs appeared to offer a cost-effective way of providing critical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311411166">Audit Commission, 1999</xref>) and were thought to be a solution to problems of ‘sub-optimal care’ on general hospital wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311411166">McQuillan et al., 1998</xref>) and excess mortality caused by premature night-time discharges from intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311411166">Goldfrad and Rowan, 2000</xref>). These issues, coupled with a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in England during the ‘winter crisis’ of 1999–2000, widely reported and criticized in the national press,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311411166">1</xref></sup> could be seen to garner the political will for extra funding for intensive and critical care which came in May 2000. The £150 million was expected to fund approximately 250 extra ICU beds and approximately 50 CCOSs.</p>
<p>That CCOSs were to be part of this package of investment was no doubt related to the reported success of innovations such as the ‘medical emergency team’ in New South Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311411166">Lee et al., 1995</xref>) and the ‘patient at-risk team’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311411166">Goldhill et al., 1999</xref>). These early models of critical care outreach aimed to facilitate early identification of patients at risk of developing critical illness and to initiate early intervention where necessary. The policy document which introduced outreach services in England, <italic>Comprehensive Critical Care</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>), identified three ‘essential objectives’: to avert admissions to critical care units; to enable discharges from critical care units; and to share critical care skills. These objectives are not entirely congruent, and different CCOSs tended to concentrate on one objective or another. Whichever objective is pursued, however, it is clear that the experienced nurses which formed the CCOS teams were perceived as filling a ‘skills gap’. Thus a basic assumption of this article is that CCOS nurses are considered as experts in their practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459311411166">
<title>Nursing expertise</title>
<p>Discussions of nursing expertise have tended to follow the lead of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411166">Benner (1984)</xref>, who utilized the Dreyfus brothers’ five-stage model of skill acquisition: the novice tends to think in terms of decontextualized rules whereas the expert deals with the whole of a situation and ‘intuitively’ identifies which aspects are pertinent to the problem at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311411166">Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1996</xref>). This approach to understanding expertise problematizes the valorization of theoretical knowledge over and above practical understanding. Know-how can sometimes be developed ahead of ‘knowing that’; non-propositional knowledge in the form of experience (past concrete examples) is regarded as a vital component of expertise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311411166">Greatbatch and colleagues’ (2005)</xref> research, for example, has confirmed how nurses utilize their own experience and deliver individualized care even when presented with computer informed algorithms – the point being that expert practice requires more than propositional knowledge able to be codified in a computer algorithm. Thus expertise consists of skilled know-how developed though extensive experience and pattern recognition. Reviews of the concept of expert as used in nursing have added to these attributes others such as moral agency, knowing the patient and acknowledgement by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311411166">Jasper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311411166">Hardy et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Benner’s conception of expertise has been and remains very influential, there have been criticisms of her approach, in particular that it emphasizes a form of narrative, even rhetoric, about nursing expertise as caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311411166">Nelson, 2006</xref>). It has, perhaps unintentionally, contributed to an over-emphasis on ‘caring’ in professional and public discourse about nursing such that ‘caring work’ is sentimentalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459311411166">Nelson and Gordon, 2006</xref>). In addition, these definitions of nursing expertise have tended, on the whole, to portray expertise somewhat individualistically: what makes an <italic>individual nurse</italic> an expert and how does this affect his or her <italic>individual practice</italic>. For even while some definitions of ‘expert’ mention ‘recognition by others’, this recognition is precisely so that the individual expert may be allowed to perform expertly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311411166">Higgs and Bithell (2001</xref>, citing Higgs and Jones, 2000), on the other hand, identify other social characteristics inherent in expertise – for example, that experts value other people’s contributions to decision making and that they seek to develop expertise in others. In seeking to develop expertise in others, the context of learning comes to the fore. In contexts such as a workplace, experts can be said to facilitate the learning of others in communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311411166">Brown and Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311411166">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis, while not discounting an individualistic conception of expertise altogether, tends to support a more social conception, consistent with a ‘community of practice’ understanding, since our analysis identifies the effects of expert practice on other workers in the workplace. Thus we contend that relationships with other health professionals do more than allow merely for recognition of expertise. Especially in the case of nursing, expertise is manifested in on-the-job training and advice to other health care professionals, in addition to being an expert carer or undertaking expert clinical action (the more widely acknowledged, individualistic, manifestations of expertise). In fact, each of these forms of expertise is related to the development of a community of practice.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The principal data collection method was in-depth interviews with key individuals. At eight study sites a number of interviews were conducted with stakeholders from a range of clinical locales and different occupations. A two stage sampling process first selected eight case study sites and then an appropriate range of interviewees at each site. Prior to investigation Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee approval and local R&amp;D approval was obtained.</p>
<p>Data collection was through interviews with members of the outreach service and staff who had exposure to the service (these staff were identified through periods of non-participant observation). Conducting both observations and interviews enabled the researcher to be more sensitive to the organizational context for the interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311411166">Murphy et al., 1998</xref>). Data collection and analysis proceeded in parallel so later periods of data collection were progressively focused on issues identified through earlier analysis.</p>
<p>Participants were fully informed of the purpose of the study, provided with information sheets and given time to consider whether they wished to participate. Interviews were informal, following a topic guide which included questions on such topics as: how critical care skills can be shared; perceived effectiveness of outreach services; communication; teamwork; impact on other hospital services. Some questions were omitted for some groups of respondents. All interviewees completed consent forms. In total 115 interviews were completed with 122 individuals; 100 of these were health care workers as tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459311411166">Table 1</xref> (some staff had dual roles so the figures in some rows add up to more than the figure in the ‘total’ column). Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed; transcriptions were checked for accuracy.</p>

<p>Interviews were analysed using qualitative software (QSR N6). Following data collection at one site, one member of the research team (DBM) inductively categorized a sample of the interview data into codes according to the subject matter of the responses. This initial coding frame was reviewed by both authors and where certain codes were identified to be similar they were combined. The coding frame thus developed was applied to the remaining data. Whenever the coding frame was subsequently changed (e.g. identifying a new category) previously analysed data were reviewed to see whether the new category should be applied. For the higher level of analysis codes which were related to similar ideas were combined to form broader themes – for example, expertise in practice and inter-professional relations.</p>

<sec id="section7-1363459311411166">
<title>Three forms of expertise in practice</title>
<p>We identified three specific forms of expertise in practice: on-the-job training; advising other health care workers; and practical clinical actions. We now consider each of these in turn.</p>
<p>Several interviewees stated that training health care workers on the wards was the most important aspect of the CCOS. This was put in several different ways, but most emphatically by one founder of a CCOS, who stated that her original ambition was that the service would eventually be unnecessary:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I hoped that one day … we could work our way out by training the ward staff … I thought by [teaching] the medical students and nursing staff … [and] giving them the support they acknowledged they needed, we wouldn’t actually be needed. (G grade nurse, CCOS)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While sometimes the ‘training’ mentioned here referred to formal teaching and training sessions, it was generally felt that informal training in the context of direct care for critically ill or deteriorating patients was more effective. In these situations CCOS nurses could explain their actions while directly implementing interventions, thereby encouraging interested ward staff to learn, re-learn or enhance their clinical skills:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think [the CCOS has] been great for the patients because as I say, we’re empowering the nurses to actually do the job properly or increase their skills and knowledge to look after the sick patients … so they actually do get to practise their skills quite a bit now. (H grade nurse, ward)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is interesting here, and a departure from conventional on-the-job training, is that it is not necessarily inexperienced or novice nurses who are receiving this extra training. This therefore fulfils the skills training objective of the original policy, but with a distinctly practical focus and an emphasis on skills for all ward staff. In using their expertise to develop the clinical skills of ward nurses, the CCOS nurses are also developing a community of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311411166">Brown and Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311411166">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>This kind of ‘community development’ can also be seen in the second form of expertise in practice, providing advice. Some nurses reported that they would telephone the CCOS if they required specialist nursing advice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘If it was general advice I mean a nurse’s point of view, as to what sort of oxygen system is best or that sort of thing, then they’re specialist skills that the [ward] doctor wouldn’t know about’ (E grade nurse, ward).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ease of nurse to nurse communication was often mentioned – on the whole CCOS nurses were perceived as being more approachable than junior doctors (we return to inter-professional relations in the next section). Several ward nurses felt that the main strength of the CCOS was ‘just having someone there’, in a consultancy type of role:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got no critical care skills. I wouldn’t be ashamed (and I’m a G grade) to say that I don’t know what to do can you come and help me please. It’s nice to have somebody you can ring and say I don’t know what to do can you give me ideas, bouncing off ideas. (G grade nurse, ward)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This implies that a collaborative approach is a key feature of CCOS nurses’ expertise. Many ward nurses also felt that because the CCOS were there to advise (as well as provide support), they had a positive impact on staff morale.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious way that expertise was enacted (and one which accords most with traditional conceptions of nursing expertise such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411166">Benner’s (1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311411166">Benner et al., 1996</xref>)), was in practical clinical action. Participants suggested that the CCOS nurses’ calm confidence (described as ‘professionalism’) enabled them to oversee patient care:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They’re just calm, they get on with it … I think especially for junior [nurses], they appreciate the professionalism … they know what they’re doing, they tidy up as well, make the area you know, from being sort of frantic, it’s all calm, at the same time talking through whatever’s happening. (G grade nurse, ward)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So, junior nurses’ stresses are apparently reduced through the expert action – and contextualized description – of CCOS nurses. Of course, the CCOS nurses were not always perfect communicators, and some CCOS nurses could be criticized for their communication styles:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The way that [CCOS nurses] communicate with the ward staff can sometimes create barriers … [CCOS staff] can be quite brusque in their communication partly because you’re dealing with critically ill patients and so what you do needs to be done quite [rapidly] and you need to be very efficient and effective in doing it, but sometimes … that may be perceived [wrongly]. (Physiotherapist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The physiotherapist acknowledges that there are occasions when efficiency and effectiveness depend on rapid action rather than calm explanation. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the occasional need to act and speak with speed, it is interesting to note how the CCOS nurses are reported as ‘talking through’ what is happening. This provides further indication of the CCOS nurses’ development of a community of practice.</p>
<p>To sum up this section: there are several forms in which nursing expertise can be demonstrated in practice. In addition to undertaking expert clinical action (the most obvious, and perhaps the most widely acknowledged form of expertise in practice), critical care outreach nurses manifested expertise in training other health care professionals ‘on-the-job’ and providing advice. In each of these forms of expertise in practice we can see the supportive approach of the CCOS nurses increasing the potential for developing a ‘community of practice’.</p>
<p>The data thus far have hinted at effects on inter-professional relationships, and we now examine these in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1363459311411166">
<title>Inter-professional relations</title>
<p>It was frequently reported that ward staff’s initial perceptions had been one of mistrust of CCOS nurses. For example, some ward staff had initially been defensive of their work and been concerned about being blamed, judged or ‘policed’ by the CCOS. However, many ward staff tended to regard the CCOS favourably because of the way that they could gain access to medical teams; their ability to deal with medical staff was very important for ward staff who themselves much preferred ‘nurse to nurse’ interaction. CCOS nurses were regarded by ward staff as easier to communicate with than doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311411166">Baker-McClearn and Carmel, 2008</xref>). In this way it seems that the CCOS nurses may be helping to resolve a problem within medical teams. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459311411166">Mackintosh and Sandall (2010)</xref> report, the notion that junior doctors are able to ‘cascade problems upwards’ to senior doctors is demonstrably problematic. On the other hand, the CCOS was described as being invaluable when a patient’s level of care needed to escalate for the simple reason that they had more authority than ward nurses, and were able to summon senior medical assistance if necessary.</p>
<p>From a medical point of view, the CCOS counteracted a perceived lack of competence and confidence of junior doctors on the wards. In the following example, the consultant did not think that ward-based nurses or junior doctors would normally have the power to prevent patients deteriorating – primarily due to their lack of skills, experience and knowledge. But, retaining ‘ownership’ of her patients, she suggested that the CCOS could act on her behalf:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘[The CCOS] gave me a sense of security about my patients … I was always the one who was pressing the ICU Outreach button … they acted in a supportive and supervisory way for me’ (Medical consultant).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, a Pain Team consultant was more than happy to accept the judgement of specialist nurses, so long as they were acting strictly under delegated authority:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The consultants in intensive care are … fairly well respected … I think if the consultants there give the Outreach team their authority … then as far as [an] anaesthetist is concerned, that gives them a very good reference, a mandate … If I were a headstrong junior doctor I would be inhibited from being too rude to Outreach because I wouldn’t be too surprised to get a phone call from [an intensive care consultant] the next day, saying what are you doing upsetting my nurses? (Anaesthetist, pain team)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The use of the phrase ‘my nurses’ gives support to the notion that a general medical view is that the CCOS ‘belongs’ to intensive care consultants. From a senior medical point of view, the influence of the CCOS is limited in scope and it is required to be acting under formally delegated authority. A similar role was envisaged by an intensive care consultant, who described the CCOS as being the ‘eyes and ears’ of the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Thus the CCOSs are seen as able to supervise and oversee care across the whole hospital, able to liaise with intensive care doctors and support ward-based junior doctors. The great benefit for many consultants, and one reason why they were predisposed to favour the CCOS, was that CCOSs can usually be trusted with all these activities without the consultant having to be called. From the point of view of these senior doctors, there is a sense in which these expert nurses were said to be undertaking activities on the behalf of senior doctors. The CCOS is perceived as an extension of medical activity, influence and decision making – specifically, an extension of intensive care medicine. While several non-critical care doctors were prepared to relinquish some of their own decision-making power to the CCOS, this seems to be because of the close connection between the CCOS and intensive care doctors and that the CCOS was acting under delegated authority. It is moot whether they would be as supportive were it not for this link.</p>
<p>However, not all non-critical care doctors were happy to relinquish their decision-making power and there could be tensions in medical relationships with the CCOS. One CCOS nurse described a ‘tradition’ of a difficult relationship between intensive care doctors and other hospital doctors, which was inherited by the CCOS:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The medics were much more resistant I think … because [they didn’t think] we could add to their care … there is a tradition about the relationship between medics and intensive care staff and doctors and I think they still saw us as part of [intensive care] coming down to alter their package of care. (Nurse consultant, CCOS)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, critical care outreach activity is apparently perceived as critical care empire building. Intensive care doctors are seen as over-extending their remit, interfering in the care of patients on the ward who are under the care of other medical or surgical teams. (Indeed, one doctor in our study referred to the CCOS as the ‘critical interference team’). Clearly, some hospitals can be highly politicized environments. So long as CCOSs are perceived as breaking in to non-critical care territory they may not be trusted. It is interesting to note, however, that what is on the surface an inter-professional problem (CCOS nurses <italic>versus</italic> hospital doctors) may actually be indicative of underlying intra-medical rivalries (intensive and critical care doctors <italic>versus</italic> other hospital doctors). Nevertheless, it is the CCOS nurses who bear the brunt of the rivalry and for this reason many CCOS staff thought that senior intensive care medical support was vital for them to function properly. The CCOS, perceived as ‘belonging to intensive care doctors’, can be resented, and the largely positive service loyalty between intensive care doctors and the CCOS could become problematic in relations with medical teams elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
<p>Another issue for senior medical staff was the potential for junior doctors to become ‘deskilled’. While the cause of this was not felt to lie entirely with Outreach, the CCOSs were not helping what was perceived to be a general trend towards junior doctors losing basic clinical skills:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There’s a lot of deskilling going on but it’s not necessarily to do with [the CCOS] … Boundaries have changed all over the place, now a lot of nurses are doing bloods and venflons and things like that but then they’ll call the doctors for more difficult ones and maybe the doctors now don’t have as much experience as they used to in doing things like that. So there is a bit of deskilling of the doctors, partly through changes of practice and … partly through reduced working hours. (Medical consultant)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reduction in working hours, to which this medical consultant refers, was an outcome of the de-exclusion of junior doctors from the European Working Time Directive. The rapid and widespread development of CCOSs can, in part, be attributed to the reduction in junior doctors’ working hours. While this was widely regarded as a good thing for patient care (and for the well-being of junior doctors), there were some senior doctors who felt that it impacted negatively on junior doctors’ skill development.</p>
<p>Junior doctors, of course, are themselves trainee professionals. As one candidly admitted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We don’t know what we’re doing a lot of the time, we’re still learning … You can make most of the decisions but because it’s a scary environment you can forget things’ (Junior doctor, ward).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This doctor went to say that the CCOS can provide advice to them (‘they can say “what do you think about this?”’). Thus while junior doctors might share the perception of their senior colleagues that they need to learn clinical skills, and that the CCOSs were taking away opportunities for learning, in fact the CCOS could have been deployed to assist junior doctors’ learning, in a collaborative way akin to one of the forms of expertise described in the previous section.</p>
<p>Overall, most senior doctors regarded the CCOS as a positive development: one which extends the influence of senior medical staff in the wards. Nursing expertise is seen here as a form of extension medical authority, and from the ward staff perspective the CCOS provides a welcome link to senior medical staff. Some senior medical staff disliked the CCOS, which we have interpreted as a manifestation of an <italic>intra-</italic>professional rivalry. However, despite some misgivings about junior doctors potentially losing clinical skills, the relationship between the CCOS and junior doctors brings us back, potentially if not in actuality, to the development of a community of practice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The encouragement and development of critical care outreach services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>) can be seen as an instance of health policy and other trends concerning the division of labour in health care, such as ‘New Public Management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311411166">Dawson and Dargie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311411166">Dopson, 2009</xref>) – in particular, flexible and interchangeable working among different professional groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311411166">Department of Health, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311411166">2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311411166">2002</xref>). The encouragement for flexibility among health care workers has resulted in nursing expertise being increasingly presented as a solution to problems in health care. Our findings relate these developments to the level of working practices. We identified three forms of nursing expertise in practice: on-the-job training; expert advice and consultation; and expert practical clinical action.</p>
<p>The different yet overlapping meanings for expertise in practice we have portrayed broaden the individualistic representations of expertise and demonstrate the importance of the notion of a ‘community of practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311411166">Brown and Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311411166">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>). For example, our findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311411166">Nelson’s (2006)</xref> critique of the narratives of expertise as recounted by Benner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311411166">Benner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311411166">Benner et al., 1996</xref>). The expertise of the expert practitioner is manifested in all sorts of ways, not necessarily only ‘intuitive’ decision making. Expertise is a social phenomenon, not only in that it requires to be socially acknowledged, but also that the manner of its use and its effects are themselves social. The social dimension of expertise was seen in the many ways that the CCOS nurses developed communities of practice: for example, as they worked, they talked through their actions for the benefit of less experienced staff in the vicinity. Other social effects of expertise were seen in the inter-professional consequences of the work of the CCOS.</p>
<p>While inter-professional relations in the hospital have been challenged through the work of CCOS expert nurses, and the CCOS has sometimes broken down barriers between professions, on other occasions the existing boundaries, divisions of labour and hierarchies remained intact and were even reinforced. Changes to the division of labour are limited in scope: particularly from the perspective of senior medical staff who tended to regard the CCOS as acting only under the formally delegated authority of intensive care doctors. The reality of hospitals as work organizations is that some innovations are perceived as empire-building and encroachment onto others’ turf by medical specialties, and this in turn restricts the extent to which inter-occupational boundaries are truly dynamic. In the case of CCOS, the inter-occupational boundary which appeared to be most affected was that between CCOS nurses and junior doctors; many aspects of the CCOS nurses’ role could be seen as transferred from the responsibility of junior doctors. While such a transfer of responsibility was not universally welcomed, it seems to us that junior doctors are potential beneficiaries of CCOS expertise – not least as those who could ‘peripherally participate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311411166">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>) in CCOS nurses’ practical clinical action.</p>
<p>That junior doctors tended not to avail themselves of these opportunities indicates a general contribution of our findings: the tension in sociological analysis between that which emphasizes inter-professional conflict (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311411166">Coombs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311411166">Porter, 1991</xref>) and that which brings out ‘de facto’ boundary-blurring and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311411166">Allen, 1997</xref>). Eschewing ideological differences as an explanation for inter-professional conflict, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363459311411166">Walby and colleagues’ (1994)</xref>, for example, reported that the ‘time–space geography of the hospital’ was implicated in differences between medical and nursing perspectives. Such findings are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459311411166">Reeves and Lewin (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459311411166">Snelgrove and Hughes (2000)</xref>, who noted that encounters between different professional groups tend to be of an intermittent nature, which in turn leads to inter-professional relations being characterized by conflict and differing viewpoints. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311411166">Carmel (2006b</xref>) raised the corollary that where the geographical domains of the different professions are congruent over an extended period of time (as in intensive care units), inter-professional working relations may become more collaborative. It seems that one limitation of the CCOS is precisely their peripatetic character – the very fact that they get involved in patient care all around the hospital may well limit the potential for extended (and improved) working relations between CCOS nurses and junior doctors.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our research shows the importance of the concept of a community of practice in the everyday demonstration of expertise. A weakness of our analysis is that while our data are close to clinical practice, they are still interview data rather than observations of practice. Nevertheless, in this study we have found that expertise has a number of fundamentally social characteristics. These social characteristics need to be acknowledged in academic and policy discourse.</p>
