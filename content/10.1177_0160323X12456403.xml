<abstract>
<p>Investigations into municipal annexation have been largely conducted at the interstate unit of analysis and have focused on the impact of annexation legislation on overall annexation frequency. Interestingly, little effort has been placed on exploring the differences in intrastate levels of annexation activity by method of annexation available to municipalities. This analysis explores intrastate annexation activity through a multivariate regression examination of municipal annexation activity conducted in North Carolina between 2000 and 2010. Results surprisingly show that the key variables impacting voluntary contiguous, voluntary noncontiguous, and involuntary annexations are similar. Meanwhile, more research is needed to understand the unique factors that influence legislative annexation activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last half a century urban scholars have spent a considerable amount of energy studying municipal annexation activity. One reason for these efforts is the sheer volume of annexations that occur in any given year within the United States. Thousands of municipal annexations occur each year impacting tens of thousands of people and thousands of acres of land (Feiock and Carr 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>). Recent census-related research has revealed that more than 93,000 municipal annexations occurred in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12456403">U.S. Census Bureau 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The scholarly work completed on municipal annexation has resulted in a better understanding of the impact of annexation on metropolitan consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12456403">Weiher 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12456403">Orfield 1997</xref>), the role of annexation in the fiscal health of municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12456403">Rusk 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12456403">Smirnova and Ingalls 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X12456403">2008</xref>), and state variations in annexation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. 2002</xref>; Facer II 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>). Edwards’ (2008) recent attempt to integrate the wide array of scholarly work on annexation from a variety of disciplines provides a broader context from which to begin to understand municipal annexation. However, little thought has been given to the differing methods of annexation utilized by municipalities. While many studies have highlighted the fact that annexation methodology differs by state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12456403">Sengstock 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12456403">Hill 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12456403">Southern Growth Policies Board 1980</xref>; USACIR 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12456403">Palmer and Lindsey 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. 2002</xref>) and that the methods of annexation available to municipalities impact overall annexation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12456403">Palmer and Lindsey 2001</xref>; Feiock and Carr 2001; Facer II 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>), few studies have explored annexation methodology at the intrastate level.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the intrastate differences in annexation methodology is critical to developing a more complete theory on local government boundary change. A review of state annexation legislation reveals that a majority of states often provided for a minimum of two or three annexation methodologies. However, little research has been conducted on the various methods of annexation themselves. Understanding which factors influence annexation activity can provide valuable insight into this important boundary change process. Likewise, this information can also be used to craft new legislation and/or critique existing regulations around the country in an effort to “steer” annexation activity in a desired direction according to political ideology concerning municipal expansion. Specifically, this research will contribute valuable information to the debate between metropolitan reformers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12456403">Orfield 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12456403">Rusk 2003</xref>) and public choice proponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X12456403">Tiebout 1956</xref>; Ostrom et al. 1963) over the preferred urban form and the impact of annexation activity on the fragmentation or amalgamation of urban areas.</p>
<p>As a result, the purpose of this article is to explore the factors that influence annexation methodology in North Carolina. The study examined the impact of a variety of demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and political variables on the annexation methods available to North Carolina’s municipalities. Overall, more than 7,800 annexations conducted by 346 municipalities during the 2000s were analyzed. Annexation activity was examined according to the four methods available to North Carolina municipalities: voluntary contiguous annexation activity, voluntary noncontiguous annexation activity, involuntary annexation activity, and legislative annexation activity. The results of this analysis will help other states understand the impact demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and political conditions have on the methods annexation implemented by their municipalities.</p>

<title>Interstate Annexation Scholarship</title>
<p>Urban scholars and policy makers have placed a premium on examining annexation from an interstate perspective. Much of this scholarly work has focused on attempting to classify state laws on annexation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12456403">Sengstock 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12456403">Hill 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12456403">Southern Growth Policies Board 1980</xref>; USACIR 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12456403">Palmer and Lindsey 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. 2002</xref>) and examining the effects of various types of annexation requirements on overall annexation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12456403">Dye 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12456403">Wheeler 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12456403">MacManus and Thomas 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12456403">Galloway and Landis 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12456403">Liner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12456403">Carr and Feiock 2001</xref>; Facer II 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These classification studies conducted over the last 50 years attempt to organize states according to the legislative procedures available for completing an annexation. However, this has been exceedingly difficult since no two states have the same rules of engagement. For example, several states in the Northeast only allow annexations to occur through a state legislative approval process. Some states require that the area being annexed approve the annexation (popular determination) and only a few states allow municipalities to annex unilaterally (municipal method/involuntary; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12456403">Palmer and Lindsey 2001</xref>). These classification efforts summarize the different hurdles a municipality may face when expanding their boundaries, and the majority of this research has been built upon Sengstock’s (1960) typology. More recently, Palmer and Lindsay (2001) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. (2002</xref>) have attempted to move past the mutually exclusive method of classification and allow for an examination into the nuisance differences that exist between states. These more recent studies have attempted to incorporate a research design that accommodates multiple annexation methods within a state that can provide for a more accurate portrayal of existing conditions.</p>
<p>The other significant area of state-level annexation research has examined the effects of various types of annexation requirements on overall annexation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12456403">Dye 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12456403">Wheeler 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12456403">MacManus and Thomas 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12456403">Southern Growth Policies Board 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12456403">Galloway and Landis 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12456403">Liner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12456403">Carr and Feiock 2001</xref>; Facer II 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12456403">Dye (1964</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12456403">MacManus and Thomas (1979</xref>) did not find a strong relationship between annexation activity and state laws. However, Wheeler’s (1965) study determined that less restrictive state legislation on annexation resulted in an increased chance of municipal annexation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12456403">Carr and Feiock (2001</xref>) determined that the state laws that were supposed to act as constraints on annexation frequency (e.g., referenda requirements, public hearings, and county approval) actually stimulate annexation activity. A reason for this unexpected result may be that the state constraints result in smaller (e.g., land area and/or population) annexations but with much greater frequency. Facer II (2006) results on annexation frequency at the state level confirmed Carr and Feiock's (2001) examination and included an analysis of requirements that were meant to constrain and facilitate annexation activity. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards (2011</xref>) determined that “nearly all state provisions affect the frequency of municipal annexation, although some had unexpected results” (p. 325).</p>
<p>These interstate examinations into annexation have provided some critical insight related to variables that may play an important role in annexation activity. While most of the research has focused on the legislative parameters associated with annexation activity, many scholars have also included additional control variables within their models. Dye’s (1964) research revealed that wealthier municipalities were more proficient at annexation than poorer cities and that the presence of a “manager” form of government aids annexation activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12456403">Liner (1990</xref>) found a relationship between density and increased levels of annexation activity. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12456403">Liner (1990</xref>) also included a measure of political fragmentation (number of incorporated places in a county) and geographic region (Sunbelt) in his work.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12456403">Carr and Feiock (2001</xref>) found that several measures of municipal spending and the percentage of a states population living in unincorporated areas had a statistically significant impact on annexation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards (2011</xref>) determined that higher population and higher growth rates were associated with higher levels of annexation activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards (2011</xref>) also found that counties with more land available for annexation witnessed higher levels of annexation activity. Finally, Smith’s (2012) study of annexation activity revealed that one region of North Carolina, the Piedmont region, conducted a disproportionate share of annexations in recent decades and that local geography may influence annexation methodology.</p>

<title>Why do Municipalities Annex Territory?</title>
<p>Considerable research has been conducted on why municipalities annex land. In general, three major reasons are offered in the existing literature on why municipalities conduct annexations. First and most often discussed in the literature is the impact of financial considerations on annexation proceedings. Numerous scholars since the 1950s have often discussed the role of economic growth and development as it relates to annexation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12456403">Bollens 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12456403">MacManus and Thomas 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12456403">Fleischmann 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12456403">Rusk 2003</xref>). Municipalities see annexation as a primary means by which to collect additional revenue through direct (e.g. property tax and sales tax) and indirect (e.g. federal and state redistributive) revenue streams. These additional revenues can help to offset proposed tax increases on the existing citizenry or result in a decrease in tax rates for a community.</p>
<p>A second reason often cited for why cities conduct annexation proceedings is growth management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12456403">Weiher 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12456403">Reynolds 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12456403">Orfield 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12456403">Rusk 2003</xref>). Municipal leaders can view annexation as a method by which to orderly plan for the development of vacant property. Likewise, annexation can be used in tandem with utility service to encourage or discourage urban development in certain geographic areas around a municipality. Annexation has also been lauded for its ability to reduce political fragmentation within the metropolitan regions. Through the amalgamation of property to an existing municipality, economies of scales can be achieved and a potentially complex political landscape can be averted. However, recent research has discussed the relationship between annexation activity and increases in municipal incorporation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X12456403">Smith 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12456403">Smith and Debbage 2011</xref>). These studies suggest that annexation activity may result in unincorporated areas seeking municipal incorporation to protect them from being annexed and thus create a more fragmented urban environment.</p>
<p>A final municipal motivation for conducting annexations is simple politics. Through the selective use of annexation, the political actors of a municipality can change or keep constant the demographic and/or socioeconomic characteristics of a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12456403">Austin 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12456403">Parnell et al. 2004</xref>; CGISC 2004). Feiock and Carr (2001) discuss the role of these individual actors in the development of their collective action theory of local government boundary change. Molotch’s (1976) growth machine theory of urban development also discusses the impact of individual political actions on the larger municipal landscape as it relates to growth and development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0160323X12456403">
<title>The Case for North Carolina</title>
<p>North Carolina was chosen as the unit of analysis for several reasons. First, North Carolina is recognized as a leader in annexation activity within the United States. Recent research has shown that North Carolina municipalities completed more than 14,000 annexations between 1990 and 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12456403">Smith 2012</xref>). Likewise, a 2002 study revealed that North Carolina had risen from the ninth most active state in terms of frequency of annexation during the 1970s to the second most active annexation state during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, until recently the laws governing municipal annexation in North Carolina have been identified as a model for the nation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12456403">Rusk (2003</xref>) specifically mentions North Carolina’s annexation legislation and comments that North Carolina possessed “the best annexation laws; they virtually guarantee their cities will be successful” (p. 6). Additionally, the recommendations outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12456403">Reynolds (1992</xref>) on annexation legislation incorporated many of the principles that had been part of North Carolina’s legislation for the last fifty years.</p>
<p>Finally, a new legislature with an antiannexation focus was elected. Upon taking office the newly elected legislature began examining the existing annexation legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12456403">Fain 2011</xref>). The results of which have taken the form of additional constraining processes being placed upon the annexation methods available to municipalities. Additionally, several municipalities had previously adopted annexations repealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12456403">Smith 2011a</xref>). This new political reality has had major impacts on North Carolina’s cities and may offer important insight into what can be expected in other states. As a result, this timely analysis of annexation activity prior to the enactment of the new limiting annexation legislation will provide important context for comparison purposes in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0160323X12456403">
<title>North Carolina Annexation Procedures</title>
<p>Four different methods of annexation are available to North Carolina municipalities. First, municipalities may request an amendment to their corporate limits from the elected General Assembly of North Carolina. This legislative method is also available to municipalities in most states and is the preferred form of annexation in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12456403">Palmer and Lindsey 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, a contiguous voluntary annexation may be requested by a property owner looking to obtain urban services to a parcel of property. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12456403">Smith (2012</xref>), approximately 65 percent of all annexation activity completed over the last twenty years in North Carolina utilized voluntary contiguous methodology. The majority of states allows for this type of annexation to occur and is the favored method of annexation in 29 states according to Palmer and Lindsey’s (2001) work.</p>
<p>Noncontiguous voluntary annexations involve the annexation of property that is not contiguous to the existing corporate limits of a municipality. Almost a quarter (23.8 percent) of all annexations completed in North Carolina during the past two decades used the satellite annexation provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12456403">Smith 2012</xref>). Additional annexation research has revealed that fourteen states allow for some form of satellite annexation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12456403">Steinbauer et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, involuntary annexations are initiated by municipalities for properties that meet legislatively defined tests for urbanity including population density, land use, and tract size. Between 1990 and 2009, less than 10 percent of all annexation activities in North Carolina was completed utilizing the involuntary method of annexation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12456403">Smith 2012</xref>). Idaho, Indiana, and Tennessee also allow for involuntary annexations to be completed without the consent of affected property owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12456403">Hunter 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160323X12456403">
<title>Hypotheses and Methodology</title>
<p>Four hypotheses were developed to determine how a variety of variables impact the method of annexation utilized by municipalities in North Carolina. Below is a list of the hypotheses for the four different measures of annexation activity. A detailed list of the expected relationship each independent variable will have on the measures of annexation activity by method is available through email from the authors.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Voluntary contiguous annexation activity will be heavily influenced by variables related to population growth pressures.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Voluntary noncontiguous (satellite) annexation activity will be affected by population density and competition for territory.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Involuntary annexation activity will be most affected by the wealth of the annexing municipality and municipal leadership.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Legislative annexation activity will be most impacted by political fragmentation.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>To determine whether these hypotheses are correct, four models were developed to examine the relationships between voluntary contiguous annexation activity, voluntary noncontiguous annexation activity, involuntary annexation activity, and legislatively approved annexation activity for North Carolina municipalities that completed an annexation between 2000 and 2010 and a select group of variables. A review of the existing literature on municipal incorporation formed the basis for choosing the majority of the variables. Upon completion of the collection of the data, SPSS was utilized to conduct four regression analyses to examine the relationship between annexation methodology and the chosen geographic, demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables. The Poisson regression was selected since the annexation data collected is not normally distributed and was not determined to be correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12456403">King 1988</xref>). For the voluntary contiguous, voluntary noncontiguous, and involuntary annexation models the overdispersion, as measured by deviance (Deviance/<italic>df</italic>), suggested that a negative binomial regression was more appropriate than a Poisson regression. The overdispersion results for the legislative annexation activity confirmed the use of a Poisson regression for that data set.</p>

<title>Data Sources and Variables</title>
<p>All data included in this analysis were obtained through two principal sources: the US Census Bureau and the North Carolina Secretary of State’s Office (NCSOS). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12456403">U.S. Census Bureau (2011</xref>) provided the majority of the population, geographic, and socioeconomic data related to North Carolina municipalities. A list of all independent variables, the definition for the variables, the source of the information and the mean of the variables are available by e-mail from the authors. The annexation information included in this analysis was obtained through an examination of the North Carolina Secretary of States’ online database of annexation activity. The Secretary of State’s Land Records Management Division maintains an excellent online database of annexation proceedings for all municipal annexations that occur in North Carolina. The General Statutes of North Carolina require that all municipalities submit a certified copy of annexation ordinances to the Secretary of State’s office within 30 days of the effective date of the annexation (NCGS 2011). The database is searchable by municipality and includes an Abode Acrobat file of the actual annexation ordinance for all annexations completed within the State of North Carolina. Without the annexation database this scholarly endeavor would not have been possible.</p>
<p>This research project does have several limitations, including the primary annexation data gathered from the North Carolina Secretary of State Land Records Management Office. While North Carolina's General Statutes require all municipalities to submit annexation ordinances to the Secretary of States office within 30 days of approval, smaller municipalities may be unaware of this requirement or lack the staff power to complete this task. As a result, the annexation activity database may be missing recently approved annexation ordinances from the last years of the decade. Additionally, the database may include errors or omissions as a result of faulty data entry techniques. For example, an annexation ordinance for a municipality may end up being added to the database of a different but similarly spelled municipality. Thus, skewing the annexation data for both entities involved in the mislabeling.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The results from the four regression models generally confirm the findings of previously completed research and all models have a fair amount of predictive power. The pseudo-<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> for the models range from a low of .65 for the Legislative annexation model to a high of .80 for both the voluntary contiguous and involuntary annexation models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X12456403">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, these models offer the first quantitative insight into the factors that influence different types of annexation methodologies available to municipalities in North Carolina.</p>

<p>The most interesting finding was that some of the factors that influenced voluntary contiguous, voluntary satellite and involuntary annexation activity were the same. This finding was unexpected due to the motivations influencing each of the methods of annexation. As previously mentioned, voluntary contiguous annexations and voluntary noncontiguous annexations tend to be utilized proactively prior to the development of land. Conversely, involuntary annexation proceedings are usually initiated reactively in order to capture urban development that at the initial time of construction may not have been adjacent to the corporate limits of a municipality or did not met certain standards for annexation.</p>
<p>The research conducted in this analysis however reveals that some of the statistically significant factors influencing all three forms of annexation are the same and include population, municipal planning department, and form of government. As previous researchers have shown, the size of a community plays a large role in annexation tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>). Additionally, this analysis reveals that the presence of professional staff in the form of a planning department and a city manager has a significant influence on these three types of annexation methods. These results show that having a professional staff is helpful in completing these types of annexations. On the other hand, legislative annexations were not statistically significantly impacted by these two variables. This lack of significance is understandable because legislative annexation is more likely the result of “politics” and not technical proficiencies.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that population-related growth pressures would have a large influence on voluntary contiguous annexation activity and many of the variables associated with growth were statistically significant including: population density, municipal growth rate, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) designation. While population density has been identified as a major influence on annexation activity for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12456403">Liner 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12456403">Edwards 2011</xref>), the importance of the municipal growth rate and MSA designation are new but not unexpected discoveries. One surprising result was the lack of significance for the county growth rate variable. This finding may highlight the role of a more intimate, local geography on annexation activity.</p>
<p>Noncontiguous (satellite) annexation activity was hypothesized to be influenced by variables associated with crowding and competition for territory. Interestingly, the satellite annexation model was the only method of annexation not impacted by population density. Additionally, the measures of competition for territory including available territory, political fragmentation, and county annexation activity were not statistically significant. These results are somewhat surprising since it was anticipated that higher population densities and competition for territory would spur annexation activity.</p>
<p>A likely explanation for these findings is that satellite annexation activity is more closely tied to unique geographic variation that was not included within the model. Because the use of the satellite annexation methodology has a unique set of geographic criteria associated with it, the simple measures of available land, number of governments, annexation activity, and overall community density may not have been sensitive enough to register within the model. Interestingly, the county growth rate was determined to be a statistically significant variable for satellite annexation activity but not for the other models. This finding shows that growth-related pressures do exert some influence on satellite annexation activity. Finally, noncontiguous annexations were the only method of annexation statistically significantly influenced by municipal expenditures and may highlight the importance of government funding for the extension of needed utilities to serve distant properties.</p>
<p>Involuntary annexation activity was expected to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the residents of the municipality and municipal leadership. The results of this analysis confirmed the importance of the form of government and municipal planning department (measures of municipal leadership), but proved that the role of income was not statistically significant. The ability of poorer municipalities to annex wealthier suburban developments does not seem to be a reality for North Carolina's cities. Involuntary annexations were also statistically significantly influenced by population density and the region of North Carolina in which they are located. Even after taking all other variables into account, there were more involuntary annexations in the Piedmont Region than the coastal or mountain regions.</p>
<p>The results of the regression analysis for legislative annexation activity are complex. Legislative annexation activity was the only method of annexation that was not statistically significantly influenced by population, the presence of a municipal planning department, or the form of government. Interestingly, the available land variable was negatively associated with legislative annexation activity. This is the opposite of the impact that this variable had on all the other models and may highlight the role of a limited unincorporated geography on the need for a legislative solution to complex metropolitan realities.</p>
<p>Legislative annexations are more than likely completed as a last resort to tackle complicated political geographies irrespective of a communities’ size or education. Additionally, age, party affiliation: republican, NC region and municipal growth rate were also statistically significant. These results reveal the need for more research to understand the unique factors that influence legislative annexation activity since the traditional and expected measures of population size and political fragmentation did not resonant in the model.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The regression analyses completed in this study confirm some of the previous work completed by scholars on annexation and in particular show the influence of population, a planning department, and the form of government on annexation methodology. More importantly, this study also reveals that differences exist between the annexation method models. That is, there are apparent differences in which variables influence the different methods of annexation. While the factors that influence voluntary contiguous, voluntary noncontiguous, and involuntary annexation activity are similar, the influences of education, income, and political party affiliation on satellite annexation activity and the median age, political party affiliation, region of North Carolina, and municipal growth rate on legislative annexation activity needs further evaluation.</p>
<p>In sum, these results begin to shed light on a relatively unstudied area of local government boundary change. To date, research has almost exclusively focused on interstate annexation analysis and has treated all annexation activity the same. However, similar to how researchers have continued to improve upon Sengstock’s typology and develop more accurate representations of annexation legislation for analysis purposes, this study pushes forward the examination of annexation activity at the intrastate level. Municipalities around the country have multiple methods of annexation available to them and gaining a better understanding of which variables influence annexation methodologies is of critical importance to urban scholars, public policy makers, and the public.</p>
<p>Future research is planned to investigate the differences in annexation activity by annexation method in other states that have witnessed high levels of annexation activity including Florida, Georgia, and Illinois. Additionally, it is envisioned that a study looking at annexation methodology by the population size of the municipality will be conducted. Understanding if large, medium, and/or small municipalities have different tendencies for completing annexations may prove critical to developing a more complete understanding of annexation proceedings. Finally, an examination of annexation activity by method of annexation in the South U.S. Census Region is also warranted, given the total amount of annexation activity conducted in the South. The overall aim of these efforts are to empirically analyze the annexation methodology at the municipal level to gain a better understanding of what factors influence annexation tendencies. In the end, these endeavors will allow for the development of a more complete theory of local government boundary change.</p>
