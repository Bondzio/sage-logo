<p>In a time of high levels of economic uncertainty and insecurity for many Americans, and a public arena characterized by Occupy Wall Street, “bailing out banks” and discussions that include concerns over the far-reaching power of Corporate America, it is useful to remind ourselves how many of the policies we have come to frame as “liberal” or “democratic” came into existence. In <italic>Class and Power in the New Deal: Corporate Moderates, Southern Democrats, and the Liberal-Labor Coalition</italic>, G. William Domhoff and Michael Webber, working in an historical tradition of Howard Zinn, do just that. Challenging some of the more traditional analyses of New Deal policies and uncovering the historical accounts that are often missing, they argue that it was individuals they call “corporate moderates,” and not liberals, progressives, or even labor unions, who crafted, revised, and lobbied for the key legislative pieces of the New Deal, including the Social Security Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the National Labor Relations Act. Specifically they find that “Northern corporate moderates, representing some of the largest fortunes and biggest companies of that era, proposed all three of the major policy innovations that today define the New Deal, sometimes in reaction to pressures from the leaders of organized labor or disruptive efforts by grassroots leftist activists” (p. 3).</p>
<p>The work fits squarely into scholarly and policy debates on the New Deal—questioning whether the landmark policy innovations were a way to limit corporate power and serve workers’ interests, or instead were a way to extend the reach of business. Using extensive archival research methods and focusing on primary data sources, Domhoff and Webber make a convincing case for the latter, and in doing so provide an in-depth original analysis of all three pieces of legislation. They share many of the untold stories of the policy formation in a manner that is quite comprehensive, but easy to follow. Through this work they focus on the integral relationship between politics and policy—particularly the network and interconnectedness between corporate elite and policy experts at foundations, think tanks, and consulting firms. For instance, by painstakingly detailing the long process of drafting and passing the Social Security Act, Domhoff and Webber persuasively show how “corporate moderates proposed a sophisticated and comprehensive program based on years of experience with their company plans and with group plans developed by life insurance companies, as adapted and fine-tuned for them by experts in the policy-planning network” (p. 185).</p>
<p>However the book is not meant solely to be an historical account of the origins of New Deal policy. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the scholarly usefulness of Domhoff and Webber’s version of class dominance theory, particularly demonstrating that it is a better paradigm than historical intuitionalism, Marxism, and protest-disruption theory in explaining the development of the Social Security Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the National Labor Relations Act. Building from the work of C. Wright Mills and Michael Mann, they highlight how the “power elite” and the networks they form influence social policy. Each of the three pieces of legislation are then framed within this paradigm. In trying to demonstrate the supremacy of class dominance theory, the authors sometimes push their cases and categories a bit too far—for instance, labeling all experts at think tanks and foundations as “corporate moderates.”</p>
<p>This well-researched book is a very important read for students and scholars of history, as well as those of us who are currently studying and working on the policy issues of the New Deal today. It serves as an important resource of the often unrecognized role of business in shaping the social policy we today tend to think of as “working families” policy.</p>
