<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of temperature distribution, concrete strength, cover thickness, and heating time on the structural behavior of reinforced concrete beams. Toward this goal, reinforced concrete beams with different concrete compressive strength and cover thickness are fabricated and subjected to furnace heating for 60, 90, and 120 min under a loaded state. In order to analyze structural behavior based on the thermal behavior of the beams, transient temperature distribution is measured during the furnace heating. After furnace heating, spalling is observed. From loading tests performed on the damaged reinforced concrete beams, residual strength, maximum loads, and beam deflections are measured and examined. The experimental results show that significant damage occurs in the reinforced concrete beams under high temperatures. In addition, it is found that thermal and structural behavior of damaged reinforced concrete beams is dependent on cover thickness and concrete strength and that most structural damage occurs in a relatively short period of heating time. Using these experimental findings, an equation is proposed that can be used to predict maximum load capacity and stiffness reduction ratio of the damaged reinforced concrete beams.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1042391512474666" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Experimental studies to define changes of material properties and spalling of concrete due to fire have been reported for many years. Among them, the effect of high temperatures on material properties of normal concrete was examined by Harmathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1042391512474666">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512474666">2</xref>]. Harmathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1042391512474666">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512474666">2</xref>] reported experimental results for the temperature-dependent thermo-mechanical material properties, such as effective specific heat (thermal capacity), thermal conductivity, mass change rate, and thermal expansion of normal and lightweight concrete having different types of aggregate and mixture ratios. These material properties can also be found from ACI Committee 216 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1042391512474666">3</xref>] and ENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1042391512474666">4</xref>]. For high-strength concrete (HSC) materials, temperature-dependent thermal, and mechanical material properties were reported by Kodur and Sultan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391512474666">5</xref>] and Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512474666">6</xref>]. The former performed experiments for thermal material properties of HSC at different temperature levels, and the latter examined stress–strain curves of HSC at different temperature levels. Furthermore, Kodur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391512474666">7</xref>], Kodur and McGrath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1042391512474666">8</xref>], and Kodur and Phan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512474666">9</xref>] reported experimental results for thermal and structural behavior of HSC columns. In their studies, the fire resistance of HSC columns was lower than that of normal-strength concrete (NSC) columns due to spalling. Spalling occurs when the tensile strength of concrete decreases and pore pressure increases as temperature increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512474666">10</xref>]. An increase of pore pressure in HSC at elevated temperatures was reported by Kalifa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1042391512474666">11</xref>]. In their study, pore pressure was measured at different locations of NSC and HSC specimens at temperatures of 600℃. For HSC, peak pore pressure was measured as 3.7 MPa at 600℃ and the location was 50 mm away from the surface. Kodur and Phan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512474666">9</xref>] examined the factors that could affect fire resistance of HSC columns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512474666">9</xref>], and these were fire intensity, fire size, heat output, heating rate, concrete strength, fiber reinforcement, types of aggregates, tie spacing, tie configuration, load levels, size of the member, etc. Especially, it was found that tie configurations affected the fire endurance of HSC columns by confining longitudinal rebar and concrete, thus minimizing the extent of spalling.</p>
<p>Relatively few studies have been reported about the fire endurance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391512474666">12</xref>], Shin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391512474666">13</xref>], Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391512474666">14</xref>], and Choi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1042391512474666">15</xref>] performed experimental studies for thermal and structural behavior of RC beams at elevated temperatures having different concrete strength. Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391512474666">12</xref>] performed heating tests on NSC beams at elevated temperatures, while Shin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391512474666">13</xref>] performed on these HSC beams. According to their studies, HSC beams showed higher temperatures and more damage due to spalling compared to NSC beams. In addition, it was found that the spalling occurred on the upper part of beam side surfaces for HSC beams due to high pore pressure developed in the upper part of the beam during heating. Using experimental results from Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391512474666">12</xref>] and Shin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391512474666">13</xref>], Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391512474666">14</xref>] proposed non-destructive test methods evaluating the strength of fire damaged RC beams and found that the degraded strength of fire-damaged concrete could be recovered to some degree as time passes after a fire. Choi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1042391512474666">15</xref>] reported the effect of many parameters including concrete strength and cumulative temperatures on structural performance of RC beams using the existing experimental findings. In addition, Haj-Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1042391512474666">16</xref>] and Choi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512474666">17</xref>] proposed a modeling technique for predicting temperature distributions and deformations of structural members. The proposed modeling technique, including temperature-dependent thermo-mechanical material properties of concrete during transient heating, was validated by comparing the prediction with the experimental results on RC beams.</p>
<p>This article aims to investigate the structural capacity of RC beams when exposed to high temperatures. Structural capacities of RC beams damaged by high temperatures are quantified by measuring load–deflection relationships and crack propagation from the four-point loading tests. The effects of concrete strength, cover thickness, and time period of heating on the thermal and structural behavior of damaged RC beams are also investigated. The experimental results are expected to help predict structural capacity of fire damaged RC beams and to find parameters that can prevent possible damage of RC beams under high temperatures.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1042391512474666"><title>Test specimens and parameters</title>
<p>Experiments consist of furnace heating and four-point loading tests on RC beams. For the tests, twelve RC beams are fabricated using ordinary Portland cement and pulverized fly ash. The fine and coarse aggregates are medium zone quartz sand and siliceous gravel, respectively, which are popularly used in Korea. The mix proportions for NSC and HSC are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391512474666">Table 1</xref>. The steel reinforcements are D22 (deformed bars with diameter of 22 mm) and D10 bars (deformed bars with diameter of 10 mm). Measured tensile strength from the tests are 439 and 390 MPa for D22 and D10 bars, respectively. Test parameters are compressive strength of concrete, cover thickness, and time period of heating, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1042391512474666">Table 2</xref>. Sizes of the RC beams are 250 mm in width, 400 mm in depth, and 4700 mm in length, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391512474666">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Details of the tested beam section with locations of thermocouples are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391512474666">Figure 1(b)</xref>. Three thermocouples are placed in the middle of beam length to measure the temperature distributions inside the beam during the furnace heating, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391512474666">Figure 1(b)</xref>. These three measured points are located at 50, 200, and 350 mm from the bottom of a beam, and designated as ‘Low’, ‘Mid’, and ‘Up’, respectively. In order to investigate the effect of cover thickness on the behavior of the RC beams, cross-sectional areas are maintained as 250 × 400 mm, and cover thicknesses of the beams are varied between 40 and 50 mm.

<p>For furnace heating, RC beams are cured for over 6 months to prevent effect of excessive moisture and then placed in a heating furnace, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1042391512474666">Figure 2</xref>. The two side surfaces and bottom surface of the RC beams are under the effect of flame provided by the heating furnace. Prior to heating, the RC beams are subjected to loads in order to simulate the fire situation that occurs while the beam is being used as a structural member. The magnitude of the applied load is calculated from combined dead load and 40% of live load for an office building, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1042391512474666">Table 2</xref>. The applied load is maintained throughout the heating for 60, 90, or 120 min. Because the HSC beams failed due to excessive deflection earlier than 120 min of furnace heating, furnace heating of HSC beams is terminated at 90 min. The temperature of the heating furnace is controlled to follow the ISO 834 standard time–temperature curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1042391512474666">Figure 3</xref>), and temperatures throughout the heating furnace are monitored from nine thermocouples. The average of temperatures measured from these thermocouples is used as the representative temperature of the heating furnace. In addition, linear variables displacement transducers (LVDTs) are placed at the center and 1/4 of the beam length to measure vertical displacements of the beams during the furnace heating.

<sec id="sec5-1042391512474666"><title>Loading test</title>
<p>Four-point loading tests are performed to examine the structural behavior of the damaged RC beams 1 month after the furnace heating. The test setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1042391512474666">Figure 4</xref>. The beams are simply supported with an effective length of 4000 mm. The load is applied through a load cell in a form of displacement control and LVDTs measure deflections during loading in the middle and 1/4 of the beam length. Three gages are attached on the upper side surface in the middle of the beam at 50 mm intervals to obtain compressive strains of concrete during loading.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1042391512474666">Figure 5(a) and (b)</xref> shows the effect of cover thickness on the temperature distribution within RC beams having NSC. In comparing different cover thicknesses, maximum temperature is measured at the ‘Low’ location of the NSC beam with cover thickness of 40 mm, which shows about a 10% higher temperature in ℃ than the NSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm. Also, temperatures of the longitudinal steel bars are much higher in the beam with cover thickness of 40 mm than the steel bars in the beams with cover thickness of 50 mm due to the former being closer to the heat source.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1042391512474666">Figure 6(a) and (b)</xref> shows the effect of cover thickness on the temperature distribution within HSC beams. In HSC beams, the effect of cover thickness on the temperature distributions at ‘Low’ location is not as significant as in NSC, because the large amount of cover falls off due to spalling between 20 and 40 min of heating. However, in the ‘Mid’ location, a higher temperature is obtained in the HSC beam with cover thickness of 50 mm than the HSC beam with cover thickness of 40 mm, e.g. the maximum temperature at ‘Mid’ location is about 250℃ for the beam with cover thickness of 50 mm, while it is 200℃ for the beam with cover thickness of 40 mm. Also, the temperatures measured at ‘Low’ location are around 350℃ when the HSC beams are heated for 90 min, while the NSC beams show 250℃ at the same locations. The reason for showing the higher temperatures in HSC beams is due to the spalling effect. When HSC beams are exposed to high temperatures, the concrete cover falls off due to spalling. Spalling in HSC beams under high temperatures is a well-known phenomenon and significantly related to structural behavior. Mostly, spalling in HSC beams occurs as pore pressure increases and tensile strength of concrete decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512474666">10</xref>]. In order to quantify spalling of HSC beams, cross sections of the beams after 90 min of furnace heating are measured at the locations along the beam length illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1042391512474666">Figure 7(a) and (b)</xref>, indicating that the average area loss of the HSC beam with cover thickness of 50 mm is slightly larger than the HSC beam with cover thickness of 40 mm. When the beam has cover thickness of 40 mm, the remaining area after the cover thickness fell off due to spalling is about 82.7% of the original cross-sectional area, according to measurements observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1042391512474666">Figure 7(a)</xref>. On the other hand, for the beam with cover thickness of 50 mm, the remaining area after the cover thickness fell off due to spalling is about 80.3% of the original cross-sectional area. Since a larger area remains in the beam with cover thickness of 40 mm, thermal conduction preceded more slowly, leading to lower temperatures in the interior portion of the beam compared to the beam with cover thickness of 50 mm, as observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1042391512474666">Figure 6(a) and (b)</xref>. In fact, the effect of confinement on the temperature distributions or spalling also can be found from test results where variables are tie configurations or confinement. According to Kodur and Phan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512474666">9</xref>], HSC columns having provision of bent ties at 135° back into the core of the column and increased lateral reinforcement show improved fire endurance. These results confirm that a lower temperature distribution and a reduced amount of spalling can be achieved in beams with more confinement.

<p>Surface cracks of NSC beams caused by high temperatures are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1042391512474666">Figure 8(a) and (b)</xref>. In the NSC beams, the cover partly falls off, but spalling is not found. As expected, more cracks occur as heating time increases from 60 to 120 min. The observed cracks are shallow and exist only on the surface. Between the NSC beams with cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm, slightly more cracks are observed from the beams with cover thickness of 50 mm. This can be explained from the lower load capacity of the NSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm than the NSC beam with cover thickness of 40 mm. The NSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm have effective depth of 350 mm, while the NSC beams with cover thickness of 40 mm have effective depth of 360 mm. Due to spalling, cracks of HSC beam surfaces are not observable.

<p>During the loading tests performed 1 month after the furnace heating, flexural cracks due to loading are initiated from the cracks caused by high temperatures, especially from the middle of beam length, and propagate towards the upper and end of the beam, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1042391512474666">Figure 9(a) and (b)</xref>. Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1042391512474666">Figure 9(a) with (b)</xref>, cracks of fire damaged NSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm are distributed in a dispersed manner, while most of the cracks on the beams with cover thickness of 40 mm are seen in the middle area of the beam length. Also, load–deflection curves are obtained from the loading tests, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1042391512474666">Figure 10(a) through (d)</xref>. In all tested beams, slopes of the load–deflection curves and the maximum loads decrease as the heating time increases. Especially, damaged HSC beams result in more degradation of structural performance as heating time increases compared with the damaged NSC beams. From the load–deflection curves of the damaged NSC beams, maximum loads are observed at the end of the elastic region of the load–deflection curves followed by long plateau until failure, while load–deflection curves of HSC beams are appeared as bi-linear and maximum loads are observed at the end of the plastic region with large deflections. When comparing maximum loads of the beams having different cover thicknesses, direct comparisons are not proper because effective depths are different for the beams having different cover thicknesses so that the load capacities are not same. For the case of NSC beams, nominal moments of the beams with cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm are 140.1 and 136.3 kN m, respectively. In order to compare structural behavior of the beams with different cover thicknesses, ratios of maximum loads of the damaged beams to the maximum loads of the undamaged beams are calculated as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1042391512474666">Table 3</xref>. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1042391512474666">Table 3</xref>, it is shown that maximum loads of NSC beams with cover thickness of 40 mm are 93–94% of that of the undamaged beams, while maximum loads of beams with cover thickness of 50 mm are 96–97% of that of the undamaged beams. So, the NSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm show less structural damage than the NSC beams with cover thickness of 40 mm, mainly because the temperatures of the N5 series are slightly lower than the temperatures of N4 series due to the larger cover thickness. However, differences of load ratios between the NSC beams with cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm are very small, as their temperature differences are not significant. In addition, the difference of the reduced maximum loads between 60 and 120 min of heating time is not significant in the NSC beams.

<p>As for the HSC beams, load–deflection curves appeared as bi-linear and maximum loads are observed at the end of the plastic region with large deflections. Also, maximum loads of the damaged HSC beams decrease about 13–46% depending on heating time and cover thickness, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1042391512474666">Table 3</xref>. The larger reduction of the maximum load is observed from the HSC beams rather than the NSC beams, because spalling of the damaged HSC beams results in reduction of second moment of area. Since the cover falls out due to spalling, the HSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm result in more damage than the HSC beams with cover thickness of 40 mm. Also, the maximum loads of the HSC beams, especially for the beams with cover thickness of 50 mm, decreases a large amount as the heating time increases.</p>
<p>From the loading test results, relationships between reduction ratio of maximum load and heating time are found, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1042391512474666">Figure 11(a) and (b)</xref>. Overall, the load capacity of the damaged RC beams decreases rapidly until 60 min of heating, and stabilizes towards the end of the furnace heating. It is interesting to note that the rate of load-capacity reduction increases with the heating time in the HSC beams with cover thickness of 50 mm. In this case, a large amount of spalling occurred during the furnace heating, which results in loss of cross-sectional area and degradation of loading capacity. Also, the stiffness of the damaged RC beams is defined from the slope of the load–deflection curves, and expressed as a function of heating time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1042391512474666">Figure 12(a) and (b)</xref>. Compared with the reduction ratio of maximum load, the stiffness decreases with the larger ratios, but similar tendencies are observed between cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1042391512474666">Figure 12(a) and (b)</xref>, it is shown that stiffness reduction rate of NSC beams stabilizes as heating time increases, while the stiffness of HSC beams decreases continuously as heating time increases.

<p>From these experimental findings, a regression analysis is performed to propose an equation that can predict the reduction ratio of maximum load capacity and stiffness of the damaged RC beams.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1042391512474666">Figure 13(a) through (d)</xref> illustrates reduction ratios predicted from the proposed equation compared with the experimental results. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1042391512474666">Figure 13(a) through (d)</xref>, predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental results and the overall error between the prediction and the experimental results is about 1.4–11.1%.

Using the limited number of variables and experimental results available, the coefficient <italic>A</italic> is determined so as to have the least error compared with experimental results.

<p>This study reports the effect of concrete strength and cover thickness on the thermal and structural behavior of RC beams under high temperatures. Normal and high-strength concrete beams are prepared to have 40 or 50 mm of cover thickness and exposed to high temperatures for time periods of 60, 90, or 120 min. Temperature distributions, spalling, and crack configurations of the RC beams during furnace heating are examined. From four-point loading tests performed on the damaged RC beams, maximum load capacity, stiffness, and crack propagation of the damaged beams are investigated. In addition, an equation for predicting reduction ratios of maximum load and stiffness of damaged RC beam is proposed as an exponential function. Based on this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:
<list id="list1-1042391512474666" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Temperatures are much higher in HSC beams than the NSC beams because of spalling.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In NSC beams, the larger cover thickness results in the lower temperatures. However, in HSC beams, there is no difference of temperatures at ‘Low’ location between the cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm and temperatures at ‘Mid’ location are higher in 50 mm cover thickness because of spalling.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From the loading tests of the damaged RC beams, HSC beams show more structural damage than the NSC beams due to spalling.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Comparing beams with cover thickness of 40 and 50 mm, the larger reductions of maximum load capacity and stiffness are observed from the beams with cover thickness of 50 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The experimental results show that the rate of load capacity and stiffness reduction ratio changes with heating time, and can be expressed as an exponential function of heating time. With a proper value of the constant <italic>A</italic>, the proposed equation shows good agreement with the experimental results. However, the results from the proposed equation are compared to a limited number of experimental results such as normal and high-strength concrete beams with cover thicknesses of 40 and 50 mm subjected to the ISO 834 heating curve. Further studies are needed to see if the proposed equation is applicable to RC beams of different size, concrete strength, reinforcing ratio, and heating environment. Also, the coefficient <italic>A</italic> can be defined as a function of these same influencing parameters, such as beam size, concrete strength, cover thickness, reinforcing ratio, and heating environment.</p></list-item>
