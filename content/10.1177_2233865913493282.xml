<abstract>
<p>The Philippine business process outsourcing industry is poised to be a significant sector contributing to the country’s economic growth. Owing to the rapid development of information and communication technology in the past decade, the industry constantly boasts double-digit growth rates in revenue and manpower. However, as demand for outsourcing decelerated during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the industry faced its first major challenge. This research explores the Philippine information technology–business process outsourcing industry’s performance during the crisis by assessing the post-crisis results of the industry’s targets and strategies. The study identifies and analyzes the factors that contribute to the sector’s resilience and robust growth during the recession and concludes that offshored services can maintain short- to mid-term growth, but in the long term face major challenges with respect to innovation and talent sustainability. More importantly, the research emphasizes the central role of the Philippine government in the decision-making and policy-reform process that is essential in developing the Philippines into a business process outsourcing center of excellence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Business process outsourcing (BPO) has quickly become a mainstream global industry in the twenty-first century. The amazing growth of the industry can be attributed to globalization and developments in information and communications technology (ICT). Business transactions across borders became more convenient and instantaneous with the availability of real-time data, and trade became borderless and unrestricted.</p>
<p>Cross-border trade in services, particularly in the ICT sector, has become the economic backbone of most developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913493282">Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2233865913493282">Sudan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2233865913493282">Tschang, 2011</xref>). Emerging economies saw a golden opportunity in offshoring and outsourcing (O&amp;O), leveraging on their low-cost resources and abundance of alternative labor. Strategically and economically, multinationals have also discovered the benefit of O&amp;O and have relocated their businesses abroad to take advantage of alternative labor, land, capital and organizational resources. Globalization has also expedited the rate at which vertical de-integration within companies happens—to stay competitive, companies need to invest abroad and reach more consumers worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2233865913493282">Pfannenstein and Tsai, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although increased connectivity brought benefits for most countries and businesses, it also made international systems vulnerable, as seen by the tremendous impact of the recent global crisis. Dubbed the “Great Recession”, the financial meltdown in the late 2000s had countries that depended heavily on the outsourcing sector worried about the deceleration of demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913493282">Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, offshoring has met a good deal of political backlash, especially in developed countries like the United States and UK, because of increasing unemployment and job losses in the source countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913493282">Hira and Hira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2233865913493282">King, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2233865913493282">Pfannenstein and Tsai, 2004</xref>). The ICT sector suffered as the demand for hardware and electronics steeply declined. However, information technology (IT)-based services, which has less elastic demand than hardware, was only slightly affected by the crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2233865913493282">Mitra, 2009</xref>). It is through this resilience that, despite the political and economic threats, the O&amp;O industry shows a promising future in developing countries. However, challenges still remain as the industry rapidly changes over time.</p>
<p>India is the top destination of outsourced IT services. The industry is currently facing transformational opportunities and is becoming one of the world’s leading powers in IT and knowledge-based industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2233865913493282">Mitra, 2009</xref>). Although a shy second, the Philippines is increasingly catching up, having already overtaken India as the number 1 destination in voice-based IT services and contact centers. Furthermore, its non-voice services, especially in medical and legal services and animation, have shown unprecedented growth in the past five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913493282">BSP, 2011</xref>). Overall, the industry has also managed to maintain double-digit positive growth rates even during the global recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2233865913493282">BOI, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of existing literature on outsourcing, studies have been highly concentrated on the case of India and only a few have been published about the Philippines. This has prompted the researcher to pursue a study of the industry’s exceptional performance and resilience in the Philippines during the global financial crisis. This research will contribute to the previous literature owing to its contemporary scope. The paper attempts to show how the Philippines can proactively compete in the outsourcing industry by including a critical assessment of the results of the targets and goals of the Roadmap 2010 during the financial crisis, in line with existing outsourcing theories and research. It includes future challenges that need to be addressed by the government through policies recommended by the research to help ensure the competitiveness of the Philippine IT–BPO sector. The paper will use a descriptive and explanatory research design utilizing a wide range of publications, reports, news articles, journals and books from various public and private institutions and individuals engaged in research with outsourcing and IT services. It will attempt to answer the following questions:</p>

<p>To explore the industry’s performance in the crisis, this study is divided into six sections. The first section gives a brief introduction about the contents of the paper and contains the research methodology, objectives of the research and data sources. Next, we look into the global IT–BPO industry by discussing the whys and whats of outsourcing, including contemporary theories employed by previous studies, and the industry statistics and market potential. Then, we delve specifically into the Philippine IT–BPO industry by presenting its evolution, the ICT-competitiveness criteria and the organizations involved in ICT development in the country. Afterwards, we discuss the recent global financial crisis and assess the Philippines’ performance during the crisis by benchmarking the goals and targets set by the Business Processing Association of the Philippines (BPAP) Roadmap 2010. We also discuss the potential challenges that threaten the continuous growth of the Philippine industry. Then the next section contains the policy implications of the previously discussed chapters, which will help created more robust IT–BPO sector growth amidst these challenges. The final section summarizes the findings and concludes the paper.</p>

<title>The global IT–BPO industry: Theories, taxonomy and statistics</title>
<p>Outsourcing refers to a business decision to hire a third-party contractor to do specific business processes that might otherwise be performed by in-house employees. Outsourcing processes relocated in another country that is significantly geographically separated from the source country is called offshoring.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2233865913493282">1</xref></sup> Many large companies from developed countries outsource jobs such as production and assembly, call center services, email services and payroll. Companies also establish regional headquarters in countries around the globe and transfer the entire management and end-to-end processes of certain business divisions to these remote locations. Originally, the outsourcing industry was associated with manufacturing firms, but it has evolved to include services as well, owing to the increased proliferation of technological developments.</p>
<p>Businesses look at both strategic and economic perspectives when analyzing outsourcing decisions. Strategically, the resource-based theory and/or resource dependency theory suggest that firms’ business decisions are based on the resources available to them and how the companies are able to utilize these resources to be able to survive internally or externally. Economically, cost-efficiency is the key to surviving, wherein businesses take advantage of reduced transaction costs and the economies of scale that come with outsourcing business processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2233865913493282">Lee et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, multinational enterprises move businesses, or business segments, abroad for a wide variety of reasons. These can be either proactive or reactive. Proactive factors are internal business decisions to strengthen the organization’s capabilities, while reactive ones are business responses to external factors such as economic threats and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2233865913493282">Munoz and Welsh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past five years, most outsourcing decisions were reactive responses triggered by the challenges brought about by the global financial crisis. More than strategic motivations, economic-driven decisions were made by businesses. Cost reduction was the priority so as to survive the global economic meltdown, thus, jobs were destroyed in high-cost locations while they were created in the new outsourcing locations that offer lower costs and an alternative labor pool.</p>
<p>The outsourcing industry takes advantage of both the mobility of capital (to low-cost locations) and labor (to different industries). Offshoring usually benefits the service providers more because it allows job creation. On the other hand, jobs in source countries are transferred abroad, and because of non-immediate inter-sectoral movement, the unemployment rate may rise and thus underemployment. This is why critics of outsourcing, more often than not, highlight the impacts of outsourcing on job losses and unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2233865913493282">Greene, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913493282">Hira and Hira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2233865913493282">King, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To look more into outsourcing in detail, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2233865913493282">Figure 1</xref> explains its structure. The business model shows various decisions a company has to make for its business segments. Decisions regarding outsourcing usually involve two dimensions—location and business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2233865913493282">Sako, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, comparative advantage in production factors, firm competencies and business environment are also determining factors that influence outsourcing patterns and decisions of multinationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2233865913493282">Tschang, 2011</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Most developing countries still rely heavily on foreign capital entering the domestic economy (upper-right quadrant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2233865913493282">Figure 1</xref>). If countries are able to create a strong foothold on high-value-added activities, they can move to the lower-right quadrant and establish domestic-grown companies for mature sourcing activities such as voice BPO and data encryption to increase their service export capabilities, diversifying their export portfolio. Furthermore, this will cushion the risks from international crises and maintain domestic control over employment.</p>
<p>In addition to knowing the rationale behind outsourcing as discussed above, it is also imperative to be familiar with the global value chain of offshore services to be able to understand the developments and evolution of the industry. Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark (2009) formulated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2233865913493282">Figure 2</xref> in classifying the varied types of outsourcing activities into definitive business segments. It also aids in identifying the positions of certain regions or countries in terms of the industry’s development and labor-skill capability.</p>

</fig>
<p>Services offered are divided into horizontal activities, which can be provided across all industries, and vertical activities, which are industry-specific. These activities are also classified according to the level of value-added for each business process, which is directly correlated to the skill set of the service provider.</p>
<p>India, as a first mover, has already captured the entire offshore services value chain, providing BPO, knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and sophisticated IT services to vertical industries. Services in the Philippines, on the other hand, are concentrated mostly in the BPO industry with minimal activities in KPO and IT services. Thus, there is still a huge gap between the services offered by the top two offshore service providers. This means a considerable amount of untapped potential in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Continuous development in the IT industry and expansion of multinationals into developing countries reveal that the IT–BPO sector will continue to be a lucrative business. While outsourcing markets are difficult to estimate owing to the escalating digitization of the knowledge-based economy, the industry is expected to expand at compound annual growth rates of between 15 and 40%, with China and India taking a major share of contracts outsourced to developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2233865913493282">Bartels and Lederer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2233865913493282">McKinsey Global Institute (2008)</xref> released reports showing that the annual addressable market for both IT services and IT-enabled services (ITES)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2233865913493282">2</xref></sup> was US$475 billion in 2007 with a compound annual growth rate of 40% projected until 2010. However, only 27% of the whole market was provided for in 2010 with a revenue of US$130 billion. Among the various segments, ITES and IT services have the biggest shares at US$45 billion and 55 billion, respectively. These data show that there is an untapped opportunity of US$345 billion. Indeed, as we can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2233865913493282">Figure 3</xref>, the outsourcing of services will continue to be a very lucrative industry in the future, with much untapped potential in high-value-added services.</p>

<title>The Philippine IT–BPO industry: Catching up with India</title>
<p>The Philippines, with its vast English-speaking population and strong affinity with the Western culture, has become one of the first choices when it comes to outsourcing locations. From a business perspective, it is strategically advantageous to move to the Philippines owing to its rich land and labor resources, and also economically sound because of the comparatively low costs of infrastructure, land rent and labor. Unsurprisingly, the Philippines has capitalized on its in-demand labor force and has overwhelmingly grown its service industry in the past decade. However, we will see in the next few sections that, while the outsourcing industry has been generally resilient, the Philippines still has a great deal of room for improvement to maintain its competitive edge against other developing countries.</p>
<p>As we can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2233865913493282">Figure 4</xref>, at the turn of the twenty-first century, the Philippine outsourcing industry had achieved unprecedented double digit growth year-on-year, attaining around US$10 billion revenue in 2010 while the number of full time employees (FTEs) reached about 530,000 owing to the continuous increased investment in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913493282">BOI, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913493282">BSP, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>According to Everest Research Institute and the Business Process Association of the Philippines (2011), Philippines recorded US$5.70 billion in revenue for voice projects in 2010, overtaking India’s projected US$5.58 billion. Furthermore, the Philippines also has a foothold on non-voice outsourcing, capturing a 10% market share in 2010, which is continuously growing. The country also has a high penetration in Enterprise Service Outsourcing particularly in the applications market, rapidly catching up with China and India. Currently, the Philippines is the number 1 destination for voice BPO, reaching 330,000 FTE, and number 2 in non-voice or IT–BPO, with more than 200,000 FTE. Additionally, more than 60 Fortune 1000 companies have established shared service centers in the Philippines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2233865913493282">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2233865913493282">Figure 5</xref> shows that contact centers (voice BPO) remain the highest contributors to BPO with revenue of around US$5.3 billion, while transcription and animation are still in their infancy, capturing only US$84 million and US$63 million, respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>While these numbers are remarkable, it is also important to note the obstacles faced by the country in attaining further growth in the sector. As mentioned, India’s focus, as an industry leader and first mover, has already shifted to higher-skilled activities in the global value services chain. For the Philippines to catch up with this trend, it must face talent-related constraints in the non-voice sector. The Philippines must ensure it has a steady supply of professionals and highly skilled workers to offer the more complex, high value-added services to meet clients’ demands. Other prevalent issues on infrastructure, business environment and policies should also be taken into account, to address the strategic and economic concerns of businesses abroad.</p>
<p>To be able to assess the Philippines’ competitiveness in the ICT and IT service sectors, it is important that we identify four ICT-competitiveness criteria as utilized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2233865913493282">Telecommunications Management Group Inc. (2008)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2233865913493282">4</xref></sup> These are (1) ICT infrastructure; (2) ICT policy, law and regulations; (3) business environment; and (4) human resources. The discussion below looks at the current status of Philippine government policies with respect to the above four factors, which all contribute to the resource dependency and cost-efficiency motivation of multinationals engaged in outsourcing.</p>
<sec id="section4-2233865913493282">
<title>ICT infrastructure</title>
<p>Overall, the Philippines’ ICT infrastructure is still relatively underdeveloped and largely concentrated in urban areas. Low PC penetration, relatively high internet access costs and bandwidth limitations are the major challenges for infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2233865913493282">Lallana, 2003</xref>). However, costs have substantially decreased in recent years as technology continues to be developed.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank ICT Data in 2009, the Philippines show low costs in mobile cellular prepaid phones and fixed broadband internet access at US$6.2 per month and US$21.5, respectively, compared with other low–middle-income countries with an average of US$7.1 and 30.4. This can be attributed to the competitive market structure of the mobile phone industry, consisting of nine international carriers, six cellular operators nationwide and 70 long distance and local carriers.</p>
<p>Another important factor in infrastructure is the availability of office rent space. According to the Global Market Rents Report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2233865913493282">CB Richard Ellis (2008)</xref>, the Philippines maintains a low cost at US$38.43/ft<sup>2</sup>/annum, which is cheaper than other locations such as Singapore at US$139.31 and Shanghai at US$68.45. Additionally, electricity costs are also cheap and there is excess capacity over current demand with office buildings having back-up generator systems installed. To address the increasing demand for office space, the Philippines anticipates adding approximately 280,000m<sup>2</sup> of office space in 2011 mainly in the Fort Bonifacio area. The current government also promotes the public–private partnership program in improving various infrastructures throughout the country, including roads, airports, transportation, hospitals and schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2233865913493282">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2233865913493282">
<title>Policy, legal and regulatory framework</title>
<p>There are several laws in the Philippines that help protect investors in the ICT industry. The Electronic Commerce Act of the Philippines gives legal recognition to electronic documents, signatures and transactions. The E-commerce Act of 2000 contains provisions on cybercrime that penalize hacking and online piracy. The Telecoms Act of 1995 establishes the national policy for telecommunications governing operators and service providers. The country is also a signatory to various international conventions and treaties on intellectual property rights and is also bound to the provisions of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
<p>The Philippine government is oriented toward investment promotion and thus the provision of institutional infrastructure for investment. Laws such as the Foreign Investment Act of 1991 (Republic Act 7042) and the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 (Republic Act 7916) were created to encourage foreign capital entry to the Philippines. RA 7916 paved the way for the creation of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2233865913493282">6</xref></sup> that administers 239 Special Economic Zones (SEZs), 148 of which are IT parks, around the country that offer various incentives for foreign investors, such as income tax holidays, duty-free importation of equipment, simplified trade procedure and employment of non-resident foreign nationals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2233865913493282">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2233865913493282">
<title>Business environment</title>
<p>For the outsourcing industry, the business environment is the key to investment decisions made by multinational enterprises. The PEZA grants investors that are locating their ITES, BPO, KPO or call center operation within a PEZA zone and/or PEZA registered building various incentives. Companies registering their businesses with the Board of Investments (BOI) also enjoy the same benefits offered by PEZA but without the restrictions of having their businesses located in SEZs.</p>
<p>The Philippine government has also instituted the Philippine Cyber Services Corridor to create interconnected centers of technology-related services all over the country. The project was jumpstarted with the establishment of the Philippine Silicon Valley in the University of the Philippines Technology Park in Quezon City. The compound now houses 20 software and technology outsourcing companies such as the Java Research &amp; Development Center and IBM. The Technology Park was also recently awarded by the World Bank infoDev project as the most successful incubation center in Asia. The corridor will stretch 600 miles from the north to south of the country to include other major “Next Wave” cities in the development of the ITES sector.</p>

<p>The country is rich in skilled and unskilled workers, with 59.2% of the population considered to be part of the working class. Preliminary findings of the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics for 2011 show that there are approximately 39.2 million Filipinos in the labor force with a 63.7% labor participation rate. The country’s employment rate is 92.6%, with unemployment rate at 7.4%.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, the Philippines’ total adult literacy rate as of 2008 is 95%, which is well above the world average of 83%. The Philippines’ education system currently consists of basic compulsory education of 12 years. The Department of Education has geared up to implement a K–12<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2233865913493282">8</xref></sup> curriculum to be implemented in the 2012 school year to raise the country’s basic education course to world standards and produce high school graduates ready to be employed even without a college degree.</p>
<p>The Philippines have also produced 469,654 qualified graduates and professionals for the school year 2008–2009, with 45,830 (9.8%) in IT-related fields, 128,057 (27.2%) in medical and allied fields and 48,448 (10.3%) in engineering (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2233865913493282">Appendix</xref> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2233865913493282">Table 8</xref>). The number of graduates is also expected to grow at 5.8% the next year. This shows that there is an adequate supply of qualified professionals to perform high value-added outsourcing activities.</p>
<p>In terms of its programs for the IT–BPO sector, focusing on “near hires”, P500 million is allocated to Technical Education and Skills Development Authority for its IT/BPO industry-based training program for 65,000 possible workers to be trained not just in voice operations but also in important segments of non-voice BPO, such as legal, health care information management, publishing, animation, game development and software development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2233865913493282">ABS-CBN News, 2011</xref>). Additionally, the Philippines’ usage of English as its second official language and its close affinity to the Western culture are major advantages against other offshoring destinations. The country was hailed as the world’s best country in business English proficiency in the workplace through the Business English Index<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2233865913493282">9</xref></sup> by GlobalEnglish Corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2233865913493282">Mendoza, 2012</xref>). The Philippines obtained an index of 7.11, making it the only country in the intermediate level, among 76 countries surveyed.</p>
<p>Considering the criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2233865913493282">Table 1</xref>, that can be measured quantitatively, they show that the Philippines is only somewhat competitive in rent costs and salary for IT workers and it needs major improvements in its business environment in terms of ease of doing business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2233865913493282">10</xref></sup> The country’s shortfall in these quantitative measures is overcome by the service quality it offers.</p>

<p>Central to the BPO industry in the Philippines is the BPAP. With its 250 member firms, it is the umbrella organization for IT–BPO and GIC (Global In-House Center) related firms in the Philippines. The organization leads several activities that help promote the Philippines as the premier outsourcing destination with regards to maintaining labor quality and competitiveness, service innovation and country visibility. BPAP’s brainchild—the Roadmap 2010—was the first comprehensive report about the BPO industry in the Philippines. The details of the “blueprint” and its results post-crisis will be discussed further in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section8-2233865913493282">
<title>Surviving the downturn: performance of the IT–BPO industry during the financial crisis</title>
<p>The world economy was in “Great Moderation”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2233865913493282">11</xref></sup> during the late twentieth century with stable, in some ways stagnant, growth patterns of the leading economies in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2233865913493282">Bean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2233865913493282">Bernanke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2233865913493282">Giannone et al., 2008</xref>). Following this stagnant growth, China began to emerge as a global power, growing at rates far higher than US average. This unprecedented growth combined with low inflation and growing external surplus placed China at the center of the “Platinum Age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913493282">Garnaut and Huang, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2233865913493282">12</xref></sup> China’s growth opened opportunities for other developing countries to expand their economies. There was a surge in external financing, a boom in consumption and an increase in investments and exports in the developing world, led by China and India. However, this unprecedented growth was globally unsustainable as large current deficits in the advanced economies, loose monetary policies, lax financial regulations and underestimation of risks brought about by decreasing costs of capital became threats to the booming global economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913493282">Islam and Verick, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The global financial crisis had diverse effects on developing countries in terms of trade, poverty reduction, capital flows, and migration and remittance. Since the effect was global, the export-oriented growth of the developing economies was enormously affected by the decrease in demand from advanced nations. Trade slowed from 6.4% in 2007 to 2.1% in 2008 and further contracted to −12.2% in 2009. The slump in 2009 was the largest decline since 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2233865913493282">World Trade Organization, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Amidst the slowdown, Asia was at the forefront of recovery, led by India and China. The region had favorable, if not exemplary, economic conditions even during the recession, making it well positioned to respond quickly to the crisis. Stock markets showed positive growth expectations. Firms also began to rehire staff. Import orders from all over the world increased, indicating recovery signs for world trade.</p>
<p>The financial crisis had two opposing effects on the global value chain—the substitution effect vs the demand effect—the former caused companies to relocate to cheaper locations, leading to growth in offshoring, and the latter showed decreasing demand from clients owing to recession, resulting in a decline in offshoring activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913493282">Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2010</xref>). There was a significant growth slowdown in India’s offshore services during the crisis with only 16% growth in 2009, compared with 37% in 2006, and employment growth rate dropping from 27% in 2006 to 11% in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2233865913493282">National Association of Software and Service Companies, n.d</xref>.). The “substitution effect” on the other hand made companies unbundle their business processes and relocate them to developing country locations, which offer labor arbitrage.</p>
<p>As shown in the previous section, the IT–BPO industry in the Philippines maintained its double-digit growth rates even during the financial crisis, increasing its revenue at 44.80%, 30.56% and 21.80% year-on-year in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2233865913493282">Appendix</xref>). Although it is evident that there is a continued decrease in growth, the continuing double-digit growth rates and increasing revenues in each sector show the marked resilience of the industry owing to the substitution effect, even through the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Additionally, from 2006 to 2010 the industry grew its revenues by 246%, its export value by 314% and equity by 607%. In terms of exports, during the five years from 2006 to 2010, software development grew the most, with 73% growth average, followed by medical transcription at 63%. Similarly, equity investment in software development and transcription also grew by 160% and 119%, respectively. This goes to show that there is a huge potential for non-voice BPO work compared with the mature contact centers sector that grew its exports only by 40% and its equity by 67% on average (in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2233865913493282">Appendix</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section9-2233865913493282">
<title>Roadmap 2010: targets, strategies and results</title>
<p>Even with this impressive growth, the industry still fell short of its Roadmap 2010 targets. The <italic>Offshoring and Outsourcing Philippines: Roadmap 2010</italic> was published by BPAP, in cooperation with McKinsey Research Institute in 2007 to assess the state of the O&amp;O industry in the Philippines. It recommended that the country set an aspirational target of 10% global market share with US$13 billion revenue and 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by 2010. The industry was also expected to create 1.2–1.5 million indirect jobs across other industries. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2233865913493282">Table 2</xref> contains a summary of the goals and plans recommended by BPAP from its “blueprint” to 2010.</p>

<p>After the global financial crisis, however, it was reported by BPAP that the industry had only generated 350,000 direct jobs and up to 700,000–1 million indirect jobs at the end of 2010. It is also estimated to have attained an 8% global market share with close to 30% CAGR during the five year period. Additionally, it also catalyzed the growth of more than 10 “Next Wave Cities” adding over 50,000 FTEs. Although these results are impressive, they fell short of the initial targets made by BPAP as described in the previous paragraph. Possible reasons can be attributed to the recent crisis and also weak domestic institutional frameworks that aid in pushing these strategies forward. Nonetheless, the growth pattern is still commendable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2233865913493282">
<title>Critical assessment of the Roadmap 2010 results</title>
<p>The BPAP initiatives and post-crisis 2010 results were mentioned above. The below-target performance of the industry can be attributed to several factors, such as slow implementation and lack of a coordination mechanism between the organizations involved. Below are presented the researcher’s assessments of the results of BPAP initiatives based on dependency on resources and cost-efficient business decisions.</p>
<sec id="section11-2233865913493282">
<title>Increased resource capability in the service sector through the SSME faced slow implementation</title>
<p>The decision of multinationals to move to offshore locations is motivated by their dependence on resources not available domestically. Thus, an offshore location’s main selling point is the quality of its labor pool. In the Philippines, however, the prevalent issue and major challenge in confronting the fast growing demand for BPO is the sustainability of the talent pool with respect to higher value-added skill sets. In terms of talent management and development, BPAP and IBM signed a memorandum of agreement for a Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) collaboration, which allocated P350 million scholarship funds for training new hires in colleges and universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2233865913493282">13</xref></sup> The program was implemented in 2012 and the results are quite optimistic.</p>
<p>It seems to have an ambitious interdisciplinary approach to the service sector, bringing together science, management and engineering systems in one curriculum. Owing to this complexity and given that it is still in its infancy, the strategy seems to have faced a major setback with its slow implementation and rollout to the universities in the Philippines. The lack of a better institutional framework and inter-agency cooperation domestically may have brought about the slow progress with this initiative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2233865913493282">
<title>Next Wave Cities could not utilize full absorptive capacity</title>
<p>Next to labor are the land and infrastructure. The creation of the “Next Wave Cities” has accommodated the expansion and supply of fresh talent and has hosted the expansion of operations of major multinationals. These Tier 2 and 3 cities include Cebu City, Clark and Davao, which are the other major cities in the Philippines. Yet, the absorptive capacity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2233865913493282">14</xref></sup> of these cities is theoretically underutilized. For example, if we look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2233865913493282">Figure 6</xref>, Metro Laguna only employs 6000 BPO workers but is able to support 206,000 FTEs.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2233865913493282-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Closer coordination between the national and local government is needed in identifying and addressing the obstacles to reaching this full capacity. These challenges vary in each city and need to be identified by the local government to encourage more investment in their cities. Physical and office infrastructure in the new wave cities needs to be further improved through careful and meticulous urban development. Most importantly, the quality of the talent pool should be developed on a par with the talent pool in Metro Manila. This can be done through seminars and training initiated by the local government in collaboration with academia and private companies, starting with secondary school students to increase awareness of the possible careers in the BPO sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2233865913493282">
<title>Investment promotion remains the central strategy to increase awareness of the Philippines as destination choice for outsourcing</title>
<p>Finally, proper marketing of these cost-affordable resources encourages continuous capital entry. The industry has also actively participated in trade and investment shows abroad to encourage new investment. BPAP has also organized the International Outsourcing Summit held annually in the Philippines, participated in by international delegates and experts on outsourcing. It has also started the accreditation of IT Parks and Buildings as part of the PEZA initiatives for the Philippine Cyber Services Corridor. The Philippines has also diversified its clientele to nearshore locations such as Australia and other Asian countries such as Japan. Legislators are also pushing for the Data Privacy and Protection Bill to be passed in Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913493282">BOI, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Enhancing the business environment through improvements in the ease of doing business should also be given attention by the government. This requires institutional reforms in the process of investments, acquiring business permits and tax payments, not just in the SEZs but also focused on locations outside of SEZs.</p>
<p>As a whole, the three results above show that huge improvement in policy implementation and inter-agency coordination is needed. To address these issues, government intervention and a more active role in developing the IT–BPO sector is necessary. Since the share of services in trade has significantly increased in the past years, sound government policies that help address the business needs for outsourcing can help move the Philippines to the next level of outsourcing.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-2233865913493282">
<title>Other threats and challenges</title>
<p>Furthermore, there are two notable external issues that need to be discussed owing to their direct effect on demand for outsourcing. First is the House Bill 3596: Call Center and Consumers Protection Bill (HR 3596 hereafter). Second is the continuing debt crisis in the Eurozone.</p>
<p>The negative perception against outsourcing in the United States was given prominence during President Barack Obama’s 2012 State of the Union Address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2233865913493282">The White House, 2012</xref>). During his speech, he encouraged businesses to bring back jobs to the United States. Incentives in the form of tax reforms by shifting tax rewards from companies that outsource to companies that create jobs in America were to be implemented. Preceding the speech, on 7 December 2011, United States Representative Tim Bishop introduced a bill in Congress that would penalize companies that placed call centers offshore. The HR 3596 was introduced “to require a publicly available list of all employers that relocate a call center overseas and to make such companies ineligible for Federal grants or guaranteed loans and to require disclosure of the physical location of business agents engaging in customer service communications” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2233865913493282">Open Congress, n.d</xref>.). This bill and President Obama’s call for insourcing are possible threats to the growing potential of outsourcing. Thus, developing countries should increase their competitiveness and innovative capabilities to avoid huge foreign capital loss.</p>
<p>Another pressing, but not so major, issue for the outsourcing industry is the prevailing Euro crisis. The sovereign-debt crisis that plagued the Eurozone has affected most of the global market. Although there has been great care given by the Eurozone leaders to implement measures designed to prevent the collapse of member economies, uncertainty and risk are fueled by credit rating agencies that have already downgraded the credit rating of most of the countries, and also by the media and financial market speculators. For the Philippines’ plan to expand its market share, entry into the European market is quite uncertain. However, EU Ambassador to the Philippines, Guy Ledoux, said that investing in the sunshine industry of BPO is a way for European companies to stay competitive during the crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2233865913493282">Valencia, 2012</xref>). Currently, European companies’ share of the local BPO market is 10% of the total foreign investments. Furthermore, Ledoux said that, as far as foreign investment and trade between the Philippines and EU are concerned, the flow of European investments into the Philippines will depend on the investment climate in the Philippines more than on the economic situation in Europe.</p>
<p>These threats to outsourcing have serious repercussions to the industry if not handled well. Attributed to the inelastic demand for technology, the ‘substitution effect’ still has a stronger pull compared with the ‘demand effect’, and outsourcing will still continue to be an option for companies. However, the question is: will the Philippines still be a competitive location?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-2233865913493282">
<title>Policy recommendations</title>
<p>BPAP’s current initiative is a significant driving force to improve the industry’s performance. The organization’s Roadmap 2010 and 2016 are useful tools to assess the sector’s capabilities, strengths, challenges and opportunities, especially in resource improvement. However, this paper argues that a private organization’s initiative would be more effectively implemented if the government assumed a more central role in instigating policy reforms that are necessary for the industry’s growth sustainability. Discussed below are the policy implications extracted from our critical assessment of the current government policy as per Roadmap 2010.</p>
<sec id="section16-2233865913493282">
<title>Training and re-training programs are necessary to maintain labor pool quality and income hierarchy movement</title>
<p>The major issue at hand has to be skills–jobs mismatch. Although the Philippines boasts a population of 101 million, the majority of its labor force are not well-equipped to perform high-end activities in business processes. The rapid pace of growth of the BPO demand has resulted in a large gap in the supply of mid-level managers and senior-level executives. Also, owing to stiff competition among the companies and between the voice and non-voice sectors, attrition rates are high. Training programs designed to increase capabilities should have a targeted audience such that the curriculum is made to cater to a specific skill set (i.e. entry level, managers, executives). The government and the BPAP can implement these programs on a wider audience to exploit economies of scale, thus lowering costs. Furthermore, the government should have a monitoring mechanism for re-training programs within the company to assure that technology transfer is being utilized efficiently. Internal training programs for soft skills and international certification within companies will ensure a quality labor pool addressing the shortage of managerial positions. Moreover, this will enable income bracket movement within the company, resulting in decreased attrition rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-2233865913493282">
<title>Service innovation should be the top priority</title>
<p>Without doubt the industry can sustain short- to mid-term sector and economic growth, but it requires attention in terms of long-term sustainability. In the long run, the BPO sector needs to cushion the impact of outsourcing backlash by focusing on innovation. In fact, a survey among BPO clients in the United States suggested that a third of the respondents look for BPO providers to drive innovation in three forms: business model innovation; service market innovation; and operations innovation. From these three, service market innovation is deemed the most important. If the Philippines focuses on creating new markets, particularly in KPO, and develops sectors in their infancy, it can prove to be a first mover and have an advantage in the sector. Also, in connection with the first recommendation, technology transfer from the multinationals to the local talent pool can be tapped to ensure that the skill sets of human capital are constantly improving.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-2233865913493282">
<title>Develop emerging sectors such as legal and medical services, and animation and game development</title>
<p>The government should realize the potential of local talent in professional services and animation. Contact centers have already reached maturity and are growing at a decreasing rate. Focus should be shifted to emerging sectors such as legal and medical transcription and animation. The country has enough certified professionals in the legal and medical field to address the demand for manpower in these back office services. Privacy concerns for outsourcing medical records can be one of the drawbacks in developing this sector, but this can be addressed by policy reforms in protecting data privacy and a robust well-designed system that protects confidential information from outsiders. The Philippines’ competitiveness relies on its comprehensive education system in medicine, comparable to the United States, and its large population that can participate in the clinical trials for new medicines.</p>
<p>Similarly, the animation and game development sector also has a huge growth potential in the future, especially in the age of smartphones and video game consoles. Filipino artists have also been making waves abroad working on 3D graphics for Hollywood movies. In game development, the country also has enough competent IT and engineering graduates to perform these tasks, ranging from concept art design to in-game animation, game testing and quality control and support.</p>

<title>Empower local companies to increase competitiveness in the global market</title>
<p>It is no secret that most companies in the Philippine BPO industry are set up using foreign capital. The sector is overly dependent on foreign capital to create domestic jobs, thus, most profits are repatriated to the investing country and only a minority is reinvested domestically. The key is to develop the international branding of home-grown outsourcing companies such that they can compete in the global market. The government should create an incentive scheme that can encourage the creation of local companies using the technology transfer from the talent pool that has worked with multinational companies. Similar to the Indian model, the country can leverage the innate skills and capabilities of the Filipino people and encourage active behavior for innovation such that those who have worked abroad can create their own companies domestically given the appropriate incentive or subsidy from the government. In turn, the government can also encourage domestic consumption of these services by hiring these small and medium enterprises at the local government unit (LGUs) and later on, they can be developed into competitive global companies. The benefits from such policies, though, can only be realized in the long run. A mid-term solution can be to encourage joint ventures with multinational companies such that the service providers still carry the local name, but are providing world-class service through collaboration with multinationals.</p>

<title>Develop physical and office infrastructure in the “Next Wave Cities” to encourage more investment</title>
<p>Physical and office infrastructure developments are still concentrated in the urban areas in the Metro Manila region, but rents are still expected to increase by 5–10% in the next two years. The increase in costs might be a disadvantage for companies, which aim to lower their costs through outsourcing. This can be addressed through the public–private partnership program of the government in improving physical infrastructure such as airports and roads in emerging cities. This can be complemented by a joint program between the national government and LGUs to develop office space in the “Next Wave Cities” that is comparable to those in the metro. The electricity and internet broadband costs at these provinces are also lower than those in the greater Manila area, making these cities attractive offshoring destinations. However, the government should also be prepared to tackle shortages in electricity once the demand increases with the growth of the IT–BPO sector. Most importantly, government agencies such as the CICT should work quickly to create a robust wireless network to ensure business continuity in times of calamities with the Philippines being an area often visited by typhoons and hurricanes.</p>

<sec id="section21-2233865913493282">
<title>Improve the policy and legal framework to support ICT development in the country</title>
<p>There is a gap between national and local governments’ implementation of policies in investments. Furthermore, there is no clear and consistent policy from the national government in supporting the IT–BPO industry. This is evidenced with the various organizations that were implemented to promote ICT development in the country; sometimes roles overlap, causing confusion among the agencies. Also, there is a disconnect between the tax policies in SEZs and the 1991 Local Government Code that allows LGUs to impose taxes on companies, resulting in inconsistencies in policies implemented in other domestic locations. Improving the information campaign in the LGUs outside of Metro Manila regarding tax schemes and investment strategies should be a priority.</p>
<p>Recently, there has also been a clamor in the United States and other developing economies to retain jobs; this may cause negative effects for countries that depend on outsourcing for economic growth. A major concern in the source countries is confidential data protection, given that services are outsourced to developing countries that still lack the proper institutional framework to address such issues.</p>
<p>For all the policy recommendations discussed above, this paper recognizes the central role of the government in implementing necessary information dissemination, policy reforms, education and training programs, and investment promotion to sustain the growth of the IT–BPO industry in the Philippines. The recent global financial crisis has tested the sector’s sustainability and has proven its resilience amidst these challenges. The only thing left to do is for the government to assume its role in making sure that the industry’s strengths and competitiveness are maintained with respect to business resource dependencies and cost-effective measures.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>Facilitated by information and communications technology developments and the constant business demand for cost-efficiency and competitiveness, the service outsourcing sector is definitely here to stay for the long run. There are many growth opportunities in service outsourcing because of the diversity of services, from low to mid value-added activities in the BPO and high value-added processes in professional services through KPO and software R&amp;D in ITO. Service companies can also concentrate on vertical activities in industries such as health and pharmaceuticals, tourism and animation.</p>
<p>The Philippines as a key player in the industry needs to maintain its comparative advantage in costs and quality resources, especially its labor pool. Improving talent capability, maintaining innate capability, adaptation to the American accent, commitment to improving business environment and implementing the necessary ICT policies and regulations are necessary enhancements for growth sustainability, especially when other developing countries are entering the market.</p>
<p>The first challenge for the outsourcing industry was the 2008 global financial crisis. The recession happened when the sector was in its infancy in the developing countries. Nonetheless, the IT–BPO sector displayed marked resilience during the crisis and helped in the economic development of most countries that produce service exports. The Filipino peoples’ neutral English accent and competency in business English make the country highly competitive in the market, making it the primary choice of investors. Furthermore, incentives offered in the SEZs by the PEZA and BOI greatly help in encouraging the entry of foreign capital. However, further service innovation, improvement in the business environment and ICT policy structure need to be given attention to address the incessant business demand for quality resources and effective cost-reduction measures.</p>
<p>BPAP, the Philippine’s umbrella organization for BPO, created the Roadmap 2010, which aspired to reach a 15% global market share, US$13 billion in revenue and 40% CAGR for the BPO industry. However, owing to the global recession that adversely affected world trade, investments and businesses, the Philippines was not able to meet its targets for 2010. Nonetheless, the domestic BPO industry displayed its resilience, still posting double-digit positive growth in revenue and manpower during the crisis. This can be largely attributed to the ‘substitution effect’ wherein multinational businesses reacted to the recession by moving some of their business segments abroad to decrease costs, increase international competitiveness and survive the global business landscape.</p>
<p>This paper emphasizes that the government’s active behavior in intervening with the policy reforms necessary for sustainable growth will eventually end with positive results. First, immediate action is needed with changes in the education sector to ensure the development of the capability and skill set of the country’s labor pool required to meet the growing demand for high-skilled services. This can be done with a robust education curriculum and training programs from both the public and private sectors. Second, physical, ICT and office infrastructure should be improved. Development projects should be made in the “Next Wave Cities” to narrow the infrastructure gap between the urban and rural areas. Third, sound ICT policies should be implemented and enhancements of the business processes in the Philippines should be delivered. Tax breaks are not enough to encourage foreign capital; instead, reforms in the business registration process should be employed to enhance the ease of doing business. Finally, home-grown outsourcing companies should be empowered. Enabling small and medium-sized enterprises that engage in outsourcing activities to become global competitors should be a priority of the government. A strategy that is service trade-based vs investments-based is more robust as it allows a more dynamic domestic-induced growth.</p>
<p>With the change in administration after the crisis in 2010, reforms are currently being implemented to strengthen the Philippine IT–BPO industry. However, it is still too early to identify the results from these policy changes. Hopefully, the government’s active participation in the sector development will not wane in the coming years. Its central role in the decision and policy-making process is necessary to make the Philippines a BPO center of excellence.</p>

<p>The terms outsourcing and offshoring are more often than not interchangeably used in written texts regarding this industry. However, in the interess of this research we will be using the term offshoring or offshore outsourcing as more appropriate.

<p>The K–12 program would restructure the basic education system with a required kindergarten, six years in elementary (grades 1–6), four years of junior high school (grades 7–10) and two years of senior high (grades 11–12). The final two years of the program will allow students to choose an area of specialization from performing arts, vocational training, sports, agriculture, etc. Originally, the Philippine education system only consisted of an optional kindergarten course, and compulsory six-year primary school and four-year high school, only for a total of 10–11 years of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2233865913493282">Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>“Great Moderation” is the term used to describe the economic phase of reduced volatility on both output and inflation owing to improved monetary policy and structural changes in business practices and technology. It was first mentioned in Stock and Watson’s paper “Has the business cycle changed and why?” in 2003 but was made famous by Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, in one of his speeches in 2004.</p>
