<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies of the assessment of fitness to drive have used on-road assessment as the gold standard against which to measure other assessment methods, such as cognitive tests, carer reports and simulators. It is assumed that a one-off assessment drive will accurately reflect driving ability in everyday life. The assessment is usually conducted by a driving assessor who specializes in the assessment of people with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>However, the question arises as to the consistency of fitness-to-drive decisions between different assessors. In many studies it has been assumed that the driving assessor used is representative of all driving assessors, but this is rarely checked. Small-scale studies have indicated that on-road assessments are reliable in people with neurological disabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442413">1</xref></sup> and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442413">2</xref></sup> The aim of the present study was to examine the agreement between two experienced driving assessors for people with dementia. In addition to examining the overall decision about safety, the agreement on individual items of the road test was examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269215512442413" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants were identified from those referred to a study examining cognitive tests as predictors of safety to drive in people with dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512442413">3</xref></sup> In this study clinicians were invited to refer participants with dementia who were currently driving. The participants for the present study were selected on the basis that they were able to attend for assessment on a day when two driving assessors were available. Each participant was assessed on the road on the Nottingham Neurological Driving Assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442413">1</xref></sup> This on-road assessment comprises 25 items which are recorded as correct, minor error (not compromising safety) and major error (compromising safety). In addition there is a global rating which is recorded at the end of the drive using the categories: definitely safe, probably safe, probably unsafe or definitely unsafe to drive. Participants were assessed in their own car unless they requested to be assessed in the driving assessor’s dual-controlled car or there were serious concerns about their safety. Participants were taken on a drive lasting about 40 minutes along a standard route which included dual carriageways, complex junctions and quiet country roads. One driving instructor was in the passenger seat and the other in the rear seat. All instructions were given by the assessor in the passenger seat; the second instructor was an observer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512442413" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Six people with dementia took part. They were aged 73–85 and five were men. Four drove a manual transmission car and two an automatic transmission car. Four were assessed in their own car and two in the driving instructor’s car.</p>
<p>Of the six drivers, four were found to be probably safe to drive and two were definitely unsafe. There was complete agreement between the two raters in their decisions about safety to drive.</p>
<p>Results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512442413">Table 1</xref>. The agreement on the individual items assessed on the road was 100% for 7 of the 25 road test items. On 13 items there were discrepancies between ratings of minor error (not enough to compromise safety) and no error. On 5 road test items there were discrepancies between ratings of correct or minor error and major errors. Overall there were significant discrepancies between assessors’ judgements on 6 out of 150 observations (4%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall the agreement between raters was good, with perfect agreement in the overall decision about safety to drive. There were only six occasions when the road test items were recorded by one assessor as correct and the other as an error sufficient to compromise safety. These discrepancies tended to occur on items which may be difficult to judge from the rear seat, such as positioning and use of speed. Similar methodological limitations of checking inter-rater reliability of on-road assessment have been noted by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442413">2</xref></sup> The discrepancies between no and minor errors were not considered further as they occur in most drivers and would not be used to stop someone driving. The discrepancies occurred in both directions so it was not that one assessor was more lenient than the other.</p>
<p>These results suggest that two independent road assessors with no previous experience working together were consistent in their judgement of safety to drive in people with dementia. It suggests that studies which rely on the road test given by one assessor probably reflect safety to drive in general and the results are not specific to that assessor. It is also consistent with the results in people with other medical conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442413">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442413">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, there are limitations. The two assessors may not be representative of all driving assessors, as both were relatively experienced in assessing people with dementia. There were only six participants, due to the availability of the two assessors, and these may not have been representative of all drivers with dementia. However, there was a spread of driving ability, with some safe and some unsafe drivers.</p>
<p>Overall, the results provide preliminary evidence to support the inter-rater reliability of the Nottingham Neurological Driving Assessment as a global assessment of safety to drive for people with dementia, but further studies are needed.</p>
