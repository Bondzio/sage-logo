<p>Over the past 30 years, a great amount of research has been done to understand how lighting affects human health. Scientists have demonstrated that white light as low as 200 lux at the cornea stops melatonin production at night, identified a novel photoreceptor in the eye, established the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system, and investigated the application of light as a tool to reduce seasonal depression, increase performance and alertness, and improve sleep in older adults. Moreover, it has been shown that circadian disruption by irregular light/dark pattern exposures is associated with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and even cancer. But, what is missing before we can forge the link between light and health (or diseases)? In my opinion, quantification of circadian light exposures in the field is the missing piece.</p>
<p>More specifically, we need to quantify the magnitude of the effects of light on the circadian system in different contexts. The context within which lighting is applied will certainly alter its effectiveness on human circadian rhythms (e.g. the effects of night light on a farmer will be different than that on a computer-aided design engineer). Proper light measurements over the course of many days will lead to a better understanding of these contextual effects of light, which is needed before anyone can simply beatify or condemn light as it affects human health. Looking ahead, it will also be imperative that we translate the findings from animal models to humans appropriately and that we have a better understanding of the robustness of light’s effect on the human circadian system in the various environments where light is deliberately applied. In the long term, if we cannot generalise from research using animal models, we will misestimate both the positive and the negative effects of light on the human circadian system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, until proper measurements of light using calibrated instruments are made, ‘experts’ will continue to recommend the replacement of low-wattage ‘white’ nightlights with ‘red’ ones, suggest that watching television at night can be harmful to human health, and imply that there is a health hazard in lighting our streets with light emitting diodes. Until lighting professionals are better grounded in proper light measurements for the circadian system, good intentions will not necessarily lead to good practice; indeed, the opposite is more likely. The belief is that, by being able to measure circadian light exposure throughout 24 hours for various populations, lighting professionals will better understand, control, and hopefully improve the lighted environment. No progress will be made towards that understanding, however, if we do not properly measure the light stimulus in the field. As H. James Harrington stated: ‘Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement. If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it. If you can't control it, you can't improve it.’</p>
