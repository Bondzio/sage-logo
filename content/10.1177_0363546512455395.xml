<title>Background:</title>
<p>Beach volleyball is an overhead sport with a high prevalence of infraspinatus muscle atrophy of the hitting shoulder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512455395">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Infraspinatus muscle atrophy seems to be caused by a repetitive traction injury of the suprascapular nerve. Early pathological findings might be assessed with surface electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512455395">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512455395">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Fully competitive professional beach volleyball players were assessed with a structured interview, shoulder examination, strength measurements (external rotation and elevation), and neurophysiological examination (surface EMG and NCV of the infraspinatus and supraspinatus muscles and the suprascapular nerve, respectively) during the Beach Volleyball Grand Slam tournament 2010 in Klagenfurt, Austria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512455395">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Thirty-five men with an average age of 28 years were examined. Visible infraspinatus atrophy was found in 12 players (34%), of which 8 (23%) had slight atrophy and 4 (11%) had severe atrophy. External rotation (90%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .006) and elevation strength (93%; <italic>P</italic> = .03) were significantly lower in the hitting shoulder. Electromyography revealed a higher activation pattern in the infraspinatus muscle of the hitting arm in players with no or slight atrophy (<italic>P</italic> = .001) but a significantly lower activation pattern in players with severe atrophy (<italic>P</italic> = .013). Nerve conduction velocity measurements showed a significant higher latency and lower amplitude in the hitting shoulder of the total study group and the subgroup with infraspinatus atrophy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512455395">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Professional beach volleyball players have a high frequency of infraspinatus atrophy (34%) and significantly reduced shoulder strength of the hitting shoulder. These findings are not associated with demographic factors. Electromyography and NCV measurements suggest a suprascapular nerve involvement caused by repetitive strain injuries of the nerve. External rotation strength measurements and NCV measurements can detect a side-to-side difference early, while EMG may show compensation mechanisms for progressive damaging of the suprascapular nerve and, as a result, loss of infraspinatus muscle strength.</p>

<body>
<p>Beach volleyball is an overhead sport with a high risk of acute and overuse injuries. The shoulders of high-level beach volleyball players are especially highly stressed when performing repetitive hitting movements.</p>
<p>It was shown in some overhead sports (beach volleyball, volleyball, baseball) that players have an increased prevalence of infraspinatus muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512455395">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512455395">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512455395">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512455395">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512455395">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512455395">21</xref></sup> of their dominant arm compared with nonplayer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512455395">17</xref></sup> Some authors postulate pathological changes in the suprascapular nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512455395">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512455395">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512455395">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512455395">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512455395">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512455395">22</xref></sup> caused by stretching of the nerve over the bony wall of the spinoglenoid notch due to hitting movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512455395">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512455395">9</xref></sup>; a superior labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesion; a ganglion cyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512455395">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512455395">21</xref></sup>; an ossified, bified, or trified superior transverse scapular ligament; or a hypertrophied spinoglenoid (inferior transverse scapular) ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512455395">19</xref></sup> However, the exact cause of that muscle atrophy is not clear. What is known is that the atrophy is usually isolated and affects just the infraspinatus muscle, which is innervated by the suprascapular nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512455395">18</xref></sup> It is usually present only in the dominant arm of the players, while blockers are less affected compared with smashers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512455395">6</xref></sup> Clinically, the affected shoulder has a deficiency of external rotation strength, but many players with objective signs of infraspinatus muscle atrophy do not have subjective handicaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512455395">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the condition of the suprascapular nerve in professional beach volleyball players using surface electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) measurements. It was a specific aim to examine and compare hitting and nonhitting shoulders in both static and dynamic conditions, respectively.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that many professional beach volleyball players have a relevant and measurable neurological lesion of the suprascapular nerve in the hitting arm, resulting in infraspinatus atrophy. With surface EMG and NCV measurements, irregularities of the suprascapular nerve can be detected in the hitting arm compared with the nonhitting arm.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512455395" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The players were examined during the Beach Volleyball Grand Slam tournament 2010 in Klagenfurt, Austria. All players were informed about the study during the technical meeting that all teams were required to attend before the tournament. They were invited and actively asked to participate in the study during the tournament.</p>
<p>The players received the necessary information for the study in a comprehensible written form. All the players confirmed that they agreed with the procedure (informed consent) before the examination. The study was approved by the local ethics committee.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512455395">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Fully competitive, professional (ability to participate in the tournament without restrictions due to health status) male beach volleyball players with or without shoulder pain were included. The main draw of the tournament consisted of 32 male teams. In addition, 26 teams participated in the qualifications, which resulted in a total of 116 potential participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512455395">
<title>Clinical Assessment</title>
<p>Each player underwent a questionnaire including specific questions about duration of high-level volleyball and beach volleyball activity, weekly training activity, and problems or pain around the shoulders. All shoulder girdles were inspected in terms of asymmetry, especially atrophy of the infraspinatus region, and documented by photographs. Infraspinatus muscle atrophy was graded by 3 experienced orthopaedic shoulder surgeons (consensus readout): A symmetric and well-defined muscle belly in the infraspinatus fossa was graded as “no atrophy.” Atrophy of the muscle belly, only detectable by side-to-side comparison, was graded as “slight atrophy” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512455395">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, obvious muscle atrophy detectable already without side-to-side comparison was graded as “severe atrophy” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512455395">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512455395">
<title>Strength Measurements</title>
<p>Strength was assessed for elevation and external rotation of both arms with an Isobex dynamometer (Cursor SA, Bern, Switzerland). Elevation strength was measured in the standing position with the arm in the scapular plane at 90° of elevation and arm in full pronation. Strength was measured 3 times, and the average was calculated. Strength for external rotation was assessed in the sitting position with the arm in adduction and slight flexion, in neutral rotation with the elbow at 90° of flexion. Again, strength was measured 3 times and the average calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512455395">
<title>Electrophysiological NCV Measurements</title>
<p>The NCV measurements were taken with a Neurowerk EMG4 NCV device (SIGMA Medizin-Technik GmbH, Gelenau, Germany). The suprascapular nerve was stimulated with an electrode in the region of the neck (supraclavicular region). The latency and amplitude of the signal were measured on the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. These measurements were performed bilaterally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546512455395">
<title>EMG Measurements</title>
<p>The following muscles were examined bilaterally: deltoid (clavicular, acromial, and scapular part), pectoralis major (sternal and clavicular part), trapezius (upper and middle part), supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles. After the skin was carefully prepared with a sponge and a cleaning paste, 2 skin electrodes were placed on each of the muscle parts on both shoulders, and 1 reference electrode was placed on 1 of the acromioclavicular joints. This resulted in a total of 33 electrodes on the skin of each player (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512455395">Figure 2</xref>). After 30 seconds of drying, the electrodes were connected with the device, and the impedance of the system was measured to get comparable results.</p>

<p>First, the players had to perform special movements in predefined time periods: maximum forward flexion from the neutral position, maximum abduction from the neutral position, maximum external rotation with the arms at the side and the elbow flexed at 90°, and maximum internal rotation with the arms brought back to the spine and reaching with the thumb to the highest level of the spine possible. Next, with the arm in an adducted neutral rotated and slightly flexed position and the elbow at 90° of flexion, they performed external and internal rotations with static resistance. Finally, they had to perform 3 hits with the right arm and 3 hits with the left arm as naturally as possible (to replicate the overhead smashes on court).</p>
<p>The measurements were recorded by video synchronously to the 16-channel EMG measurements. A Noraxon TeleMyo 2400 G2 16-channel EMG device (Scottsdale, Arizona) was used as hardware. Software for data recording, the MyoResearch XP Master Edition version 1.07.41 (Noraxon), was used.</p>

<sec id="section13-0363546512455395">
<title>Statistical Methods and Analysis</title>
<p>For data collection and for data analysis, Excel 2007 (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, Washington) and SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) were used, respectively. The unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used for unpaired groups, and the paired <italic>t</italic> test was used for paired groups. For the frequency between 2 groups, the Fisher exact test was used for paired groups, and the χ<sup>2</sup> test was used for unpaired groups. When the sample size was fewer than 30, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for paired groups, and the Wilcoxon test was used for unpaired groups. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

<title>Demography</title>
<p>Thirty-five (22 players qualified for the main draw) male players participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 28 years (range, 20-37 years), with a mean height of 195 cm (range, 185-210 cm) and a mean weight of 89 kg (range, 76-107 kg). They were fully competitive volleyball players for a mean of 10 years (range, 3-20 years) or beach volleyball players for a mean of 8 years (range, 2-17 years), with a mean of 21 training hours per week (range, 10-36 hours).

<title>Infraspinatus Muscle Atrophy</title>
<p>In 12 of the 35 players (34%), visible atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle was documented. This atrophy was identified as slight in 8 players (23%) and severe in 4 players (11%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512455395">Figure 1B</xref> shows a severely atrophied infraspinatus muscle of the right hitting shoulder.</p>

<sec id="section18-0363546512455395">
<title>Strength Measurements</title>
<p>Strength measurements for elevation and external rotation were completed for all of the 35 examined players. The average elevation strength in the hitting shoulder was 10.6 kg (range, 4.9-16.9 kg), which was significantly less (93%; <italic>P</italic> = .03) than that of the contralateral side, where it averaged 11.4 kg (range, 6.1-15.4 kg). For external rotation, the differences were even more pronounced and averaged 12.9 kg (range, 2.7-22.6 kg) in the hitting shoulder, which was significantly less (90%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .006) than the 14.3 kg (range, 8.9-24.8 kg) in the contralateral shoulder.</p>
<p>Players with atrophy (n = 12) had significantly more loss of external rotation strength (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) than players without atrophy (n = 23). No significant correlations between the grade of atrophy and other parameters, like body mass index (<italic>P</italic> = .81), age (<italic>P</italic> = .63), or practice hours per week (<italic>P</italic> = .76), were found.</p>

<title>EMG Measurements</title>
<p>Thirty players were examined with EMG measurements to evaluate eventual abnormalities in muscle activation. Three players with severe atrophy, 8 with slight atrophy, and 19 players without atrophy were examined. Electromyography analysis of the infraspinatus muscle during the performed smashes did not reveal significant differences in side-to-side comparison. However, the activation pattern of the infraspinatus muscle during external rotation of the hitting arm showed a significant difference in all groups of atrophy compared with the contralateral side.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Beach volleyball is an Olympic sport with intensive, repetitive overhead hitting activity. Although the phenomenon of infraspinatus muscle atrophy of volleyball players is well documented in the literature, little is known about the causes of this atrophy, its effect on shoulder function, and its correlation with electrophysiological measurements such as EMG or NCV.</p>
<p>In this study, infraspinatus atrophy was visible in 34% of the hitting shoulders, which is comparable with findings in other reports (30%-33%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512455395">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref></sup>). However, this atrophy was also not associated with any of the demographic factors (height or age of the players, duration of playing volleyball at a high level, or amount of hours practicing volleyball per week).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the players with infraspinatus atrophy did not report any subjective restrictions attributed to it, but the atrophy has a relevant effect on measured (objective) shoulder strength. For the 35 players, external rotation strength was significantly reduced in the hitting shoulder, as compared with the contralateral shoulder, with 68% of the players having less external rotation strength compared with the contralateral side. This is as much as reported by Lajtai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref></sup> Although this loss of external rotation strength was also measured in players without any visible atrophy, players with clear infraspinatus atrophy had significantly more loss of external rotation strength than did players without.</p>
<p>The literature well acknowledges that the reason for infraspinatus atrophy is overhead shoulder activity, overuse, or trauma leading to a neuropathy of the suprascapular nerve. Such neuropathy can be caused respectively by direct compression of the suprascapular nerve at the level of the scapular notch or at the spinoglenoid notch because of a ganglion cyst or a hypertrophied transverse scapular or spinoglenoid ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512455395">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512455395">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512455395">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512455395">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512455395">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512455395"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512455395">11</xref></sup> However, in volleyball players with infraspinatus atrophy, compression of the suprascapular nerve by a ganglion cyst or a ligament is usually not observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref></sup> We agree with Ferretti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512455395">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512455395">10</xref></sup> that the cause of infraspinatus atrophy in volleyball players is a stretching neuropathy of the suprascapular nerve caused by the repetitive hitting activity. In our NCV evaluation, the amplitude of the signal of the hitting side was significantly less compared with the contralateral side (suggesting an injury of the axons), and the latency was higher in comparison (which suggested demyelination).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512455395">16</xref></sup> Overall, this would be compatible with a repetitive strain injury or trauma.</p>
<p>The EMG muscle activity of the infraspinatus muscle of the hitting side was compared with the activity of the contralateral side. Overall, the mean activation pattern was higher on the hitting side and significantly higher on the hitting side in the groups with no or slight atrophy (<italic>P</italic> = .001), whereas it was significantly lower on the hitting side in the group with severe atrophy (<italic>P</italic> = .013) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512455395">Table 2</xref>). This interesting finding might be interpreted as a compensating mechanism in which the muscle-nerve unit of the infraspinatus muscle tries to compensate for the already existing damage of the suprascapular nerve with an increased activation of the remaining muscle fibers until the damage is too high and the activation breaks down, which results finally in severe atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle. However, this does not seem to be the only compensatory mechanism in the shoulder girdle. Apart from the local mechanism in the infraspinatus unit, there seems to be also a second mechanism distant to the infraspinatus muscle or the suprascapular nerve. In players with severe and slight infraspinatus muscle atrophy, the activation pattern of the middle trapezius part was significantly increased compared with the contralateral side. This can be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism of the middle trapezius part for external shoulder rotation with a weakened infraspinatus muscle by rotating the scapula (glenoid) outside.</p>
<sec id="section23-0363546512455395">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Only 35 players could be examined on site under tournament conditions, and players were recruited who wanted to participate voluntarily in the study. This might result in a substantial selection bias. However, the results of the prevalence of infraspinatus muscle atrophy and the measurements of strength are very comparable with previous studies, which suggests that this population seems to be representative. Furthermore, we did not perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations for this study based on the results of a study in 2009,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455395">13</xref></sup> wherein no pathological lesions could be identified in 29 MRI scans of the hitting shoulder (ie, SLAP lesion, paralabral cyst, or thickened spinoglenoid ligament), which might potentially contribute to a suprascapular nerve lesion.</p>
<p>A second limitation might be the fact that only surface EMG was used to evaluate the activation pattern of the infraspinatus muscle. Better or more accurate results might have been produced by needle EMG evaluation. However, surface EMG to estimate muscle activity of the rotator cuff muscle is an accepted tool in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512455395">20</xref></sup> and invasive needle EMG can be strongly influenced by electrode placement because of the different fiber orientation (ie, bipennate structure of the infraspinatus muscle), which furthermore introduces movement artifacts. Most importantly, needle EMG was not allowed by the institutional review board in fully active players during a professional tournament.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The cause of infraspinatus atrophy in high-level beach volleyball players is still not completely clear, but data from this study seem to confirm the hypothesis of a repetitive strain or traction damage of the suprascapular nerve (stretching neuropathy). While EMG seems to reveal compensatory mechanisms for progressive damage of the suprascapular nerve, external rotation strength measurements and NCV measurements can detect a side-to-side difference.</p>
