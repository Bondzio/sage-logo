<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypoplastic left-heart syndrome (HLHS) encompasses a spectrum of severe obstructive lesions on the left side of the heart that share the common feature of a left ventricle (LV) whose size is clearly inadequate to support the systemic circulation. The obstructive lesions involve LV inflow and outflow in specific combinations of mitral valve (MV) atresia/aortic valve atresia (MA/AA), MV stenosis/aortic valve atresia (MS/AA), and MV stenosis/aortic valve stenosis (MS/AS). Obstruction of the aortic arch (hypoplasia, coarctation) is common to all 3 subtypes of HLHS. When a diagnosis of HLHS is made and surgical repair pursued, the patient is started on a pathway often referred to as a “staged single ventricle repair.” In the initial Norwood procedure, outflow tract obstruction is repaired with reconstruction of the ascending aorta and arch, incorporating the pulmonary valve as the neoaortic valve. Atrial septectomy ensures pulmonary venous access to the right side of the heart. The right ventricle (RV) is designated as the systemic ventricle and a temporary shunt provides blood flow to the pulmonary circulation. After neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance has appropriately decreased, the second stage of the repair directs superior vena caval blood flow to the right and left pulmonary arteries via a modified, bidirectional Glenn shunt. Redirection of inferior vena caval blood flow away from the heart and directly to the lungs with the final stage Fontan procedure completes separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. In many cases, a fenestration is created between the IVC pathway and the right atrium (RA), allowing the patient to adapt to the altered hemodynamics of the Fontan circulation. Although this may result in some degree of cyanosis, the fenestration will either close spontaneously or via a percutaneous occlusion device inserted with cardiac catheterization. Each stage of this complex repair has its own attendant morbidity and mortality, and questions remain regarding the long-term outlook for the RV as the systemic ventricle.</p>
<p>Functional size of the LV as one of the defining criteria for HLHS, and as such for a single-ventricle repair, is controversial. This spectrum of obstructive aortic and MV lesions may be associated with a continuum of LV size, from mild to severe hypoplasia. Indeed, some consider HLHS to consist of the entire spectrum of LV hypoplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213488247">1</xref></sup> Others exclude mild LV hypoplasia, and still others, including this author, limit HLHS to the severe end of the spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213488247">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213488247"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213488247">4</xref></sup> Difficulty in establishing an absolute size for the lower limit of LV functional viability leaves a problematic group of hearts with borderline severe LV hypoplasia and questionable functional capability. Many of these hearts undergo the staged single-ventricle repair. In some cases, surgical options now include techniques to enhance LV size and function, thereby permitting a biventricular repair in cases not previously thought possible. As such, what constitutes an LV size inadequate to support the systemic circulation may be a moving target. Furthermore, because LV hypoplasia has been demonstrated to progress in the fetal heart, intrauterine intervention may be possible to promote sufficient LV growth, permitting postnatal biventricular repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213488247">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213488247">6</xref></sup> These considerations for surgical interventions place renewed emphasis on understanding the anatomical features associated with the full spectrum of LV hypoplasia. Features that were previously insignificant to a Norwood/Fontan single-ventricle repair may have to be addressed with a biventricular repair.</p>
<p>This review presents the spectrum of pathological features of LV hypoplasia, ranging from mild to severe. Primary defining lesions are described as well as additional lesions that may affect clinical symptoms, surgical repair, and long-term outcome. Pathology findings presented are predominantly based on a nearly 30-year ongoing prospective and retrospective review of congenitally malformed hearts in a congenital heart museum collection at this institution. The collection spans nearly 60 years with more than 2000 hearts. In the following review, a brief historical overview is provided to explain the evolution of the term <italic>HLHS</italic> and the basis for the varied interpretations as to what lesions and LV sizes are to be included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1089253213488247">
<title>Historical Perspective of HLHS</title>
<p>Our understanding of HLHS as an entity began with the examination of postmortem hearts at a time when this spectrum of lesions was uniformly fatal. Individual cases and reviews of specific types of left-sided obstructive lesions had been previously published dating back to the 1850s. The broader spectrum of lesions was first recognized and grouped together as an entity in 1952 by Maurice Lev.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213488247">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213488247">8</xref></sup> In a review of 40 postmortem hearts, Lev described a constellation of pathological features, which he referred to as “hypoplasia of the aortic tract complexes.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213488247">8</xref></sup> All hearts had normal, concordant ventriculo-arterial anatomy, thereby excluding cases with transposition or double-outlet RV. A few years later, in 1958, Noonan and Nadas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213488247">9</xref></sup> reviewed clinicopathological features of 101 pathology cases, emphasizing the similarity of the salient associated clinical features for premortem diagnosis. These authors proposed the currently favored term, <italic>hypoplastic left-heart syndrome</italic>.</p>
<p>However, both these historic, landmark publications included left-sided obstructive lesions associated with septal defects and mild hypoplasia of a functionally adequate LV. Indeed, the most common lesion (70%) among those reviewed by Noonan and Nadas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213488247">9</xref></sup> was hypoplasia of the aortic arch, many with associated ventricular septal defect (VSD) and a few with atrioventricular canal defect. In 1966, Lev proposed a more restrictive definition of HLHS, excluding cases with a VSD. The central, unifying features were the presence of AA or severe AS, with marked hypoplasia of the ascending aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213488247">10</xref></sup> The LV was either minute (with MA) or a “small,” thick-walled chamber with endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE; with a patent MV). These 3 landmark articles are key to our current understanding of the pathological anatomy of HLHS. The lesions included in Lev’s more restrictive definition of HLHS represent the severe end of the spectrum of LV hypoplasia. The more broad interpretation of HLHS, to include the full spectrum of LV hypoplasia, is largely based on the review by Noonan and Nadas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213488247">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Spectrum of LV Hypoplasia</title>
<p>A review of pathological features of LV hypoplasia begins with external features of the heart. LV hypoplasia is indicated by leftward and superior (basal) deviation of the anterior and posterior interventricular sulci, which demarcate the size and position of the LV. These features correlate with the typically described “non–apex forming” hypoplastic LV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213488247">Figure 1A</xref>). Right-sided cardiac structures, including the RA, RV, and pulmonary artery are dilated. In addition to LV hypoplasia, the left atrium, ascending aorta, and aortic arch are variably hypoplastic, depending on the location and severity of the left-sided obstructive lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213488247">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1089253213488247">
<title>Aortic Valve</title>
<p>As emphasized by Maurice Lev, the aortic valve is always either severely stenotic (AS) or atretic (AA), with a markedly hypoplastic valve annulus. The majority of cases have AA with the LV outflow tract ending blindly in a dimple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213488247">Figure 2A</xref>). When viewed from above, slight ridges suggest commissures but there is no valvular tissue. The stenotic valve has dysplastic, thickened, poorly formed cusps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213488247">Figure 2B</xref>). Bicuspid, dysplastic valves are common. Although in this author’s experience AS with a unicuspid valve is rare, others have found AS in infancy to be mostly unicuspid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253213488247">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-1089253213488247">
<title>Mitral Valve Apparatus</title>
<p>The MV is either atretic (MA) or patent, but typically stenotic (MS). In MA, the floor of the left atrium ends blindly in a dimple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213488247">Figure 3A</xref>). In some cases, a tiny imperforate membrane can be demonstrated, but in the remainder, the entire floor of the atrium is muscular. With MA, unless there is an alternate pathway for blood flow to enter the LV, such as a VSD, the aortic valve will also be atretic (MA/AA). If the VSD is small, the heart will closely resemble HLHS; however, these hearts should be considered HLHS variants because classic HLHS has no VSD. When the MV is patent, the annulus is hypoplastic, with a size proportionate to the degree of LV hypoplasia. There is intrinsic MS with variably thickened leaflets. Chordae tendineae are also thickened, abnormally short, and partially fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213488247">Figure 3B</xref>). In some cases, the chordae are virtually absent, with leaflets that directly insert into the papillary muscles. Papillary muscle size is also usually proportionate to the LV chamber size; however, they are often poorly formed and poorly demarcated from the LV free wall.</p>

</fig>
<p>In clinical reviews of HLHS with AA, the ratio of cases with MA/AA versus MS/AA is approximately 60:40.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref></sup> As reviewed by Nathan et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref></sup> this ratio is similar in pathology series that pre-dated the current era of Norwood and Fontan palliation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref></sup> These authors further noted that more recent pathology series describe a higher percentage of HLHS with MS, with an MA/AA:MS/AA ratio that is either 50:50 or reversed at 40:60. This apparent increased mortality in HLHS with MS in the current surgically treated era suggests associated features that negatively affect successful surgical intervention in this subgroup. Several of these potential features are described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1089253213488247">
<title>Left Ventricle</title>
<p>LV size and morphology largely correlate with the anatomy of the aortic valve and MV. If both valves are atretic—MA/AA—the LV is a miniscule, sequestered, slit-like chamber that may not be demonstrable with routine echocardiography. In the anatomical heart, the chamber can usually be identified by transverse sections close to the base of the heart, across the region delimited by the anterior and posterior descending coronary arteries within the interventricular sulci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253213488247">Figure 4A</xref>). With MS/AA, the LV may be flat or may be a nodular shoulder on the left-heart border, sometimes described as a “cherry pit” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253213488247">Figure 4B</xref>). In the latter situation, the cavity is clearly markedly hypoplastic, but LV myocardial mass is increased with a thick, hypertrophied free wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213488247">Figure 2</xref>). MS/AS has a similarly thick LV free wall. As emphasized by Lev, with a patent MV there is often a diffuse, gray-white rind lining the LV, variably involving the papillary muscles, chordae tendineae, and in some cases, the left atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213488247">Figure 2</xref>). Histologically, the rind is composed of abundant elastic tissue within a fibrous matrix, largely limited to the endocardium—hence the term <italic>endocardial fibroelastosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253213488247">Figure 5</xref>). On echocardiographic imaging, EFE appears as an echo bright LV lining. EFE is not seen with an MA. The etiology of EFE remains unknown but postulated pathogenetic factors include elevated LV end-diastolic pressure and myocardial ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213488247">13</xref></sup> Chronic myocardial ischemia may be seen in MS/AA or MS/AS with fibrous scarring and myocyte dropout, more likely attributed to acquired postnatal physiological changes and/or coronary abnormalities, as described below.</p>

<title>Left Atrium</title>
<p>The left atrium in HLHS is often moderately hypoplastic but remains functionally adequate. EFE may involve both LV and, less commonly the left atrium. Although EFE compromises LV function, the significance of atrial involvement is less apparent. Significant left-atrial myocardial hypertrophy may be present, most often in the setting of MA, and particularly when there is premature closure of the foramen ovale (see below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1089253213488247">
<title>Atrial Septum</title>
<p>In the presence of severe obstruction on the left side of the heart, left to right blood flow across the foramen ovale serves as an important, if not only, pathway for pulmonary venous blood to exit the heart. When thin and delicate, the valve of the foramen provides little resistance to this reversed, in-utero blood flow pattern with no untoward prenatal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253213488247">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the valve may become thickened and partially muscularized, with a restrictive foramenal orifice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213488247">Figure 3B</xref>). In some cases, the foramen prematurely closes, leaving no interatrial pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253213488247">Figure 6B</xref>). With in-utero closure, there are severe secondary pulmonary venous hypertensive changes with lymphangiectasis within the lungs, all of which contribute to postnatal morbidity and mortality. Early in the postnatal period, infants with HLHS and premature closure of the foramen ovale rapidly decompensate. Emergent creation of an atrial septostomy is required, in some cases with atrial septal stenting. If there is significant left-atrial EFE, transcatheter septostomy creation may be difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253213488247">Figure 6B</xref>). Atrial septectomy is an important part of the first-stage Norwood procedure to relieve any potential obstruction to pulmonary venous outflow to the right side of the heart. Infants born with an intact atrial septum have been reported to have increased mortality at every stage of HLHS palliative repair, likely the result of decreased tolerance of alterations in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213488247">14</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Another common atrial septal anomaly in HLHS is posterior and leftward malalignment of the posterosuperior margin of the valve of the foramen ovale (septum primum). This creates an exaggerated recess in the RA between the muscular rim of the septum (limbus fossa ovalis or septum secundum) and the valve of the foramen. Although this is of no apparent functional significance, it does contribute to the diminished size of the left atrium and should be recognized with interventional attempts at atrial septostomy and surgical atrial septectomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1089253213488247">
<title>Pulmonary Veins</title>
<p>Pulmonary vein anomalies are rare, but well recognized, in HLHS, usually when there is severe obstruction to pulmonary venous outflow, as with an intact atrial septum. The pulmonary veins normally connect with the left atrium, but an alternate systemic venous route of pulmonary venous drainage may persist. Typically, there is an anomalous vein that connects the left atrium or left-upper pulmonary vein with the innominate vein, referred to as a persistent levoatrial cardinal vein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1089253213488247">
<title>Coronary Arteries</title>
<p>The presence and impact of coronary anomalies on morbidity and mortality in HLHS is a subject of ongoing debate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253213488247">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253213488247">16</xref></sup> The most common coronary anomaly is a sinusoidal connection (ventricular-coronary fistula) between the LV cavity and a coronary artery. These fistulas are much more common with AA/MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253213488247">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253213488247">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253213488247">Figure 5</xref>). In a recent review of 216 HLHS postmortem hearts with AA, ventricular-coronary fistulas were seen in 29% of 134 cases with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref></sup> A spectrum of other coronary anomalies was seen in 12% of the remaining hearts with MA, but no fistulas were identified. These anomalous fistulous connections between the hypoplastic LV cavity and a coronary artery are analogous to the coronary anomalies seen in pulmonary valve atresia with intact ventricular septum and a hypoplastic RV. Although dysplastic mural thickening with luminal compromise may be seen in the affected coronary artery, this occurs much less frequently than seen in a hypoplastic RV. Intramural coronary artery branches may also have dysplastic mural thickening. Rarely, with proximal and/or ostial obstruction, perfusion of a coronary artery may be exclusively dependent on a coronary fistula arising from the hypoplastic LV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213488247">12</xref></sup> Compromised perfusion of the LV will lead to acute or chronic myocardial ischemia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1089253213488247">
<title>Ascending Aorta and Arch</title>
<p>Marked hypoplasia of the ascending aorta is an intrinsic, required component of HLHS. In AA, the ascending aorta measures only 0.2 to 0.3 cm in external diameter, with a similar to minimally larger caliber in severe AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213488247">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213488247">2</xref>). This miniscule ascending aorta serves only as a conduit for retrograde perfusion of the coronary arteries via the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Although always larger than the ascending aorta, the aortic arch is usually also variably hypoplastic. A coarctation ridge, typically positioned opposite the orifice of the PDA (juxtaductal), may be seen in more than 70% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253213488247">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213488247">Figure 1B</xref>). Hypoplasia with an abnormally elongated (greater than 0.5 cm) segment of the arch is referred to as tubular hypoplasia. This configuration, previously termed <italic>infantile coarctation</italic>, variably affects the distal transverse arch, aortic isthmus, or both segments of the arch. Obstruction may also occur at the junction of the ascending aorta with the transverse aortic arch, a feature which led to modification of early versions of the Norwood aortic reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213488247">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Ductus Arteriosus</title>
<p>In HLHS, the virtual or complete absence of outflow from the LV requires a persistent PDA. Perfusion of the systemic circulation and coronary arteries is dependent on right to left shunting across the PDA. The PDA is a muscular artery with abundant loose myxoid intimal tissue (intimal cushions) that approximate one another and functionally obliterate the lumen with constriction of its wall. Anatomical PDA closure involves a more complex interplay of signals and tissue responses, ultimately resulting in a fibrous cord or ligamentum arteriosus. The intimal cushions may extend along the surface of the adjacent aorta and coarctation ridge, contributing to arch obstruction. The PDA may be tortuous and, rarely, aneurysmally dilated. Ductal constriction commonly heralds cardiopulmonary decompensation in HLHS.</p>

<title>Right-Sided Cardiac Chambers</title>
<p>The volume load on the right side of the heart that accompanies the obligate left to right shunt across the atrial septum in HLHS results in dilation and hypertrophy of the RA and RV with dilation of the main pulmonary artery.

<title>Tricuspid Valve (TV) and Pulmonary Valve</title>
<p>The TV and pulmonary valve are most often structurally normal, although both valve annuli are dilated.

<title>Borderline LV Hypoplasia</title>
<p>A ventricle whose size is in between that clearly too small to support the circulation (ie, HLHS) and that of a mildly hypoplastic, but adequately sized, chamber falls into the gray zone of borderline LV hypoplasia. Upward of 65% of cases have been suggested to have borderline LV hypoplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253213488247">24</xref></sup> The quandary faced with these intermediately sized ventricles is whether surgical repair of the associated lesions will entail a Norwood single-ventricle palliation, cardiac transplantation, or interventions to relieve obstruction, resulting in a preferred biventricular circulation. In this section, only left-sided obstructive lesions with an intact ventricular septum and a borderline LV will be discussed. Malformations that fit this category are critical AS, Shone’s complex, and aortic coarctation combined with either MS or AS. Patients with these malformations often present clinically in heart failure with elevated pressures in the LV and pulmonary venous and arterial circulations and a poorly compliant LV. These hemodynamic alterations, combined with left to right shunting across a patent foramen ovale, may lead to decreased filling of the LV, contributing to diminished LV size. RV volume overload with dilation and hypertrophy of the chamber will alter the ventricular septal geometry, resulting in an exaggerated convex leftward contour. In this setting, LV compression may also significantly compromise LV size. Borderline LV hypoplasia with an underfilled and/or “squashed” LV may respond to therapeutic interventions to alter hemodynamics and transition to a functionally adequately sized ventricle. Balloon dilation of the aortic valve is one such intervention with critical AS. This intervention may be life saving in the neonate and, when performed in the fetus, may permit sufficient LV growth for biventricular postnatal repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213488247">5</xref></sup> Ballooning and/or surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta will also alter LV hemodynamics, leading to enhanced LV size. Aortic coarctation will be discussed under mild LV hypoplasia, the more common phenotype seen with this malformation.</p>
<sec id="section17-1089253213488247">
<title>Critical Aortic Valve Stenosis</title>
<p>Critical AS with a patent MV is the most commonly encountered lesion associated with a borderline LV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253213488247">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213488247">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213488247">Figures 8A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213488247">8D</xref>). AS, described as critical, implies that blood flow across the valve is severely limited to the extent that perfusion of the systemic circulation is dependent on a PDA. The valve morphology will resemble the dysplastic changes seen with HLHS; however, the valve annulus and cusps are usually larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213488247">Figure 8C</xref>). LV size in hearts with critical AS ranges from normal, or even dilated, to the full spectrum of LV hypoplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253213488247">26</xref></sup> A number of clinical studies have attempted to identify objective measurements of LV size that correlate with ventricles suitable for a biventricular repair. The importance of LV inflow dimensions has been emphasized, variably assessed by noting whether or not the LV forms the apex, if the LV inflow length exceeds 25 mm, or if the ratio of the LV long axis to the heart long axis exceeds 0.8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213488247">25</xref></sup> Other suggested size-related parameters include the diameters of the MV (greater than 9-11 mm) and aortic valve (greater than 5–6 mm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213488247">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although LV size is important, it is only one of several anatomical variables that affect the success of a biventricular repair. LV EFE as well as additional sites of obstruction involving the MV and aortic arch provide significant challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213488247">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253213488247">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253213488247">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213488247">Figure 8B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213488247">8D</xref>).

<title>Shone’s Complex</title>
<p>Shone’s complex, first described in 1963, refers to a constellation of multiple levels of left-sided obstructive lesions to include a supravalvular MV ring, parachute MV, subaortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253213488247">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1089253213488247">Figures 9A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1089253213488247">9D</xref>). Classic Shone’s complex has all 4 lesions.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Obstructive lesions in the systemic circulation provide many challenges for clinical management and surgical repair. As detailed in this review, the obstructions are complex and often multiple, involving LV inflow, outflow, and the aortic arch. LV hypoplasia adds an additional layer of complexity. The pathological spectrum of LV hypoplasia is quite broad and includes both fixed anatomical and functional hemodynamic components. New therapeutic interventions, including fetal procedures, are expanding the spectrum of lesions and LV sizes that may be amenable to a biventricular repair. Demonstration of the pathological anatomy of LV hypoplasia facilitates understanding of this spectrum of lesions.</p>
