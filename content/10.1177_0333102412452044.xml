<abstract>
<p><italic>Overview:</italic> Oxygen has been a generally accepted treatment method for cluster headache attacks ever since Kudrow (1981) conducted a controlled trial showing that oxygen was equally or even more effective than ergotamine injections.</p>
<p><italic>Purpose:</italic> The aim of the present study was to provide a historical perspective of oxygen treatment in cluster headache and to find the origin of this treatment. Oxygen for cluster headache was first described by Horton in 1952 and for migraine patients in 1940 by Alvarez. At the time, neither of the authors provided any reason why they chose for this treatment method. The vasoconstrictive effect of oxygen was not described by Horton until 1961.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> We suggest that these authors originally adhered to the vasoconstrictive theory of vascular headache that was prevalent in the early 20th century until Wolff demonstrated the contrary in the late 1930s. The early literature describes an analogy between angina pectoris and migraine, as both being due to vasoconstriction. As oxygen was described as a treatment for angina pectoris, this may be the reason why oxygen was tried for migraine and cluster headache at a time when they were not recognized as separate entities. Later it turned out to be more effective for cluster headache.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412452044" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxygen has been used to treat cluster headache attacks since Horton first described it in 1952 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412452044">1</xref>). The mechanism by which oxygen relieves cluster headache attacks is still unclear, as is the pathophysiology of cluster headache itself. In this article we will provide a historical perspective of oxygen treatment in cluster headache and figure out why we started treating our cluster headache patients with oxygen in the first place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102412452044"><title>History of cluster headache</title>
<p>One of the earliest descriptions of a ‘cluster headache-like syndrome’ dates back to the 17th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412452044">2</xref>). The Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674) described the headache history of a Dutch man, which seemed to fit a diagnosis of cluster headache, although autonomic symptoms were hardly described. Several cases describing symptoms that nowadays would be recognized as cluster headache have been published since then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412452044">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412452044"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412452044">5</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1926 the London neurologist Wilfred Harris (1869–1960) gave the first complete description of cluster headache, which he named migrainous neuralgia or ciliary (migrainous) neuralgia (if the symptoms were mostly located near the eye) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412452044">6</xref>). He noticed a clear difference in clinical characteristics between migrainous neuralgia, migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. He described the unilaterality, frequency and autonomic features that we now know are typical for cluster headache. He also recognized that Horner’s syndrome could occur and he described the so-called ‘cluster phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412452044">7</xref>). Harris treated his patients with alcohol injections, at first in or around the supraorbital and infraorbital nerve and later in the Gasserian ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412452044">8</xref>). Later, he noticed the positive effect of subcutaneous injections of ergotamine that had become available previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412452044">9</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1939, Bayard Horton (1895–1980) described cluster attack features and a specific treatment method using histamine desensitization in a paper called ‘A new syndrome of vascular headache: results of treatment with histamine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412452044">10</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The association with histamine was possibly related to one of the current pathogenic allergy theories, in which migraine was compared to asthma and urticaria. Horton speculated that cluster headache was caused by an ‘anaphylactoid reaction’ to endogenous histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412452044">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412452044">12</xref>). He was probably not aware that Harris in 1926 already described the syndrome that we now know as cluster headache.</p>
<p>Only in 1952 did Horton detail the pain and its associated symptoms, and the syndrome then became well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412452044">1</xref>). Twelve years before the publication of his 1939 article, he had noticed patients with erythromelalgia of the feet. He noticed the extreme grades of vasodilatation that were associated with their complaints of burning distress. In cluster headache patients he noticed an increase in surface temperature of the painful areas, roughly corresponding to the branches of the external carotid artery. Hence the term ‘erythromelalgia of the head’ was proposed. Later, he noticed the effect of histamine in provoking an attack and as he thought that there was an important pathogenic role for the vasodilator histamine, he called the disease ‘histaminic cephalgia’.</p>
<p>The term ‘cluster headache’ was introduced by Kunkle et al<italic>.</italic> in 1952, but ‘Horton’s headache’ and ‘histaminic cephalgia’ were more frequently used names at first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412452044">13</xref>). Horton treated his patients with oxygen and ergot preparations but mostly by histamine desensitization.</p>
<p>In 1961, Horton referred to one of his earlier unpublished papers (1938) entitled: ‘Migraine: treatment with histamine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412452044">14</xref>). This paper was published under the name ‘A new syndrome of vascular headache: results of treatment with histamine’ in 1939 and turned out to be his first discussion of cluster headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412452044">10</xref>). This shows that migraine and cluster headache were considered similar clinical entities of vascular origin before the clinical descriptions of Horton himself and Harris became known.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0333102412452044"><title>Horton and oxygen treatment</title>
<p>Nowadays oxygen is frequently used as an acute treatment for cluster headache attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412452044">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412452044">16</xref>). As mentioned above, it is still not clear why oxygen aborts cluster headache attacks so well. Recent studies show that activation of the trigeminovascular system, along with the autonomic reflex arc, are important in the pathophysiology of cluster headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412452044">17</xref>). Akerman showed that treatment with 100% oxygen in rats was able to inhibit neuronal firing in the trigeminal cervical complex and attenuate the blood flow changes in response to stimulation of the facial/greater superficial petrosal nerve efferents. Oxygen treatment had no effect on activation of trigeminal afferents in response to stimulation of dural structures. It seems that oxygen acts on the parasympathetic pathways to exert its abortive effects, rather than directly on trigeminal afferents to the dural vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412452044">18</xref>). More study on the subject is still required to gain more insight into the pathophysiology and potential treatment methods of cluster headache.</p>
<p>What is the origin of the use of oxygen as a treatment for cluster headache? Working at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, USA) in 1940, Alvarez described his use of oxygen in the treatment of headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412452044">19</xref>). He used a nasal mask to deliver oxygen at a flow rate between 6 and 8 l/min. He believed that it was effective for the treatment of typical migraine, and that it gave some relief in a group of patients he called ‘Probably not migraine or else migraine with complications’ and in a group called ‘Headache, not migrainous’. In the ‘Typical migraine’ group, 88% of the patients noticed relief to some extent, 42% had complete relief and 36% much relief. In the ‘Probably not migraine or else migraine with complications’ group only 33% and in the ‘Headache, not migrainous’ group only 40% noticed any relief. Histaminic cephalgia, or any other description of cluster headache, was not yet mentioned separately, but it seems likely that cluster headache patients may have been included in the ‘Typical migraine’ and ‘Probably not migraine’ groups.</p>
<p>The first time that oxygen therapy was recommended as a possible treatment method for cluster headache attacks was in Horton’s 1952 paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412452044">1</xref>). In 1955, in the <italic>Bulletin of the Tufts,</italic> Horton described the successful treatment with oxygen in a population of 1176 patients with histaminic cephalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412452044">20</xref>). However, this was not a systematic study, as it was solely based on his experience in the clinic. He usually recommended oxygen usage in combination with an intravenous injection of dihydroergotamine. Oxygen without dihydroergotamine was found effective in less severe cluster headache attacks, which he graded 1 and 2, but of little value in severe attacks, graded 3 and 4. Furthermore, he noticed that oxygen was most effective when the oxygen treatment was started promptly at the onset of an attack. The reason why Horton started using oxygen as a treatment is not clear from his early papers. He may have followed up on Alvarez, who treated migraine with oxygen, not describing why he did so either. However, Horton stated that the pain in episodes of histaminic cephalgia was caused by vasodilatation of extracranial vessels and he noted that the intravenous administration of 1:500,000 solution of epinephrine could also be used to abort attacks. He also noted that epinephrine constricts the extracranial vessels, which may have been a clue for his ideas on the pathophysiological origin of cluster headache. Whether he was really aware of the vasoconstrictive effects of oxygen, and whether this is why he tried to use oxygen in his clinic in the first place, is not clear. Of course, it is also possible that the effective use of oxygen was discovered by coincidence.</p>
<p>If we assume that the vasoconstrictive effect of oxygen was known, it would seem reasonable to treat both migraine and cluster headache with oxygen, as Horton at first described them as variations of the same disease. In his 1959 paper ‘The management of vascular headache’, Horton made a distinction between migraine and histaminic cephalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412452044">21</xref>). In migraine he distinguished three phases but in histaminic cephalgia only two. In migraine, the first phase was supposed to be due to vasoconstriction, not giving rise to pain but rather to scotomata and other cortical manifestations. This phase does not occur in histaminic cephalgia. The vasodilatating second phase was thought to explain the associated pain. It would occur more promptly in histaminic cephalgia than in migraine. The third phase was thought to be due to oedema, which was also believed to cause pain. This is short lasting in histaminic cephalgia but may persist for hours in cases of migraine, explaining the difference in symptom duration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412452044">Table 1</xref>).

<p>In this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412452044">21</xref>), Horton also described the treatment of both migraine and histaminic cephalgia. He mentioned the effectiveness of vasoconstricting agents in migraine. Oxygen, however, was not listed among them. In the same article, oxygen was mentioned as an acute treatment for histaminic cephalgia, but again without any reasoning why this was done. Not until 1961 in the <italic>Maryland State Medical Journal</italic> was oxygen described by Horton as a vasoconstricting agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412452044">14</xref>). In that article, he also referred to treating other vascular headaches with oxygen, without mentioning the results of this treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that there is no clear documentation of why Horton started using oxygen therapy as an acute treatment for cluster headache patients and why Alvarez used it in all headache patients. In the following section we will try to formulate why they may have done so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0333102412452044"><title>The use of oxygen before Horton</title>
<p>There was a period in which sympathicotonic (with pale face) as well as sympathicolytic (with red face) types of migraine were distinguished in textbooks. This resulted from the discussion in the 1850s and 1860s following the discovery of the vasomotor nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412452044">22</xref>), although the angiospastic concept of migraine was discussed earlier (e.g. by Parry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102412452044">23</xref>)). These ideas on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying migraine (sympathicotonic and sympathicolytic) existed next to each other for several decades, although Latham tried to combine the ideas, suggesting vasoconstriction in the aura phase followed by vasodilatation in the headache phase (1873) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412452044">24</xref>). On one side there was Edward Woakes, who introduced ergot for its vasoconstrictive effect in the treatment of migraine (1868) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412452044">25</xref>), and on the other side there was a period in the early 20th century in which ergotamine was thought to block the sympathetic nerve effects and was therefore used as the treatment for sympathicotonic conditions, including migraine. It would appear later that this was a matter of dosage, lower dosages being vasoconstrictive (as in the case of Woakes) instead of vasodilatating (in the early 20th century applications) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412452044">26</xref>). In his 1935 review of migraine in Bumke’s and Foerster’s <italic>Handbuch der Neurologie</italic>, Hugo Richter (1886–1945) stated that from all evidence available at that time, the vasoconstrictive model of migraine was the most plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412452044">27</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1930s, John Graham and Harold Wolff studied the external carotid arteries by measuring the amplitude of pulsations following ergotamine injections, which showed a simultaneous decrease in amplitude and decline in migrainous headache. A relationship with cerebrospinal fluid pulsations (reflecting intracranial artery extension) was not observed. They concluded that the headache-ending effect was most likely caused by narrowing of the dilated arteries, which had caused pain by being overstretched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412452044">28</xref>). They thereby refuted the sympathicotonic theories of the 1920s and concluded that ergotamine had a vasoconstrictive effect. As this study was published in 1938, Horton and Alvarez may have been unaware of this mechanism when they started their research and may have adhered to the vasoconstrictive theory of migraine (and cluster headache). The 1939 paper by Horton, however, had already described that the pathogenesis of the pain most likely lies in the phenomenon of vasodilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412452044">10</xref>).</p>
<p>In June 1930, the results of an experimental study in cats by Harold Wolff and William Lennox (1884–1960) were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412452044">29</xref>). They conducted several experiments to determine the effect of variations in the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood on the pial vessels. They concluded that changing the oxygen concentration had a small but noticeable effect on the diameter of the pial vessels. An increase in oxygen concentration led to vasoconstriction, while a decrease in oxygen concentration let to vasodilatation.</p>
<p>It could be suggested that the use of oxygen was eventually based on this study, but the effects described by Wolff and Lennox were small and observed in pial vessels. Moreover, Horton did not mention the vasoconstrictive effect of oxygen until 1961.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, it is possible that Alvarez (and Horton) adhered to the vasoconstrictive theories of headache at the start of their research.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, oxygen was frequently used as a treatment for angina pectoris, a condition known to be associated with vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102412452044">30</xref>). The effect of oxygen had been noted in 1900 by Steele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0333102412452044">31</xref>). Taking into account the well-known use of oxygen in angina pectoris, it is possible that Alvarez tried to use oxygen in migraine to treat the supposed hypoxia caused by vasoconstriction. This theory is supported by writings of Hans Curschmann (1875–1950) in 1926, cited by Richter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412452044">27</xref>). Curschmann noted that people with migraine often tended to also have angina pectoris complaints. Moreover, they tended to have complaints of cold hands and feet, possibly caused by vascular spasm, which might also underlie the migraine. This strengthens the idea that there was a theory about a relationship between angina pectoris and migraine. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the treatment for angina pectoris was also tried in migraine (and thereby cluster headache) patients.</p>
<p>On a side note, it is interesting to note that Curschmann already described that smokers in particular were more prone to developing angina pectoris. This did not become common knowledge until the second part of the 20th century. In 1964, the Reports of the Surgeon General on smoking and health reported growing evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular disease in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0333102412452044">32</xref>). One of the earliest studies on this subject was done by English et al. He found that the incidence of coronary disease in male patients at the Mayo Clinic was about three times greater in cigarette smokers than in non-smokers in the 40–59-year age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0333102412452044">33</xref>). Furthermore, Russek published a study in 1950, stating that 100% oxygen given via a facemask led to a more pronounced and longer duration of the ECG manifestations of myocardial ischemia and failed to prevent the onset or influence the duration of anginal pain. He therefore believed that oxygen should be contra-indicated for angina pectoris without hypoxaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0333102412452044">34</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102412452044"><title>The use of oxygen after Horton</title>
<p>In the years that followed Horton’s publications, several studies reported the use of oxygen in the treatment of cluster headache. Sjaastad mentioned a study, published in 1953, in which attacks provoked by nitroglycerin or histamine were successfully aborted by treatment with 100% oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412452044">35</xref>). In 1958, Friedman and Mikropoulos described that ergotamine appeared to be more effective than oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412452044">36</xref>). Nelson (1970) described oxygen to be fairly effective when given early and of little use when started at the peak of an attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412452044">37</xref>). In 1976, Graham stated that patients had occasionally obtained relief of acute attacks by breathing 100% oxygen for 15 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0333102412452044">38</xref>). The first systematic study on the effect of oxygen therapy in the acute treatment of cluster headache attacks was done by Kudrow in 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412452044">15</xref>). He took an interest in oxygen therapy after a letter published in the <italic>JAMA</italic> (1978) by optometrist JF Janks, who described in detail his personal experience with oxygen inhalation for acute cluster attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0333102412452044">39</xref>). In Kudrow’s study, the effect of self-administrated oxygen, using a mask and at a flow rate of 7 l/min for 15 minutes, was compared with sublingual ergotamine administration. The results showed that oxygen administration at 7 l/min for 15 minutes and sublingual ergotamine administration were both effective in aborting cluster headache attacks. Oxygen aborted more than 7 out of 10 attacks in 82% of the patients, ergotamine in 70%. Moreover, the response to oxygen was faster, with an average response time of 6 minutes. After 6 minutes only 28.2% of the ergotamine group attacks were aborted. The peak response time for sublingual ergotamine was between 10 and 12 minutes. When the side-effects and contra-indications were also taken into account, oxygen seemed to be the best choice for the treatment of a cluster headache attack. However, Kudrow also described a rebound effect in oxygen users: a shorter time until the next attack after oxygen usage. This was found in 25% of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412452044">15</xref>). Not until after Kudrow’s study was published, did oxygen therapy as an acute cluster headache treatment seem to be on the rise. Results like these, however, were not found in following studies.</p>
<p>In his book on cluster headache, Kudrow (1980) mentioned an earlier study on oxygen treatment that was also described in his 1981 article, in which 52 patients were treated with 100% oxygen for 15 minutes. He noted that 75% percent responded significantly. The worst responders were chronic cluster headache patients over 49 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412452044">40</xref>). In a recent study, however, responders to oxygen seemed to be slightly older (p = 0.11) and percentages of episodic cluster headache patients were equally distributed between the responder and non-responder group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412452044">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Kudrow further described a study by Sakai and Meyer, who demonstrated that 100% oxygen, administered during an attack, promptly reduced cerebral blood flow and pain. It was suggested that there is a hyperreactivity of the cerebral blood vessels to oxygen in cluster headache patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0333102412452044">42</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0333102412452044">43</xref>) treatment with oxygen at 8 l/min was compared with the patients usual oral medication, such as ergot derivatives or analgesic tablets. All but one patient noticed faster relief when treated with oxygen compared with oral medication, and all 12 patients responded to oxygen treatment. A crossover study by Fogan (1985) between oxygen at 6 l/min and room air showed a highly statistically significant difference in pain relief scores. Fifty-six percent of patients experienced relief in over 80% of attacks while using oxygen, compared with 7% using room air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0333102412452044">44</xref>). Nowadays, oxygen still is usually delivered at a flow rate of 7 l/min, as was done in the early study by Kudrow. A recent study was conducted with a higher oxygen flow rate, 12 l/min, which also appeared to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412452044">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0333102412452044">Table 2</xref>).

<sec id="sec6-0333102412452044"><title>Hyperbaric oxygen treatment</title>
<p>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of cluster headache has also been tried. Sjaastad mentioned a case report by Weiss et al (1989) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0333102412452044">45</xref>), who described the successful treatment of two attacks in a patient refractory to all other treatments. Unfortunately, the timing of the events was poorly described, and the possibility of spontaneous recovery, without an influence of HBO, could not be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412452044">35</xref>).</p>
<p>Following this case report several studies were conducted to explore the abortive and prophylactic effect of HBO in cluster headache. Porta et al. (1991) conducted a crossover study between HBO treatment and normobaric oxygen treatment at a flow rate of 7 l/min for 15 minutes. Eight out of 14 patients were ‘partially refractory’ or ‘totally refractory’ to normobaric oxygen. All 14 patients achieved ‘complete relief’ within a few minutes after starting HBO treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412452044">46</xref>).</p>
<p>Di Sabato et al. (1993) conducted a double-blind study comparing HBO with placebo. HBO resulted in an interruption of the current attack in 6 out of 7 patients. Of the six patients in whom HBO resulted in an interruption of the attack, three had no more attacks for a period lasting from 4 to 6 days, and the other three had no attacks during the entire follow-up period of 2 months. In the patients receiving placebo treatment the occurrence of successive attacks remained unmodified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0333102412452044">47</xref>).</p>
<p>Pascual et al. (1995) studied the effect of 5–20 sessions of HBO therapy on both the duration and frequency of cluster headache attacks in four people with chronic cluster headache. Two patients improved dramatically while on HBO treatment. This positive treatment effect remained for 2 and 31 days, respectively, after treatment. One patient noticed only a lower frequency of attacks and one patient noticed no effect at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0333102412452044">48</xref>). A double-blind placebo crossover study by Nilsson Remahl et al<italic>.</italic> (2002) described a positive effect of both hyperbaric placebo and HBO treatment in 6 out of 16 and 5 out of 14 patients, respectively. The effect was mainly prophylactic and was thought to be caused by the hyperbaric condition itself, or by a marked placebo effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412452044">49</xref>).</p>
<p>A Cochrane review (2008) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to establish the effects of HBO as a treatment for an acute cluster headache attack or as prophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0333102412452044">50</xref>). Because of high costs and poor availability, the use of HBO for the abortive treatment of cluster headache is not advised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0333102412452044"><title>Oxygen and migraine</title>
<p>As mentioned above, Alvarez described the successful treatment of migraine with oxygen in 1940 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412452044">19</xref>). Currently, oxygen treatment for migraine attacks is applied only sporadically. A Cochrane review in 2008 concluded that there was some evidence that HBO treatment was effective for the termination of acute migraine in an unselected population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0333102412452044">50</xref>). No evidence was found for a prophylactic effect of HBO. Given the costs and poor availability of HBO therapy, it was concluded that more research should be done on patients unresponsive to standard therapy. Few adequate studies on migraine and normobaric oxygen therapy, as conducted by Alvarez, were found. Two small studies comparing normobaric oxygen with HBO found normobaric oxygen to be ineffective in the treatment of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0333102412452044">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0333102412452044">52</xref>). Another study (1999), conducted for treatment of acute migraine headache, compared nitrous oxide with 100% oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0333102412452044">53</xref>). No analgesic effects of oxygen were found in this study in a small group (n = 12). However, the flow rate at which oxygen was applied was not provided, which makes these results much less valuable. It is not clear where oxygen got lost as a treatment for migraine between 1940 (Alvarez) and today. It was not mentioned as a possible treatment method for migraine in a large review on the subject in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412452044">12</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1961, Horton also described treating vascular headaches other than cluster headache with oxygen. The results of this treatment, however, were not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412452044">14</xref>). It may be postulated that oxygen treatment might not cover the long duration of a migraine attack. Moreover, the use of acute medication in an occasional migraine attack might not cause any problems, but when using it to treat cluster headache attacks, potentially occurring multiple times per day, this might give rise to adverse effects. As already described by Alvarez, oxygen therefore might be more useful in patients with daily attacks than in those with longer and less frequent attacks. An interesting note by Alvarez supporting this idea is that in some migraine patients the headache started to recur about an hour after they stopped oxygen treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412452044">19</xref>). Furthermore, some of the patients had to continue treatment for an hour or two before the headache disappeared, which could of course cause much practical discomfort.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0333102412452044" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It seems that oxygen was first used in a period when the vasoconstriction theory of migraine or vascular headache reigned. An association with angina pectoris was probably made. Later it turned out that the situation was the opposite: in cluster headache there is not vasoconstriction but vasodilatation, and the oxygen probably does not control hypoxia. Moreover, oxygen is not effective in vasoconstriction (without clear hypoxaemia) and in the case of angina pectoris might even cause more vasoconstriction. Even though it was based on what later appeared to be wrong assumptions, an effective treatment was found, the true mechanism of which we do not know even now.</p>
