When investing through a greenfield investment, the foreign company creates a new entity in the local market and develops this market from scratch. On the contrary, when acquiring a firm already located in the host market, the foreign investor develops its project in the target market based on different kinds of resources provided by the local acquired firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812452634">Slangen and Hennart, 2007</xref>).</p><p>As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al. (2005</xref>), the correct management of the human side of an investment process is one of the main factors conditioning its potential success. Communication is in turn a key issue to manage this human side. Workforce diversity in terms of linguistic differences is likely to complicate communication in internationalization processes. Therefore, language distance arises as a major issue to deal with when choosing the formula to carry out an FDI.</p><p>Based on the framework provided by transaction cost theory (TCT), this paper aims at analyzing the role of language distance on the choice between greenfield investments and acquisitions in foreign direct investment processes. For empirical testing of our predictions, we used a database collecting 383 FDIs carried out between 1989 and 2003 by listed Spanish companies whose shares are traded on the Madrid Stock Exchange. As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812452634">Welch et al. (2001</xref>), patterns of internationalization and geographical spread vary depending upon the language spoken in the home country. Due to Spain’s colonial past, Spanish is the mother tongue of 450 million people over the world – only Chinese, English, and Hindi have a higher number of native speakers than Spanish – and it is an official language in 24 different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812452634">Moreno and Otero, 2010</xref>). Therefore, Spain arises as an example of a medium-large European country whose firms can expand extensively within their language domain, although their options may be somehow limited due to the low level of economic development in some Spanish-speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812452634">Welch et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The paper has been organized in the following way. We present a literature review relative to the greenfield/acquisition choice based on TCT. Next, we introduce in our study an analysis of the potential influence of language distance on transaction costs inherent to an acquisition process. The following section presents the main features of the sample of FDIs used in this study, and explains the methodology used in order to test our predictions; and then empirical evidence is given, along with a discussion of our results. Finally, we summarize the main conclusions and managerial implications derived from our study.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1470595812452634"><title>Literature review</title><p>Transaction cost theory is the theoretical framework most frequently used in order to analyze the choice between greenfields and acquisitions in foreign direct investment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812452634">Slangen and Hennart, 2007</xref>). This theory is a particularly suitable framework to analyze the role that external uncertainty plays in the internationalization process of firms, as well as on the choice of investment formulas. Reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470595812452634">Brouthers and Hennart (2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812452634">Zhao et al. (2004</xref>) show that it does a good job of explaining investment processes in international contexts characterized by external uncertainty. They also point to existing differences between the home and the target as the main factor contributing to external uncertainty. Most of these differences are gathered in the psychic distance concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812452634">Johanson and Vahlne, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812452634">Johanson and Wiedersheim-Pausl, 1975</xref>) which refers to cultural, economic, industrial, educational, and linguistic differences between countries.</p><p>Based on the TCT framework, foreign investors choose the investment formula which minimizes transaction costs derived. On the one hand, investing through a greenfield joint venture implies costs derived from the co-ownership and risks stemming from the potential opportunistic behavior of the partner which would give rise to the spread of the investing firm’s own accrued distinctive competencies. On the other hand, investing through an acquisition implies incurring <italic>ex ante</italic> costs related to obtaining accurate information that allows the investing firm to identify the true value of the target, as well as post-acquisition costs related to potential opportunistic behaviors by the seller, the need to integrate in only one hierarchy the organization, structure, and personnel coming from two different companies – which, in turn, implies the risk of turnover for top executives of the target – as well as the risk of acquiring (and paying market value for) resources the investing firm does not need. An exhaustive analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812452634">Balakrishnan and Koza (1993</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812452634">Reuer and Koza (2000</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470595812452634">López-Duarte and García-Canal (2002</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812452634">Chen and Hennart (2004</xref>).</p><p>The cultural distance between the home and the target countries has been traditionally pointed out as a factor increasing these transactions costs, mainly in acquisition processes. The cultural distance between two nations reflects existing differences in certain values, norms, and behavioral rules between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812452634">Shenkar, 2001</xref>); in other words, differences in ‘collective mental programs’ shared by groups of people who live in the same national environment, with such programs being different from one group to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470595812452634">Hofstede, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812452634">2001</xref>). A high cultural distance may boost the information asymmetry in the acquisition process, thus increasing costs relative to the search, valuation, and pricing of potential target firms. Costs relative to the negotiation process between the acquirer and the target also increase when values, norms, and behavior rules are not shared by both firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812452634">Balakrishnan and Koza, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812452634">Chen and Hennart, 2004</xref>). In the same way, post-acquisition integration problems arise when the target’s decisions and behavioral rules are not well-known and/or understood by the foreign investor and vice versa. To get full cooperation from the seller also becomes harder as cultural distance increases – see, among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470595812452634">Kogut and Singh (1988</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470595812452634">Woodcook et al. (1994)</xref>. In addition, post-acquisition integration problems may lead to the loss of valuable managers coming from the target or acquired company.</p><p>Most empirical research dealing with the greenfield/acquisition choice contributes empirical evidence regarding the tendency to invest through greenfield investments in high culturally distant countries in order to avoid the referred-to costs – among recent papers, see those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812452634">Harzing (2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812452634">Larimo (2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470595812452634">Drogendick and Slangen (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470595812452634">Slangen and Hennart (2008</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812452634">Dow and Larimo (2009</xref>). The exhaustive literature reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812452634">Shenkar (2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812452634">Harzing (2003</xref>), dealing with the role played by cultural distance on different internationalization decisions, point to the same idea. Due to such a broad acceptance of cultural distance as a main factor conditioning internationalization paths, other factors related to the distance among countries have been systematically overlooked in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812452634">Dow and Larimo, 2009</xref>); among them, the language distance between nations.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar (2006</xref>) point out, the existence of language barriers between the home and host countries of an FDI increases the so-called liability of foreignness; that is, the difficulties that the investing firm must overcome when it seeks to develop its activities in a foreign country. In the same way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470595812452634">Demirbag et al. (2007</xref>) acknowledge language distance between the home and host countries as a main factor conditioning transaction costs related to an internationalization process. However, language has been a neglected factor in international business literature, being known as ‘the forgotten factor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812452634">Marschan-Piekkari et al., 1997</xref>). Different reasons may underlie such a lack of attention: first, as already said, language has been bundled into the broader term culture, so that researchers have implicitly analyzed its influence on firms’ decisions when analyzing the role of cultural distance between countries. Thereby, it has been thought unnecessary to focus on its independent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812452634">Welch et al., 2005</xref>), even though language distance is not always captured by cultural distance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470595812452634">West and Graham, 2004</xref>). In addition, it becomes particularly difficult to disentangle language effects from broader cultural influences, as far as language influences cultural and managerial values in international contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470595812452634">West and Graham, 2004</xref>): it is not only that the language a person learns as a child may influence his/her values and way of thinking, but also that language distance may influence the perceived cultural distance between two countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812452634">Harzing, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812452634">Harzing and Maznevski, 2002</xref>). Such an influence would be developed through ‘cultural accommodation’ or ‘ethnic reinforcement’ processes carried out by individuals who develop professional activities in countries where the spoken language is not their mother language. Through a cultural accommodation process, individuals working in a second language acquire some of the cultural attitudes and values associated with that language, because they are influenced (consciously or subconsciously) by the culture of that language. On the contrary, through the ethnic reinforcement process, these individuals show a stronger endorsement of their natural cultural values; that is, the use of a second language makes their ethnicity more salient. Pre-eminence of American researchers, dominance of the English language in international business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470595812452634">Fredriksson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely, 2008</xref>), as well as the lack of existing scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812452634">Dow and Karunaratna, 2006</xref>) may be other factors underlying the systematic omission of language distance in empirical literature dealing with internationalization processes.</p><p>The following paragraphs aim to analyze the influence of language distance on the transaction costs in an international acquisition process.</p><sec id="section3-1470595812452634"><title>Language distance and transaction costs in FDIs</title><p>Language distance between the home and host nations of the FDI increases the information asymmetry the foreign investor must face. Consequently, <italic>ex ante</italic> transaction costs relative to the valuation and pricing of the target in acquisition processes also rise.</p><p>As a starting point, the acquirer and the target must choose the functional language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar, 2006</xref>) or common corporate language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812452634">Welch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al., 2005</xref>); that is, the language formally designed for verbal and written use by both of them in order to be able to negotiate and work together. If the native language of one of the firms involved in the acquisition process is chosen as common language, the information asymmetry increases, as this firm will more easily accede to and control relevant information than the other. Therefore, this firm will enjoy a more favorable situation in negotiating and making decisions relative to the acquisition process. In summary, this firm will be in a stronger position than the other one in controlling information and influencing decisions. In terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar (2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812452634">Root (1994</xref>), the functional language becomes a control mechanism. Even if the common language is a third one, <italic>ex ante</italic> transaction costs relative to getting accurate information and negotiating increase. In any case, the information asymmetry and <italic>ex ante</italic> transaction costs the foreign investor must face are the highest when the common language is the target’s mother tongue.</p><p>Language distance also boosts post-acquisition transaction costs. Costs relative to the integration process and to achieving cooperative and non-opportunistic behavior on the part of the target get upgraded in a language-distance context. First addressing <italic>ex post</italic> costs relative to integration processes, the existence of language barriers between the acquirer and the target may disturb the flows of information between them and complicate the communication process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812452634">Kogut and Zander (1992</xref>) point out, for cross-border information and knowledge transfer (especially tacit knowledge) to be effective, communication integrity is vital. Even when the acquirer is relatively competent in the language of the target (or vice versa), loss of rhetorical skill is always present (Harzing and Feely, 2004). Therefore, misunderstandings are easily caused due to, among others, filtration (messages are only partially transmitted) and distortion processes (intended meaning is altered during the transmission of the message) – empirical evidence related to these processes can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812452634">Marschan-Piekkari et al. (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812452634">1999b</xref>). In summary, language barriers between both firms involved in the acquisition process may not only prevent or disturb the flow of information between them, but also result in a loss of credibility and trust between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470595812452634">Luo, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, language distance may also hinder successful management and the integration of human resources. On the one hand, language can emerge as a source of power for some individuals: in an international business context, language skills may deliver power and opportunities to some individuals who otherwise would not <italic>enjoy such a position – </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely (2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812452634">Marchan-Piekkari et al. (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812452634">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812452634">1999b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al. (2005</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812452634">Welch et al. (2005</xref>) provide empirical evidence relative to this point. Language facility can give these individuals not only access to relevant information, but also the power to act as informal gatekeepers, allowing them to control the nature and flow of communication. In such a context, they may effectively influence negotiation and management processes, disturbing the intended hierarchy and modifying the authority channels – in summary, introducing a new source of conflict in the integration process. On the other hand, language distance can lead to factions and the creation of groups within the workforce and managers. In international contexts, language is a strong candidate for the definition of group boundaries within the integration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al., 2005</xref>). When both firms do not share the same mother tongue, language-based clusters are likely to emerge, and tensions between different clusters are likely to arise: interpersonal relationships and information transfers are easily achieved within each cluster, but not among different ones. Such a context creates a strong sense of exclusion (‘we’ and ‘they’), blocking effective collaboration and integration processes – see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812452634">Barner-Rasmussen and Björkman (2007</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely (2008</xref>); Frediksson et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812452634">Marchan-Piekkari et al. (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812452634">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812452634">1999b</xref>).</p><p>Now, addressing costs relative to achieving cooperative behavior on the side of the target, language distance between both firms may give rise to opportunist behaviors. The choice of the common language arises once again as a source of potential conflicts between both firms. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al. (2005</xref>) observe, the choice of the common language is likely to send an implicit symbolic message regarding the division of power between both parties. In addition, the common corporate language may become a control mechanism for one of these firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812452634">Root, 1994</xref>). Companies who accommodate the other firm’s language feel that they have relinquished some control over the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812452634">Harzing and Feely, 2008</xref>), as the firm whose mother tongue is the common language might start to dominate the relationship. This is known as a power distortion process – a great example of this kind of process can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al. (2005</xref>). In summary, selection of the common language may introduce a superior–subordinate relationship in the integration process which does not necessarily reflect the actual responsibility or decision power agreed upon in the acquisition contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452634">Luo and Shenkar, 2006</xref>). When the common language is the foreign investor’s mother tongue (or a third language different from the target’s one), personnel in the target may feel that they have become subordinates to the acquirer’s personnel. This negative feeling, communication misunderstandings, and the use of gatekeeper power place each merging party in an opposing camp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452634">Piekkari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812452634">Welch et al., 2001</xref>). Once they are so placed, a negative (noncooperative or opportunistic) reaction of the target’s personnel may be expected.</p><p>As already mentioned, language distance increases costs relative to both investment formulas – greenfields and acquisitions. Nevertheless, such an increase is expected to be not so important in greenfields. Investing through a greenfield provides the foreign investor with some protection against information asymmetry, even when the investment is carried out through a joint venture, which implies sharing the project with a second partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812452634">Balakrishnan and Koza, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812452634">Chen and Hennart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812452634">Reuer and Koza, 2000</xref>). When investing through a greenfield, the foreign investor gets access to local resources which are available through market contracting or are provided by a second partner. In any case, the investor does not face the cost of having to pay for them in advance nor the risk of acquiring (and paying market value for) resources it does not need. In the same way, ex <italic>post</italic> costs get also reduced when investing through a greenfield, in so far as not all the assets coming from different firms need to be integrated and different hierarchies do not exist. Even when a second partner participates in a greenfield joint venture, integration problems are not so high as each partner transfers only part of its resources to the new venture. Even more, resources provided by the local partner do not need to be integrated in the foreign investor’s hierarchy.</p><p>In summary, the rise in transaction costs due to LD is higher in acquisitions than in greenfields. Therefore, we pose the following hypothesis:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Hypothesis 1: Higher language distance between the home and the target countries will increase transaction costs of acquisition and lead to greater use of greenfield investments.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="section4-1470595812452634" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section5-1470595812452634"><title>Database</title><p>In order to develop our analysis, we created a database collecting the FDIs made through greenfield investments and acquisitions carried out between 1989 and 2003 by listed Spanish companies whose shares are traded on the Madrid Stock Exchange – one must bear in mind that Spanish outward FDI flows were not totally liberalized until 1988; as a consequence, our database collects all FDIs made by listed Spanish companies until 2003.</p><p>FDIs made by Spanish firms have been identified by following this process: after preparing a list including all Spanish firms listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange for each year within our study, exhaustive and systematic research was carried out for each identified company by using reports presented by each firm to the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores or CNMV (literally, the ‘National Stock Exchange Commission’), which oversees the Madrid Stock Exchange), as well as other corporate reports, and the archives of the leading economic Spanish newspapers.</p><p>This research allowed us to identify 509 new FDIs, or FDIs that are the first investment relative to a particular internationalization project.

Additionally, FDIs located in host countries lacking any of the cultural or risk measures referred to in the following section were also eliminated. The final sample is composed of 383 FDIs located in 44 different host countries. Latin America is the host region receiving the highest volume of Spanish FDIs, followed by the European Union and other OECD countries – 85% of collected FDIs are concentrated in these three regions.</p><p>The main role played by language in foreign direct investment processes is highlighted by the fact that as many as 40% of identified FDIs are located in Latin America, that is, a region where Spanish is the language spoken by a majority. In addition, a particularly high percentage of these investments located in Spanish-speaking countries have been carried out in service industries – as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470595812452634">Table 1</xref>, this percentage is higher than expected taking into account the industry distribution of the whole sample. These figures confirm the particularly high incidence of language concerns in the internationalization process of service firms. As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470595812452634">Ghemawat (2001</xref>), service industries are highly sensitive to cultural and linguistic differences: the final quality of a service is strongly dependent on the interaction between consumer and provider. This interaction is in turn reliant on the provider’s competence to understand and master the consumer’s cultural and linguistic dynamics.</p><table-wrap id="table1-1470595812452634" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Breakdown of FDIs by industry and host country’s majority spoken language.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-1470595812452634" xlink:href="10.1177_1470595812452634-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th>No Spanish-speaking host country</th><th>Spanish-speaking host country</th><th><italic>Total</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Service</td><td>135</td><td>145</td><td>280</td></tr><tr><td>(–5.3)***</td><td>(5.3)***</td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Manufacturing</td><td>81</td><td>22</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>(5.3)***</td><td>(–5.3)***</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>216</td><td>167</td><td>383</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-1470595812452634"><p><bold><italic>Chi<sup>2</sup> =</italic>28.348***</bold> (Adjusted).</p></fn><fn id="table-fn2-1470595812452634"><p>Phi: –0.272*** Cramer V: 0.272***. </p></fn><fn id="table-fn3-1470595812452634"><p>* p &lt; 0.1; ** p &lt; 0.05; *** p &lt; 0.01.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Although acquisition processes account for a higher percentage of FDIs than greenfield investments – 68 and 32% respectively – this is not a steady tendency across the period: as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470595812452634">Figure 1</xref> shows, <italic>de novo</italic> investments (mainly greenfield joint ventures) account for a higher number of FDIs during the first years in the period, while acquisitions rose sharply in the later 1990s and early 2000s.</p><fig id="fig1-1470595812452634" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>FDIs collected in the database: greenfield investments and acquisitions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470595812452634-fig1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section6-1470595812452634"><title>Dependent variable and methodology</title><p>In order to test our predictions, several binomial logistic regression models have been estimated. The dependent variable, investment mode, is a dichotomous one which equals 1 when the FDI has been carried out through an acquisition and 0 otherwise.

In these estimations, the coefficients obtained for each independent variable evaluate the effect of the increments of these variables on the likelihood of the dependent variable equaling 1.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1470595812452634"><title>Independent and control variables</title><p>A total of three different LD variables seek to approach the existence of linguistic distance between Spain and each host nation. First, we have used a basic dichotomous variable DL<sub>1</sub> which values 1 when Spanish (which is the majority official language in the home country) is not an official language in the host country. This variable values 0 when Spanish is an official language in the host country, although not necessarily the only official language. Then, based on the scale of language distance proposed by Dow and Kuranaratna (2006), we developed two additional measures. This is a five-point scale that focuses on the differences and similarities between languages, grouping them in families, branches within a family, and different level subbranches. Following this scale, the highest score of language distance (5 points) is given when the language spoken in the host country is classified in a family of languages different from Spanish. On the contrary, the lowest score of language distance is coded when the language spoken in the host country is Spanish. Scores ranging from 4 to 2 reflect the same family, but a different branch; same branch but different subbranch, and same subbranch, but different language, respectively. Based on this scale, LD<sub>2</sub> measures the distance between Spanish and the official language majority spoken in the host country; while LD<sub>3</sub> measures the distance between Spanish and the closest official language spoken in the host country. As an example, both English and French are official languages in Canada. The former is the majority spoken one, so LD<sub>2</sub> measures language distance between Spanish and English. French is not the predominant language in Canada, but it is closer to Spanish in the scale, so LD<sub>3</sub> measures language distance between Spanish and this language.</p><p>Several control variables have been included in our study in order to control their potential effect on the choice of investment mode. As a first step, the cultural distance (CD) between the home and host countries has been included in the analysis. We have measured it through the Kogut and Singh Index based on Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: <italic>power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, </italic>and<italic> masculinity</italic> – the fifth dimension identified by Hofstede and Bond (1988), i.e. <italic>long term orientation, </italic>has not been used in this paper as it is available for only 23 countries. As shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812452634">Larimo and Dow (2009</xref>), this is the measure most frequently used in the literature in order to analyze the extent to which different cultures are similar or different.</p><p>We have also introduced in our analysis some variables which refer to <italic>psychic distance stimuli </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812452634">Dow and Karunaratna, 2006</xref>), that is, to national level factors related to distances between nations which influence psychic distance perceptions as, for instance, differences in economic and industrial development, or geographic distance. A variable relative to the host country’s risk rate has also been included.</p><p>The ECDEV 1 and ECDEV 2 variables seek to approach differences in economic development between Spain and the host countries collected in the database. These variables have been built using data from the World Development Report by the World Bank. In this report, the World Bank clusters different economies in four different groups considering each country’s degree of economic development – high, middle-high, middle-low, and low economic development. Taking into account that Spain was in the first cluster (high economic development) throughout the 15 years in the study, the ECDEV 1 is a dichotomous variable which values 1 when the host country is clustered in the second category (middle-high economic development), while ECDEV 2 is a dichotomous variable which values 1 when the host country is clustered in the third or fourth categories (lower economic development) and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The Geographical Distance (GD) between Spain and each host country has been measured by the flying distance (kilometers) between the capital of Spain and the capital of each host country – this variable has been introduced in the model in a logarithmic transformation to capture its diminishing marginal effect.</p><p>In order to measure the political risk affecting the host country, we have used the Euromoney Risk Ratings over the period of study – variable labeled as PR. The Euromoney rating is a comprehensive country risk rating which accounts for financial, economic, and political risk. This rating uses a scale from 0 (lowest stability or highest possible country risk) to 100 (the lowest possible country risk). In order to facilitate interpreting its coefficients, we have transformed this variable, so that PR values 100-Euromoney ranking.</p><p>Several control variables relative to foreign investors and FDI processes have been also included. First, different variables related to investing firms’ characteristics have been included; in particular, their size and experience. The investing firms’ size (SIZE) has been measured through their market capitalization calculated on 31 December in the year previous to the FDI being made. A logarithmic transformation of this variable has been done.</p><p>Regarding the investing firms’ experience, two variables have been introduced in the analysis: their international or multinational experience (INT EXP) and their experience related to each particular host country (HC EXP). In both cases the experience has been measured through dichotomous variables. The INT EXP variable values 1 when the foreign investor has carried out previous FDIs (regardless of the host country); while HC EXP values 1 when previous FDIs are located in the same host country as the FDI coded in the database.</p><p>When taking into account the foreign investor’s host country experience, it is to be expected that this experience moderates the influence of both the cultural distance and the language distance on the choice between greenfields and acquistions – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812452634">Cho and Padmanabhan (2005</xref>). This potential moderating effect has been measured through interaction effects: CD * HC EXP and LD * HC EXP. With the aim of increasing interpretability of these interaction effects and avoiding multicolinearity problems, all these variables have been mean-centered. Each variable has been centered by subtracting the mean score of the variable from each data-point. Therefore, the mean value of each new centered variable is 0.</p><p>Additionally, different variables relative to the FDI process itself have been also included in the analysis; in particular, the entry mode chosen by the foreign investor to carry out the FDI, the year in which the FDI took place, and the industry. The entry mode has been measured through a dichotomous variable which values 1 when the foreign investor keeps 100% of the equity of the firm located in the host market and 0 otherwise. In order to measure time, we have used a counter variable which values 1 when the FDI was carried out in 1989 (the first year in our study), 2 for FDIs carried out in 1990, and so on. Finally, as our sample shows a high bias towards service firms, we have included in the model a dichotomous variable (IND) which values 1 when the investing firm competes in a manufacturing industry and 0 when it competes in a service industry.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470595812452634">2</xref> shows the correlation(s) matrix of the variables used in our empirical tests. As is shown in the table, the pairwise correlation between language distance variables and cultural distance is quite high, but far from perfect (correlations range from 0.41 to 0.69, depending upon the language distance variable used). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470595812452634">Table 2</xref> also shows high correlations between our independent variables (language distance variables) and some control variables, as for instance, variables relative to country risk, economic development differences, and geographic distance between nations – as shown in the table, the highest correlations are found for LD<sub>1</sub>, the dichotomous variable. Correlations amongst these control variables are also high. Logistic regressions were replicated avoiding these control variables. As results relative to our independent variables remained robust, these control variables were finally included in estimated models – as correlations are high, but not perfect, it becomes clear that each one of these variables gathers relevant information.</p><table-wrap id="table2-1470595812452634" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Correlations matrix.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table2-1470595812452634" xlink:href="10.1177_1470595812452634-table2.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th>ACQ</th><th>LD<sub>1</sub></th><th>LD<sub>2</sub></th><th>LD<sub>3</sub></th><th>CD</th><th>INTEXP</th><th>HCEXP</th><th>GD</th><th>ECDEV<sub>1</sub></th><th>ECDEV<sub>2</sub></th><th>PR</th><th>WOS</th><th>YEAR</th><th>SIZE</th><th>IND</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ACQ</td><td>1</td><td>−.127*</td><td>−.130*</td><td>−0.079</td><td>−0.065</td><td>0.074</td><td>.101*</td><td>0.087</td><td>0.068</td><td>−0.053</td><td>−0.001</td><td>−.208**</td><td>.338**</td><td>.117*</td><td>−0.028</td></tr><tr><td>LD<sub>1</sub></td><td/><td>1</td><td>.790**</td><td>.759**</td><td>.419**</td><td>−.179**</td><td>−.146**</td><td>−.718**</td><td>−.720**</td><td>−.177**</td><td>−.718**</td><td>.234**</td><td>−0.03</td><td>−.295**</td><td>.272**</td></tr><tr><td>LD<sub>2</sub></td><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.947**</td><td>.647**</td><td>−.115*</td><td>−.177**</td><td>−.288**</td><td>−.606**</td><td>0.007</td><td>−.539**</td><td>.249**</td><td>0.052</td><td>−.253**</td><td>.272**</td></tr><tr><td>LD<sub>3</sub></td><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.694**</td><td>−.102*</td><td>−.173**</td><td>−.248**</td><td>−.578**</td><td>−0.043</td><td>−.567**</td><td>.255**</td><td>0.092</td><td>−.225**</td><td>.268**</td></tr><tr><td>CD</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>−0.024</td><td>−.152**</td><td>0.003</td><td>−.335**</td><td>−0.044</td><td>−.394**</td><td>.201**</td><td>0.036</td><td>−.118*</td><td>.128*</td></tr><tr><td>INTEXP</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.286**</td><td>.196**</td><td>.144**</td><td>0.086</td><td>.124*</td><td>−.115*</td><td>.289**</td><td>.310**</td><td>−.173**</td></tr><tr><td>HCEXP</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>0.067</td><td>.139**</td><td>−.126*</td><td>−0.024</td><td>−0.031</td><td>.248**</td><td>.288**</td><td>−.231**</td></tr><tr><td>GD</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.553**</td><td>.229**</td><td>.540**</td><td>−.180**</td><td>.143**</td><td>.225**</td><td>−.147**</td></tr><tr><td>ECDEV<sub>1</sub></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>−.350**</td><td>.499**</td><td>−.159**</td><td>0.001</td><td>.240**</td><td>−.201**</td></tr><tr><td>ECDEV<sub>2</sub></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.544**</td><td>−.134**</td><td>0.071</td><td>−0.035</td><td>0.08</td></tr><tr><td>PR</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>−.225**</td><td>−0.033</td><td>.147**</td><td>−.102*</td></tr><tr><td>WOS</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>−.120*</td><td>−.199**</td><td>.234**</td></tr><tr><td>YEAR</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>.191**</td><td>0.073</td></tr><tr><td>SIZE</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>−.560**</td></tr><tr><td>IND</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>0.680</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.870</td><td>0</td><td>3.582</td><td>0.340</td><td>0.190</td><td>27.523</td><td>0.270</td><td>9.210</td><td>9.290</td><td>0.270</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>0.467</td><td>0.496</td><td>1.751</td><td>1.697</td><td>0.730</td><td>0.334</td><td>0.479</td><td>0.465</td><td>0.475</td><td>0.393</td><td>18.272</td><td>0.447</td><td>3.966</td><td>0.888</td><td>0.444</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn4-1470595812452634"><p>*p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="section8-1470595812452634"><title>Results and discussion</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1470595812452634">Table 3</xref> reports results from different logistic regression models.

This implies at least a 28% improvement over the chance rate, which is 56.6% in our study – the chance rate equals to <italic>a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470595812452634">2</xref> </sup>+ (1–<italic>a</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470595812452634">2</xref></sup>, where <italic>a</italic> is the proportion of acquisitions in our sample (68.15%). Models’ specificity ranges between 38 and 41% in all estimated models, while sensitivity ranges between 89 and 91% depending upon the particular model.</p><p>Our results confirm the role of language distance between nations as a main factor conditioning the greenfield/acquisition choice: language distance variables show a negative and statistically significant coefficient in all models from (2) to (10), except for model (9). Therefore, this is a solid result which remains steady regardless of the language distance variable used to measure language distance between countries. This result points to a lower preference for acquisitions in international contexts featured by language distance between both countries. Therefore, it provides strong support to our hypothesis, as it seems that language distance increases <italic>ex ante</italic> and <italic>ex post</italic> costs relative to acquisition processes.</p><p>When observing the coefficients of the interaction effects between language distance and host country experience, we find that none are statistically significant, except for that in model (9). It seems that the experience accrued by the investing firm in the host country does not moderate the effect of language distance on the upgrading of transaction costs when investing through acquisitions. Although the positive and statistically significant coefficient in model (9) indicates a preference for greenfield investments once the foreign investor has accrued experience in the host country, this is too weak a result.</p><p>However, this experience clearly moderates the effect of cultural distance on transaction costs, as the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the variable CD*HC EXP shows in models (4), (7), and (10) – once again, regardless of the language distance variable used. As shown in the table, coefficients of the cultural distance variable are not statistically significant in any of the estimated models, addressing a non-significant effect of this variable on the choice of investment mode when the foreign investor does not have experience in the host country (i.e. when HC EXP variable values 0). This is an unexpected result, as most empirical evidence shows a negative influence of cultural distance on the choice of acquisitions as the formula to invest. This result can be derived from the inclusion in regression models of some factors relative to the distance among countries (related to cultural distance, but not explicitly included in its measures) which have been overlooked in the literature, as for instance, the language distance, or differences in economic development or country risk rates. As already pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812452634">Harzing (2003</xref>), studies that analyze the effect of cultural distance on internationalization processes and do not include other differences between countries may obtain distorted results, as the cultural distance variable might act as a proxy for these differences. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, once Spanish foreign investors have accrued experience in the host country, they prefer to carry out further investments in cultural distant countries through greenfield investments rather than through acquisitions.</p><p>Now addressing results relative to other ‘psychic distance stimuli’ variables, our results show that neither the geographical distance between countries nor the host country’s risk rate play a statistically significant role, while the distance relative to economic development influences the tendency to invest through acquisitions in a negative and statistically significant way: ECDEV<sub>1</sub> and ECDEV<sub>2</sub> variables show a negative coefficient across all models estimated, endowing results with a high degree of robustness. It seems that Spanish companies investing abroad prefer greenfield investments over acquisitions when investing in host countries which show a lower economic development degree than Spain. This result is in line with findings in previous literature – see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812452634">Larimo (2003</xref>).</p><p>Control variables relative to FDIs characteristics show different results. The IND variable does not show a statistically significant coefficient in any of estimated models, therefore pointing to its non-relevant role in the choice between greenfields and acquistions. On the contrary, variables relative to the year in which the investment was carried out and to the entry mode show a statistically significant coefficient across all estimated models. While the former shows a positive sign, denoting a higher preference for acquisitions in the later years of the analyzed period, the latter shows a negative sign, pointing to a lower preference for acquisitions when the investing firm keeps 100% of the target’s equity. Although this latter result is in line with that found in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812452634">Demirbag et al., 2008</xref>), most empirical evidence does not find a statistically significant relation between both decisions – see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812452634">Barkema and Vermeulen (1998</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812452634">Larimo and Dow (2009</xref>).</p><p>Results relative to the YEAR variable may be contingent on the particular features of our database. As mentioned above, our database gathers FDIs carried out by Spanish firms since 1989; that is, since Spanish outward FDI flows were fully liberalized. Both the number of Spanish firms and the amount of outward FDI flows were not only extremely reduced before such liberalization, but much lower than expected given Spain’s degree of economic and industrial development. In fact, due to this gap between economic development and outward FDI activity, Spain has been known in the literature as a <italic>late investor</italic> country; that is, a country which became actively involved in FDI processes too late as compared to its economic development. It seems that once Spanish firms accrued some degree of international experience by investing through greenfield joint ventures during the former years of the period, they tried to compensate for such a delay in their internationalization path by investing through investment formulas which accelerate the internationalization process: acquisitions.</p><p>Finally, the foreign investor’s size and accrued experience do not play a relevant role in the choice between greenfields and acquisitions. However, it has to be noted that the experience accrued by the foreign investor relative to each particular host country becomes statistically significant when considering its interaction effect with the cultural distance; that is, the HC EXP variable plays a relevant role in moderating the effect of cultural distance.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1470595812452634"><title>Conclusions and managerial implications</title><p>Our analysis demonstrates the need to unbundle language distance from cultural distance in order to identify the role that it plays in the choice between greenfield and acquisitions when investing abroad. When so doing, cultural distance arises as a main factor conditioning the transaction costs of an acquisitions process. The language distance between the investing firm and the target increases the information asymmetry the foreign investor must face when investing abroad, and therefore, <italic>ex ante</italic> transaction costs relative to the valuation and pricing of the target and to the negotiation process. In the same way, the larger the language barriers between the acquirer and the target, the more difficult and costly the integration process of resources and personnel coming from both firms, and the harder it is to achieve cooperative (non-opportunistic) behavior on the part of the target.</p><p>The empirical analysis carried out in this paper provides strong support for this idea, as results remain solid when using different measures of language distance. Additionally, as our study controls the potential influence of different factors relative to the distance among countries on the choice of investment mode – cultural, economic, risk, and geographic distances – these results allow us to analyze the isolated influence of language distance.</p><sec id="section10-1470595812452634"><title>Managerial relevance</title><p>For practitioners, our study sheds light on the choice of the formula for investing abroad. We find strong support for the role of language distance as a main factor conditioning transaction costs. It seems that the role played by language distance is even more relevant than the one played by the cultural distance between the home and the host countries.</p><p>Managers dealing with an international acquisition process should carefully handle the choice of the common language of the project, as it may become a control mechanism for one of the firms involved in this process. Language can even emerge as a source of power for some individuals who enjoy a control position just based on their language skills. Additionally, language barriers between both firms should be removed in order to facilitate the flow of information, the integration of assets, knowledge, and human resources, as well as to avoid the creation of factions or groups within the workforce and managers.</p><p>Our study also highlights that the experience accrued by the foreign investor in the host country does not moderate the increase of costs derived from language distance. On the contrary, this experience seems to play a role as a moderator of cultural distance’s influence.</p></sec><sec id="section11-1470595812452634"><title>Limitations and future research directions</title><p>Although our results remain strong when using different measures of language distance, they may not be applicable to other contexts, as the particular features of our sample may be somehow influencing these results – in particular, the over-representation of service firms and FDIs located in Latin American countries. Many large Spanish firms have expanded abroad and become large multinationals during the period analyzed in this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812452634">Guillén, 2005</xref>), whereas at the beginning of the 1990s most of them were exclusively focused on the local Spanish market. Particularly, the 1996–9 period features a large amount of FDIs made by a rather small group of firms (those in some service industries) and located in a particular host region (Latin America). Thus, a study including more recent years is necessary to test whether our results are applicable to other periods of time. Nevertheless, when analyzing data from macro FDI flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812452634">UNCTAD, 2010</xref>) we can see that Spanish FDI outward flows during the period 2004–8 show an industry and country breakdown very similar to that of previous years. It is not until 2009 that we can find some differences due to the sharp decrease of the Spanish outward FDI. Consequently, it is to be expected that our conclusions relative to the role of language in the choice between greenfields and acquisitions by Spanish firms are applicable to longer periods of study.</p><p>We also think that more research is needed to better understand the role of different types of experience as factors moderating the transaction costs of different formulas to access international markets. We think that future research should not only pay attention to the two types of experience already analyzed in this paper – international and host country experience – but also to the experience related to the use of particular investment modes – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812452634">Cho and Padmanabhan (2005</xref>) – as well as to the experience accrued by the foreign investor in host nations which can be labeled as ‘similar’ to each other – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812452634">Dow and Larimo (2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work has been supported by the Science and Technology Department – Spain (Project: SEC 2009-07786).</p></ack><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1470595812452634"><label>1.</label><p>In their empirical study about bicultural-bilingual individuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812452634">Ringberg et al.
