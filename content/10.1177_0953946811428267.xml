<abstract>
<p>John Paul II proposes that 1 Cor. 9:24-27 includes sport among the human values and offers a paradigm to recognise ‘the fundamental validity of sport, considering it not just as a term of comparison to illustrate higher ethical and aesthetic ideal, but also in its intrinsic reality as a factor in the formation of man as a part of his culture and his civilization’. In this paper, I intend to follow John Paul II’s interpretation and moral reasoning in order to demonstrate how 1 Cor. 9:24-27 can be used in Christian ethics as a paradigm for theological reflection on sport.</p>

<p>The late Pope John Paul II/Karol Wojtyla was known as the ‘Athlete Pope’. ‘Lolek’, a term of endearment, had a passion for sport that was attributed to his father and older brother Edmund. He played goalie for his school football team, ran track, played volleyball, and organised athletic events. He revered the outdoors, specifically the Tatra Mountains, as a medium provoking transcendent experiences for these divine encounters were contemplative exercises charged with the beauty and serenity of God, discernible in the interior of man.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946811428267">1</xref></sup> Since John Paul II understood sport like other human actions as a lived experience,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946811428267">2</xref></sup> then it should not come as a surprise that John Paul II reflected regularly on this subject matter with an acute focus on 1 Cor. 9:24-27 as a paradigm for exploring and opening up how the Christian tradition ought to think about this irreducibly, complex human activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946811428267">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the concept <italic>paradigm</italic>, I follow Richard Hay’s different modes of appeal to Scripture for ethical discourse. St. Paul’s use of an extended athletic metaphor in 1 Cor. 9:24-27 functions as a summary and model for how a Christian, no less a Christian sportsperson, practises and lives life for the sake of the gospel. St. Paul’s pattern of meaning in this text is how the athlete models a life like Paul’s where self-sacrifice is performed for the sake of some goal which for a Christian is the gospel. Yet, our understanding of the meaning that St. Paul willed cannot neglect the implications that this text has for those who actually play sports; and therefore, John Paul II recognises this as a paradigm and even a general outlook of moral consideration (theological principles) from which a Christian sportsperson deliberates about sportive action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946811428267">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>My use of the athletic imagery in 1 Cor. 9:24-27 as interpreted by John Paul II is not meant to encapsulate all other theoretical constructs that a Christian ethic might employ for how Christians think theologically about sport; rather, it is another paradigm for interpreting and engaging ethically the lived experience of sport itself. In fact, I contend this metaphor is unable to stand as the organising image for a theological ethic of sport.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946811428267">
<title>Qualifications</title>
<p>First, this metaphor is not a root metaphor for interpreting all sportive actions. As documented in the sport philosophy literature, sport consists of a number of markers, namely, the ludic and aesthetic elements, which St. Paul’s metaphor simply does not elucidate. Therefore, if this metaphor served primarily to theologically interpret and imagine sport in the Christian life, it would be reductionist, neglecting equally important dimensions of sport and the human actor herself. St. Paul’s use of this metaphor is specific to his Corinthian correspondence and his co-text. It does not exhaust this fecund human activity. Furthermore, the practice of sport can inculcate and realise a number of virtues, yet St. Paul only focuses on self-control. Although self-control is especially important in modern sport where loves and desires go undisciplined, sport demands other virtues as well, such as courage, justice, trust and honesty.</p>
<p>Second, the nature of any metaphor is for comparison, not necessarily for a wholesale adoption or justification of the actual thing or image used in the comparison. For example, St. Paul’s use of the soldier analogy should not be construed as necessarily justifying a Christian ethic on war. Instead, I describe below how this metaphor imaginatively links Scripture to the phenomenon of sport and what it implies for the actual practice of sport.</p>
<p>Third, if this metaphor is divorced from the other aspects of a theological foundation for sport—namely, play, human dignity, sign, gift, and Christocratic structure of reality—I fear it opens a Christian ethic to the charge of idealism that has undermined Christians’ past attempts to integrate their Christian faith and sport. This metaphor as a stand-alone image denotes the spiritual life itself especially indicated by St. Paul’s concern in verse 25 to further elaborate on the <italic>agon</italic> motif by commending the example of the athlete’s aim and self-control to the Corinthian Christians. However, St. Paul’s use of this athletic imagery and its concomitant broader spiritual virtue of self-control do not inform us about essential characteristics of sport such as the uselessness or <italic>autotelic</italic> element of sport as play. In other words, to participate in sport does not only involve moral or spiritual excellence, however important that may be, but it also entails a plurality of excellences and goods that are both internal and external to the practice of sport itself. There is a dual character to sport which if a Christian ethic mis-values could plunder other goods which are intrinsic to sport and the human actor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946811428267">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, from the existing modern attempts to relate Christianity and sport, modern muscular Christianity has predominantly chosen to appraise sport’s moral worth according to its pragmatic utility. In this form of life, a Christian ethic must be on guard against making some goods so important that in earnest zeal it overlooks the freedom, spontaneity, and richness of the trivial nature of sport as play.</p>

<title>Significance of this Biblical Paradigm for a Theology of Sport</title>
<p>For this paper, the use of this biblical paradigm is important chiefly since, as Ladd and Mathisen argue, modern muscular Christianity is guilty of folk theologising when they interpret St. Paul’s sport metaphors. The charge is that these texts have been used primarily from the perspective of sports subculture, namely an accommodationist method of cultural engagement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946811428267">6</xref></sup> I intend to follow John Paul II’s interpretation and moral reasoning in order to demonstrate how 1 Cor. 9:24-27 can correctly be used in Christian ethics as a paradigm for moral reflection on sport. Though this paper gives further warrant for how to think theologically about sport, more work is necessary to create a fuller Christian ethic of sport.</p>

<title>St. Paul’s Sport Metaphor: Paradigmatic for Moral Realities in Sport</title>
<p>John Paul II biblically explicates the value of sport by appealing to St. Paul’s own use of an athletic metaphor in 1 Cor. 9:24-27 to infer that sport is a human value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946811428267">7</xref></sup> John Paul II theologically reads this passage as an important metaphor for moral discernment concerning how to live virtuously in sport and life. Following John Paul II’s meditative method,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946811428267">8</xref></sup> I will draw out some important theological principles from this paradigm’s meaning for Christian sportspersons today.</p>
<sec id="section4-0953946811428267">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>A brief explanation of this passage serves the reader before addressing John Paul II’s use of it. Alois Koch observes that this passage has been a favourite of the last popes in the twentieth century, with Pope Pius XII referring to it as the ‘Sport Epistle’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946811428267">9</xref></sup> As a human value, according to John Paul II, sport gave St. Paul a point of contact to dialogue about the gospel in the Hellenistic culture and to compare the athletic life to the ‘higher ethical and aesthetic ideal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946811428267">10</xref></sup> John Paul II adds that it was because of St. Paul’s goal to bring the message of Christ to all that he drew from such stock concepts, images, philosophical and literary references and modes of expressions. This athletic imagery or the <italic>agon</italic> motif is a classic <italic>topos</italic> surviving from Hellenistic literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946811428267">11</xref></sup> St. Paul’s readers would undoubtedly have been familiar with this theme since the Greek world attended the Games at Isthmus every second year. Moreover, the point of similarity between this athletic imagery and the Christian life only holds if there is some (incongruous) conjunction of these two semantic fields (albeit not ordinarily recognised)—between the human value of sport and the Christian life; however, that does not mean that all aspects of the unexpected analogy are transferred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946811428267">12</xref></sup> If we fail to understand this incomplete transfer, we misunderstand the nature of a metaphor in the first place. Nor, as stated above, does this sport metaphor mean that this image can function as a root metaphor for interpreting all human actions in sport.</p>
<p>This athletic motif fits the Corinthian ethos because they had an inordinate, competitive concern for the individual to attain a privileged status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946811428267">13</xref></sup> Further, as Thiselton describes, this competitive ethos inclined the people of Corinth towards self-achievement, self-sufficiency and an overvaluation of gifts, namely, some personal goods were recognised as more important than other more basic goods specific to human flourishing and the common good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946811428267">14</xref></sup> However, against their competitive striving and self-adulation, St. Paul shockingly adopts the symbolism of this metaphor to admonish all Corinthian believers, not merely the individual believer, ‘to accept the full commitment of following Christ’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946811428267">15</xref></sup> This commitment is compared to the total commitment of an athlete who trains for the games. Garland makes it clear that by no means does St. Paul’s metaphor compare the Christian life <italic>in toto</italic> to competitive sport in the sense of outdoing or outperforming others to the point that some endure the shame of defeat,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946811428267">16</xref></sup> for that is contrary to the essence of the gospel itself. Nor should the reader reduce the Christian life to the lone athlete training and struggling by herself in order to obtain some first-place prize; there were no team sports in the original games, so this aspect of the metaphor does not transfer. The root of the argument, according to Garland, ‘is that simply entering a race and running does not automatically qualify one as a winner’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946811428267">17</xref></sup> The Christian life, like sport, requires a certain kind of effort, a virtuous striving, that participation itself does not guarantee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946811428267">18</xref></sup> Hence, St. Paul goes on to develop this metaphor (vv. 25-27), paying particular attention to self-control as a virtue, along with the proper goal or aim needed in the Christian life in order for all Christians to eschatologically realise the real reward or objective. Both Collins and Horsley note that St. Paul’s eschatological perspective serves as a subversive twist to the <italic>agon</italic> motif with the contrast in verse 25 between ‘a perishable victory wreath and an imperishable one’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946811428267">19</xref></sup> This contrast invokes and invites for reflection the qualitative difference between sports and the Christian life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946811428267">20</xref></sup> The latter point, a shift from the natural to the supernatural, brings us directly back to John Paul II, who finds in this <italic>agon</italic> motif ‘the elements for outlining not only anthropology but an ethic and also a theology of sport which highlights all its value’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946811428267">21</xref></sup> Let us look at how this paradigm theologically informs his Christian ethic of sport.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0953946811428267">
<title>Human Value of Sport: A Created Good Belonging to our Humanity</title>
<p>To begin, John Paul II commences with the human value of sport because, as argued by Wojtyla/John Paul II elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946811428267">22</xref></sup> the truth about the human person is central to his personalism and is a main problem of contemporary human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946811428267">23</xref></sup> At a conference on sports and ethics, John Paul II refers to his first encyclical, <italic>Redemptor Hominis</italic>, to educate and to remind his audience about the primacy of the person and hence ‘the human person is the object of her [the Church’s] care’ when attending to sport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946811428267">24</xref></sup> Thus, the human value of sport for John Paul II is inseparably linked to anthropology, the human person, from which such created and cultural goods, aspirations and sportive activities arise.</p>
<p>If this link is cogent, then for John Paul II ‘the fundamental validity of sport’ is based on God’s plan set forth for his image-bearers in creation. John Paul II grasps the fundamental validity and meaning of sport not in the abstract but in seeing a principal relation between this athletic metaphor and creation, who we are as humans as storied in the shared narrative of the Christian Church. John Paul II asserts that ‘Athletic activity can help every man and woman to recall that moment when God the Creator gave origin to the human person, the masterpiece of his creative work.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946811428267">25</xref></sup> John Paul II, not unlike his instructions on marriage and sexuality in his pre-papal oeuvres, <italic>Love and Responsibility</italic> and <italic>Theology of the Body</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946811428267">26</xref></sup> interprets sport in the wider context of God’s purposes originally laid forth in creation which establishes a base-line narrative for how Christians reflect on and value sport. Primary to sportive reality, according to John Paul II, is the religious aspect, divine purposes, for this is fundamental to its meaning for the Christian tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946811428267">27</xref></sup> Moreover, if sportive activity is linked up with creation then it follows for John Paul II that when humans play sport they are participating in the order of creation itself, a given order with purposes. In <italic>Love and Responsibility</italic>, Wojtyla accents that when humans harmonise with or conform their activities to God’s created order then they behave <italic>particeps Creatoris</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946811428267">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both Michael Novak and Catholic sport philosopher Zbigniew Dziubiński attest to the same theological correlation between sport and God’s purposes in creation. In <italic>the Joy of Sports</italic>, Novak writes</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I love it when a last set of calculated, reckless, free, and impassioned [competitive sport] efforts is crowned with success. When I see others play that way, I am full of admiration, or gratitude. That is the way I believe the human race should live. When human beings actually accomplish it, it is for me as if the intentions of the Creator were suddenly limpid before our eyes: as though into the fiery heart of the Creator we had momentary insight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946811428267">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Novak accounts for his love or attraction to this inspired <italic>agon</italic> because he identifies the inner life of sport with ‘a deep natural impulse that is radically religious: an impulse of freedom, respect for ritual limits, a zest for symbolic meaning, and a longing for perfection’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946811428267">30</xref></sup> John Paul II would concur completely except he would philosophically clarify that sport actions follow from the dynamic structure of our being as subjects and theologically maintain that this impulse be rooted in who we are as image-bearers. For John Paul II, the sportsperson as ‘man “underlies” all his actions and everything that happens in him insofar as they are but his manifestations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946811428267">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, Dziubiński recognises sport as poiesis; and therefore, when a sportsperson is engaged in sportive actions, she becomes a continuator or co-creator of God’s magnificent work of creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946811428267">32</xref></sup> Indeed, John Paul II himself implies that, because sport is embedded in this created order, sportspersons should respect these positive values intrinsic to human players, since this demonstrates gratitude to God the creator for how he gifts athletes with their abilities which they should responsibly direct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946811428267">33</xref></sup> Let us unpack this hermeneutical turn to creation a bit more and what this implies for a reading of 1 Cor. 9:24-27.</p>
<p>John Paul II’s cultural exegesis turns back and attends to what God reveals in creation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946811428267">34</xref></sup> and thus, the doctrine of creation is an important theological presupposition when coming to terms with any embodied activity. His moral reflection examines sport in the light of God’s dealings with man. Hence, John Paul II fuses the sportive activity of the human person with this first act of the biblical drama horizon. According to Genesis, man was given the mandate or mission to creatively make and develop culture, which witnesses to his own humanity as made by God. What this means then is that sportive action is understood as coming from and cooperating with God’s creative action and purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946811428267">35</xref></sup> Our participation in sport, when construed according to the ends given in creation, can be an appropriate use of the gifts of our hands and bodies, which is meant to be developed as part of the God-given, cultural mandate in Genesis 1–2. God’s directive to ‘fill the earth’ involves the making of human culture. If sport issues from this cultural-making mandate, then, when we direct and relate it towards God it affirms him as Creator. Further, in the second part of <italic>Gaudium et spes</italic>, culture was one of the five loci which must be configured in and towards Christ in order for human culture to properly proceed to and realise man’s true end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946811428267">36</xref></sup> Though the original context for this cultural mandate only included Adam and Eve in a garden environment, a Christian ethic interprets this mission as containing in seminal form all future human <italic>poiesis</italic> and cultural patterns, such as art, dance, sport as play, science, technology, and so on.</p>
<p>When this mandate is understood accordingly, then sport receives its meaning as an aspect of the good, created order that depends on God. Sport is not an autonomous zone disconnected from God’s purposes. This disconnection negates God as creator and denies our ontological character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946811428267">37</xref></sup> Nor does sport have meaning in and of itself. Sport as a cultural activity derives its value from its position as a creation of man the player and maker. Therefore, this explains why John Paul II declares that the fundamental validity of sport is a ‘factor in the formation of man as a part of his culture and his civilization’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946811428267">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since sport is an aspect of this cultural mandate, then I believe, when John Paul II asserts that ‘athletic activity’ signifies moments rooted in our original experience, he imaginatively interprets St. Paul’s use of the sport metaphor in 1 Cor. 9:24-27 as an echo of sorts from God’s original plan. How so? It is an echo because wherever humans act or play there still remains imprints on the image of God of what God originally intended for humans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946811428267">39</xref></sup> If we listen carefully, as John Paul II describes, we can hear the ‘original experience’ in spite of the cacophony of moral discord in modern sport, which John Paul II evenly addresses and excoriates the moral wrongs and idolatrous ideologies in sport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946811428267">40</xref></sup> This latter point is consistent with the Christian tradition first observed with Tertullian and Augustine. Thus, this reading is not a simple deduction on the part of John Paul II but it follows as he reads deeply all moral matters from the scope of revelation and tradition.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it may be contested to what degree St. Paul actually commends sport through his use of athletic imagery or the <italic>agon</italic> motif.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946811428267">41</xref></sup> On the other hand, I believe it is noteworthy that St. Paul chose athletic imagery more than any other single earthly activity. Of course, the frequency of a metaphor by itself does not prove much; however, John Paul II’s interpretation makes it plausible that St. Paul’s positive rhetoric about sport corresponds to a positive conception of sport as a creational good proceeding from who we are as God’s image-bearers. St. Paul’s figurative language does obviously draw from symbols and images from the Roman Empire, which, when read in conversation, in this case, with the doctrine of creation, it becomes very reasonable to see how this imagery functions as a vehicle to communicate a script: run like athletes so that you may obtain the prize. St. Paul expected his audience to perform this imperative. If there is something substantively good about sport, then it appears to contend with an interpretation of this passage that either thins or underinterprets the value of sport in the first place. In other words, if this athletic imagery is to merely signify ethical or spiritual truths without any regard to the nature of sport in the first place, then it appears to empty not only this metaphor but grates against the very nature of a metaphor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0953946811428267">
<title>A Closer Inspection of the ‘Agon’ Metaphor and Athletic Imagery</title>
<p>Is there more going on with how this metaphor functions? From the above discussion, I hold that John Paul II rather straightforwardly believes more is at stake in 1 Cor. 9:24-25 than simply using this imagery as ‘a term of comparison to illustrate higher ethical and aesthetic ideal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946811428267">42</xref></sup> John Paul II has a thick interpretation of this metaphor. These metaphors are not window dressing which St. Paul could have just as easily stripped down to bald declarative sentences in propositional form. A few reasons follow in order to further justify John Paul II’s interpretation and moral reasoning on this point about metaphors.</p>
<p>One reason is that, in general, the nature of a metaphor, and in particular, this <italic>agon</italic> metaphor and the other athletic images literally direct us to the physical phenomenon of athletes competing and strenuously striving—running and boxing. St. Paul could have left us with just one of the agonistic images, yet he purposefully piles them up, extending the richness of the metaphor. In order to do justice to the logic of this metaphor or else the comparison appears arbitrary, first we must experience the concrete qualities of this athletic imagery before we transfer the meaning to the Christian life. Because metaphors are bifocal utterances, then the comparison always follows from understanding the literal picture: the athletic imagery in this example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946811428267">43</xref></sup> If we do not keep the literal and figurative aspects of the implied comparison in tension we either spiritualise this image with the figurative sense overwriting the literal sense, or we concretise it with the literal overwriting the figurative sense. Neither of these is acceptable.</p>
<p>John Paul II understands the literal picture phenomenologically. Sports as a human act are substantively good, though certainly they can be ethically and religiously misdirected. As intimated above, John Paul II knows sport as a lived experience. It is fundamentally good which means it cannot be intrinsically debased—a positive value—which Catholic moral theology affirms about any cultural reality belonging to human beings. That means, the nature of this metaphor allows a positive transfer from the literal or physical to the figurative or spiritual. There must be something substantively good about the literal in order to properly convey and grasp the fundamental connection and significance of St. Paul’s point.</p>
<p>John Paul II determines that this fundamental good is implied by the fact that St. Paul did not refrain from including sport among the human values ‘which he used as points of support and reference for dialogue with the people of his time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946811428267">44</xref></sup> If this metaphor is a point of support and reference, then it appears that John Paul II sees this athletic imagery as a ‘vehicle’ which offers a ‘grid’ through which the Christian life can be perceived and experienced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946811428267">45</xref></sup> If this interpretation is respected, then this metaphor is a window that illumines a real claim about the Christian life. St. Paul, then, does establish a fundamental connection between sports and gospel existence. Undoubtedly, this metaphor like others is inexhaustible, and as delineated above in my <italic>Qualifications</italic> section, the nature of a metaphor precludes a wholesale adoption or justification of the actual thing or image used in the comparison. There are boundaries which any interpreter understands from the anatomy of a metaphor. However, the connection between these two realms—sport and the Christian life—affects both the Christian life, since St. Paul gives new insights about the Christian life from sport itself, and sport, which St. Paul affords it dignity as a practice for inculcating self-control.</p>
<p>Ciampa and Rosner corroborate that St. Paul’s use of the athletic metaphor presupposes that this image of athletes was positive, since St. Paul is inspiring the Corinthians to emulate something good about these athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946811428267">46</xref></sup> What is remarkable about this is that St. Paul would not have been ignorant of the ethical abuses and pagan idolatry which surrounded these games, yet he discerns enough positive good from these games to use them to make his point about how God’s church should run or exercise themselves on the road to lasting glory (1 Cor. 15: 43-44).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946811428267">47</xref></sup> So, whatever ethical objection the Christians and Jews might have had towards sport it does not follow that they, like Paul himself, could not recognise or refer to the positive ideals inherent in the discipline of these athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946811428267">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although John Paul II emphasises sport as a created good, he equally underlines the importance of redemption when reflecting on sport. John Paul II believes that St. Paul builds from the teaching of Jesus, whose incarnation and redemption elevate the real meaning of what it means to be human, a human in any sphere of life. Participating in play, games, and sport is part of what it means to be human. Therefore, according to John Paul II, St. Paul witnesses to the intrinsic reality of human development and fulfilment that the gospel elevates and directs properly to man’s true end. John Paul II declares that St. Paul</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>established the Christian attitude towards this [sport] as towards the other expressions of man’s natural faculties such as science, learning, work, art, love, and social and political commitment. Not an attitude of rejection or flight, but one of respect, esteem, even though correcting and elevating them: in a word, an attitude of redemption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946811428267">49</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Christian stance must responsibly adopt and perfect such human values. John Paul II argues that Christians are called to redeem sport which means making the dignity of the human person the objective of all sporting activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946811428267">50</xref></sup> It is this goal and criterion which a disciple of Christ must defend and promote in order to restore sport to its true end. For John Paul II, this attitude is an entailment from the human dimension of redemption since ‘Christ fully reveals man to himself’ (<italic>Gaudium et spes</italic> 22). That means, the truth about the human person is only fully revealed from the vantage point of Christ. Therefore, Christ is understood as the end and it is this revelation which should infuse sportive activity so that sportspersons participate in their intended fulfilment in Christ.</p>
<p>Returning to the extended athletic metaphor in 1 Cor. 9:24-27, St. Paul elaborates on this <italic>agon</italic> motif in vv. 25-27 by focusing on the theme of self-control (™gkrateÚetai). Fee claims that verse 24 points towards the succeeding imagery of verse 25 in particular the necessity of self-control which explicates what must be done in order to receive and obtain the prize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946811428267">51</xref></sup> In this passage, St. Paul’s thoughts centre on the broad spiritual virtue of self-control that he elsewhere identifies in a catalogue of other virtues as a significant trait of a mature Christian (Gal. 5: 22-23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946811428267">52</xref></sup> Most insist that the sense of this virtue as adopted by St. Paul for this aspect of the <italic>agon</italic> motif is ‘to exercise self-discipline’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946811428267">53</xref></sup> or mastery over oneself;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946811428267">54</xref></sup> it ‘refers to “vigorous control of appetite and passion”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946811428267">55</xref></sup> Hence, John Paul II claims that St. Paul’s symbolism places the emphasis on ‘the interior and spiritual significance of sport: “Every athlete exercises self-control in all things” (1 Cor. 9:25). This recognises the healthy dose of balance, self-discipline, sobriety, and therefore, in a word, of virtue, which is implied in the practice of sport’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946811428267">56</xref></sup> John Paul II, not unlike St. Paul and others in Hellenic literature, interprets the realisation of self-control with the practice of sport. Yet, John Paul II qualifies that sport values such as fair play and respect demand a capacity for temperance or discipline. He avers that discipline ‘can be considered a prerequisite for spiritual elevation. In fact, it creates a certain type of personal check which every step towards perfection absolutely needs.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946811428267">57</xref></sup> He further infers that St. Paul’s use of self-denial instils the necessity not only to train athletic muscle, a bodily discipline, but also to train the spirit—moral and spiritual strength—through the exercise of the cardinal and theological virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946811428267">58</xref></sup> Therefore, just as an athlete disciplines his own body as a necessity for reaching his end so should the Christian discipline his heart and mind for a harmonious development and formation of his whole personality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946811428267">59</xref></sup> How does he reach this conclusion in light of his philosophy of human action?</p>
<p>John Paul II’s conception of sport praxis fits St. Paul’s image of an athlete deliberately and voluntarily exercising her capacities with the effect of self-control. As argued in <italic>Laborem exercens</italic> (4-6), John Paul II distinguishes two primary aspects when referring to human praxis. In this Corinthian passage, he associates self-control as a virtue that forms the sportsperson and that thus is linked to the intransitive–subjective dimension of human action. When construed and practised correctly, which St. Paul assumes lest an athlete be disqualified, sport is a practice that affords the development and fulfilment of virtues, an immanent activity of the human person. For John Paul II, sport is an activity that can ennoble humans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0953946811428267">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>John Paul II goes on to explicate that the virtues discovered and expressed in sport correspond to the moral order itself. This is important because the goods or values internal to sport have an ‘onto-logic’ to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0953946811428267">61</xref></sup> How a person plays sport is not determined solely by the practice since that determination could easily justify some kind of relativism, but by whether the goods realised in the practice correspond to an order already given in the purposes of the moral order. John Paul II summarises that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To be a good sportsman, one must have honesty with oneself and with others, loyalty, moral strength (over and above physical strength), perseverance, a spirit of collaboration and sociability, generosity, broadness of outlook and attitude, and ability to live in harmony with others and to share: all these requirements belong to the moral order…<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0953946811428267">62</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as John Paul II addresses the category of human praxis in economic and social relations, so does he apply it to the sport discourse. The nature of sport praxis, according to his Thomistic conception of human action, affords an athlete the opportunity to form himself through his actions, which remain in the subject:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0953946811428267">63</xref></sup> ‘The priority of the human being as the subject of activity has fundamental significance for the constitution of culture through human praxis.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0953946811428267">64</xref></sup> Because the activity of sport arises from the fact that a human being already exists (<italic>operari sequitur esse</italic>), St. Paul’s appeal to this cultural activity makes sense to John Paul II. What remains in the subject, the I-act, are virtues, such as self-control. In <italic>Acting Person</italic>, Karol Wojtyla draws on these kinds of ‘man-acts’ (‘I act’) as the kinds that constitute the essential experience of efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0953946811428267">65</xref></sup> Efficacy is the experience that the actor realises dynamically as the agent who self-causes her actions versus passively experiencing something that happens within herself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0953946811428267">66</xref></sup> This kind of action is an ethical experience in that the good actions that comprise the virtue of self-control are owned by the agent who causes these acts. Karol Wojtyla comments that we truthfully accept these actions as our own because they are moral in nature and thus fall in the domain of moral responsibility. Therefore, when John Paul II indexes self-control from St. Paul, it is precisely an ethical experience that he has in mind. The moral agent, like the image of the athlete, can freely choose to master her appetites and passions, whether they are realised inwardly or spiritually as self-control.</p>
<p>Closely following the last point, sport can be an effective ‘school of human formation and personal in [sic] maturity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0953946811428267">67</xref></sup> Since virtues like self-control, tenacity, and sacrifice train the will,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0953946811428267">68</xref></sup> this school as a practice has educative significance. When acting-sportspersons perform certain acts of self-discipline—acts in which the decision to do X is caused by the good of the desired object<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0953946811428267">69</xref></sup> (which in this passage is for the sake of the gospel)—this immanent activity leaves its marks and fruit in the human person. Pfitzner elaborates that the ‘apostle [Paul] also knew that grace calls and equips its recipients for hard work! The image of the striving athlete implies intense effort and application of all one’s energies, but Paul’s main focus is always on the goal of Christian striving.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0953946811428267">70</xref></sup> John Paul II imagines that, when sport is practised accordingly, it ‘has in itself an important moral and educative significance: it is a training ground of virtue, a school of inner balance and outer control, an introduction to more true and lasting conquests’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0953946811428267">71</xref></sup> Thus, he construes sport as a ‘human and social phenomenon that has such importance and influence on people’s way of acting and thinking today’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0953946811428267">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, the logic of sport is governed by its <italic>telos</italic>. I believe that John Paul II discerns that St. Paul’s use of this metaphor imaginatively situates the Corinthian church in this symbolic world to reread their own lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0953946811428267">73</xref></sup> John Paul II deduces that the sacrifice or self-control in order to achieve certain results (1 Cor. 9:25) is not merely a logic of sport, but it is also the logic of life and the gospel, for ‘without sacrifices, important results are not obtained, or even genuine satisfaction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0953946811428267">74</xref></sup> Just as sport is directed towards a desired end and affects the actions chosen by sportspersons as they play it, so too the logic of the gospel directs Christians towards their intended end of eternal life. Again, the point of similarity means that the two share this in common. Therefore, St. Paul values this similarity, and yet he does not leave it merely at this level of comparison. John Paul II asserts that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was appropriate, then, for Paul to refer to athletic contests in order to spur the Christians of that city to push themselves to the utmost in the ‘race’ of life. In the stadium races, he says, everyone runs, even if only one is the winner: you too run … With this metaphor of healthy athletic competition, he highlights the value of life, comparing it to a race not only for an earthly, passing goal, but for an eternal one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0953946811428267">75</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>John Paul II follows the whole discourse (8:1–11:1) eschatologically, with his homiletical attention given to the eternal goal (imperishable). St. Paul specifies that the gospel itself is the <italic>telos</italic> that frames how he practises evangelism (1 Cor. 9:23) and how the Corinthian church should handle the problem of eating meat that had been offered to idols (1 Cor. 8). St. Paul chooses to exercise his freedom for the sake of the gospel, which when accomplished, glorifies God in all areas of life, particularly the mundane (1 Cor. 10:31-33). St. Paul makes an <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument with this comparison between the two different goals of both endeavours. That is, if sportspersons strive with this kind of exacting discipline towards a fading, temporal crown, how much more should Christians maintain self-control for the sake of a higher, enduring goal—an imperishable crown?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0953946811428267">76</xref></sup> This <italic>telos</italic> has some immediate implications for how a Christian ethic construes sport.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-0953946811428267">
<title>Theological Implications for a Theology of Sport</title>
<p>One implication is that the eternal goal for a Christian ethic invests this end with an eschatological element because the natural ends of earthly activities such as sport are not sufficient by themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0953946811428267">77</xref></sup> If sport points to horizontal ends, the Christian gospel transformatively deepens and directs the Christian sportsperson to her ultimate fulfilment and relationship with God, a vertical end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0953946811428267">78</xref></sup> What is objectified and externalised in sportive action (human praxis) is transitive, passing away and dying, while what is formed in the human person is intransitive and rises to another level in the hierarchy of values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0953946811428267">79</xref></sup> What follows is that the sport narrative is subordinate to the scope and weight of this gospel metanarrative. The ultimate or supernatural determines and judges what the flourishing of this narrative, belonging to the natural life, is to be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0953946811428267">80</xref></sup> Therefore, this end relativises and resolves any conflict. The status of sports is such that it is not the ultimate goal in life. John Paul II calls into question any philosophy of sport that seeks its purpose, key principle for its existence, from any motive other ‘than the dignity, freedom, and integral development of man!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0953946811428267">81</xref></sup> He goes on to deny the maxim ‘sport for sport’s sake’ by countering that ‘sport is at the service of man and not man at the service of sport, and therefore the dignity of the human person is the goal and criterion of all sporting activity…’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0953946811428267">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of St. Paul’s <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument (vv. 24-25), a second implication is that a Christian sportsperson’s moral responsibility is not simply to respect the game (fair play) but also to maintain her higher responsibilities. A Christian in sport has a higher, more binding responsibility to the gospel. John Paul II claims that this goal of eternal life means the more excellent way of love (1 Cor. 12:31), which requires Christians to serve the growth of God’s kingdom in a sportsperson’s life and in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0953946811428267">83</xref></sup> St. Paul’s own example of sacrifice and self-control (1 Cor. 9:12) was to ‘endure all things’, and he later instructs his Corinthian audience that this sacrifice and self-control indeed is love (1 Cor. 13:5, 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0953946811428267">84</xref></sup> Therefore, the exercise of self-control for the sake of the gospel exhibits a form of Christian love. For a Christian ethic and sports, John Paul II concludes that our aim is to build a culture of love in sport over against a civilisation that gives higher priority to goods of production and consumption, which are purely utilitarian and hedonistic considerations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0953946811428267">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of this eschatological conviction (<italic>telos</italic>), a third implication is that the virtue of self-control in sport is not practised ultimately for the sake of sports. A gospel-directed life in sport is an other-directed life, as evidenced by St. Paul’s own example in ministry (1 Cor. 9:15-23). A Christian ethic does not stop with a personal ethic in sport because striving in sport pertains to the free course of the gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0953946811428267">86</xref></sup> Following St. Paul’s example and aim, then this means that the ennobling power of the gospel is not merely a training ground for individual virtues, but rather, the gospel is a ‘getting on together’ that is possible only in a network of mutual relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0953946811428267">87</xref></sup> Humans are meant to exist in relationship. More broadly, if this is a school of virtue, sport, as a shared activity in the interpersonal sense, can and should promote mutual fellowship.</p>
<p>Fourth, more precisely, the imperishable wreath or crown (1 Cor. 9:26) is the eschatological blessing of salvation, the consummation of the gospel. This otherworldly focus, which Christians participate in now, is a life of virtue and fidelity to Christ that determines how Christians relate in sport and life. Furthermore, since for a Christian ethic, virtue is eschatological rather than merely teleological, ultimately this goal is not something realised by our own efforts, as if the efforts in sport or life bring about an incomplete <italic>telos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0953946811428267">88</xref></sup> John Paul II reckons that this ‘imperishable crown’ is a gift received from God,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0953946811428267">89</xref></sup> while at the same time, as St. Paul recognised, it is also something aimed for in light of the promised resurrection (1 Cor. 9:24-26; 1 Cor. 15; Phil. 3:8-21). This <italic>telos</italic> puts sports back on its heels because this is an activity that should not be taken too seriously but rather should be viewed as a splendid occasion to enjoy freely and responsibly the human values of this cultural activity.</p>
<p>In summary, John Paul II believes that St. Paul valued sport for its intrinsic reality to form persons and for how Christians then and now ought to conduct themselves, including Christians in sport. This focal image of the athlete orders his acceptance of sport as a human value—especially against the modern demands of life and work that often preclude or dampen the time for sport and leisure—for an athlete can choose to become somebody.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0953946811428267">90</xref></sup> When these kinds of goods are made manifest in the kingdom of sport, they serve as concrete examples for how Christians redemptively participate with Christ over sport for the primacy and enhancement of the good of persons. According to John Paul II, when sport is practised this way, it ‘acquires an ethical and formative value, and is a valid school of virtue for life’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0953946811428267">91</xref></sup> thus opening up and directing souls to the transcendent dimension of faith. He exhorted his audiences regularly to see this redemptive mission not only for themselves personally, but also at the collective level, so that ‘it may become a vehicle of fraternity and friendship for all who are following these sporting events’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0953946811428267">92</xref></sup></p>

<p>I correlate John Paul II’s use of the word ‘recall’ (see the above quote) with the metaphor ‘echo’ because of how he interprets, in his <italic>Theology of the Body</italic>, all human experiences in fallen man as rooted or revealed in historical man’s theological prehistory. This theological prehistory is an imprint so as to speak of the image of God, for ‘sin signifies a state of lost grace’; sinfulness must be explained with reference to original experience.

<p>It is too simplistic of an answer to say that because of St. Paul’s Pharisaic origins, then he would have found the games morally blameworthy. Murphy-O’Connor counters that, even though Jewish opposition to such games is well documented, ‘we cannot assume the same attitude prevailed in the Diaspora’.
