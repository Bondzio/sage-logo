<p>This article addresses the use of art in the University of Puerto Rico student movement of 2010 to achieve social movement outcomes, such as mobilization and collective identity. More specifically, this paper addresses two major research questions. One, what forms of art were present in the UPR student movement? Two, what impact do artistic objects and performances have on the movement, from the perspective of student activists and artists? Drawing upon 25 hours of observational data and 19 interviews with student activists, faculty, and artists, this paper demonstrates how activists incorporate multiple art forms, not only traditional forms like protest songs, but also innovative forms like street theatre. Incorporating a broad repertoire of art, the movement appealed to a broad population, as well as created a dynamic movement. These questions are critical for understanding recent global movements that rely upon creative and artistic tactics for resistance. However, despite the “cultural turn” among social movement scholars, few have taken seriously the use of art in activism, particularly the ways in which multiple forms of art may be used within one single movement. The case of the student movement of the UPR provides an opportunity to explore up-close the various ways that art may be present within a movement, as well as to uncover how these forms of art operate within the movement and impact on the overall movement.</p>

<title>Reflexive Statement</title>
<p>
<italic>In February 2009, I went on vacation with my best friend, Jennie Ann Cole, to San Juan, Puerto Rico—my first trip to the island. We, like many residents of the U.S. mainland, were ignorant to the complex historical relationship between the continental United States and the island of Puerto Rico. However, both being trained as sociologists, we began to ask questions. During one of these conversations, we were invited to attend the Claridad Festival, a festival in support of independence from the United States for Puerto Rico. While musicians sang songs criticizing the colonial status of the island, I weaved through the crowd to browse information tables about political prisoners and book vendors selling hundreds of books on socialism, taking in the sounds, smells, food, and a couple of Medalla—the locally produced beer in Puerto Rico. It was this moment that I began to think about the collusion of art and politics. On subsequent visits to the island in the months that followed, I developed a close group of friends, as well as begin to learn more about the island. My initial research interest was to explore the ongoing process of gentrification in Rio Piedras, an impoverished neighborhood adjacent to the main campus of the UPR, and the use of graffiti as resistance. As I waited to hear about the outcome of my summer research grant, I began to receive e-mails and links to information about the potential for a strike at the UPR. In April, I watched—in Nashville from my computer—as students of the UPR occupied the university for 48 hours in protest of budget cuts. The students painted the walls and benches of the university. As the students continued to occupy the university, in what seemed like a strike that would never end, I spent a majority of my days, watching and listening to the all the media that poured out from the occupied campus. I was fascinated. This was not just any student strike. This strike was creative. Art poured out from every facet of the strike. As I packed my bags to begin my fieldwork on the island, I knew the story I wanted to tell was about this student strike and the ways in which art and culture has transformative potential in politics</italic>.</p>

<p>In the 2005 strike, there was no art and it was a very boring strike.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>On an unexpected day, an art collective referred to as the <italic>Unit of Clown Police</italic> arrive to the main gate of the student-occupied University of Puerto Rico (UPR) at Rio Piedras. Outside the  gates, a line of police officers surround the university with bright blue barricades separating the police from the numerous supporters who arrive daily to demonstrate their solidarity with the student movement. The members of the <italic>Unit of Clown Police</italic> are dressed in black helmets, shirts, pants, and military boots. Some of them carry brooms; others carry plastic brightly colored water guns. But all of them are wearing a bright red clown nose. As they arrive to the university, the members of the <italic>Unit of Clown Police</italic> slowly approach each member of the official police force. One at a time, they place a dog bowl in front of the officers and place dog food in each bowl. The atmosphere is tense, as the “Chief ” of the <italic>Unit of Clown Police </italic>orders the police officers to eat the food. For those observing the performance, the message is clear. In the days leading up to the performance, there had been numerous clashes between the official police force and the student protestors. After these clashes—particularly when the police force were seen as abusing their power, police officers responded they were simply following orders. <italic>The Unit of Clown Police</italic> performers were calling attention to the conformity and the lack of interrogation from the police force, insinuating they are no different than dogs that follow orders of their owners.</p>
<p>This article addresses the use of art in the UPR student movement, in order to explore the ways in which various forms of art may be used by social movement activists and artists for social movement outcomes, such as mobilization and collective identity. More specifically, this article seeks to address two major research questions. One, what forms of art were present in the UPR student movement? Two, what impact do artistic objects and performances have on the movement, from the perspective of student activists and artists? Utilizing 25 hours of observational data from student protests and 19 interviews with student activists, faculty, and artists, this article demonstrates how activists utilized a variety of art forms, not only traditional forms like protest songs but also innovative forms like street theater. Generally, the presence of art performed several different roles within the UPR student movement, such as invoking solidarity, disseminating information, provoking dialogue, mobilizing additional participants, releasing tensions, providing entertainment, and creating a dynamic movement culture. Interestingly, not all art forms present in the movement were deployed to achieve similar goals. Instead, activists—as well as artists and performers—strategically utilized specific forms of art for different purposes. Analyzing the multiple forms of art present in the UPR student movement, I found that performance art and visual arts acted to produce mobilization within the movement; whereas, protest songs and the radio shows were utilized to maintain engagement. All art forms, to some extent, were used to foster collective identity among existing activists. For example, producing a mural representing a specific academic discipline demonstrated a sense of pride in the specific group. Similarly, singing protest songs together helped the students to feel part of the larger movement. Utilizing a broad repertoire of art forms, the movement was able to appeal to a broad population, both within the student body and the community. One of the goals of the movement was to include diverse voices—such as artists—to create a dynamic movement. However, the strategic inclusion of art and artists also produced tensions within the movement, based on whether art can truly be utilized to achieve “real” political engagement.</p>
<p>These questions are critical for not only understanding this particular “creative” phase of the UPR student movement of 2010 but also global social movements and modern day protest. The use of art for resistance and protest has a long history, recognizable in Bahktin’s analysis of the carnival as a production of subversion to the creative happenings of the Situationists and Yippies during the global revolutions of 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597612451243">Schechner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). For instance, Jerry Rubin, organizer of the Yippie “Festival of Life” scheduled to take place during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, reflects on the role of revolutionary art, “The role of the revolutionary is to create theatre which creates a revolutionary frame of reference. The power to define is the power to control. . .The goal of theatre is to get as many people as possible to overcome fear by taking action. We create reality wherever we go by living our fantasies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597612451243">Schechner 1993</xref>:45). However, during the 1980s, the relationship between art and activism, specifically in the United States, transformed with the spectacular protest actions of AIDS activist group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). ACT UP, utilizing a nonhierarchical organizational model, performed creative protests, such as kiss-ins that shut down traffic, public funerals at City Hall, and their infamous “Stop the Church” event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). These events not only contained a serious political message about the need for funding and research on HIV and AIDS; however, they all featured elements of spectacle, entertainment, and artistic performance. In conceptualizing how the happenings of ACT UP are distinct from the types of performances witnessed during the 1968 movements, scholars suggest that the collusion between art and protest became necessary in a postmodern society, where leisure and consumption have also become subjected to the machinations of commodification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). Thus, in order to not only gain the attention of the media but also to encourage potential constituents to participate, it was necessary to utilize innovative forms of protest, outside of the more traditional forms of protest—such as boycotts, marches, and voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). This model of cultural protest continued to influence subsequent activists, specifically as demonstrated in the antiglobalization protests known as the Battle of Seattle in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). These activists utilized a variety of creative tactics—similar to the Yippies in 1968 and ACT UP activists in the 1990s; however, their network model of organization meant that different groups of activists produced multiple forms of art and performance, as based on their own abilities and preference for protest tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451243">Juris 2008</xref>). For example, some activist groups built giant puppets and held street parties to shut down traffic, others spray-painted the walls of major corporations and banks with graffiti and slogans about the rights of the public, and still others held silent vigils to protest the death of the public commons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>). However, after the events of September 11, 2011, these forms of creative protest were subdued given heightened security and fear of protest actions without being properly vetted through bureaucratic channels.</p>
<p>In the last few years, there has been a resurgence of protest in reaction to neoliberal policies and austerity measures being enforced globally, due to the economic recession taking place around the world. People are taking to the streets, dressed in costumes shouting humorous slogans to protest budget cuts directed at institutions people deem to be “public” and a “right.” For example, in Chile during July 2011, student demonstrators in Santiago dressed as zombies and performed a flashmob performance of Michael Jackson’s <italic>Thriller</italic> in front of La Moneda, the presidential palace. These students claimed they chose the metaphor of the zombie to describe the Chilean educational system, which is dead due to the budget cuts impacting public education in the country. Similarly, beginning in September 2011, the Occupy movement began to occupy public squares and perform protest, by dressing in costumes, such as the now iconic image of the unemployed superhero shackled by student loan debt and the thousands of artistic posters that surrounded these occupied spaces. These performances have garnered incredible media attention, but have also provided activists with a variety of ways in which to participate within the movement, regardless of artistic ability. In addition, these performances create an image of a movement that appears to be dynamic and entertaining. In this way, protest can be conceptualized as fun, instead of the typical methods of marching in a circle, shouting slogans. Similar methods—as well as the strategic inclusion of innovative and creative tactics of protest—were present in the UPR student movement. In popular media and within the movements, debate over the role of art in activism has resurfaced. However, despite the “cultural turn” among social movement scholars, few social movement scholars have taken seriously the use of art in activism, particularly the ways in which multiple forms of art may be used within one single movement. The case of the student movement of the UPR provides an opportunity to explore up close the various ways that art may be present within a movement, as well as to uncover how these forms of art operate within the movement and the impact on the overall movement.</p>

<title>The UPR Student Movement, 2010</title>
<p>The UPR, established in 1903 and formally accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1946, is the island’s state university system. The 11 campus system has approximately 65,000 students with 5,300 faculty members and 14,000 nonteaching staff. The university system offers 472 academic programs and 32 doctoral programs. Beyond the UPR public university system, there are only two other public universities on the island, namely, <italic>Escuela de Artes Plastica</italic> and <italic>Conservatorio de Musica</italic>. The remaining universities on the island are private.</p>
<p>On September 25, 2009, newly elected Governor Luis Fortuno announced that his administration would lay off thousands of government employees under Law 7, legislation that declared a fiscal emergency on the island allowing Fortuno’s administration to make drastic budget cuts. Within days of the announcement, the students of the UPR called for a General Assembly on September 28, 2009, to address their growing concern over how Law 7 might impact the university. At the assembly, the students created action committees by academic disciplines (Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Education, and the School of Law), as well as decided to support other organizations in the<italic> Paro Nacional</italic> (or National Strike), which was scheduled for October 15, 2009.</p>
<p>Over the next 6 months, students from each action committee would act as representatives; visiting and disseminating information to classes on campus, other movement organizations, such as unions and socialist groups, as well as other campuses. The goal was to inform as many people as possible on the issues, in order to establish an educated population before official voting on future actions occurred. In January 2010, the students learned the university would suffer a budget cut of $100 million. The university administration implemented Certification 98, which outlined the ways in which the administration would accommodate for the budget cut, specifically: elimination of tuition waivers for certain types of students (namely, athletes, artists, and honor students), a proposed tuition increase, an increased student fee of $800 per student each semester, other cuts resulting in the lay off of part-time professors, and a 25 percent reduction in the number of classes available, particularly at the upper level. In response, the students called for another General Assembly on April 13, 2010, where the students decided by majority vote to call for a 48-hour strike taking place on April 21 and 22, 2010. In addition, the students voted that if the administration did not agree to negotiate during the 48 hours, they would engage in an indefinite strike beginning on April 23, 2010.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the strike, a student-elected group representative of all 11 campuses referred to as the Negotiating Committee attempted to schedule a meeting with President Jose Ramon de la Torre and Chancellor Ana Guadalupe; however, the administration refused to meet with the Committee. Without negotiations in place, the students began the 48-hour strike on Wednesday, April 21. Between the hours of 4 and 6 a.m., students arrived on campus and locked the seven gates of the campus with chains and locks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597612451243">1</xref>
</sup> Given the refusal of the administration to negotiate with the students by the end of the 48 hours, the students activated the second part of their vote, the indefinite strike. After the occupation of the Rio Piedras campus began, the remaining 10 campuses would also become occupied, resulting in a complete shutdown of the entire university system on the island, with the one exception of the Medical Sciences building.</p>
<p>During the 62-day occupation, many students referred to the occupation as “the creative movement,” given the dynamic presence of art in the movement. Art was utilized in multiple forms, such as flyers, murals, protest songs, poetry, video, photography, dance, and street theater. At times, the students relied upon traditional forms of protest; however, this strike produced innovative forms of protest that had not been present in previous strikes at the university. The strong presence of art during the 62-day occupation, in conjunction with the broad support by sectors of the public that generally do not support student movements of the UPR, provokes questions about the varied types of art present in the movement, as well as the different ways in which this art was deployed within the movement.</p>
<p>On the night of June 16, 2010—2 months in the occupation of the university by students, the Board of Trustees entered into agreement with the students. This agreement would negate most of Certification 98; however, the imposed student fee of $800 would be revisited in subsequent semesters. On June 23, 2010, incidentally the day of my arrival on the island, the students would celebrate victory in the Convention Center in Ponce, where they would ratify the agreement made with the administration. On this same day, Fortuño and his administration would change the law regarding the number of Board of Trustees, to increase the number of private citizens on the Board. Merely days later, the President of the Board would be quoted in numerous media sources as referring to the ratification as “only a piece of paper.” Although the UPR student strike has been widely acknowledged as the only success of the UPR students in history, the struggle would continue. Even at the time of writing, the students are coordinating a 3-day seminar to educate the student body about the movement and current economic changes impacting the university.</p>

<title>Art and Social Movements</title>
<p>Previous work on the use of art and social movements has demonstrated how this malleable form has the potential to perform a variety of roles within social movements, such as evoking strong emotions, producing solidarity, and communicating grievances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451243">Adams 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597612451243">Eyerman and Jamison 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597612451243">Halfmann and Young 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451243">Moore and Roberts 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160597612451243">Roy 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451243">Taylor et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597612451243">Tucker 2010</xref>). The existing literature focuses on four broad areas regarding the use of art in social movements. One area is how artistic and cultural productions have the capability of disseminating information and delineating grievances. A second area explores how artistic workshops and performances can provoke dialogue among activists and those observing the performance. A third area focuses more narrowly on aesthetic techniques—such as narrative or use of the “grotesque”—that can produce strong emotions, ultimately leading to mobilization and solidarity. Finally, the fourth area is focused on the pleasure of protest, specifically how movements can utilize art and culture for leisure, entertainment, and fun.</p>
<sec id="section5-0160597612451243">
<title>Dissemination of Information and Grievances</title>
<p>Artistic objects can be readily used to convey a message—whether this message is about an upcoming protest or outlining the grievances of the movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451243">Adams 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451243">Chaffee 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451243">Isaac 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597612451243">McCaughan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451243">Morrison and Isaac 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451243">Roscigno and Danaher 2004</xref>). Depending on the temporal and spatial location of the social movement, artistic objects may be the only way in which information may be spread to other potential constituents. For example, during the southern textile strikes in the United States from 1929 to 1934, activists relied upon the radio to circulate messages to potential constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451243">Roscigno and Danaher 2004</xref>). Despite little organization by labor unions, activists were able to mobilize workers who were geographically isolated in rural mill towns by utilizing music played on the radio to spread the word from town to town (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451243">Roscigno and Danaher 2004</xref>). In addition, the expression of grievances through artistic objects may be the only opportunity to be heard for those subjected to a repressive government—such as the case of protest against Pinochet in Chile, where the only opportunity to criticize the regime was through collective art-making workshops that were held out of the eyes of the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451243">Adams 2002</xref>). Similarly, depending on the characteristics of potential constituents, certain art forms may be more effective at communicating—such as the use of political cartoons with an illiterate population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451243">Morrison and Isaac 2012</xref>). Different art forms may be more or less useful, depending on the population, but also the message that is being communicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160597612451243">
<title>Provoking Dialogue</title>
<p>Another way that art can be used within movements is to provoke dialogue, generally during collective art making, but also for those who view the object or performance. We find evidence for the importance of dialogue in Adam’s (2002) research on arpillera workshops, during the regime of Pinochet in Chile. <italic>Vicaria de la Solidaridad</italic>, a religious organization set up arpillera workshops,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597612451243">2</xref>
</sup> where women who lived in shantytowns and had no income were able to make money from the sale of these handicrafts. Not only did the workshops fulfill a logistical need, they also provided an opportunity for education, as the workshops provided a space for these women to discuss the issues in their daily lives. It is also present in Reed’s (2005) work on poetry and consciousness-raising groups in the women’s movement of the 1970s, where individuals could engage in a conversation in these groups where their personal experiences provoked discussion and dialogue among other participants that lends to the recognition of structural issues impacting issues of gender equality. Finally, Taylor, Rupp, and Gamson’s (2004) work on drag performances demonstrates how performers intentionally engage the audience in dialogue over the issues of concern in the Gay and Lesbian movement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160597612451243">
<title>Aesthetic Techniques</title>
<p>Some research on art and social movements focuses on different aesthetic techniques that may be utilized by artists and activists. For the purposes of this article, aesthetic refers to an analysis of the <italic>form </italic>apart from the content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597612451243">Tucker 2010</xref>). One aesthetic technique that scholars have explored is that of narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451243">Eyerman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451243">Isaac 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597612451243">Polletta 2006</xref>). Narratives are stories, containing rhetorical devices and story lines, which are capable of linking a particular experience to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451243">Eyerman 2006</xref>). More specifically, the temporal sequencing and moral positioning of characters in a story provoke potential and existing constituents to identify their own opinions in the matter—often leading to mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451243">Isaac 2009</xref>). Additionally, some activists fuse tradition and innovation to enhance mobilization and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597612451243">Eyerman and Jamison 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597612451243">McCaughan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>). For example, in Eyerman and Jamison’s (1998) work on the relationship between music and social movements, particularly the Civil Rights Movement, the authors demonstrate how songs can provide a link to history, specifically the traditions of previous movements—such as the use of the song “We Shall Overcome” (originally a gospel song) in the Civil Rights Movements and protest over the Vietnam War. Overall, artists can use a variety of aesthetic styles and techniques that can resonate with potential constituents, not only encouraging them to participate in the movement but also keeping them engaged within the movement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160597612451243">
<title>Entertainment and Fun</title>
<p>In the social movement literature, there is little discussion about the ways art may provide entertainment, excitement, and leisure within a movement. As forms of protest have become institutionalized—perhaps, some might suggest ritualized, activists struggle not only to capture the interest of potential constituents but also to keep individuals engaged in the day-to-day realities of protest. In this way, art may provide an opportunity to make protest more dynamic and fun. Reed’s (2005) work on the Battle of Seattle provides striking evidence that the importance of performance in the forms of carnivals and costume balls make protest seem irresistible and desirable. Similarly, these performances allow for activists to express their goals, bind participants together, and create an emotional bond that extends to those outside of the movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451243">Eyerman 2006</xref>). More recently, there are scholars who write about the carnivalization of protest, as well as the inclusion of concepts such as play and spectacle to explain modern-day social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451243">Edelman 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451243">Juris 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160597612451243">Langman 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). These scholars assert that as neoliberal policies become hegemonic, play becomes tremendously important for movements expressing grievances against neoliberal policies. Against this backdrop, activists seek new tools to challenge these politics. “Questioning the accustomed lesser evil electoral politics, the boring rallies, the bursts of direct action, and frustrated tears of routine cycles of protest, a new cohort of political actors emerged with a new series of tactically silly approaches to organizing for social change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>). However, these scholars debate whether or not play and carnival leads to real social change, particularly given the likelihood that play can be easily misunderstood as only entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451243">Shepard 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the existing social movement literature on art has generally focused on one form of art within a movement, such as music in the Civil Rights Movement or poetry in the Women’s Movement; however, there has been a lack of discussion about the dynamic artistic environment of movements that utilize a multiplicity of forms within one single movement. This research uncovers the variety of art forms that were present in the UPR student movement of 2010, in order to more fully understand how activists can differentially employ various art forms. This article addresses the following two questions. One, what forms of art were present in the UPR student movement? Two, what impact do artistic objects and performances have on the movement, from the perspective of student activists and artists?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This research employs ethnographic site-specific field work to explore not only the presence of art in the UPR student movement but also the voices of the activists within the movement on the purpose and outcomes of the use of various forms of art in the movement. My data are comprised of 25 hours of observational data and 19 in-depth interviews. Although the UPR student movement occupied all 11 campuses of the university system, this article focuses solely on the Rio Piedras campus. I chose to focus solely on the Rio Piedras campus, as it is the main campus of the UPR system, as well as was the primary site of the 62-day occupation.</p>
<p>My observational data are based on observations of actual protest events that took place during the summer of 2010 in the student movement. Over the course of 6 weeks in the field, I was able to observe 10 separate demonstrations and marches that took place in a variety of locations—the University campus, the surrounding streets of the main Police Department in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a march that began at the UPR and ended near the Convention Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>My 19 in-depth interviews took place during the summers of 2010 and 2011 with a variety of individuals inside of the movement—such as student supporters, community supporters, artists, and student leaders. The interviews lasted from 1 to 4 hours, covering a wide variety of issues regarding the movement—including providing a history of the current movement. I employed purposive snowball sampling, as each new contact put me in touch with individuals for subsequent interviews. Given my outsider status, it was necessary to employ snowball sampling to be connected to individuals within the movement; however, I chose purposive sampling in order to ensure I was able to interviews various individuals within the movement, including artists, student and community supporters, and student leaders. In the interviews, activists were asked to recount the myriad of ways that art was used in the movement, as well as to provide some analysis to the outcomes of this presence. Generally, interviewees were asked to describe the artistic displays and performances they witnessed in order to provide a more in-depth exploration of the specific types of art that were present.</p>
<p>Utilizing an ethnographic approach was beneficial for this specific case, as I was able to conduct research on a social movement as it was unfolding based on the voices of the activists themselves. A majority of social movement research takes place long after the movement has ended, as well as relies upon secondary accounts or media reports to capture the voices of the activists. However, utilizing purposive snowball sampling produced a drawback in terms of having access to individuals in the movement who may have been less involved or supportive of the movement. In the future, it is my intention to continue to interview individuals in the movement who were peripherally involved, as I suspect they may have been involved “culturally” in the movement, but did not participate in the more “political” actions.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>During the 62-day occupation, student activists strategically utilized art. One of the goals, as stated by student leaders, was to incorporate as many different voices as possible, leading to a multiplicity of aesthetic forms as different individuals bring different talents to the creative tactical repertoire. In a manifesto distributed by the Humanities action committee prior to the 48-hour strike, students refer to the first occupation as “Ocup(arte).” The manifesto states, “Throughout the day, we will have performances, music, poetry, art, work-shops, and concerts. We will occupy against funding cuts, decrease of student rights, and a moratorium on tuition waivers.” In this movement documentation, activists demonstrate the intentional incorporation of artists and art making practices in the struggle.</p>
<p>In addition, collective art making took place organically within the occupation. Prior to the occupation, students organized by action committees based upon academic disciplines with a total of six committees—Humanities, Education, Social Sciences, Fine Arts, Natural Sciences, and the Law School. Since the university campus is surrounded by an iron gate with six entries, the students decided to assign each action committee to the area of campus located near their buildings on campus. As the occupation progressed, each camp took on distinct identities, which was reflected in their names, as well as the types of cultural activities in which they engaged. The Humanities camp became known as Camp Vietnam, given the activists’ preference for radical tactics and their physical location at the primary gate of the university. The Education camp became known as The Tribe, due to the fact that it was a tight-knit action committee with a strong female leader and many younger students. The Social Sciences were known as Camp Sparta as these activists were known as the “soldiers” of radical tactics. The Fine Arts were known as The Middle East, based on their geographical camp location. The Natural Sciences were named Camp Disney, based on their preference for tactics of civil disobedience, as well as the fact that many of the activists in the camp were young. Finally, the Law School was referred to as Camp Beverly Hills, due to their preference for nonviolent tactics, but also the fact that most of the activists came from a higher social class. Not only did the camps develop a distinctive cultural identity, they also created cultural calendars for each day. The cultural calendars allowed activists the opportunity to participate in various events, such as movie showings, workshops on art making, lectures by professors and union leaders, and information sessions about the university. In these workshops, individuals who may have never considered themselves artists were able to cultivate their abilities. In addition, a majority of the art present in the movement was created with a do-it-yourself approach, amplifying a participatory mode of cultural production.</p>
<p>In order to assess the myriad of ways that the movement utilized art, I’ve organized my findings in a way to provide broad insight into the way artists and activists utilized art within the movements. More specifically, I will present examples of the various forms of art that were present in the movement to provide the reader of tangible evidence before drawing analytical conclusions. In my discussions of the presence of these various forms of art, I also provide insight into the ways activists discussed the importance of this particular form. Overall, instead of relying upon one particular form of art to represent the movement, activists utilized a myriad of forms of artistic expression, both more traditional forms—such as political cartoons and protest songs—and newer, innovative forms—such as street theater.</p>
<sec id="section11-0160597612451243">
<title>Street Theater</title>
<p>During the occupation, there were several artist collectives and groups that regularly engaged in performances, both inside and outside the gates of the university—namely, the Unit of Clown Police, Papel Machete, and Sembrando Conciencia. While these three do not exhaust the full list of performances that took place over the 62 days, they provide insight into the various ways street theater was deployed within the movement.</p>
<p>The Unit of Clown Police, pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0160597612451243">Figure 1</xref>, was a secretive and random performance group that would intermittently arrive at the gates of the university, dressed in uniforms similar to that of the police, donning red clown noses and carrying water guns. A frequent performance by the group was when the Chief of Clown Police would scream out ridiculous and outrageous orders to the unit—and the unit would proceed to act out the orders. The purpose of the performance was to act out what many people in Puerto Rico—not just in the student movement had witnessed when a violent incident occurred between the people and the official police force—the contradiction of values and beliefs between the brute force utilized by the police and their justification of these actions. Often when the police force was criticized for their individual actions, they would recount with, “I was just following orders.” These performances, given their secretive performances, would quickly rally a large crowd to watch. Generally, the audience laughed at these performances, given the ridiculous orders that the unit would perform. However, the unit was capable of generating a reaction from the police during a specific performance—the performance involving the bowls of dog food that was recounted early in this article. During this performance, one police officer began to visibly cry in front of the performers, only to be removed by his superior and replaced by another officer. In this way, these performances not only caught the attention of the supporting spectators and students occupying the university but also the police force.</p>

</fig>
<p>Another group referred to as Papel Machete create “larger than life” paper-mache puppets, accompanied by a drum corps and protestors carrying signs with slogans. In one particular performance at a march in support of the UPR students, the large puppet—representative of the students—wears a shirt that reads, “La UPR no se vende,” which translates to “The UPR is not for sale.” Papel Machete makes use of multiple forms of art in their performances, incorporating visual art, sculpture, dance, and music. The sheer size and sound of the performance evokes an atmosphere of carnival and festival. During the course of the occupation, Papel Machete was featured in many articles about the student movement.</p>
<p>Finally, one group of artists referred to as Sembrando Conciencia (which translates as Spreading Awareness) consist of a small group of men and women who fully paint their mostly bare bodies with symbolic images and messages, as pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0160597612451243">Figure 2</xref>. They would move through the crowd using various modern dance moves without making a sound, while carrying more explicit messages on signs. For example, in one particular performance, the members painted their bodies to resemble trees, while carrying signs that state the words for reflection, dialogue, and analysis. Sembrando Conciencia was also often captured in media coverage of the movement, due to their colorful presentations and innovative form. There were a few times that Sembrando Conciencia generated powerful emotions in their audience, such as when they performed a mock funeral for public education. During the performance, the performers—still silent—grieved physically with their bodies; this provoked some audience members to also begin crying.</p>

</fig>
<p>Overall, activists felt that street theater was capable of encouraging potential constituents to become involved in the movement (what social movement scholars refer to as mobilization), as well as helped to keep individuals engaged in the movement, particularly given the long time period of the occupation. While the direct impact of whether or not street theater directly impacted mobilization and sustained engagement is impossible to measure, activists spoke about the mechanisms and the ways in which this particular art form could have impacted the movement.</p>
<p>One explanation provided was that street theater made the movement seem more dynamic and exciting, such as what was explored by Reed’s (2005) work on Battle of Seattle. An irresistible movement not only generates excitement and a desire to participate, it also increases media coverage by providing media savvy images that capture the attention of journalists and publishers who operate on a quick media cycle. These performances were not only dynamic based on their sheer size, like with Papel Machete, or colorful images, like with Sembrando Conciencia, they were also viewed as an innovative form that has not been previously utilized in student protests at the UPR. For example, a performance artist and professor at the UPR said, “This is virtually unheard of in Puerto Rican society—the young women in Sembrando Conciencia, the nude painted bodies. It is something very different, very new. All of that is essentially important for making a real lasting legacy of the strike.”</p>
<p>Given the duration of the occupation, many students spoke about the daily stresses of the occupation, ranging from the daily consideration of tactics and strategies to the exhaustion they felt from simply living on campus for 62 days. Not only were there daily pressures, the students also expressed, as mentioned earlier, how tensions erupted between different camps and student leaders. Utilizing a participatory democracy approach to decision making, the students at times felt frustrated when assemblies would last several hours. These tensions also emerged in the form of differences of opinion regarding appropriate tactics and strategies. Thus, these performances—particularly that of the Unit of Clown Police—were capable of easing tensions and producing emotion within activists and spectators. By making a joke out of serious violent confrontations between police and students, the Unit of Clown Police were able to lighten the tense mood surrounding the strike. Laughter is important when engaging in 24-hour activism, as activists become exhausted and need a release for their emotions. In this way, performance art acted as a release valve for the emotions of the activists, supporters, and even, the police force. One of my participants—and faculty member of the UPR and member of the Clown Police remarked,<disp-quote>
<p>The first day he (the originator of the group) did this, he was there standing by a policeman with a broom, sweeping and mimicking him. It was an estranged effect because the policeman didn’t know what to do and that was interesting because it broke the tension, it broke the harshness of the moment. And even people who would be sympathetic didn’t know what to do either. They didn’t know. Are they policemen? What are they? So, I found it quite interesting because it walked that fine line between fiction and reality.</p>

<title>Visual Arts: Political Cartoons, Flyers, Posters, and Murals</title>
<p>In addition to performances by artists and collectives, numerous flyers and political cartoons were created during the strike. While these cartoons and flyers were printed and posted on campus, they also proliferated on social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. One particular political cartoon pictures a young woman wearing a shirt that reads, “Huelga” (which translates to “Strike”), with one hand on the iconic tower of the university and her other hand holding a rat by its tail with the face of Governor Fortuño—the administration responsible for the austerity measures—with a dollar sign on his body. Across the top of the flyer, it reads, “The UPR is not for sale.”</p>
<p>Over the course of the 62-day occupation, students created hundreds of posters that were displayed throughout the campus, but most prominently they were hung on the iron gates surrounding the university facing the streets surrounding the university. Images and slogans were combined to make statements about the movement, as well as to specify specific grievances. For example, some posters contained the message, “Please excuse the mess, we are constructing a public university.” Others simply read, “No Law 7,” which was the specific piece of legislation impacting the budget cuts of the university and for public services island-wide.</p>
<p>In addition, students painted the walls and concrete benches of the university with murals. These murals generally featured any number of slogans that called for a critical dialogue with the administration, while also pointing to the importance of maintaining a public university for the people. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0160597612451243">Figure 3</xref>, a student in the Humanities is painting a bench by hand, as well as using a stencil to paint the word “<italic>Arte</italic>” (or Art) numerous times on the bench surrounded by various abstract symbols. Many of the painted benches were painted, as can be seen in this particular bench, not necessarily by formal artists, but any number of students expressing themselves. In addition to slogans, these murals often depicted images of the administration or student activists, painted in bright colors. For example, one bench was painted simply with the colors of the rainbow to depict the inclusion of the lesbian and gay community in the movement—which incidentally had not been a strong sector in previous strikes on the island. Additionally, murals were painted in almost all of the campsites, which were organized by academic colleges.</p>

</fig>
<p>Flyers and political cartoons were mostly used to disseminate information and slogans to a wide variety of people. Given their portability, particularly as computerized files, these artistic forms were able to spread information about the movement quickly to a large number of individuals. For example, the slogan, “constructing a public university” was a flyer posted around campus; however, it was also posted as Facebook status updates for the action committees and individual activists for a few weeks—until a new flyer was released. Similar to the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451243">Morrison and Isaac (2012</xref>) on political cartoons and Roscigno and Danaher’s (2004) work on the use of radio and music to communicate to distant rural populations, the flyers and political cartoons of the UPR strike were able to conduct this work in the strike, due to their portability and simple statements. Although these flyers and political cartoons have the capability to be quickly disseminated, they can also be quickly replaced.</p>
<p>Murals could also do the work of communicating information about the strike; however, due to their more permanent location, they mostly conveyed a sense of solidarity and fostered a collective identity. The murals on the walls and benches of the campus referenced specific campsites and action committees. The mechanism at work in these self-referential murals that produced solidarity was both the sense of claiming a space within the increasingly privatized university, as well as by working together to create a mural allowed the students to express a sense of price in their accomplishments during the occupation and their sense of wellness. Painting of the streets, benches, and walls of the university has become an important tradition for the students of the UPR, as it states a claim to the university belonging to the students, not the administration. This claiming of space has become a way that the students assert their presence and identity on the university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0160597612451243">
<title>Music and Radio</title>
<p>Protest songs were incorporated in every protest event accompanied by a group of percussionists. Even in smaller pickets where groups such as Papel Machete or Sembrando Conciencia were not present, protestors would march in a circle, singing and clapping. These songs are representative of traditional forms of protest, in that protest songs are based on a traditional form of music in Puerto Rico—the plena.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597612451243">3</xref>
</sup> Plenas are a narrative style of music, generally relying upon a call and response form. Given the narrative form, plenas lyrically tell a story, which makes them easily adaptable for protestors. For example, a song often used calls out, “Where is Fortuño? He is not home. Where is Fortuño? He is selling off what is left of the island.” This song has been used in earlier protests in the history of the island; however, protestors used the name of the governor at the time rather than Fortuño.</p>
<p>During the occupation, there were various musical performances that took place, not only within specific camps—such as collective jam sessions, but also large musical events that produced large numbers of attendance, such as the concert called <italic>Que Vivan Los Estudiantes</italic> (which loosely translates to The Students Live). This concert allowed many Puerto Rican celebrities to perform and was attended by many well-known Puerto Rican celebrities, such as Calle 13. During the event, a video was shown of international artists, such as Rene Perez from Calle 13, Juanes, and Ricky Martin, stating their support for the students.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160597612451243">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A particularly innovative form that took place during the occupation was a radio soap opera called <italic>Amor de Barricada</italic>, which translates to “Love of the Gates.” The plot of the soap opera was based on a love affair that takes place between students from two different campsites during the occupation. In the various episodes, the characters navigate ideological differences using humor. As depicted earlier in this article, during the occupation, each camp began to develop a distinct identity. These identities, mostly based on tactical preferences in the movement, were often in conflict with one another. For example, the Social Sciences (Camp Sparta) and Humanities (Camp Vietnam) camps were in opposition to the Natural Sciences (Camp Disney) and the Law School (Camp Beverly Hills). These led to heated debates over subsequent protest actions, as well as how to operate the occupation on a daily basis. In some ways, the debate between different camps allowed the students to fully practice participatory democracy; however, on the other hand, these debates produced some fragmentation within the movement.</p>
<p>The use of music and the radio soap opera were seen as providing entertainment, particularly given the mundane everyday life of an activist during an occupation. For example, in the case of the concert, <italic>Que Vivan Los Estudiantes,</italic> this event provided a source of entertainment for supporters of the movement. The inclusion of numerous celebrities and the act of celebration of the students provided a much-needed break from the daily tasks. These forms of entertainment were able to increase support and participation in the strike, as well as enhanced media coverage. In the (almost) daily protests, singing and clapping along to protest songs created enough noise to bring nearby individuals into the protest. As well, the concert was capable of generating a significant amount of media coverage, particularly given the inclusion of celebrities into the protest.</p>
<p>While these events may simply be seen as entertainment and leisure, they also are capable of generating solidarity and a form of collective effervescence, as large groups came together to display their support for the students, even if they were generally unable to participate in the occupation on a daily basis. However, these moments of spectacle and celebratory events encouraged others to become informed and involved in the events taking place during the strike. One of my participants, a professor at the UPR, spoke about the tradition of a carnival-esque atmosphere of political events on the island,<disp-quote>
<p>Most political and public events, if you don’t have music or food or drink, then it is not a good event. It follows that we have a high turn-out rate for elections, much higher than the U.S., about 60 to 70%. It has to do with this carnival-esque atmosphere. It’s the caravans, speeches, the music—a lot of entertainment. It is getting them away from their homes and participating in the public—with massive support. In this case (of the UPR), the atmosphere is part of the reason people do go out and participate.</p>
</disp-quote>As evidenced in early research on the use of play and carnival in protest demonstrates, activists increasingly find it necessary to create an irresistible protest environment in which to pique the interest of potential constituents who may find traditional forms of protest—such as voting and marching—to be tiresome and boring.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-0160597612451243">
<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>The art of the student movement of the UPR was capable of performing several roles; however, these roles varied given the specific artistic form. Overall, I discovered in my interviews that my participants spoke about the potential of art to provide entertainment, to create a spectacle, to release tensions and emotions, to disseminate information, represent group identity, maintain engagement during more mundane day-to-day activities, and tap into more traditional scripts that have become part of both the Puerto Rican and protest collective conscious.</p>
<p>By drawing comparisons among the various forms, I found that certain forms were utilized with the intention of producing mobilization, such as performance theater and visual and graphic arts; while other forms were thought of as being able to provide solidarity and collective identity among existing constituents, such as protest songs and the radio soap opera. It is necessary to recognize that certain art forms, given their characteristics, be more capable of achieving specific social movement outcomes. For example, murals are less capable of producing a sense of excitement that in turn, can increase participation in the movement. Similarly, the chanting of protest songs during pickets may work to produce a sense of solidarity with other activists; however, it is not necessarily as successful as generating wide mobilization of supporters, as performances such as the Unit of Clown Police or the musical concert.</p>
<p>A majority of existing social movement literature focuses specifically on one form of art represented in a movement; however, this research demonstrates that movements may utilize multiple forms of art for different purposes within the movement. Particularly in contemporary movements that seek to mobilize a broad population—such as the Battle of Seattle and the Occupy movement, activists need to perform numerous roles that speak to a diverse population.</p>
<p>In particular, for the activists engaged in the UPR student movement one of the goals was to incorporate as many different voices as possible, which led to a multiplicity of forms as different individuals bring different talents to the creative tactical repertoire. One student from the Law School confirmed the importance of including art in the strike, “Art was a very important part. It was more than important. It was one of the things that differentiated the strike from other strikes. It really made it unique.”</p>
<p>More importantly by incorporating several different artistic forms of protest, the movement is capable of generating a dynamic and exciting movement, which may draw individuals in to participate, given the sheer irresistibility of the movement. We find evidence of the importance of these dynamics in the handbook for the Direct Action Network, from the Battle of Seattle protests, as activists write about the use of culture within the movement,<disp-quote>
<p>Traditional demonstrations and protests, while essential, oftentimes alienate the general public, and are ignored by policy makers. Taking to the streets with giant puppet theater, dance, graffiti, art, music, poetry and the spontaneous eruption of joy breaks through the numbing isolation. . . We must strike to use all our skills in harmony to create an enduring symphony of resistance. The cacophony against capital will be deafening when nine days of large-scale theater preparations culminate in the largest festival of resistance the world has ever seen. We will make revolution <italic>irresistible</italic>. (my emphasis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451243">Reed 2005</xref>:255)</p>
</disp-quote>The use of art to produce what the Direct Action Network handbook refers to as a “festival of resistance” is not without tensions and complications. There is a gap in the social movement literature in regard to the use of art for excitement, fun, leisure, and entertainment in protest. During my interviews this past summer, many students of the UPR mentioned these tensions, particularly as they referenced the daily activities of the Chilean students on protest. For example, some suggested that the artistic performances meant that the government and others in the community would take the demands of the students less seriously.<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know, it’s entertaining and sometimes you need entertainment during the strikes, because it is very stressful and you need time to relax and learn . . . I was just reading the news in Chile, they are doing a lot of performance and I think that it takes the serious part from the movement and normal people that are not students see it as a joke. So you have to be careful. Every performance should have a purpose and even though it could be entertaining, people need to know that it is a serious topic . . . It should be entertaining, but it should always have a purpose and that purpose should be clear to all attendees. And it should stay clear that it is a serious matter.</p>
</disp-quote>Others suggested that these symbolic forms of protest are representative of “real” political engagement. For example, a student leader found that the distinctions between art and politics produced a false dichotomy, when he spoke about art.<disp-quote>
<p>But that’s political too. What we gained in the first movement . . . all of the drama, art, culture; it was center to our politics. It was an important thing; we were discussing it again this week in my study group, the work of art and culture in politics. It has substance too. You know, it’s important to build a relationship between those aspects because a human being is not just the political aspect or just the cultural aspect or just the academic aspect, we are complex human beings. We are all of that . . . I think it’s important, it’s part of the political process.</p>
</disp-quote>Given these tensions, subsequent research should take up not only more fully exploring how protest can produce feelings of joy within protestors but also what role these more symbolic and culturally rich artistic displays play in concepts of political engagement. This suggests that we need to rethink our conceptualizations and measurements of political engagement. In that forms of cultural engagement, such as producing a radio soap opera or performing street theater, may be just as important to political engagement, as voting or signing a petition.</p>

<p>Specific to the UPR are two university laws—one is the restriction of the police of Puerto Rico on campus and the other is a policy of nonconfrontation, which means that when students decide to strike or occupy the campus, the administration does not intervene and allows for the campus to be shut down.
