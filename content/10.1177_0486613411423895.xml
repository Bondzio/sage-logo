<abstract>
<p>This paper analyzes the nature of capitalism by critically employing Marx’s comments in <italic>Capital</italic> on forms of subsumption of labor. It argues that to the extent that property owners employ wage laborers to produce for the market for a profit, they are capitalist, even if they may not reinvest their profit in technology. In this situation, wage-labor is formally subsumed under capital. The transition from this stage to real subsumption of labor, which signifies capitalist development with technological change, is not, however, automatic, as Marx tended to assume. It is mediated by class struggle, which occurs in the context of geographically varying factors, such as state interventions. Uneven development, seen as the uneven transition to real subsumption, is partly a product of place-specific outcomes of class struggle. The paper thus emphasizes the relation between class struggle and dynamics of capitalism including technological change. The conceptual arguments are illustrated with empirical evidence from India. The implications of the arguments for radical development theory and politics are also briefly explored.</p>

<body>
<p>Commenting on the progressive nature of capitalism in the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>, Marx and Engels say, “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0486613411423895">Marx and Engels 1976</xref>: 487-88). When one observes the development of productive forces in large swathes of the less developed world, especially in rural areas, this comment seems a little odd. Consider the situation in India, for example, where 600 million people directly depend on agriculture. The nature of economic development in this country—at least in the countryside—does not appear to support Marx and Engels’s optimism. Here, in many areas, millions of direct producers still practice farming with rudimentary technology, including wooden ploughs or their improvised versions. Instruments of production have not been revolutionized (to the extent Marx might have expected).</p>
<p>This paper deals with some basic questions about the nature of the capitalist mode of production, both in general terms and with an eye towards less developed societies. How does one identify capitalism? When do capitalists invest capital to revolutionize instruments of production and increase labor productivity?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0486613411423895">1</xref></sup> And, what might be the relation between development<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0486613411423895">2</xref></sup>/technological change and class struggle?</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is divided into five sections. In the first section I briefly discuss, and critique, the way in which certain scholars conceptualize capitalism, including in agriculture, which has traditionally occupied a central place in discussions of capitalism (e.g. transition debates). In this section and in the next, I present an alternative framework for understanding capitalism. In doing so, I build on Marx’s often-neglected discussion in <italic>Capital</italic> on hybrid, formal, and real subsumptions of labor. I argue that capitalism can exist even if there is only formal subsumption. I then contend, in section 2, that the transition to real subsumption with associated technological change is not automatic, but is a protracted process, mediated by class struggle which occurs in the context of a whole host of factors, including capitalist state interventions. Uneven development—seen as uneven transition to real subsumption—is partly a product of the fact that the outcome of class struggle varies from place to place. In the next two sections (section 3 and 4), I present some empirical material including from my own fieldwork to illustrate the conceptual arguments about the relation between class struggle and the possibility of the transition to real subsumption. Thus, in section 3, I discuss how class struggle can prompt real subsumption, though not in any unilinear, straightforward way. In section 4, I show how property owners can respond to class struggle against formal subsumption by way of <italic>reinforcing</italic> formal subsumption and/or introducing hybrid subsumption (which includes mercantile-usury based exploitation). In the conclusion, I summarize the discussion and draw its theoretical (and political) implications.</p>
<sec id="section1-0486613411423895">
<title>1. How is Capitalism (to be) Conceptualized?</title>
<p>Capitalism as a production relation has been variously defined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0486613411423895">3</xref></sup> According to some, the existence of capitalist <italic>social relations</italic> necessarily coincides with expanded accumulation, i.e. capitalist development with technological change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423895">Brenner (1977)</xref> tends to have this view of capitalism. Intervening in a debate on the mode of production in the Indian context, Patnaik also held that capitalism is characterized jointly by three factors: production for the market, use of free wage labor, and reinvestment of profit in technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0486613411423895">Patnaik 1990b</xref>: 41-44, 1972: 22). In this view of capitalism, if technological change does not happen, it is because capitalist social relations do not exist (or do not exist fully). And capitalist social relations and capitalist development do not exist because semi-feudal relations act as a fetter: landowners may get their land cultivated by recruiting land-hungry peasants as tenants and make money merely in the form of rent from them; when landowners engage in direct cultivation by using hired labor, they may invest their profit from farm production in usury and other non-productive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0486613411423895">Patnaik 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0486613411423895">Bhaduri 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>In an alternative view, one that was held by Lenin (with respect to agriculture in the U.S. context in the early part of the 20th century), “the use of wage-labour is the chief distinguishing mark of every kind of capitalist agriculture.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0486613411423895">4</xref></sup> A few years after he made this remark, he reiterated this position thus: “Hired labour is the chief sign and indicator of capitalism in agriculture.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0486613411423895">5</xref></sup> A Montreal-based Marxist economist (Chattopadhyay), among others, holds the Leninist view when he says that commodity production, and wage-labor are necessary and sufficient conditions for capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0486613411423895">Chattopadhyay 1990</xref>: 82). Chattopadhyay—like Lenin—assumes that the <italic>production</italic> of surplus value <italic>necessarily</italic> generates its productive <italic>reinvestment</italic>: “The very process of commodity production with the sale of labor power as its ultimate form generates the process of surplus value and its reinvestment . . .” in technological change (ibid.). But from the standpoint of radical development theory, the question that remains unanswered is this: why may surplus produced in agriculture under capital-labor relations <italic>not</italic> be re-invested to promote technological change? The assumption of Chattopadhyay and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0486613411423895">Ram 1972</xref>) is a little problematic therefore; what is missing is a historical view of capitalism (and, by implication, a geographical view as well).</p>
<p>One solution to the problem surrounding the characterization of capitalism—which has implications for understanding capitalism’s evolution as well as anti-capitalist politics—could be achieved by correctly employing Marx’s concept of subsumption of labor under capital. Subsumption of labor is indicative of the extent to which and the forms in which labor is integrated into the process of production of value and surplus value (process of exploitation). This concept signifies the importance Marx attached to the moment of historical difference <italic>within</italic> capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0486613411423895">6</xref></sup> In the “Results” section of <italic>Capital</italic> vol. 1 (in the appendix), Marx says that capitalist production is historically differentiated into at least two forms/stages:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0486613411423895">7</xref></sup> the formal subsumption of labor under capital and the real subsumption of labor under capital. In chapter 16 of <italic>Capital</italic> vol. 1, he also introduces a third form of subsumption, which has remained more or less unnoticed.</p>
<p>In the initial stage of capitalism, wage-labor is only formally subsumed. There are four main features of formal subsumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 1,025-1,029). First, there is no extra-economic coercion in the sphere of production; that is, laborers, who do not own means of production, are generally <italic>free</italic> to choose their employers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0486613411423895">8</xref></sup> Second, no more labor time is used in production than is socially necessary; there is competition to reduce the cost of production of commodities for sale, suggesting that the law of value is operating. Third, an <italic>economic</italic> relation of supremacy and subordination exists at the point of production, as the worker is supervised by the capitalist. Fourth, the means of production and consumption are bought in the market and confront the worker as capital. Two points must be quickly noted. In Marx’s definition of formal subsumption, he is emphasizing capitalism as a relation of production, although his last point is more about exchange relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0486613411423895">9</xref></sup> Further, he stresses subsumption of <italic>wage</italic>-laborers: his view is not that petty commodity producers are formally subsumed under capital, one that is wrongly ascribed to him by some (e.g. Banaji), an issue to be discussed later.</p>
<p>In this initial stage of capitalism, which lasted in Britain for more than two centuries (i.e. until the last third of the 1700s), capital takes over a pre-existing labor process without “revolutionizing” it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 1,021). Thus, capital “subordinates labor on the basis of the technical conditions within which labor has been carried on up to that point in history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 425). Formal subsumption does <italic>not</italic> change (much) the socio-technical conditions of production. The necessary part of the labor-time (necessary labor)—the labor-time that the worker expends for producing her own means of subsistence—is not decreased through technological change, during the early stage of capitalism. So, the only way more surplus value can be produced is by increasing the other part of the labor-time (i.e. surplus labor-time). This is done by making workers work longer and/or intensifying the pace of work. In Marx’s language, absolute surplus value is produced in this first stage of capitalism. This form of surplus value is also produced by depressing wages below the value of labor power. Unfortunately, Marx does not emphasize this aspect as he assumes that wages cover labor’s cost of maintenance. In the context of less developed countries, this assumption is problematic.</p>
<p>Real subsumption is associated with what Marx, in his “Results” (and elsewhere in <italic>Capital</italic>), calls specifically capitalist mode of production. It has all the four characteristics of formal subsumption. In addition, it involves the reduction of necessary labor-time through the use of technology, reflected in an increase in the ratio of constant capital to variable capital; labor productivity increases as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 762). In this stage of capitalism, the appropriation of surplus value in its relative form dominates.</p>
<p>In addition to these two forms of subsumption, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx (1977</xref>: 645) also mentions “hybrid subsumption” which is highly relevant in the context of the present-day less developed world:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It will be sufficient if we merely refer to certain <italic>hybrid forms</italic>, in which although surplus-labor is not extorted by direct compulsion from the producer, the producer <italic>has not yet become formally subordinate</italic> to capital. In these forms, capital has not yet acquired a <italic>direct control of the labor process</italic>. Alongside the independent producers, who carry on their handicrafts or their agriculture in the inherited, traditional way, there steps the usurer or merchant, with his usurer’s capital or merchant’s capital, which feeds on them like a parasite. The predominance of this form of exploitation in a society excludes the capitalist mode of production [meaning that sporadic existence of these forms does not exclude capitalist mode of production]; although it may form the transition, as in later Middle Ages. (emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus in hybrid subsumption there is no pre-capitalist relation including feudalism, because there is no extra-economic coercion against direct producers who include petty commodity producers of farm or handicraft goods. At the same time, the production process is not directly controlled/supervised by capital. The money-lenders or merchants give direct producers advances (for the production process to occur as well as for the reproduction of family labor), and exploit them like parasites. The surplus is appropriated by what Marx calls “antediluvian forms” of capital, in chapter 5 of <italic>Capital</italic> vol. 1 and in chapter 36 of <italic>Capital</italic> vol. 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">1977</xref>: 266, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0486613411423895">1991</xref>: 728); these refer to merchants’ capital and usurers’ capital. They appear before the “primary form of capital,” i.e. capital in its productive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 266). It would also not be entirely inconsistent with Marx’s thinking to include money-owners buying up land and renting it out to small-scale direct producers, without exercising any extra-economic coercion, as another kind of parasite alongside usurious money-lenders and merchants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0486613411423895">10</xref></sup> Clearly, hybrid subsumption is <italic>not</italic> subsumption of wage labor. This is an intervening process between pre-capitalist relations and formal subsumption of labor under capital.</p>
<p>Thus, capitalism must be seen in terms of forms/stages of subsumption of labor. Formal subsumption and real subsumption of labor constitute what I will call “accumulation by exploitation,” in contrast to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0486613411423895">Harvey (2003</xref>: 147) calls “accumulation by dispossession.” <italic>Conceptually</italic>, to the extent that the production process has the four characteristics of Marx’s formal subsumption, production <italic>is</italic> dominantly capitalist, regardless of whether there is real subsumption, the second moment of accumulation by exploitation. In such a case, labor is formally subsumed under capital. One may consider the empirical case of India. The Indian constitution stipulates the right to choose one’s employer. In the context of agriculture in this country, the laboring class, most of which owns little or no means of production, works for employers for a wage. Their numbers are increasing relative to those who are considered cultivators, who include labor-hiring rich peasants and capitalist farmers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0486613411423895">Table 1</xref>). A large part of the work in agriculture is done by <italic>hired</italic> labor, although, and as expected, the share of hired labor to total human labor varies from place to place (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0486613411423895">Table 2</xref>). And in terms of investment in agriculture, it is dominantly a <italic>private</italic> affair: private agents make the investment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0486613411423895">Table 3</xref>). Purchased inputs comprise the majority part of the cost of production in most places. This means that if property owners hiring laborers are unable to cut costs they may go out of business. Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0486613411423895">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0486613411423895">3</xref> are consistent with the idea that means of production confront labor as capital, which is an important attribute of Marx’s formal subsumption. Agrarian capitalists and rich peasants – like their counterparts in cities – seek to increase their profits by prolonging the working-day and/or by buying/leasing more land which allows them to employ more workers. They also seek to increase profits by paying low (often below-subsistence) wages. All these methods of exploitation do not increase the relative surplus value. But these increase the mass of absolute surplus value. Less developed societies such as India have a vast reserve army of labor, a part of which has been created under colonialism, including through primitive accumulation and deindustrialization through cheap imports. These processes continue now under new imperialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0486613411423895">11</xref></sup> Much of this reserve army is in the form of what I will call “vulnerable laborers”: they are generally subjected to various forms of non-class oppression (e.g. gender and ethnicity), they tend to be not politically organized, and they work for less than the average wage and for long hours. Vulnerable laborers include migrants, tribals, women, and children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0486613411423895">12</xref></sup> Capital is able to appropriate absolute surplus value from laborers through lower wages and through overwork.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0486613411423895">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>2. Capitalist Mode of Production, Temporal Differentiation, and Class Struggle</title>
<p>Real subsumption is less likely to emerge as long as there is ample scope for the appropriation of absolute surplus value through formal subsumption (and hybrid subsumption), as long as there is no strong imperative on the part of property owners to resort to methods of relative surplus value. In other words, the transition to real subsumption, which points to the temporal differentiation within capitalism, will not occur spontaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0486613411423895">14</xref></sup> The “spontaneity argument” is, however, wrongly made by Marx himself at times. Marx says: “a specifically capitalist mode of production (his word for technologically advanced capitalism) . . . arises and develops <italic>spontaneously</italic> on the basis of the formal subsumption of labour under capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">1977</xref>: 645, italics added). This assumption contradicts his more general view about the role of class struggle in social change: social change within a mode of production (as in <italic>Capital—</italic>see below) and from one mode of production to another (as in the beginning of the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>).</p>
<p>There is much discussion on the role of class struggle in social theory and theory of capital, and especially as to where it belongs in the hierarchy of abstractions in this theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0486613411423895">15</xref></sup> It is surprising that most authors writing about the evolution of capitalist mode of production (including in the context of India/less developed countries) talk about the class relations aspect of the mode of production as if they can be separated from class struggle. But this is problematic, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0486613411423895">E. P. Thompson (1966</xref>: 9) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0486613411423895">Poulantzas (1968</xref>: 82), among others, remind us. And when class struggle is discussed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0486613411423895">Mencher 1974</xref>), its relation to capitalist accumulation is less likely to be dealt with.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0486613411423895">16</xref></sup> It is interesting that in the European transition debates also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0486613411423895">Hilton 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423895">Aston and Philipin 1987</xref>) there has been little, if any, explicit discussion on the forms of subsumption. The assumption, including that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423895">Brenner (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423895">1982</xref>), is that once there are capital-free labor relations in place of unfree relations characteristic of pre-capitalist modes of production, there will be advanced capitalism based on the dominance of the appropriation of relative surplus value. That Brenner had this problematic assumption could be partly because of his Euro-centrism; he had indeed relatively little to say about actual capitalist development in the periphery, as Booth points out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0486613411423895">1985</xref>: 77).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0486613411423895">17</xref></sup> But in my view, the transition from formal subsumption to a capitalist regime where the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423895">Brenner (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0486613411423895">1986</xref>) logic operates (the logic praised in the <italic>Manifesto</italic>)—the idea that capitalists make use of technology to improve labor productivity and sell products in a competitive manner—is not automatic, at least in less developed societies, and indeed it is the absence of the logic of real subsumption that contributes to the specificity of these societies as capitalist societies. It is class struggle that plays a crucial mediating role in the transition to real subsumption, the transition from an under-developed capitalism to a developed one.</p>
<p>But <italic>how</italic> does class struggle matter? Holloway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0486613411423895">1991</xref>) says that capital <italic>is</italic> class struggle: “The core of capitalism . . . is antagonistic, the daily repeated struggle by the dominant class to pump out surplus labor out of direct producers” (171). Yet, the attempt of the dominant class to exploit direct producers is subject to contestation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0486613411423895">Lebowitz (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0486613411423895">2005</xref>) writes, in its struggle for its own development, labor plays an extremely active agency in the actual reproduction of capitalism. The extent of capitalists’ success in pumping out surplus labor indeed depends on the degree of separation among workers, or its opposite, that is the intensity of their class struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0486613411423895">18</xref></sup> For example, the outcome of struggle <italic>against</italic> capitalism, i.e. the struggle against formal subsumption of labor under capital, influences how much surplus is appropriated and how (e.g. whether labor-displacing technology is used and thus whether the transition to real subsumption of labor occurs). In England, for example, successful resistance against long working hours during formal subsumption contributed to the introduction of machinery and conscious use of science. This prompted Marx to say in <italic>Capital</italic> that, “It would be possible to write a whole history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working class revolt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">1977</xref>: 563). In his more empirical discussion on European capitalism, he thus did see the transition to real subsumption in terms of class struggle.</p>
<p>It is indeed possible to extend Marx’s view. In imperialist countries, the transition to real subsumption, and the resultant dynamism associated with capitalism, were possible because: a) given the presence of capital-labor relations existing <italic>already</italic>, vast resources flowing from the colonies were converted into capital; <italic>and</italic> b) class struggle against capitalists just formally subsuming labor forced it to invest this capital in new technology that increased labor productivity. Thus class struggle is important not only to the transition <italic>to</italic> capitalism (as argued in the transition debate by Dobb, Brenner, etc.). It is also important to the transition <italic>within</italic> capitalism. Of course, <italic>how</italic> important it is in a specific context is another matter. Class struggle occurs amidst specific factors. These contextual factors influence the actual effect of class struggle, and therefore contribute to uneven development because of geographical variation in their existence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0486613411423895">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first of these factors is the availability of a given technology—either mechanical or biological or both—that can be used to increase labor productivity. Second, and with respect to agriculture, in spite of the availability of, for example, the greenhouse farming technology, ecological conditions are particularly important, given the nature-dependent nature of agricultural production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0486613411423895">20</xref></sup> For example, the fertilizer-HYV technology can only be used where there are favorable natural conditions (e.g. controlled water and proper soil and temperature conditions) subject to modification by human labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0486613411423895">21</xref></sup> The fact that these natural conditions do not exist everywhere contributes to uneven development. The geographer Neil Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0486613411423895">1990</xref>: xiv) says, “Uneven development is the concrete process and pattern of the production of nature under capitalism.” This also has implications for class struggle. Favorable natural conditions—like technology—contribute to the production of a larger amount of a commodity per unit of labor time and indeed make possible a larger amount of surplus product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0486613411423895">Marx 1977</xref>: 130, 648).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0486613411423895">22</xref></sup> This creates the possibility for class struggle over the “distribution” of the total value produced between owners and laborers. Third, unless there is a substantial amount of concentration of means of production, that is, unless there are a few owners with large landholdings, expanded accumulation by private owners may be inhibited, <italic>even if</italic> wage-labor relations dominate. Class struggle against employers over wages and working conditions may not be particularly intense because of the absence of strong economic-cultural differences between laborers on the one hand and capitalists operating relatively small holdings (or businesses) on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0486613411423895">23</xref></sup> Fourth, given the division of labor, one sector or sub-sector can have a tight labor market in response to demand for its products from another sector or sub-sector. For example, the development of non-agricultural economic activities—which expand the market for farm goods and which increase demand for labor in specific locations—can enhance labor’s bargaining power resulting in higher wages, to which capital can respond by introducing technology, with the real subsumption of labor as a possibility. Finally, there is the capitalist state intervention. Government assistance including subsidized food and employment generation on public projects—which partly reflects (potential and/or actual) working class and poor peasant struggle—have specific impacts on labor. The labor market is tightened. A part of the reproduction of labor power is covered through social wages. All this may enhance the bargaining power of labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0486613411423895">24</xref></sup> As well, welfare programs for workers and poor peasantry create an internal market for capital. And by manipulating relative prices, the state can make the terms of trade between agriculture and industry<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0486613411423895">25</xref></sup> favorable to capitalist farmers. This can augment the amount of capital in their hands and may make technology affordable as a means of increasing surplus value. It should be noted that all these contextual factors which have an impact on class struggle are connected, directly or indirectly, to the overall <italic>capitalist</italic> development of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0486613411423895">26</xref></sup> The latter, in turn, defines the context for capital-labor struggle which affects the possibility of the transition to real subsumption, albeit differently in different areas, contributing to uneven development under capitalism.</p>
<p>Now, where labor struggles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0486613411423895">27</xref></sup> achieve some success (e.g. a rise in wages, shorter hours, laborers being able to more freely choose their employers), capital formally subsuming labor may show several types of response. Of these, three are important. As mentioned above, capitalists may use technology to discipline labor, raise labor productivity, and increase surplus value. The real subsumption of labor—capitalist development with a technological change—is the result. In a non-linear historical view of capitalism, there are at least two other possibilities in situations where the balance of power is not particularly in favor of labor: capitalists may continue to use hired labor but appropriate surplus value by various non-technological means thus reinforcing the system of formal subsumption. Or, they may resort to “hybrid subsumption,” which is not capitalist in its labor process. It is not difficult to see that the nature of subsumption of labor—the nature of class relations under capitalism—holds a key to the understanding of why the Third World, for example, remains economically underdeveloped in spite of being capitalist. More specifically, the Third World remains backward because property owners formally subsume wage labor and do not generally have to resort to real subsumption of labor, and this is the case because of the difficulty of launching class struggle against formal subsumption, given a massive reserve army (among other factors), which has been accumulating since colonial times and is expanding now.</p>
<p>It should be clear that the approach to subsumption taken in this paper differs from that of other scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0486613411423895">Banaji (1977a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423895">1977b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0486613411423895">Mundle (1979)</xref>. Banaji talks about formal subsumption in his theoretical work and in his historical discussion of the peasantry. While my approach emphasizes subsumption of <italic>wage</italic>-labor under capital, Banaji’s interest is in “[t]he [coercive] subjugation of the <italic>simple commodity form of production</italic> to capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0486613411423895">1977a</xref>: 33, 36; emphasis added). According to him, the labor of small producers, including sharecroppers in South India in the 19th century, can be seen as formally subsumed under capital. This is so, he argues, because “[t]he relations of production which tie the enterprise of small commodity producers to capital are already relations of capitalist production” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0486613411423895">1977a</xref>: 34). Banaji insists that “[b]ehind the superficial ‘surface’ sale of products, peasants under this form of domination sell their labour-power” (ibid.) to “the monied bourgeoisie of moneylenders and merchants through whom the small producer was brought into relation with the market” (ibid.: 35-36) by way of the latter receiving advances necessary for carrying out the production process. The “price” which small producers receive signifies a relation, not of exchange, but of production; it is “a concealed wage” (ibid.). So they are “disguised laborers,” according to Banaji. In one place, Banaji admits that what he describes is in fact “pre-formal” subsumption. The latter, he says, “would tend <italic>to lead</italic> in the vast majority of cases to the system of formal subordination” (italics added). He (wrongly) says that, for Marx, “pre-formal” subsumption can be “assimilated” into formal subsumption, and that is how he (Banaji) treats the matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0486613411423895">1977b</xref>: 1,376).</p>
<p>In my reading of Marx, Banaji’s characterization describes not <italic>formal subsumption</italic> of labor but what can, at best, be called hybrid subsumption. The latter concept Marx clearly sets out in the main text of <italic>Capital</italic> (and not in the appendix, which has particularly influenced Banaji’s discussion). The concepts of formal and real subsumption apply to <italic>wage</italic>-labor, <italic>not</italic> to petty commodity-producing labor. Besides, the transition to real subsumption, for me, is a protracted process, mediated by <italic>class struggle</italic>. This is not an essential part of Banaji’s thinking. As well, neither he nor others, such as the geographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0486613411423895">Watts (1992)</xref>, who occasionally use the subsumption perspective, explore its implication for understanding uneven development. As far as Mundle (1977) is concerned, he talks about bonded laborers being formally subsumed. This paper takes the position that Marx’s formal subsumption applies to free laborers. This is the <italic>general</italic> tendency under capitalism, although in <italic>specific places and times</italic> capital freely uses unfree labor to increase surplus value; indeed its use of unfree labor is a means of class struggle by capital against labor (more on this below).</p>

<title>3. Class Struggle and Transition to Real Subsumption in Rural India</title>
<p>Thus far the argument of the paper has been this: that capitalism must be seen as historically differentiated into various forms/stages of subsumption of wage-labor, that capitalism exists even where there is only formal subsumption of labor, that the transition to real subsumption and associated technological change is not automatic or spontaneous, and that this transition is mediated by the balance of power between capital and labor, the balance of power which is influenced by a whole set of geographically changing contextual factors. In this and the next section, it is the last point, the one about class struggle and the transition from formal subsumption, that will be <italic>illustrated</italic> with some empirical material; the paper does not attempt a thorough empirical study of the issues at hand. Using findings from the existing research by various scholars, this section deals with the transition to real subsumption of labor. Using my own on-going work on agrarian transitions in the eastern Indian province of Orissa, section four discusses capital’s other two responses (where the transition is less likely to happen).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0486613411423895">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their geographically uneven struggle against capital, rural laborers have succeeded in at least three areas with varying success. They have obtained an increase in wages and achieved a reduction in the working day (with a given wage). And they have emancipated themselves from unfree labor relations. Unfree relations exist where laborers’ right to freely enter into, and exit from, a labor contract does not exist and where labor has lost the right to directly negotiate working-day wages with capital. This happens because of various forms of bondage (e.g. debt-bondage) imposed by capitalists as a localized form of class struggle from above in order to continue to formally subsume labor and increase surplus value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0486613411423895">Brass 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0486613411423895">Bhandari 2008</xref>). Consider Andhra Pradesh (in South India). In many of its villages, studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423895">da Corta and Venkateshwarlu (1999)</xref>, labor struggle has led to a decline in traditional/permanent bonded labor relations and to increases in real wages for men and women. Even if no overt collective action exists or if the overt collective action fails, the implicit “go-slow” by laborers at lower than reservation wage may still make some employers raise wages, as in several villages in Uttar Pradesh (in North India) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0486613411423895">Srivastava 1999</xref>). Non-agricultural wages also put pressure on landowners to pay higher wages, either through strike actions or simply to be able to attract sufficient laborers, who are free to reject any request from employer for work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0486613411423895">Lerche 1999</xref>: 205). For example, in a village studied by Lerche in Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, daily wage has had to be increased from 1 kg. of wheat in the late 1970s; to 2.5 kgs. in the late 1980s; and to 3, 4, and 5 kgs. by 1993 (ibid.: 193). Also in villages in Uttar Pradesh, pro-poor government programs including land redistribution,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0486613411423895">29</xref></sup> however limited they may be, have put some assets in the hands of laboring families. This has caused an upward pressure on the supply price of labor power, and has contributed to an increase in laborers’ bargaining power. The wage offered at government employment generation programs is higher than the prevailing wage rate in many areas. This has fuelled laborers’ expectation of a better wage from landowners and encouraged them to bargain for this.</p>
<p>As wages increase due to a balance of power in favor of laborers caused by their struggle and other factors, in many villages in Andhra Pradesh (as in Uttar Pradesh, and elsewhere), farmers resort to labor-displacing mechanization to maintain or enhance the level of surplus value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423895">da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999</xref>: 91). This process is a complicated one. For, in some places and at given points in time, if laborers are strongly organized, capital’s initial attempt to use technology (and thus the transition to real subsumption of labor) can be resisted/slowed. The rice region of Kerala illustrates this process rather well.</p>
<p>Located on the southwestern coast of the country, Kerala is known for the first “communist” government elected within a liberal-democratic system anywhere in the world. Here laborers are traditionally more strongly organized than in most other parts of India. The transition to real subsumption appears to have passed through four stages. First, laborers strike for (or bargain for) higher wages. Second, following their success, capital tries to use mechanization to reduce its dependence on labor. Laborers then fight against mechanization, thus slowing down the transition to real subsumption. Finally, labor’s resistance to capital’s introduction of technology softens.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and the 1970s, rice fields owned by capitalist farmers were the hotbed of agrarian class tension in Kerala.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0486613411423895">30</xref></sup> Supported by multiple unions, including those organized by communist parties, laborers launched political action demanding higher wages and better working conditions including an eight-hour day. Agrarian capitalists responded by retrenching workers, many of whom had worked for them on a long-term basis. They resorted to casualization of employment. They used tractors to reduce their dependence on laborers. Workers often reacted by forcibly harvesting rice. They were supported by the pro-labor governments in power which refused to intervene on behalf of capital in labor disputes. In Kuttanad area (in Allepey district), the rice bowl of Kerala, laborers even broke up some tractors. This was reminiscent of the Luddite movement Marx talks about in <italic>Capital</italic>. Unions themselves would send in a large number of laborers to farms to complete the harvest in a few hours. Farm owners gradually lost control over the process of recruiting laborers.</p>
<p>Because rice cultivation was profitable in the 1970s, farmers persisted in their attempt to introduce tractors in order to increase labor productivity. Unions did not relent either. Ultimately, landowners agreed to pay wages to the traditional ploughmen for ploughing the fields. In return, the unions agreed to let the farmers use tractors. This meant that farmers were free to use the tractors for ploughing after paying wages to the ploughmen. So the ploughmen would come and plough the field, take their wage and go away. Farmers would then prepare the land with tractors in whatever way they wanted. Over time, ploughing by ploughmen became a ritual. Gradually they stopped ploughing, but yet they would come and collect their wages. Writing about the situation, Oommen (1990: 234) says: “When the rich farmers in Allepey district introduced tractors, the labor unions . . . successfully led their struggle against it so that the farmers had to agree that whether or not they used tractors, the land should be ploughed through bullocks/buffaloes at least for two rounds instead of the traditional three rounds in order that laborers did not face further unemployment or suffer loss of wages.”</p>
<p>With the decline in the rice price after the 1970s, farmers complained about the system, because they were paying more than their counterparts in other parts of the country. They responded by reducing employment in rice cultivation. They also replaced rice with less labor-intensive crops. This meant the loss of employment for labor. In the late 1980s and afterwards, a new situation arose: labor shortage. On the one hand, with the expansion of the non-agricultural economy, especially the service sector, partly due to the flow of remittance money from the Middle East, younger people would prefer to work outside of agriculture. On the other hand, through years of struggle, laborers had earned a high social wage in the form of “poor relief” from the government (see Heller 1989): the social wage was almost equal to the consumption requirement of one adult in a family. This meant that unemployed people could wait for suitable employment without starving. Both these factors caused a labor shortage which had a positive impact on laborers’ bargaining power. Farm owners used mechanization as a counter-response. This time unions did not protest. But they did stick to their earlier strategy of demanding payment of wages to the same number of workers at the prevailing rate when machines were to be introduced. This actually meant the payment of double wages to an operation. This did put a brake on introducing mechanization in post-harvest operations. As Oommen (1990: 234) says, in Kerala “mobilization of the agrarian proletariat is moderating, if not halting, capitalist development in Indian agriculture.” But eventually, the introduction of tractors and other machines came to be widely accepted.</p>
<p>Struggle against formal subsumption does tend to prompt a transition to real subsumption. But how quick the transition is, and in what form it happens, depend on the intensity and form of class struggle, which is influenced by specific contextual factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0486613411423895">31</xref></sup> The transition to real subsumption may be slowed down where laborers’ organization has reached a sufficiently high level and where there are other favorable factors including a certain degree of state support for labor locally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0486613411423895">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>4. Class Struggle and the “Blocked” Transition to Real Subsumption in Rural India</title>
<p>In less developed social formations such as India’s, the dominant responses of capitalists to resistance against formal subsumption may be those which are other than real subsumption, resulting in a capitalism that is not quite progressive, a capitalism that can remain relatively backward for long.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0486613411423895">33</xref></sup> The first of these responses is just “business as usual”: reinforcement of formal subsumption (use of new forms of formal subsumption). The second type of response is Marx’s “hybrid subsumption” (mercantile/usury-based exploitation and rental extraction), and this is the case in specific localities/regions such as those in eastern India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0486613411423895">34</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-0486613411423895">
<title>4.1 Reinforcement of Formal Subsumption</title>
<p>Capital may resort to what can be called a “gender fix” in response to class struggle. The class struggle from below by men over low wages, long working days, and unfree labor relations provokes agrarian capital to intensify/reinforce formal subsumption by increasing the use of female labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0486613411423895">35</xref></sup> In order to support their families, women are forced to accept lower wages and relatively unfree labor contracts (more on this below), which their husbands refuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423895">da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0486613411423895">36</xref></sup> This happened in many villages in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>In other areas, capital may resort to a “spatial fix” in response to class struggle: when local laborers go on strike, it may use laborers from outside the locality ready to work with lower wages and less satisfactory working conditions that local laborers reject. Breman reports that this happened in Gujarat on the west coast of India where landowners “imported” docile migrant tribal laborers in order to undermine the bargaining power of local laborers demanding higher wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0486613411423895">Breman 1985</xref>). In fact, the use of extra-local labor is a geographically wider process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0486613411423895">37</xref></sup> To the extent that landowners can use the spatial differentiation in wages and in laborers’ solidarity, this is a barrier to the transition to real subsumption, although the strategy may benefit specific capitalists who are involved in formal subsumption locally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0486613411423895">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>A most important response in this category—reinforcement of formal subsumption—is the tied labor use. Although Marx stipulated free labor as a necessary characteristic of capitalism, the history of actual capitalist societies does indicate that specific capitals do make use of various forms of unfree labor. Now, in response to class struggle for higher wages and against permanent bonded relations (permanent laborers work for given landowners almost throughout their lives), landowning capital uses non-permanent attached labor arrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0486613411423895">39</xref></sup> Under these arrangements, laborers who have an unsettled high-interest loan are obliged to report to the lender’s farm <italic>first</italic> before other employers; they work off the loan based on a pre-arranged tied wage. Capitalists resort to these arrangements to secure labor supply, especially during peak seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0486613411423895">Bhalla 1999</xref>: 50) and to secure it at lower than the market rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423895">da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999</xref>: 92). The use of attached labor relations must also be seen as a mechanism of labor control, a form of class struggle from above (113), and it does not at all automatically suggest feudal relations. More specifically, it segments the labor market into two parts: permanent laborers who tend to possess land, and casual/daily laborers who tend to be landless and who belong to the lowest positions in the caste hierarchy (ex-untouchables) which contributes to their vulnerability to labor control. This segmentation undermines the solidarity of rural laborers as a class. The use of attached labor also reduces the bargaining power of casual laborers because casual labor days are reduced (Lerche 1990: 199). As more work is done by attached laborers, there is less demand for casual labor, thus reducing casual laborers’ wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0486613411423895">Bhalla 1999</xref>: 50).</p>

<title>4.2 (Reversion to) Hybrid Subsumption</title>
<p>In some villages in Andhra, as real wages rise, landowners respond partly by moving into commission trading: buying up farm produce at harvest, and reselling it at higher prices to urban merchants. Sometimes merchants advance cash loans to small land-holders, and/or lease out some land, and borrowers promise to pay in kind at harvest at a price determined by the lender. This is called tied harvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423895">da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999</xref>: 88). Thus, in other words, as wage costs rise, landowners seek to appropriate surplus through exchange relations rather than directly through production relations based on hiring in of labor (89). Elsewhere, as in many Uttar Pradesh villages, when wages increase, labor-intensive non-mechanized paddy cultivation is leased out for a rent; the lessee does not provide any means of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0486613411423895">Srivastava 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0486613411423895">Lerche 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0486613411423895">40</xref></sup> This is a form of hybrid subsumption.</p>
<p>Hybrid subsumption, as a response of owners to class struggle, can be widely observed in Orissa, one of the under-developed states. I studied two villages located in Jajpur district (less than 400 kms. south of Calcutta) in 1988, and have returned to the area since. The situation existing up until the late 1980s will be discussed first. Then more recent changes will be explained.</p>
<p>The area has fertile soils. But it is completely dependent on the monsoon. The public irrigation infrastructure has collapsed. Landowners are small owners. The average size of operational holdings (owned land, plus land leased in, minus land leased out) was less than three acres in the late 1980s [the all India figure for the average area operated per holding was 3.31 acres in 1991-92 and 2.62 acres in 2002-03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0486613411423895">Government of India 2007</xref>)]. There were half a dozen landowners, among a sample of 70 families, with 10 acres and more of land. Instruments of production were very rudimentary: bullocks were being used as draught animals; wooden ploughs, wooden yokes, and iron sickles were the main instruments of production. Laborers, who belong to lower castes, were mainly of two types. There were those who worked on daily wages, and others were attached laborers on annual contracts who came from ex-untouchable castes. They received wages on a daily/monthly basis in cash and/or in kind (paddy). Employers would also give them a piece of land to cultivate, the product of which the laborer kept. The attached laborers did not have any fixed working day; they worked as long as they were required to work by their employer. Apart from performing farm work, they also performed some household chores. Being an attached labor carried low social status.</p>
<p>Employers were formally subordinating labor. They did not invest in machines to reduce necessary labor time. Rather, the surplus, which was produced on the basis of the methods of formal subsumption of labor (long working day, low wages), found its way into many non-farming (and non-productive) avenues. One was usury. Usury was very attractive, the annual rate of interest being 36 percent to as high as 60-120 percent. Some landowners also invested a part of the surplus in local politics (e.g. election campaigning): being a part of local state apparatuses helped one to obtain government loans. Becoming a local politician was also a source of bribes from the semi-literate/illiterate poor laborers and peasants, many of whom were women, in return for official favors (e.g. public employment, old-age pensions, subsidized loans). Many invested in their children’s education. This could fetch money in the future in the form of urban remittances and in the form of dowry for male educated children with good jobs. Going into mercantile business also helped many landowner-traders to exercise some control over the supply of laborers. The two biggest landowners in the area were shopkeepers, who used their retail business to secure labor supply. Getting farmwork done at the right time was crucial to productivity, especially when farming depended entirely on rainwater. The laborer, usually very poor, could obtain means of subsistence such as rice on credit from the landowner-shopkeepers, and this obliged him/her to work for the landowner when he/she wanted, and in a relatively “disciplined” manner. Investing the farm-generated surplus in retail business also allowed the landowner-shopkeepers to sell their commodities to “captive” customers: i.e. to laborers whom they usually hired and over whose earnings they consequently had some control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0486613411423895">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>All this suggests that productive capital as well as commodity capital and money capital are interlocked, and generally without the mediation of extra-economic relations. The landowners in the area, like landowners elsewhere, are involved in a cycle of expanded reproduction to some extent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0486613411423895">42</xref></sup> though this may not show up in the investment in productivity-raising techniques <italic>within</italic> the farm sector. This also means that, as Gunder Frank and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0486613411423895">Brass (1995</xref>: 96) have noted, surplus does not have to be reinvested in the <italic>individual</italic> farm generating it or even locally for there to be a capitalist mode of production. More generally, farmers employing legally free wage labor but <italic>not</italic> investing in productivity-raising techniques <italic>in</italic> agriculture <italic>are</italic> capitalists, just as those employing free wage labor and making such investments in productivity-enhancing technologies.</p>
<p>Agrarian class relations have not been static, but have evolved through three stages in the study area. This is an area where wage strikes occurred frequently between the 1970s and mid-l980s. In a context of the tightening of the labor market owing to the availability of employment on government projects and the possibility of migration to urban areas for employment, strikes have contributed to an increase in wages (although wages are still low relative to workers’ needs). Nominal wages (in rupees) for adult males for farmwork increased from 2.5 in 1974 to 25 in 1992 and to 40 in 1995. In 2008-09, it was rupees 60-70 (which would fetch 4-5 kilos of rice in the local market).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0486613411423895">43</xref></sup> “Real wages”—as measured by the amount of paddy that can be bought at these nominal wages—increased by 200 percent between the 1970s and the 1990s. The working day has also shrunk by at least two hours relative to the earlier period (i.e. prior to the 1970s). Earlier laborers used to work from 6 am until noon and from 4 pm to 6 pm or so. Now there is only one shift of approximately 6 hours. The attached labor arrangement, which was profitable for landowners, has <italic>completely</italic> disappeared as low-caste laborers did not like being on call for twenty-four hours at low annual wages for high-caste landowners. Laborers have also become much less “docile” and much less “disciplined” from the landowners’ standpoint. From the (low-caste) laborers’ standpoint, the balance of power (both class-wise and caste-wise)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0486613411423895">44</xref></sup> has shifted a little in favor of them. Landowners complain that unless laborers are supervised directly, the work assigned may not get done. Given the resistance (most of which was not organized and formal) against caste-based oppressive practices, the use of caste as a mechanism of labor control is not possible to the extent it was earlier. This creates a problem, especially for upper-caste landowners who will not work on their land themselves. As a result of these changes, however limited they may be from the laborers’ standpoint, landowners who were earlier hiring low-caste wage-laborers to cultivate their land started renting out their land and often to these same laborers, who consequently became partially peasantized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0486613411423895">45</xref></sup> The method of surplus appropriation changed from formal subsumption of labor to what can be called hybrid subsumption. This has been happening in the last 15-20 years or so, and constitutes the second stage in the evolution of agrarian relations in the area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0486613411423895">46</xref></sup> The possibility of exploiting the poor peasants enables the local landowners to transfer the negative impact of wage-strikes (e.g. higher wages) to them. The <italic>form</italic> of class struggle from below was important: if the strikes were organized jointly by immediate producers—by poor peasants (i.e. tenants) for lower rents <italic>and</italic> by laborers for higher wages—landowners would not have been able to rent out land at high rent. This did not happen. For one thing, there was an intra-class conflict: as more land was leased out to tenants, there was less wage-work on employers’ farms for daily laborers. For another, the local communist organization—many members of which were themselves labor employers—was unable to forge solidarity within the class of direct producers (as tenants and as laborers). Because of the high level of rent and interest, direct producers have limited resources to invest in land; they also have less incentive to do so as they do not own the land. In the absence of countervailing processes (e.g. cooperatives), productivity has suffered. I have heard many landowners who were hiring labor earlier and have rented out their land now complaining about this.</p>
<p>Currently, and this is the beginning of the third stage, some landowners are a bit alarmed at the fact that not far from their villages poor peasants are getting organized to demand a higher crop-share (presently, tenants pay half of the gross produce to landowners). Some tenants are even leaving the landowners’ share of the crop on the sharecropped land itself instead of harvesting the entire crop and delivering to landowners their share, which was the practice earlier. It remains to be seen what the response of landowners will be to the emerging resistance of tenants to the high level of rental extraction. It can be argued that short of more radical changes in property relations (e.g. via radical land reforms), the development of productive forces will be furthered if, in response to an increase in both wages and in the crop-share demanded by tenants, landowners individually and/or collectively make productivity-raising investments which would allow them to appropriate relative surplus value. In the last few years, a new development has happened in this direction. There has been an increase in the use of tractors and power tillers. Tractors are bought by large owners, many of whom tend to belong to middle castes for whom performing labor on the land is not a taboo. They use tractors on their own land cultivated with hired labor. They also lease out tractors to poor peasants who have leased in land from higher caste landowners. Poor tenants use tractors to plough their own land and the land leased-in.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0486613411423895">47</xref></sup> They do this because of the structure of exploitation they are inserted into: they must produce “efficiently” to be able to pay the rent (and interest). But given the level of exploitation of poor peasants with limited access to land, their use of machines will be limited. It remains to be seen how far the incipient transition to real subsumption of labor—the (middle caste) landowners using tractors and power tillers, prompted by the local wage increase—develops.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>Building on Marx’s discussion about forms of subsumption of labor under capital, the paper makes the conceptual argument that to the extent that Marx’s four conditions for formal subsumption exist, capitalist social relations exist, even if productivity-increasing technological change is absent; whether property-owners formally subsuming labor will also resort to technological change crucially depends on the balance of power between them and labor. The paper has also critiqued in tandem the view of many radicals who, subscribing to a restrictive view of capitalism, doubt that agriculture in India (and by implication, agriculture in many other similar ex-colonial Third World social formations) is capitalist enough. The development of capitalist relations in such countries as India is much more widespread than is implied by the restrictive concept of capitalism. In India, necessary conditions for capitalism exist, which are empirically verifiable. These include: commodity production; commodification of land and other means of production confronting labor as capital; and, a class of numerically expanding and legally “free” laborers, forced to work for a wage because they do not own sufficient means of production. Agricultural production is dominantly capitalist, at least in the sense of formal subsumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0486613411423895">48</xref></sup> Formal subsumption coexists not only with real subsumption of labor under capital, but also hybrid subsumption, which is not capitalist.</p>
<p>The paper argues that property owners respond to class struggle against formal subsumption in three ways, representing three methods of appropriating surplus. In other words, class struggle impacts the extent to which surplus value will be appropriated through: a) the use of technology aimed at increasing labor productivity (meaning that the transition to real subsumption has occurred); b) the use of various forms of tied or unfree labor as well as free labor made to work long hours for very low wages, thus reinforcing the system of formal subsumption; or c) landowners resorting to hybrid subsumption. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0486613411423895">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Where laborers are better organized, and in the presence of other favorable factors (state’s pro-poor interventions working, ensuring a good social wage), wages have risen, and the working day has gotten shorter (as in Kerala). Landowners respond by making use of available mechanical technology. In other words, the transition to real subsumption becomes likely. Yet, this process is a non-linear and complicated one. The more frequently observed response of capitalists to resistance against formal subsumption may be, however, those which are <italic>other than</italic> real subsumption. They may respond to class struggle by using new forms of formal subsumption as methods of appropriating surplus, resulting in a backward capitalism. For example, when local laborers go on strike (in a situation where factors conducive to their success may not exist), capitalists may use migrant laborers or local female laborers for low wages or resort to tied labor use (making indebted laborers work for low wages for long hours) to appropriate surplus value. In such a situation, property owners do <italic>not</italic> resort to mechanization to displace and discipline labor. This happens in many villages in Gujarat and in Haryana, for example. Another type of response is “hybrid subsumption” (mercantile/usury-based exploitation as well as exploitation based on rental payment), as widely observed in less developed areas such as Orissa. Here in response to a balance of power in favor of labor, landowners, who were earlier formally subsuming laborers on annual contracts as well as daily laborers, resorted to large-scale casualization: permanent workers became casuals. This situation gradually changed to one where many landowners started renting out their land, often to those who were earlier working as casuals or on permanent contracts, contributing to their partial peasantization. There was nothing necessary about this kind of “reversion” from formal to hybrid subsumption: if the strikes were organized jointly by poor peasants for lower rents <italic>and</italic> by laborers for higher wages, landowners would not have been able to rent out land at high rent to poor peasants/laborers who also continued to be exploited in mercantile and usurious modes. This did not happen. To the extent that direct producers have limited resources to invest in land because of high levels of rent and interest, the productivity of land has suffered in the absence of countervailing processes (e.g. cooperatives, effective state support). In more recent times, in a new development, tractors and power tillers are being introduced by several landowners of middle castes, who do not mind performing labor on their land. Although, the wage increase to which local class struggle contributed has prompted the (middle caste) landowners to use machines, it remains to be seen how far this incipient transition to real subsumption of labor develops.</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion has potentially wider relevance for radical political economy in general and radical development theory in particular. First, asserted here is the need for a return to Marx’s often-neglected distinction between real and formal subsumption of <italic>wage</italic>-labor by capital in its productive form (not to be confused with subsumption of petty commodity producers by antediluvian forms of capital) for understanding capitalism’s temporality and spatiality, as well as the nature of Third World capitalist social formations. The inter-capitalist struggle, i.e. competition, which presupposes separation of workers from means of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0486613411423895">Weeks 1981</xref>), forces capitalists to resort to formal subsumption of labor (and even to use the pre- or non-capitalist sector, where it still exists). The most general form of capitalism anywhere in the world, and historically, is when capital appropriates absolute surplus value through formal subsumption by making workers work longer hours, by intensifying the labor process (and by even paying them below-subsistence wages, which Marx generally abstracted from). Formal subsumption is the more “primitive” (original) form of <italic>capitalist</italic> accumulation and capitalist exploitation.</p>
<p>Second, this return to Marx must be critical: it must challenge Marx’s neglect of—or rather an inconsistent stance towards—class struggle. Whether the transition to real subsumption of labor under capitalist relations, with associated technological change, happens depends on, although it is not reducible to, the balance of power between capital and labor.</p>
<p>Third, any discussion of capitalism must be sensitive to its spatial unevenness. Class struggle occurs within a context of specific factors, including capitalist state interventions. Partly because of the geographical variation in these contextual factors, the form and outcome of class struggle against formal subsumption will be place-specific with uneven impacts on the transition to real subsumption. Thus, productive forces are more developed in one place than in another, even if capitalist relations may exist in <italic>all</italic> places. In other words, <italic>the more general tendency</italic> under capitalism (i.e. the causal powers and liabilities of capitalists to produce commodities by using wage laborers so as to earn at least the average rate of surplus value) interacts with <italic>locally existing contingent conditions</italic> to produce geographically uneven development, more concrete forms of which must be subjected to empirical analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0486613411423895">50</xref></sup> Uneven development is taking place because of, and in the framework of, social relations that are predominantly <italic>capitalist</italic>, at least at the national level (as well as in most places at the sub-national scale). Uneven development is fundamentally, though not exclusively, a product of the spatially uneven transition to real subsumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0486613411423895">51</xref></sup> This view is contrary to the one implied by the restrictive concept of capitalism according to which only the use of modern technology represents capitalist relations of production. What erroneously follows from this is that uneven <italic>development of productive forces</italic> is a function of spatially limited amount of <italic>development of capitalist social relations</italic>: uneven development occurs because there is capitalism here but not there.</p>
<p>True, in terms of a tendential law, capitalism is a progressive force: it tends to promote the development of productive forces. Marx stressed this. But this does not mean that in every part of the world this will be the case, at a point in time. Capitalism based on formal subsumption of labor will not be very materially progressive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0486613411423895">52</xref></sup> To say that where capitalism is not playing its “assigned” progressive role, it must be because of some pre-capitalist (or semi-feudal) relations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0486613411423895">53</xref></sup> or that capitalism as a social relation does not exist, is being blind to one important aspect of capitalism. This is its socio-spatial dialectics: presence and absence of backwardness within a single global system of capitalism. The absence of dynamism is as much a part of the system as the presence of it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0486613411423895">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, in less developed countries, there is a huge industrial reserve army of labor, including migrants, women, and children. This owes its origin to colonialism and is being expanded under new imperialism through, for example, primitive accumulation. The expanding reserve army provides capital an ample opportunity for formal subsumption of labor, including the vulnerable elements when they are employed; on the other hand, the reserve army adversely affects the bargaining power of employed labor and makes class struggle against formal subsumption rather difficult. Neither does the state have resources<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0486613411423895">55</xref></sup> to adequately augment the social wage through pro-labor policies in a way in which they can substantially increase the power of labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0486613411423895">56</xref></sup> Given all this, capitalism based on formal subsumption of labor, and especially in the agrarian sector, may continue for a very long time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0486613411423895">Harvey (2003)</xref> and others have rightly said that primitive accumulation (or accumulation by dispossession<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0486613411423895">57</xref></sup>) is a continuous affair under capitalism. Formal subsumption—as an aspect of accumulation by exploitation—is also a <italic>continuous</italic> affair.</p>
<p>Finally, whether or not capitalism exists is not a matter of academic squabbling. The concept of what is present determines what needs to be absented (to use the terminology of the radical philosopher Roy Bhaskar). To say that a social formation is decidedly capitalist has a different political implication than the contrary view that it is not capitalist (enough), or that it is capitalist here and there but not everywhere. If a country is dominantly semi-feudal or not capitalist enough, then the radical strategy is seen by many as one which is to be directed against semi-feudal exploiters or at the promotion of advanced capitalism. This strategy licenses an indefinite wait for the fight for socialism (abolition of class relations) to start.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0486613411423895">58</xref></sup> But if what is present is already capitalism, albeit one that is not very progressive and that is unlikely to be very progressive for a very long time, the nature of class politics must be seen in a radically different manner.</p>

<p>The term “stage” is used both in a historical sense and conceptual sense (where stage = form), unless otherwise noted. Historically, formal subsumption precedes real subsumption. But at the same time, once real subsumption is developed it can and does coexist with formal subsumption.</p>

<p>Some scholars (e.g. Patnaik) think that laborers are unfree when they work for only one employer because they cannot find alternative employment. This view of unfreedom is contrary to Marx’s.

<p>In an adequate conception of capitalism, exchange relations cannot be ignored, for capitalism is about capital, which appears in the form of things bought and sold, although what underlies this appearance is a set of production relations. Marx is right to emphasize that in capitalism means of production and consumption are bought and sold. Note also that his point about means of production and consumption being bought and sold is not <italic>entirely</italic> about exchange: workers have to buy means of consumption—they have a market-mediated access to means of consumption—because they have been dispossessed of their means of production (e.g. land), and this is an aspect of class relation.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, rent and mercantile profit (or usurious interest) cannot be put in one category. On the other hand, buying land and leasing it out to poor peasants for a rent may be considered somewhat similar to money-lenders/merchants giving an advance in cash or kind to small producers. So, the appropriation of rent as a form of exploitation is much closer to Marx’s antediluvian forms of capital than to pre-capitalist forms of property, including feudalism, in the specific empirical context described later (i.e. where land is a full commodity and relations between landowners and peasants are based on monetary relations rather than extra-economic coercion).</p>

<p>Several additional points may be noted here. Rural India is characterized by both unequal land distribution —the top 10 percent of rural households owns 54 percent of land and the bottom 40 percent owns 1.2 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0486613411423895">Sharma 1992</xref>)—and by the fact that the average land holding being operated by cultivating families is extremely small (below 3 acres). Now, the degree of inequality in land distribution is a function of the process of primitive accumulation as well as of the market-driven class differentiation, which much of classical agrarian political economy including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0486613411423895">Lenin’s (1899)</xref> analysis focused on (apart from demographic processes and inheritance laws that lead to the break-up of family-owned holdings). Class struggle by peasants against primitive accumulation—which happened during colonial times and continue now (see Gough 1974; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0486613411423895">Dhanagare 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0486613411423895">Surjeet 1986</xref>, 1992)—can slow down primitive accumulation to some extent. Also, such struggle will be more successful in one place (e.g. West Bengal) than in another (e.g. the Punjab) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0486613411423895">Webster 1990</xref>). The degree of market penetration underlying class differentiation varies from place to place. Thus both these processes (geography of class struggle and of market penetration) will create a differentiated terrain on which capitalism—and labor struggle against formal subsumption—emerges/develops, and also as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0486613411423895">Bharadwaj (1982</xref>: 606-7) notes, new technologies (e.g. the green revolution technology) are introduced.</p>

<p>The relative balance of power between capital and labor stems primarily from production relations: from capitalists’ ownership and control over means of production and their use in the realm of production, and from laborers’ power to stop production, to bargain over the price of their commodity (labor power), and so on. But this (unequal) power relation between capital and labor does not stand alone; it is mediated by state interventions, both on behalf of capital and labor. Workers’ exercise of their power is affected by state’s pro-poor policies to some extent.</p>

<p>Conceptually, labor resistance against formal subsumption is a factor that influences the possibility of the transition to real subsumption. In less developed countries, there are numerous barriers to labor resistance, including a vast reserve army of labor. Therefore, we generally see only pockets of resistance, which have been intellectually captured through not regional or national level statistical data, but village studies such as those the paper relies on, including my own, to provide some support for the conceptual arguments.</p>

<p>Still another response is what can be called political accumulation. Landowners formally subsuming labor utilize local state institutions including police to beat up striking laborers, or to have them jailed on false charges. Surplus from agriculture is used to support political parties and bribe state bureaucracy which, in turn, helps capital’s use of the state’s rural development resources illegally, in a form of primitive accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0486613411423895">Wilson 1999</xref>). The fact of state intervention and the fact of it being instrumentally used by local dominant classes suggest that reproduction of (agrarian) capitalism is a deeply political matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0486613411423895">Harriss 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>One may ask: why, when confronted with increasing wage-hikes, landowners in the study area did not go in for mechanization, whereas many farmers in Punjab and Haryana would have done so. One reason is that landowners in the study area are small owners: less than 10 percent of them own more than 5 acres, whereas in Punjab and Haryana 25.3 percent of owners own more than 5 acres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0486613411423895">Sharma 1992</xref>). Also, with the neoliberal economic policy in force since 1991, the prices of inputs such as fertilizers have been increasing much faster, because of withdrawal of government subsidies, than the price of paddy, the dominant crop in the area. Thus farming based on directly hiring labor, with rising wage costs, has been unviable for smaller landowners; given the amount of means of production (land) in their hands, the amount of surplus value available to them is not adequate for investment in machines. This means that, as explained earlier, the effect of class struggle on accumulation will depend on local, contextual factors, including the degree of concentration in means of production.</p>

<p>Among constraints on the state is the (relative) lack of state funds due to the overall lower development of productive forces, and ruling classes being reluctant to share a part of the surplus value as taxes.

<p>Further, given the transfer of resources in the form of debt-payment, etc., from these societies in the system of imperialism, the resources necessary to invest in technology may be limited, although this is not to say that imperialism completely rules out technological change in the Third World. Indeed, imperialism is partly responsible for “combined and uneven development.” The green revolution technology was indeed promoted in part by imperialism. The sale of modern farm inputs including tractors by the United States in India was a strategy to counter the crisis of overproduction in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0486613411423895">Cleaver 1972</xref>). More recently, the introduction of green-house farming in floriculture (at least initially) and contract farming under neoliberalism have also happened partly through the involvement of imperialist companies. To the extent that technological change in Third World agriculture will create a market for products for these companies and/or will increase relative surplus value, a part of which will be shared by imperialist countries, imperialism may not be inimical to technological change.</p>
