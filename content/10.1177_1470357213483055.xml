<abstract>
<p>Focusing on the critical case of the mobile phone footage of Gaddafi’s death in the context of Swedish television news and its audiences, this article considers how the nature of ‘media witnessing’ is being transformed through the employment of user-generated footage. On the basis of a combined text/audience analysis study, it shows that citizen video encodes an extraordinary sense of presence and participation. Critically, however, its facilitation of ‘pseudo-eyewitnessing’ is not enough in itself to sustain practices of bearing witness. Rather, the author shows that moral responsibility is fundamentally conditioned by the symbolic management of distance – which, audiences stress, is most efficiently provided by professional news packages. Importantly, then, this empirical study corroborates the so far mainly theoretical claim in literature on media witnessing which advocates that media representations need to maintain a ‘proper distance’ in order to construct scenes of suffering and violence as a moral cause to spectators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article considers how the nature of journalistic witnessing is changing in the emerging new media ecology, when smartphone-carrying citizens are now replacing professional journalists as on-site eyewitnesses to breaking crisis events. Citizen eyewitness recordings from zones of conflict and crisis are increasingly employed to help establish journalism’s authority as witness to the truth of the event, especially in controversial circumstances. Such imagery, importantly, is the only form of user-generated content that is published on equal terms with, i.e. is assigned the same epistemic authority, as professionally produced content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483055">Andén-Papadopoulos and Pantti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357213483055">Saugmann Andersen, 2012</xref>). Yet, while providing a form of documentation and expression that has a deep ‘reality-effect’, the poor technical quality of much of this imagery, let alone the difficulties of identifying its sources, make the challenge of interpretation and verification formidable.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that professional newsrooms tend to employ citizen eyewitness imagery as ‘visible evidence’ to embody the on-site presence by which journalism constitutes its claim to authority. However, we have yet to consider the communicative complexity of this imagery as a distinct mode of witnessing with its own truth and rights claims (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483055">Andén-Papadopoulos, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483055">2013b</xref>). My concern here is how the nature of ‘media witnessing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483055">Frosh and Pinchevsky, 2009</xref>) is being transformed through the employment of user-generated footage. As opposed to the enduring journalistic norms of objectivity and impartiality, video shot by involved citizens summons an immediate and embodied experience from ‘inside’ the event that is believed to impose a particular moral and political obligation on news publics. However, this is something that has been asserted rather than carefully studied. Also, so far very limited empirical study is available of how actual news audiences recognize and respond to the distinct ‘imaginative demands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Frosh, 2009</xref>) that citizen footage makes of its addressees (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483055">Ahva and Hellman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483055">Williams et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Focusing on the critical case of the mobile phone footage of Gaddafi’s bloody death on 20 October 2011, in the context of Swedish television news and its audiences, this article addresses the issue of the imaginary powers of crowd-source footage from a two-fold perspective. Firstly, I identify and analyse through which ‘aesthetic registers and ethical discourses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483055">Chouliaraki, 2008</xref>: 339) citizen audiovisuals render proximity to the real, which in turn poses the viewer’s moral responsibility or complicity to the event depicted. Can we identify an alternative ethics and aesthetics of authenticity in this imagery, one that is altering traditional forms and standards for the journalistic labour of bearing witness to distant crises? Secondly, the article explores how actual audiences respond to the distinct appeal to eyewitness subjectivity provided by crowd-sourced video. How do members of a national audience make sense of crowd-sourced video, as published ‘raw’ on YouTube vs as incorporated into a national news narrative, and what types of ‘witnessing’ does this sense-making involve?</p>
<p>My analysis draws on two principal sets of data. Firstly, I have examined the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation’s (SVT1 Rapport) newscasts of the killing of Libya’s former dictator Muammar Gaddafi during 20–21 October 2011. Secondly, 9 focus group interviews were conducted in Sweden between May and October 2012 with 3–5 people in every group. The aim of setting up the groups was to include a broad stratum of Swedish audiences with regard to age, gender and location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357213483055">1</xref></sup> However, this particular study will not refer to structural differences in the way the Gaddafi case was discussed. Its principal purpose is to provide a condensed discussion of what Swedish viewers have in common with regard to the experience of witness generated by crowd-sourced video of a distant crisis. In the context of a wider interrogation, the groups were shown (among other materials) an edited news story containing mainly professional footage, including a brief scene from an amateur recording of the brutal manhandling of Gaddafi (SVT Rapport, 21 October 2011). In connection with this clip, they were also shown a crowd-sourced video of Libyan rebels abusing Gaddafi (found on YouTube and published as a link on online news sites, 21 October 2011). The groups were then asked to reflect on how they connected (or not) with these two different representations of the same event, and in what particular ways these two clips variously functioned to facilitate and frustrate a sense of proximity and engagement.</p>
<p>The Swedish setting provided an opportunity to study how a global crisis event, as constituted and framed by ‘hyper-local’ crowd-sourced eyewitness video, is interpreted by television audiences in a distant cultural context. The death of Gaddafi is a prominent example not only of the increasing journalistic reliance on citizen-contributed video in breaking crisis reporting, but also of the highly ambiguous status of such visuals as witness to the ‘truth’ of an event. The Gaddafi video involves extreme violence and most importantly a scene of a political crisis where the roles of victims and perpetrators are fused – and where the viewer is positioned as party to a gaze that performed this recording within the very act of bloodshed. I thus use the case of Gaddafi as an illustrative point of reference to demonstrate that issues concerning truth, morality and authenticity take on a complexity otherwise neglected by hopeful assumptions about the potential of user-generated footage to sustain practices of bearing witness.</p>

<title>Journalistic Witnessing in a New Media Ecology</title>
<p>The global news industry is in the midst of a ‘crowd-sourced video revolution’ that is altering both information flows and the nature of news work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483055">Sasseen, 2012</xref>: 4). Traditional journalists no longer have a monopoly on footage from zones of conflict and crises around the world. Instead, citizen journalists, political activists and human rights workers are now filling in as critical eyewitnesses to human suffering worldwide (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213483055">Allan and Thorsen, 2009</xref>). News organizations are, in response, increasingly giving up attempts to lead on breaking news, focusing instead on verifying and re-mediating the stream of crowd-sourced images and information provided by variegated actors on scene.</p>
<p>Journalism’s extensive reliance on images created by unknown actors, who do not abide by the ethical standards and responsibilities of the news trade, presents potentially devastating challenges to conventional journalistic notions of truth-telling (including fact-checking and source criticism). Importantly, this is a context in which journalism cannot distance itself from amateurs and other non-journalistic actors. Not including available and newsworthy visuals would seriously undercut their credibility as a news organization, while including them in effect often means risking violating editorial control and credibility. Journalists negotiate this dilemma by employing various discursive strategies for incorporation that seek to ‘normalize’ citizen imagery to suit existing norms and practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483055">Singer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Under such pressures, recent studies indicate that the ‘professional logic of control’ may be slowly shifting towards a revised logic of ‘adaptability and openness’, which breaks away from the professional understandings of objectivity and truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357213483055">Lewis, 2012</xref>: 851). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483055">Chouliaraki (2010)</xref>, the subcontracting of the role of the eyewitness to private citizens can be seen to constitute a break not only with the monopoly of journalistic story-telling but also with professional discourses of objectivity: in replacing the journalist with the citizen as a guarantee of the authenticity of witnessing, she argues, it is no longer only the verification of facts and sources that makes for the trustworthiness of news but the authority of genuine emotion and first-person experience.</p>

<title>‘Media Witnessing’ Revisited</title>
<p>Recent years have seen the term ‘media witnessing’ emerge as a way of elucidating how modern audiovisual media now make the experiences and realities of distant others available to mass audiences, turning us all into witnesses of a sort. In the seminal definition provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483055">Frosh and Pinchevsky (2009</xref>: 1) the term refers to the ‘witnessing performed <italic>in, by</italic>, and <italic>through</italic> the media’ (emphases in original). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483055">John Durham Peters (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483055">2009</xref>) offers a restricted take on the capacity of broadcast media to sustain the attitude of witnessing. For him, one qualifies as a witness primarily by virtue of being bodily present at the event, a presence that ties the act of witnessing to potential risk, pain and even death. Full presence is the ‘paradigm case’ of witnessing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483055">Peters (2001)</xref> argues, while the modality of ‘recording’ – the broadcast of a recording of an event that has already happened – in his view is least likely to sustain the act of witnessing.</p>
<p>Paul Frosh and John Ellis provide necessary critiques to Peters, arguing that a vital sense of participation is not necessarily undermined but often intensified by modern audio-visual media. By simulating the modalities of unmediated perception, television in particular draws us into a new experience of witness, they contend, whereby we become accomplices in the often disturbing events we now know about yet cannot change. ‘You cannot say that you did not know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213483055">Ellis, 2000</xref>: 11) reads the oft-cited dictum by which Ellis sums up the conflicting sense of involvement and detachment that defines this new audience position. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Frosh (2009</xref>: 63), television news and documentaries are ‘witnessing texts’ that address the viewer as a witness through their ‘witnessing intentionality’, i.e. the way they signify their ‘having-been-designed to bear witness’, which in turn poses the viewer’s moral responsibility to those represented on the screen. Building on Ellis’s model of viewer experience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Frosh’s (2009</xref>: 52) discussion is centred on how these texts enable a kind of ‘pseudo-eyewitnessing’ through the deployment of discursive and aesthetic features that imply ‘liveness, immediacy and co-presence’.</p>
<p>Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483055">Sue Tait (2011</xref>: 1224) notes, there is little to distinguish this notion of witnessing from mere spectatorship. She argues that the conflation of eye-witnessing and <italic>bearing</italic> witness indeed is endemic in discourses on media witnessing. Even so, a distinction must be made between these two concepts, Tait contends, in order to explain the ways bearing witness extends beyond seeing through practices of enacting responsibility (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483055">Rentschler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357213483055">Zelizer, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213483055">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A significant weakness of the literature on media witnessing is that its contributions to our understanding of audience experiences in the age of global media reporting have, on balance, been theoretical. It makes qualified assumptions about the audience, but does not empirically engage with it. Also, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Paul Frosh and Amit Pinchevsky (2009</xref>: 10) stress that the proliferation of mobile cameras in an increasingly converged media landscape ‘has turned everyone into a testimony-producer’, the ways in which this shift might be transforming the nature of media witnessing have yet to be carefully studied.</p>

<title>The Aesthetics of Authenticity in Citizen Imagery</title>
<p>Several fragments of cellphone video exist that show the capture and death of Colonel Gaddafi at the hands of rebel fighters. The earliest footage to emerge was captured by a rebel fighter with an iPhone just seconds after Gaddafi was dragged from the water drain in which he was hiding in his hometown of Sirte. The clip shows a bloody and battered Gaddafi who is pleading helplessly with his captors as they fiercely drag him towards a pick-up truck. There are shouts of ‘God is great’, yelling and sounds of gunfire. Using this clip as a critical point of reference, I distinguish four main characteristics of the aesthetics of crowd-sourced footage: <italic>hypermobility, opacity, non-narrativity</italic> and ‘<italic>raw’ audio</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section5-1470357213483055">
<title>Hypermobility</title>
<p>The hallmark of citizen footage is the ‘hypermobilised’ camerawork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357213483055">Tait, 2009</xref>: 343; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213483055">Niekamp, 2011</xref>). In contrast to the typically steady camera shots of professionals, citizen video is distinguished by sudden and seemingly aimless camera movements. Citizen-shot imagery is typically chaotic and indiscriminate, i.e. it does not draw viewer attention to a particular point of interest. The notion of hypermobility extends not only to the motion of the camera, but also to the motion of the citizen photographer, who physically pursues, and takes the place of people caught up in affecting life-and-death situations. The Gaddafi clip is marked by the manic efforts of the videographer to frame and hold the image as he or she is pushed around by – and in turn pushes the group of fighters who are frogmarching the former dictator. The video is shaky, mostly out of focus and with frantic and disorienting pans and zooms. While the haphazard camerawork codes the scene with authenticity – as a signifier of proximity and participation in a moment of crisis – it also partly blocks our access to the scene recorded, poising the image on the very margins of legibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470357213483055">
<title>Opacity</title>
<p>The aesthetics of crowd-sourced footage is identified by an orientation towards visual opacity: the ‘medium’ explicitly comes forth as the ‘message’ in the typically blurry, dim and grainy quality of citizen-shot video. This imagery compromises the representational process by means of accidental forms of inscription, such as fuzziness, low resolution, poor lighting, ellipses and interferences within the field of vision. As the Gaddafi clip demonstrates, we are thus confronted with an uncertain form of representation that oscillates between figure and abstraction, transparency and opacity. Yet, this representational inadequacy encodes immediacy, the collapse of time and space limits with the scene of violence, allowing us to make ourselves imaginatively present at the event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470357213483055">
<title>Non-narrativity</title>
<p>Citizen video is distinctly set apart from professional photojournalism in that it breaks away from the prevailing journalistic norm of storytelling. The chaotic, fragmentary and incoherent clip of Gaddafi’s death radically disrupts the fundamental structure of narrative (a story with a proper beginning, middle and end, a coherence working to enact closure). The professional photographer carefully composes the shot according to preexisting conventions so as to artfully construct a sense of emotional closeness and identification. In contrast, crowd-sourced footage has been described as a form of ‘spraypainting’: the camera is just rolling, pointing in all directions as the photographer frantically tries to capture everything that goes around him or her. As a result, central events are often taking place off-screen and a particular focus of attention is conspicuously lacking. It is precisely this seemingly spontaneous, unstaged quality of citizen video, i.e. its open refusal of ‘the morally suppressive force of narrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483055">Orgad, 2012</xref>: 197), that codes it with authenticity as well as ambivalence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470357213483055">
<title>‘Raw’ audio</title>
<p>The reality effects of crowd-sourced video is also a result of the unedited sound, which is key to creating a sense of ‘being-there’ and, as the Gaddafi clip illustrates, of getting access to the rawness of the event. The manic yelling and screaming at the scene of Gaddafi’s capture intensifies the sense of drama and also of attendance – of being there in the midst of the agitated mob.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470357213483055">
<title>The Ethics of Authenticity in Citizen Imagery</title>
<p>The point of departure for this discussion is that the moral and aesthetic values of citizen imagery are interdependent: the moral value of crowd-sourced video is contingent on the specific embodied gaze of the citizen photographer which, in turn, is encoded in the distinct aesthetic features of the imagery. I have distinguished three main principles that variously serve to construct – but potentially also compromise – citizen footage’s claim to reality and morality: <italic>subjectivity, affectivity</italic> and <italic>partisanship</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section10-1470357213483055">
<title>Subjectivity</title>
<p>One key source of power of the Gaddafi clip is that it affords a deeply subjectivist insight into the brutal drama of the former dictator’s capture as it was enacted by, and impacted upon, his fellow citizens who, just like him, were an integral party to the political crisis in Libya. If professional journalists typically have a weak form of connection to the distant others who populate our television screens, citizen videographers, in contrast, embody a shared sense of circumstance and affect – in the case of the capture and killing of Gaddafi, however, not sympathy but apparently a deeply felt hatred for the former dictator. Unlike the professional photojournalist, who undertakes to act as the surrogate eyes, and conscience, of distant publics, camera-wielding citizens operate both as reporters and participants. The local citizen, victim or activist caught up in a crisis event is not a third party and therefore gives testimony with a particular investment in the grievances he or she portrays. The individual who shot the Gaddafi footage evidently took a considerable personal risk in participating in this event of militia violence, and also in recording amid the frenzied and apparently murderous crowd. This clip, then, draws us into an emotive relationship with people in pain and outrage – the villain/victim and his merciless executioners – partly because it provides a strongly subjectivised point of view, one that conjures an embodied presence and response <italic>within</italic> the traumatic event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470357213483055">
<title>Affectivity</title>
<p>The rhetorical power of citizen video comes in large measure from the way it concentrates and directs raw feelings. Such imagery departs from a conventional journalism of facts in that it reflects and feeds into a broader shift towards emotions and personal expression as authentication of news. The most powerful affective appeal in the Gaddafi video is no doubt the bloodied full-on face of the former dictator: his brutalized, confused and agonizing look almost inevitably humanizes him, urging us to identify with his helplessness at the hands of a bloodthirsty mob. The commiserate appeal of the defeated ruler is only amplified by the resounding cries of the agitated mob, giving voice to a primitive hatred and lust for revenge. The cries of the Libyan rebel fighters are more than a sign of personal affect, for their screams reflect a moment of national catharsis in the country Colonel Gaddafi had ruled for 42 years. Simultaneously, their agitation calls into question the democratic credentials of the new Libya, disrupting the prevailing narrative of non-violent change into one that is much messier and morally ambiguous. The emotions attain additional significance because they become political, drawing us into an explicitly political scenario (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213483055">Hariman and Lucaites, 2007</xref>). Hence, because it fuses political dissent with a moment of intense individual agony and public outrage, the Gaddafi video can be seen to have afforded global news publics a space to connect viscerally with the revolutionary developments in Libya, which is also to say that it builds its claim to reality precisely on the authority of embodied affect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470357213483055">
<title>Partisanship</title>
<p>In contrast to a professional journalism of detachment, citizen videographers are characterized by the fact that they typically report as both observers and parties to a contested circumstance. Hence, it is rarely the case that people who publicize their testimony to a particular crisis or conflict are simply seeking to be heard. More often they are attempting to get a particular message across. As the Gaddafi video exemplifies, the line between citizen journalism and political action at times is altogether blurred, as citizens and activists increasingly participate in both the media and the critical event through their strategic self-representation. Yet, the main point to consider here is that the honesty of citizen video that makes explicit its political stance becomes a category of value, one that is associated with strong claims to authenticity. Citizen imagery that acknowledges its invested perspective is thus often perceived as more truthful and sincere than the ‘professional’ appeal to a principle of detachment which underpins the news image’s claim to reality.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-1470357213483055">
<title>Audiences: The Effect of Authenticity</title>
<p>The focus group interviews show that Swedish audiences value the use of crowd-sourced video in professional crisis reporting for complex reasons, but chief among them is the sense of authenticity it can afford. This is supported by earlier studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483055">Williams et al. (2011)</xref> who found that BBC news audiences appreciate the inclusion of amateur eyewitness footage because it is perceived to be ‘more real and less packaged’ than reportage produced solely by journalists. In contrast to their findings, however, the Swedish focus groups clearly aligned themselves with the discourse of ‘reality effects’ rather than an uncritical understanding of citizen footage as a transparent record of the real. Swedish audiences readily and knowingly identified the aesthetic qualities and ethical registers of citizen videos, how these depart from professional photojournalism and they ways in which they <italic>signify</italic> access to the real.</p>
<p>The focus groups here recurrently pointed to the blurry, shaky, non-coherent character of the Gaddafi clip as key in creating the impression of realism. ‘I get the sense of authenticity when the images are a bit blurry and maybe shaky and not so well-composed’ (Magnus, men’s group, 35–55). Audience members contrasted the undesigned quality of this footage with what is commonly referred to as the ‘theatrical’ conventions of professional images. The latter were typically perceived as ‘arranged’, ‘staged’, ‘rigged’, ‘artistic’: they were seen to illustrate a pre-existing <italic>idea</italic> about reality, rather than an offhand impression of reality.</p>
<p>Yet participants simultaneously stressed that <italic>form</italic> is of much lesser significance in this regard than <italic>content. What</italic> the image shows, and particularly <italic>who</italic> shot it, were foregrounded as the main reasons for perceiving crowd-sourced footage as providing more direct access to reality. The timeliness of such footage was persistently stressed, i.e. the fact that the photographer was on the spot at the ‘right’ time, managing to capture an unexpected but sensational news event offhand (as opposed to professional recordings which typically show situations <italic>after</italic> the event). Most importantly, the focus groups forefronted the subjectivized point of view in citizen video as a main source of authority. The guarantee of trustworthiness derives precisely from the fact that the person recording is not viewing the event from an external position but is part of the event. He or she just happened to be on the scene and, in contrast to the potentially manipulative reports of professional news makers, provides a first-hand account of how those affected experienced the event <italic>as it happened</italic>. The citizen videographer is somebody ‘who is in the midst of everything and photographs a feeling he or she has at that particular moment’. Citizen video is ‘shot in affect’, by an ‘involved’ photographer who is ‘engaged and completely preoccupied by what’s going on’ (Marcus, men’s group, 35–55). Such imagery, then, ‘shows what actually happened, even if it is disturbing and bloody and disgusting’ (Ivar, mixed group, 35–55).</p>
<p>This perception of increased credibility is also intimately linked to the ways in which citizen footage displays and evokes raw feeling. The focus groups underlined that this creates a sense of ‘being there’, on the scene of events, allowing audiences access to a seemingly more unmediated version of events. Participants pointed to the strong embodied articulation of panic, outrage and hatred within the Gaddafi clip as a signifier of veracity:<disp-quote>
<p>You get a sense of how much they hate him and how panic … how the sentiment … You cannot experience this in a better way than seeing it in this way. Not if you are not there. (Helena, women’s group, 18–34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Particularly, the audience highlighted the importance of the original audio for creating this sense of corporealised presence within the disturbing event. The Gaddafi clip was held to be particularly authentic – and distressing – because of the fact that ‘you heard voices in [it], that they were screaming. You couldn’t hear what they were saying, but they were very agitated, stressed and full of hatred’ (Maria, mixed group, 35–55). Authentic audio ‘creates the feeling that you are recording what is happening right now’ (Jon, men’s group, 18–34).</p>
<p>Participants did not take the truth claims of citizen video at face value: they talked about citizen footage in terms of how it creates a ‘sense’, ‘impression’ or ’feel’ of reality, rather than warranting any unproblematic access to the real. Also, they emphasized the contingent nature of these truth claims. The Gaddafi clip was held to provide a local but not necessarily absolute truth: ‘It feels as if this is what was really happening, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is more true’ (Magnus, men’s group, 35–55).</p>
<p>Many of the participants also brought up the issues of interpretation and verification as critical for how they value crowd-sourced video. Put simply, the Gaddafi clip was perceived as authentic because it was largely self-explanatory: ‘you saw that this is Gaddafi … then you get the feeling that you actually know what is going on’ (Johan, men’s group, 18–34). In contrast, the participants commonly expressed frustration with crowd-sourced video that does not ‘speak for itself’: i.e. when it is so fuzzy, chaotic and confusing that you cannot make sense of it (who is doing what to whom). They emphasized that the challenge of interpretation is essential for how they engage (or not) with citizen video and that much of it frequently comes across as meaningless to the point of pushing them away: ‘I lost interest. I did not understand’ (Maria, mixed group, 35-55).</p>

<title>The Productive Ambivalence of Symbolic Proximity</title>
<p>The interviews suggest that crowd-sourced video affords distant (i.e. national) audiences a quality of connectivity with global crisis events that is characterized by a productive ambivalence between, on the one hand, an appreciation of ‘being there’ and, on the other hand, a suspicion of lack of context and verification. ‘Symbolic proximity’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483055">Orgad (2012</xref>: 31), ‘is a central dimension and quality of the relation that viewers are called on to develop to distant others.’ Viewers are invited to dislocate from their comfort and safety zones and think and feel ‘as if’ they were there, at the distant other’s danger zone (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483055">Chouliaraki, 2008</xref>). Audience members here validated this, as they responded very strongly to invitations by citizen footage to dislocate from their own here and now, and relocate to the other’s often precarious and distant time and place. The Gaddafi footage was commonly held to work in this way: ‘You are really there, at the inside’ (Johan, men’s group, 18–34). ’I really get a sense of it getting closer. It could be me or my buddy standing there and shooting these images’ (Jon, men’s group, 18–34).</p>
<p>The principal reason for this perception of closeness is the capacity of crowd-sourced video to summon an embodied experience of atrocity. Such imagery, insofar as it is legible and graphic, provokes strong visceral responses from audiences, as aptly summarized by one of the respondents: ‘It triggers sensations in the body when you hear gun shots and you see people who are afraid’ (Fredrik, mixed group, 18–34). Citizen imagery from Libya and Syria is commonly described as ‘touching’, ‘moving’ and ‘stirring’, and participants recurrently point to the feelings of ‘panic’, ‘distress’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘sadness’ (among others) that it communicates. In the case of the Gaddafi piece, audience members highlighted the embodied affect that the footage encodes, and particularly the fact that they were able to recognize Gaddafi as ‘the protagonist of the drama’, as key to creating a sense of attachment to the event:<disp-quote>
<p>You need to be able to see the emotions in people’s faces, pain and fear, so that you can connect them to feelings within yourself. /…/ I sense that it [the Gaddafi clip] is much more close because here you can relate to … like we have found him, we are outraged, we are happy – all emotions at once. It’s just chaos. Yes, my own kind of human being is in that crowd somewhere! (Fredrik, mixed group, 18–34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants also stressed the importance of original audio for generating this sense of affectedness: ‘Loud noice and messiness … then it feels more like now there is something going on. The body switches its warning signals on’ (Johan, mixed group, 18–34). Audience members also specifically singled out the lack of narrative structure as crucial in adding to their bodily reactions. Because crowd-sourced video disrupts ready-made news conventions, it creates a sense of acute alertness as viewers have to fill in the blanks themselves.</p>
<p>Yet, it is critical to note that this sense of visceral immediacy does not necessarily translate into moral responsibility. Indeed, many participants are careful to make this distinction: ‘You get closer with the amateur imagery, but I don’t know if you really get a different understanding’ (Jon, men’s group, 18–34). ‘You do get close to the people in the amateur footage, but once it is over you think “alright, this happened in another part of the world”’ (Camilla, mixed group, 35–55). Also, the emotions evoked by the Gaddafi footage were negatively coded: the respondents asserted that it provokes feelings such as ‘dizziness’, ‘nausea’ and ‘panic’. This suggests that the affective appeal of graphic eyewitness footage is ambiguous and might provoke impulses of detachment as much as attachment: ‘It gets under your skin. I will think about this when I go to bed tonight and almost feel sick. I don’t want it this close’ (Anna, mixed group, 18–34). While audience members did stress that the Gaddafi footage adds a ‘human dimension’ and invites feelings of pity – ‘no human being deserves to die in such a manner’ (Håkan, men’s group, 36–55) – they simultaneously asserted that the Libyans and their actions fell outside their lifeworlds, outside their structure of experience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It feels close when you watch this footage. But at the same time you distance yourself from it because this would never happen in Sweden. Or at least not in my everyday life. (Helena, women’s group, 18–34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Group members also stressed that identification is problematic because of the at times controversial role of the citizen videographer: while the participatory perspective provided by citizen imagery is held to create visceral closeness, it is also perceived as morally and politically ambiguous – especially in the case of the Gaddafi footage where the photographer is also a perpetrator. Participants expressed their unease with the way in which the photographer pushes himself through to get close-ups of Gaddafi’s bloodied face, and took exception to the fact that he even seems to use his mobile camera as a weapon to assist in the brutalizing of the former dictator.</p>
<p>Hence, participants suggested that while crowd-sourced video facilitates a mode of ‘pseudo-eyewitnessing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Frosh, 2009</xref>: 52), which encodes a sense of immediacy and authenticity, it does not in itself engage with their potential to care. Rather, this study shows that the possibility of audiences <italic>bearing witness</italic>, understood as an act that exceeds seeing through practices of assuming responsibility for contemporary events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483055">Tait, 2011</xref>), is fundamentally conditioned by the symbolic management of distance which, audiences stressed, is most efficiently provided by professional news packages. Respondents emphasized that the Swedish television news narrative calls them to experience events at a degree of distance: ‘The SVT clip is objective … It is as if you’re positioned in front of a crystal ball and watching everything happening and then going back again’ (Helena, women’s group, 18–34). Yet they simultaneously suggested that this conventional distance is precisely what invites them to bridge socio-cultural remoteness:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Camilla:</speaker>
<p>In the SVT piece you at least heard the Swedish prime minister talking about Swedes who had been there and who had done things, so that gets close in a different sense.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interlocutor:</speaker>
<p>So there are connections?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent C:</speaker>
<p>Yes. Ok there are Swedes there. Is there anyone that I know who was there?</p>
</speech>
<p>All the focus groups recognized the pedagogic repertoire of television news as key to sustaining the practice of bearing witness, in that it expertly places the spectacle of violence in a meaningful context of explanation and understanding. In comparing the unedited YouTube clip of Gaddafi’s death with SVT’s news report, respondents commonly stressed that the latter establishes the necessary distance from the event so as to render it not only comprehensible but also ethically acceptable for viewers:<disp-quote>
<p>In the SVT news broadcast it felt like now the Libyan people have taken responsibility in ousting the former dictator in an almost acceptable manner. But in the other clip it is a mob lynching and beating another human being to death. (Marcus, men’s group, 36–55)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent further underscored that the lack of an explanatory perspective might trigger processes of symbolic distancing and antagonization:<disp-quote>
<p>If you don’t get the historical context you can easily picture all the Arabs, the others, as extremely brutal … People at work were talking about the footage and somebody said ‘they are like monkeys’… and ho ho ho! (Fredrik, mixed group, 18–34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>On the basis of a combined text/audience analysis study, I have shown how the discursive features of crowd-sourced footage encode an extraordinary sense of presence and participation. The shots signifying the position of involved actors provide the audience with a subjectivized point of view: one that invokes a body within and responding to events rather than the ‘objective’ posture conjured by conventional journalism. As the study of audience responses to the raw mobile footage of Gaddafi’s death suggests, such footage has an extraordinary capacity to move the bodies of its viewers via affective responses. It compels audiences to experience the distant event as a visceral phenomenon which, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483055">Tait (2011</xref>: 1229), may facilitate a sense of attachment to it. To elicit affect, to move the body, she argues, may be a precondition to enabling publics to care about an event. Thus, in resisting normative renderings of journalistic detachment, crowd-sourced footage may be seen to open up an affective and political space within professional crisis reporting that has the potential to radicalize the testimonial mode of journalism (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483055">Chouliaraki, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The example of the Gaddafi clip shows that the nature of crowd-sourced footage positions the audience in a relationship of almost immediate eye-witnessing, of a sense of ‘being there’ at the scene of the events. The direct attraction of these audiovisuals derives from the ways in which the difficulties of recording are inscribed into the footage itself: that is, from the reality effect of imperfect perceptual realism whereby the imagery encodes an embodied and, importantly, affected presence within the scene of violence. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483055">Peters (2009</xref>: 43), a subject’s witness of a traumatic experience ‘is often more persuasive by performing blockage than fluency’ and such incoherence can thus ‘underline the reality of experience’. Also, crowd-sourced footage communicates authenticity precisely because the person recording is not observing the event from an external position, but is part of the event being reported on – often at great personal risk. Such footage, then, can be seen to assert moral claims by evoking Peter’s ‘paradigm case’ of witnessing: an in-the-flesh presence at the event vouchsafed by the vulnerability of the videographer’s body. ’To bear witness’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483055">Peters (2001</xref>: 731), ‘is to put one’s body on the line. Within every witness, perhaps, stands a martyr, the will to corroborate words with something beyond them, pain and death being the last resorts.’</p>
<p>Yet insofar as the capacity of recordings, or ‘witnessing texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483055">Frosh, 2009</xref>) to sustain the act of bearing witness is premised on the moral intention of the testimony-producer, then this is a point where the ethical demands of crowd-sourced footage become weak. Against Peters’ assertion that ‘to witness means to be on the right side’, the videographer in the Gaddafi case is ambivalently positioned as both a victim to the rule of the now-dying dictator <italic>and</italic> a brutal perpetrator. His use of the mobile camera as weapon represents the fury of vengeance, the mode of mob justice, not the ethical responsibility to the integrity of the victim which is one of the defining criteria of what it means to bear witness to trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483055">Guerin and Hallas, 2007</xref>: 15). The Gaddafi clip is thus suggestive of how the dubious motivation of ‘outlaw’ videographers can aggravate the anxieties over how to look at violent imagery, for the act of looking at atrocity footage taken for reasons other than to bear witness cannot be separated from the violent production of that footage in the first place: it renders a gaze that participates and implicates the viewer in practices of brutality.</p>
<p>Also, if our ethical response to a witnessing text is dependent on a certain faith in its truth or truthfulness, it is critical to note that crowd-sourced footage raises acute concerns about issues such as veracity, representativity and accuracy, as it is rarely attributed and it has proven impossible to verify how and where some footage was shot. Also, as commercial pressures place increasing constraints on journalists’ ability to conduct the disciplines of verification that traditionally underpins the truth claims of news, news organizations are often caught up in the practices of re-mediating user-generated footage with minimal authentication. Yet the focus group study suggests that it is precisely the value of experienced professionals who know how to critically and ethically report on new information, not merely recirculate it, that audiences call for in order to facilitate ethical response. Crowd-sourced footage, my study shows, creates a productive tension between, on the one hand, a visceral effect of corporeal implication in the viewer and, on the other hand, suspicion as to how this precarious imagery blocks processes of interpretation and identification. Critically, then, its facilitation of pseudo-witnessing, and the imagination of presence this enables, is not enough in itself to sustain the practice of bearing witness. Instead, all the focus groups emphasize the moral value of ambivalence in the representation of distant crisis: they celebrate the sense of immediate witnessing as a means of affectively drawing them into the scene of suffering and, simultaneously, they underscore the value of distance, of processes of framing as a prerequisite for them to be able to assume an ethical responsibility towards distant others.</p>
<p>Importantly, then, this empirical study corroborates the so far mainly theoretical claim in existent relevant literature which advocates that media representations need to maintain a ‘proper distance’ – ‘both far and close’ – in order to construct scenes of suffering and violence as a moral cause to spectators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357213483055">Silverstone, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483055">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483055">Orgad, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213483055">Robertson, 2010</xref>). This scholarship proposes that our ethical and emotional responsibility to those represented on the screen relies precisely on this productive tension between a position of ‘being there’ and one of reflexive distance vis-à-vis the spectacle of suffering. If the findings of this study thus point to the continuing importance of well-tested news conventions in sustaining the practice of bearing witness, they also imply that journalistic ethics have to be re-imagined to catch this new thing called the crowd-sourced video revolution – professional journalists might have to accept more willingly a reflexive notion of objectivity that provides for a journalism which has the ability to express and enable the affective engagements that lie at the heart of genuine witnessing.</p>
