<p><italic>Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation</italic> edited by Kate Bornstein and S. Bear Bergman is a compilation of writings by a diverse group of authors discussing the experiences and voices of the new generation of transpeople. The book begins with a conversation between Bornstein and Bergman in which they discuss their own experiences of the transcommunity, the changes in the movement throughout the years, the greater visibility of the community and of transpeople, and their hopes for the new generation. Bornstein and Bergman are excited about the direction of the new generation of gender outlaws and want to showcase the diversity of the transcommunity. The objective of the book is then to illustrate and demonstrate what the new generation of gender outlaws look like and how they reinvent, change and use the culture of the previous generation.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five parts. In part 1, ‘Do I look like an outlaw to you?’, authors discuss what it is like to be a gender outlaw in situations where the gender binary is strict. In part 2, ‘Being reconfigured is not the same as being reimagined’, the authors focus more on the issues of gender and bodies, gender being a choice, gender being confusing and complicated, and doing away with gender identification. Hormone treatment, transitioning and medical procedures such as orchidectomy, gonadectomy and GRS (Genital Reassignment Surgery) are also discussed. The fluidity of gender is both a discussion and a critique of doing, performing and living gender in a society that imposes strict rules on its participants. Part 3, ‘… which is why I’m as cute as I happen to be’, focuses on life experiences of the authors, such as growing up in a poor working-class home, living well in a world that is less accepting of transpeople, their sexual experiences, and being in drag. Part 4, ‘It might not be a picnic, but there’s a great buffet’, discusses characteristics important to the contributing authors’ lives, such as pregnancy, being able to come to terms with one’s identity, and being able to play with gender. Lastly, part 5, ‘And still we rise’, discusses the trials and tribulations of the authors that have come to define who they are. Part 5 is also about finding one’s voice as transgender, cultural traditions that impact one’s life, and the privilege of normative gender. Overall, <italic>Gender Outlaws</italic> offers a critique of the gender binary, as well as a new relationship between body, mind and gender. Gender is explained as more than cultural norms and genitalia. Gender can be a shifting identity, a transformation, an emotional state, and, perhaps most of all, a choice.</p>
<p>What is fascinating about <italic>Gender Outlaws</italic> is that it is a cultural space for the transcommunity to express their experiences, feelings, struggles, relationships, bodies, outlook on gender, the existing binary of gender theory, and so much more. The writings are very personal and reflect the changing dynamics of gender through the eyes of the gender outlaws. At the same time, the authors question the gender binary as a whole through their personal stories. Poems, cartoons, and historical accounts are also embedded in the pages. The new generation of gender outlaws also mentions their mentors, lovers, support groups and role models. The language used by the contributing authors also points to the diversity of the transcommunity. Whether one identifies as transgender, tranny, male in a biologically female body, a mixed-gender person, FTM (female-to-male), MTF (male-to-female), genderqueer, a transsexual woman or man, a boi, a gurl, in transition, a she-male, or as intersexed, <italic>Gender Outlaws</italic> provide a space for the next generation to create their own history and their own definitions. In doing so, the book becomes a powerful tool in telling the world what it means to be a gender outlaw.</p>
<p><italic>Gender Outlaws</italic> can be fairly complicated, abstract and at times difficult to comprehend because of the rapidly changing nature of the language used by the transcommunity, the opposition to what we know as normative definitions of gender and sometimes sex, along with the often opposing views and attitudes related to gender, language, feelings of being born in the ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ body. This is especially so if one is not very accustomed to the language used or the diverse views on gender presented here. At the same time, I get the feeling that this is the point. The gender outlaws are forming, discussing and changing their own history, culture, and views on sex and gender. Whether one is already part of the transcommunity, an ally or supporter, or simply wants to know more, <italic>Gender Outlaw</italic>s is a good source to use in acquiring an understanding of transpeople and gender outlaws.</p>
