<speaker>Jon Cruz (JC):</speaker>
<p>If you could reach back to when you began to take up intellectual work, and finding yourself plugging into the academy, it was a period in which cultural studies was starting to take hold in the United States. What sorts of things were going on in your head at that point in time as you began such engagement?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Andrew Ross (AR):</speaker>
<p>I came to this country 30 years ago, just as Ronald Reagan was about to be elected [president], though I didn’t come as a card-carrying member of cultural studies. I’d been educated in Britain and was certainly aware of the debates around cultural studies, but if anything I was more attached to the non-populist, avant-garde wing which, in Britain at least, was associated with the Screen School of film studies and film theory. Taking on the challenges of cultural studies was indissociable for me from taking on cultural citizenship in the US, and finding my bearings in quite a different political culture than the one I’ve been brought up in – so I wasn’t carrying a set of methods and ideas with me and then applying them to the American landscape. I was learning my own way through that landscape on a daily basis, and that’s when cultural studies became experientially useful to me. That said, I was also working within an American studies framework, which had a longstanding tradition of research in cultural studies. My book <italic>No Respect</italic>, which is really a work of intellectual history, was an effort to fuse the insights of British cultural studies with this longer American studies discipline. As far as academic locations go, American studies, which dates to the 1930s as an interdisciplinary field, became a haven for me, as it did for other US scholars like Hazel Carby and Michael Denning, who had both trained at Birmingham. American studies is a field where no one asks to see your papers or your credentials, and so there isn’t the same fighting over turf that you find in ‘four-walled’ disciplines.</p>
<p>When I first settled in the US, it was at the University of Illinois, at Champaign-Urbana, which at the time was a sort of crucible for the development in the US of cultural studies: the two mega-conferences there, on Marxism and culture and on cultural studies itself, had a great impact. My own doctoral dissertation had been about American poetry (the poetry scene was what had brought me to the US in the first place), and so it was in literature that I secured my first full-time job at Princeton. No one ever asked me to teach poetry at Princeton, so I took this as a serendipitous opportunity to move out of the literary field very early and slide over into the American studies programme there, where I felt much more comfortable, addressing larger issues about the relationship between politics, society and culture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>So you had a literary background that allowed you to move into American studies, as American studies also had a very strong literary tradition as well, and of literature and history?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Traditionally, literature and history are the two anchors of the field, but by the time I was moving into American studies, there was more and more input from social sciences – and even the literary folks who were involved in American studies always had a much broader sociohistorical approach than scholars of British or other European literatures.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>So you were ready to make some kind of move, an expansive move. Not only did you relocate from one place in the world to another, but also you started to move into a discipline that, to my understanding, gave you some kind of broader licence, a different kind of freedom to be able to explore and grow new problems. So what was that like, when you begin to start – this was at Princeton?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Princeton is known and prized as an institution where things don’t really change much.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Ossification?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>We used to refer to Princeton as ‘a womb with a view’. But at that time I was there, from the mid-1980s, there was a kind of melting moment in the humanities at least, where it was a little easier to move through the breaches and the fortifications around particular disciplines, and have dialogues with work in others. It was more hard going at Princeton because American studies was one of the very few interdisciplinary programmes, and it was an undergraduate initiative – and that’s one of the reasons I left Princeton; there were no graduate interdisciplinary programmes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it’s hard to get traction with new ideas if you don’t have that. But your background with Screen, with its emphasis and, I believe, its blending of psychoanalytic theory and Marxian impulses, Athusserian structuralism – that seems like an odd kind of intellectual combination to bring to Princeton, frankly. American studies I suppose was, as you say, a haven for such – at least allowing you to have those interests to be appreciated, and to take it in directions that you wanted to?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Yes. It was valuable in helping me become more of a generalist, and to avoid the academic trap of specialization. When people ask me at smart parties what my discipline is, I often say that I’m an agnostic, which is just a flip way of describing what used to be called a generalist.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>But the very idea or impulse to not want to identify with specialization, I think, had a larger set of reinforcing currents out there with regard to cultural studies, American studies and interdisciplinary studies. So you found a place to be able to stretch, to not be tied to some reified notion of what knowledge should look like, how it should be produced. So you moved on from Princeton to…?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>I moved on from Princeton to New York University [NYU] because I was given the opportunity there to have more of an institutional impact by refashioning an American studies graduate unit. The NYU programme had been around for decades, and it was very much a traditional version of American studies. It had more than 80 students at the time that I took over, but there were no resources – only a file cabinet, not even an office.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>So, did you get a van to drive around in, that you could borrow from a failing rock band?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Maybe some old amps! My mandate there was to reinvent the programme by developing a new curriculum and hiring core faculty. NYU is a much more entrepreneurial environment than Princeton: seldom do folks invoke tradition, sometimes to the detriment of intellectual life, but usually to the betterment. The new kind of American studies that we envisaged would be a home for intellectual activism. We made that quite clear to the students that we recruited: they were coming to the programme to do the kind of work they couldn’t do outside of the academy, but if the work they did there only stayed within the academy, then they weren’t doing the right thing. So we looked for students who had either an activist background or had a strong potential for intellectual activism. Some students ran with the label and did what they could under that rubric, while others ignored it and pursued a more straightforward academic career. It seemed important at the time to provide a programme open to that sort of thing. To some degree I felt that cultural studies more broadly wasn’t necessarily doing so, and that as an enterprise it was much more concerned with finding a legitimate institutional location within the academy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>That’s an issue that started to emerge after the moment that corresponded with the large conference on Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture in the early 1980s. By the latter part of the 1980s cultural studies seems to have been incorporated here and there, and there was a lot of discussion with regard to what the fate of it was going to be, what was happening to it. There were a lot of different angles, different struggles over the identification of cultural studies in relation to questions of politics and engagement in things that weren’t simply reducible to fine-tuning the academic world. So at NYU, in your experience with that process, there was tension with cultural studies, as it was becoming something more solidified intellectually and academically in relationship to other kinds of currents that you were hoping to push? So, about this juncture: what was the relationship between American studies and cultural studies writ large?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>I think that’s probably a good way of describing it. There was a degree of tension within American studies because the impact of cultural studies was affecting a lot of disciplines. In addition, and outside of the orbit of the academy, that moment was really the high point of the culture wars, where intellectuals were being drawn into this broader, highly politicized debate about the shape of US national culture – and that wasn’t necessarily a bad debate, even though it was not on our terms. Marx said that people make history under conditions not of their own making. It was not a context that anyone trained in cultural studies could have anticipated, but it was a theatre that we should have been well equipped to act in. In the degree to which we made a little bit of history, the culture wars were a very important and neglected part of the historical map of cultural studies. The Birmingham template, after all, was for training intellectuals to choose how and when to intervene publicly. More often than not, the context just creeps up on you, and you get hit over the head with it and you have to respond.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Speaking of the Birmingham School, and the historically specific conditions under which cultural studies got organized: being in the United States, seeing some of that being grafted on, which involved a dislocation and a translocation into the American context, seems to have engendered a lot of tensions about where it could and couldn’t go, where it should and shouldn’t go. My sense is that this really resonated with the juncture in American society, that in some ways it has a relationship with the Birmingham school’s historical focus on labour as well as ‘race’. But in the United States it is very peculiar, because of the period coming on the heels of the civil rights movement and the incursion of gender and ethnic components into the academy. These new subjectivities are being absorbed, even if not substantively, precisely at the same time that cultural studies has been grafted onto the American academy.</p>
<p>How did those working in the academy at that time perceive that juncture? Stuart Hall talks about the British case, where ‘race’ and gender begin to impact and make very problematic the older notions of the Marxian canon, which tended to have a tin ear to some of those issues. But in the American context and with American studies, the formative role of these new intellectual havens that allowed for rethinking to take hold, must have been quite an interesting moment in academe?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>There was a tendency during that period for US academics to import a lot of European theory lock, stock and barrel. So cultural studies was often seen as one more European school (always a superior one) to be flown in and applied in an often inorganic fashion – which, quite frankly, is the worst thing you can do with theory. Theory, for me, has always a serviceable way of getting from A to B, but it’s not the only way and a lot of people get stuck inbetween, spinning their wheels. So I started to make my own empiricist turn by delving into the cultural genealogies that I found here, in the American grain, as it were.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>It’s interesting to raise this tension, because there are these odd moments that seemingly play in the background of American studies and cultural studies, with developments on American soil that get actually picked up in reverse order, of being imported to Britain. For example, if you take Dick Hebdige’s work on subcultures, and you read that along with Paul Willis’ ethnographic studies, it takes you back to see the importance of criminologists like Jock Young and a larger group of early critical criminologists who were re-reading the Chicago School and, to some extent, were weaned on Chicago school critical deviancy theory; but they also deepened that appropriation in a major way through a Marxian critique of the whole penal system. So there are such prior exchanges. One can read cultural studies simply as a British import that is transplanted into the US, while at the same time some of those thought processes in their critical strands were actually deeply engaged in American thought, and even more broadly in resonation with the larger crises of Cold War politics, labour struggles, race relations, those sociological studies of deviancy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I absolutely agree with that. The sociological lineage that you are describing there is much less acknowledged and is very important. Most people have focused on the reaction against the Parsonian paradigms, and have neglected what was coming in from other American schools of social thought.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Yes, the schisms ran deep in the US between Parsonian sociology and urban sociology. It was very strong.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>In addition, I was also looking, in <italic>No Respect</italic>, at the debt that cultural studies owned to the very public postwar debate in the US about popular or mass culture in the US. That debt was not fully acknowledged, because the Birmingham School was so focused on the British scene, aimed as it was at intervening in the politics of national culture.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the reasons I never wanted to work in a cultural studies department per se. In fact when, five years ago, we created our new department at NYU, we called it Social and Cultural Analysis. Our deans just assumed it would be called the Cultural Studies department, but we rejected that outright. We didn’t want the baggage that comes with cultural studies.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Why did you think that the administration wanted that sort of logo?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>They just assumed it’s what we would want, or that it was something that they could market more easily. We chose a bland name so that it could function as a blank to be filled in by whatever we did.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Let’s open this up a bit because it’s kind of an interesting intellectual juncture. You have an administration at NYU supporting cultural studies and it isn’t alone; there are other places in the US where the term ‘cultural studies’ is seen as the new programmatic land grab, a new place to produce, attract and grow; and the American academy is very much interested in growing things all the time, particularly if it picks up and gets student interest. Tuition follows, careers are made. Yet at the same time, there is this growing sense – and I think you fingered it – that the term, notion or incorporation of cultural studies is necessary but not sufficient, or useful but not necessarily reducible and self-contained. There is somehow in your reflections on the developing situation at NYU, of something other or of something more that needs to be done, of other things that need to be challenged, and simply wearing the label of cultural studies was a problem that had its own tensions. Could you say a little bit about that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>That’s a fair question, and so I would respond by talking about the trajectory of my own research. <italic>No Respect</italic> was probably closer to the consensus view of cultural studies than any of my other books. So afterwards, my research tacked toward field topics like technology and environmentalism, and my next two books – <italic>Strange Weather</italic> and <italic>The Chicago Gangster Theory of Life –</italic> were more at the margins of cultural studies at the time (ditto for my work in the last decade or so in urbanism and labour). If you flip through the anthologies of cultural studies, you will search in vain for contributions that are labour-focused. I was looking back over Raymond Williams’s work not that long ago, in connection with some article I was writing, and I realized that in his many writings he hardly ever addresses culture itself as a form of labour or livelihood – which is kind of interesting, if you consider how dominant Labour politics was in that era. Probably one of the reasons for this is that the early cultural studies Left had to think its way beyond Labour, because so much of the Left was Labour-based. If, like Williams, you were coming out of an industrial working-class culture, Labour was the air that you breathed. I grew up in the industrial belt in Scotland and it was very like that. So maybe there was an overcompensation in the effort really to wrench the Left’s mentality away from labourism.</p>
<p>Did that overcompensation lead to a real rift on the Left between the social justice and the cultural justice people? This face-off has much written about: I’ve always felt from an early point that my work would be most useful if I tried to bridge those two wings.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>You raise an interesting problem, because there seems to have been a lot of concern, though I’m not sure where it went in the American case, with the notion of overcompensation – I like your word. It seems to get at some of the criticisms of the response to orthodox Marxism by flying off into the far ends of the other direction, where culture is seen as the counter-side to the older notion of the mode of production, and given an autonomy that some insist on while being strongly rejected by others. In some ways that rectifying of orthodoxy can end up with the kind of sheer culturalism that has no traffic whatsoever in the labour process, and is increasingly or entirely caught up in signification only. So there’s been that kind of antagonism or tension regarding how you bring this into conversation or at least hold it in play.</p>
<p>This has always been something like the ideal way of addressing the problem of cultural studies, for it is not an ‘either/or’ but a holding of both in tension. There is that development, a tendency, that in many ways frontloads the shift toward reading culture or looking at signification (semiotics gets pulled into this big-time in analyses) to the point where people are wondering again about labour and class – and your work seems to have, in many ways, very clearly sought to retrieve those tensions and dimensions of labour, class, social justice, away from just a sheer discussion of the popular or popular culture as a signifying practice in and of itself. So I’m curious how you saw yourself in such work. Did you see yourself swimming upstream? Against the tide of the larger so-called notion that there is a cultural studies model that really doesn’t get at that tension, that has moved beyond or has gotten over the ‘labour metaphysic’, so to speak, as C. Wright Mills earlier had argued? What was that like for you to make those moves and, if so, to be still engaged in the problems and impulses of cultural studies?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Not too difficult, if only because I have never checked myself against whatever consensus there might be in cultural studies. Labour has come back into the purview of cultural studies because new economic formations have caught up with the field in the form of the so-called creative industries, which were presaged by the research done by cultural policy scholars like Tony Bennett from the 1990s. Over the last decade or so, government attention in many countries around the world has swung around to focus on creatives as the entrepreneurs of the moment, as model workers of the New Economy. With regard to Williams’ neglect, who could have predicted that only a few decades hence, artists and writers would be no longer at the margins of the productive economy, as they had been for centuries, but at its very centre? That transition has generated a lot of research about the precarious conditions of modern work, insofar as we have seen the massification or the industrialization of the profile of creative labour with which artists coped for so long, albeit as a small minority community.</p>
<p>In addition, I think the other way that labour has come back is through the academic labour movement. Scholars have had to respond to what is happening in our own backyard with the casualization of the academic profession. Higher education has become a classic ‘doughnut economy’, with a small core of high-wage professionals and a vast army of contingents in the outer layer. This is quite typical of other industrial sectors, but no profession has degraded itself so rapidly and so pervasively as higher education.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>The issue of labour and art represents some really interesting problems. The reinsurgent rediscovery of aesthetics and artistic production as labour strikes me as an odd moment in this juncture in which the traditional materialist notion of labour has undergone a tremendous eradication and decimation. I suppose in lay or popular terminology, we would simply sum that up by the word ‘outsourcing’. There’s been a tremendous flight of jobs which many, many people have been concerned about since the deindustrialized ‘rust belt’ era of the 1970s, and now the dislocation of labour is deeply chronic and pervasive. The transformations seem deeply institutionalized in the form of that vacuum where jobs once resided but now have disappeared. Yet the outsourcing of aesthetic sensibility, of expressivity, of art, perhaps is not easily done. Jobs can be shipped out, but people remain behind – with their sensibilities, their aesthetics. Aesthetic, creative sensibilities don’t simply go away. You can’t do that so easily to aesthetic sensibility. You can’t do that with emotional work that is lived every day. So I wonder if you have thoughts about that juncture with regard to labour or production being easily shipped away while other aspects of society remain left behind, left holding the bag with regard to intellectual work and artistic problems, as jobs go but people remain stuck here? I guess the question is, given the problem of economic erosion and loss of jobs, of outsourcing in the globalization process, what does that do to the cultural sphere, which is about how these processes get understood, framed as intellectual challenges, and where intellectual work as labour now has to confront these issues as well? It strikes me that some of your work has sidled up to those issues and tries to unpack them. Could you could say a bit more about this juncture, this split?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>The question revolves around whether creative work can be industrialized and routinized in the same way as any other production process. A lot of the evidence suggests that it can be, and that in some respects already has been. The closer you get to an industrial model, with film and media production, you can see the intensification of the division of labour, with the outsourcing to cheaper locations not only of the more routine work, but also some of the talent. So, too, in the realm of digital labour, we have seen the growth of distributed labour models through crowdsourcing and other tools, whereby high-quality design, ideas and writing can be gotten largely for free if the tasks are advertised as fun. That doesn’t require outsourcing to cheaper locations – the participants can be anywhere, as long as they are wired.</p>
<p>At the launch of the creative industries paradigm, it was argued that the creative jobs could not be sent offshore and that the value-added components would be contributing to the domestic economy. That same promise was made to the tech industry in the 1990s, but it proved to be one that capital owners would not keep. There’s no reason to expect anything different from the so-called creative industries, especially when more sophisticated digital platforms facilitate sourcing from far and wide at minimal cost.</p>
<p>In this country, where creative industry policymaking is less visible, most of the action in this sector occurred around Richard Florida’s ‘creative city’ idea, which had a powerful impact on urban managers desperate for some kind of turnaround strategy. It was a much cheaper urban policy than the business of trying to attract high-tech investors, which required lavish tax subsidies and infrastructural guarantee. Most attractive, however, was the proven impact that the residence of creatives had on raising rents and property value.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Within urban contexts?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Within urban downtowns, in the pre-recession period, which were marked out as recruitment locations for creative workers. In the wake of the housing crash, the legacy of that arts-based recipe for economic development remains to be seen. My response is that it will probably be similar to the aftermath of the dot com boom. When I wrote <italic>No Collar</italic> – which was an ethnography of new media workplaces – my working hunch was that the business models of these dot com companies were not the most important part of what was going on. The money deals got all the media attention, but it was actually the organization of the workplaces and what I called the ‘no-collar work mentality’ that would prove to be more enduring. I was documenting the early adolescence of that mentality, and today you can find its more mature or normative form in a whole host of other workplaces. In a similar vein, I would say much the same about the creative city model. The speculative aspects of it – directly tied to gentrification – generated a crash, but what will survive and become more normative is the expedient approach to creative work as a source of economic value that can be siphoned off and mined in ways that have very little to do with traditional ideas about the place and function of creative expression.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>This raises the issue of having entered this juncture where a tremendous amount of transformation has occurred, with many struggles over how to realign political, economic, social, cultural sensibilities that are ultimately going to transform into some new modalities by which life gets reorganized in the United States. How do you see, or would you be willing to hedge your bets that there are, certain emerging places within the culture where this gets flashed as a kind of hotspot or kind of place of intensification? The idea of creative work, for example, seems to have that kind of ‘schizophrenic’ moment where you have a cultural dimension that comes with a tremendous amount of aesthetic reconfiguration, new politics, new mobilizations around problems of cultural ownership has struggled over. I’m thinking about everything that happened after Napster, with petty cultural creators emerging as the recording industry finds itself on the ropes now. We are now living in a period in which more music is being made than any time hitherto: less than 10 percent of the people making music actually do it for a living, yet they do it anyway. The phenomenology of a desire and an aesthetic is there. I wonder where you would see these moments of cultural conflagration creatively and perhaps criticality emerging, given all the other things that we know have happened under outsourcing, globalization of capital, runaway systems, etc.?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>The proliferation of amateur effort and uncompensated labour that you described in the musical field is occurring in every corner of the culture, insofar as all aspects of our daily life, not just the expressive but also the emotional and relational, become available for capital accumulation. One way of thinking about this is to analyse the longstanding effort on the part of capital to move work out of the realm of paid production and into the realm of unpaid consumption. The rise of self-service is a major part of that story: consumers had to be persuaded and educated to take on more tasks for themselves. Today, this labour involves massive amounts of our time and energy invested in market research, in the assembly of products and the customization of applications. That transfer of work has been fairly consistent, but in the years of the Great Recession we have seen a rise in returns for capital. US corporate profits have never been higher, while the real levels of joblessness are up near 17 percent. How can that be? One of the reasons has to do with is the growing reliance on new kinds of free labour to boost the balance sheet of companies that are savvy enough to harvest it. Hard evidence for this footprint is not so easy to muster, but the strong anecdotal record suggests it is large enough to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>Free or token-wage labour is increasingly available though a variety of channels: crowdsourcing, data-mining or other sophisticated digital techniques for extracting rents from users or participants; expanded prison labour programmes; the explosion of unpaid near-obligatory internships in every white-collar sector; and the whole gamut of contestant volunteering that has transformed so much of our commerce in culture into an amateur talent show, with jackpot stakes for a few winners and hard-luck ‘schwag’ for everyone else. The web-enabled developments have attracted the most media attention, not least because the tidal surge of free online content directly threatens the livelihoods of professional writers and artists. But the TV reality and amateur talent shows are the most emblematic of these developments.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is such a cheap production model – there are no costly sets or stars.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>There is no going back to the professional pay scales for performers and writers that were the mainstay of high-wage union work in that corner of the culture industries; but other sectors are following suit, especially as they transition into digital formats where it is normative to expect volunteer labour as a customary price of entry.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Italian operaists argued that capital owners would be taking advantage of what they called the ‘social factory’ in order to escape from factory-bound conflicts with unionized and often militant workers’ organizations. According to this thesis the work discipline of the factory is exported far beyond its bounded walls, and a large share of the work of production is subsequently and increasingly performed by the unpaid in the interstices of society. Consequently, the entire content of our daily lives – our net subjectivity – and not just our workplace toil, becomes raw material for capital accumulation. At the time this thesis was put forth it was an avant-garde analysis, but now we can see everywhere the impact of the transfer of work outside of the traditional sites of production.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>This raises an interesting question. Cultures and societies have to broker the hard work of interpreting where we are, what to make of the moment and where we go. On the material level, there’s been all these powerful realignments that circle back to the globalization of capital and outsourcing, and along with neoliberalism we now contend with a lot of up-ending of the old-world relations. You mentioned elsewhere how employers don’t know how to behave as employers anymore because they don’t need to and are not expected to, for in some ways the scenario has abandoned both employer and worker. If there was an older fidelity to labour, it has evaporated. So employers now seem like goldfish in a bowl, looking outward or upward, waiting for the next moment for the new food, the next structural infusion, to drop down, to rethink where they are going to be. They are not oriented to labour, but to external crises and a scenario of seriously lessened production.</p>
<p>So my question is in many ways a culturalist one at this juncture, and it brings us back to the old but nagging problem of what is the relationship between base and superstructure. What is the relationship between the inescapable problem of productivity or lack thereof, and the everyday brokering of what life means as it is necessarily refracted into cultural dilemmas? If we take some of the problems you have raised recently – of steel workers in serious labour crisis, who turn to challenge the state’s trade policies – how might those struggles also get mapped onto cultural crises? How do such problems get refracted culturally in terms of the ways in which people in everyday life see or do not see such issues? Or does the culture constantly refract through obscuring, denying and with subterfuge and obfuscation? Does culture offer rupturing possibilities – or engender usable irruptions? Or are there elements of both extremes? If somebody were to come to you, a cultural studies student, and say: ‘I want to study the crisis today’, where do they look? Where would they look in order to cross the line, to bridge the gap between the materialist crisis and the psychic crisis?</p>

<p>It used to be said that bosses needed workers, but that workers didn’t need bosses. Does this yawning disjunct between profits and joblessness mean that the bosses have learned how to get by without workers? Not exactly, no: they still need workers, but not expensive ones in the North. So, they are learning how to use the new digital tools to expropriate uncompensated or discount labour wherever possible. More and more, labour inputs are coming from users, participants or donors that do not show up as employees in any traditional sense of the term. As for the world of manufacturing, that is a more well-known story about the internationalization of production and the race to the bottom of cheap labour markets.</p>
<p>As far as answering that student who wants to study crises, I’d have to direct them to the climate crisis. After all, it is the mother of all of system-wide problems and it is clearly connected to our traditions of thinking about the crises of capitalism. Nicholas Stern (he of the influential Stern Report) described climate change as the biggest failure of market capitalism that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Our responses have to come at all levels, of course, even in customary daily life where sometimes the resistance is strongest. To the degree to which we associate environmental action with sacrifice, it’s very difficult in a consumer society to get adequate responses, because for most people the behaviour modifications being proposed connote a lower standard of living. I’m more wary of the faith that some activists put in technological solutions and fixes. The mentality of some climate activists is that carbon levels have to be reduced as soon as possible, and by any means necessary. The quickest vehicle is the best, even if it means putting democracy on hold until this problem can be resolved. Any solutions are worthy of consideration, but not if they put us on undemocratic pathways – that way leads to an authoritarian death march. I’m aligned with the climate justice movement in this regard. Moving ahead is an abolitionist matter: how to abolish the debt owed to those suffering most from the legacy of high-carbon industrialization. But delivering environmental justice to those bearing the largest burden should bring benefits to all, not just the aggrieved. In this respect, I see climate change as an opportunity: we need to approach the crisis as an opportunity to bring more equity into the picture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>That makes a lot of sense. The urgency seems to be appearing on the horizon and we can begin to name them and see them some kind of arena within which they might get played out. So, to go back to a problem: if the heavens aren’t going to deliver solutions based on some kind of narrow wishful thinking about some sort of technicist option, this raises a backlash with regard to how the culture gets brokered with regard to politics, because ultimately consensus or force gets realigned in ways that are responsive to the juncture. So to put it to you this way: there is this notion that just a green revolution, as a response to environmental crisis – as well as a response to the gutting of traditional labour – is not going to be enough as a way out. If I have understood you correctly, you have noted that there is no way that an economy of scale based on simply green production is going to accommodate the massive labour needs that are already present, here and elsewhere – and that suggests that the culture may need to brace itself, if it is unwittingly headed for a very serious political crisis, as it assumes that we can simply just do more work in achieving green transformations. What it suggests is a tendency to overplay and believe in too much of that, and then we find ourselves left holding the bag when green innovations can’t lift us out of an already decimated sphere of labour and production. This, to me, suggests that this disjunction in the making would be part of the calculus behind eco-fascism that you have alluded to; it points to a real crisis and a foreseeable response: ‘We tried that, it’s not enough. So now we have to really buckle down.’</p>
<p>Following this may be the return of capital to a totally destitute sphere of domestic labour, where capital comes back to rediscover labour it had hitherto abandoned and push in the process for an abandonment of the old pay scale, such as the minimum wage. Those safety net features become fetters to a redeployment of labour, with minimum wage laws no longer in the way. We hear this already, contemporary politicians say: ‘We don’t need minimum wage laws; they are simply a fetter these days.’ This was raised in the recent mid-term elections in the US. The very notion of what’s left of the social contract is up on the auction block. The urgencies are increasingly there.</p>
<p>So I wonder how you might see this in response to the crisis, the climate crisis, the response to the mobilization that attaches itself vis-à-vis the green ideology and the productivism around that which includes the notion that it is necessary, but not sufficient. How do we broker this in terms of our social thinking?</p>
</speech>

<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Advocates of green capitalism like Paul Hawken, Jonathan Porritt and Amory and Hunter Lovins, believe that the best way of preserving nature is to put a price on it. Renewable alternatives would thrive, for example, if non-renewable resources were traded at their true price, rather than in their heavily subsidized form. In this view, growth can be maintained if it is driven by sustainable development. Others tend to see capitalism as inimical to nature: capitalism must grow or die, and so sustainable development is really just a recipe for capitalism to survive in the short term. From a climate justice perspective, green capitalism rests on the premise that the crisis can be resolved solely by stimulating the upmarket slice of the population for whom green innovations are researched and marketed. This is the LOHAS [lifestyles of health and sustainability] market segment, which is about one in four adults in the US and globally amounts to $900bn. It’s entirely possible that green capitalism can sustain legitimacy on the basis of production for that particular fraction while extracting profits at a rate of growth that is comparable to what we’ve seen over the last century or so. But most of the reparative outcome of this effort will be outdone by neglect of the 80 percent of the population who will not have the income to buy into the economy of eco-options and green gizmos. Worst still, this scenario will reinforce the hoarding of resources within highly fortified islands that are eco-showpieces, while other populations are relegated to sacrifice zones. It’s a scenario that applies not across the international climate divide, but also within the borders of wealthy nation-states. Our cities are places of extreme inequality where some populations are living the green American dream on one side of the tracks, and another group is trapped in pestilence on the other side, unable to breathe clean air or drink clean water. Van Jones has described this, quite accurately in my view, as eco-apartheid.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Even widely read populist blog sites, like the <italic>Huffington Post</italic> – Arianna Huffington actually – talks about the ‘Third World’ in the US. So there’s a popular discourse that is pondering such scenarios.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Yes, that’s a perception that has almost been a given wisdom among sociologists for some time. So, too, the recent debt problems that have destabilized the Eurozone and now, increasingly, the US itself, are evidence of chickens coming home to roost, since the ‘debt trap’ is something traditionally associated with developing countries. Debt leveraging is the only way of propping up an unsustainable economy, whether you see it through the lens of capitalism or from the point of view of non-renewable resources.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>So it’s not about a reinvigoration of the social contract, but rather in some ways an ideology that legitimizes capitalism under crisis, by giving it a kind of environmental panacea which doesn’t necessarily translate into any kind of broad and widespread penetration of thought aimed at reconstituting how social equity could be advanced. Recently, the Republican strategist Karl Rove was addressing a group of Wall Street financial and banking representatives, and he seemed to gleefully state that ‘Environmentalism is dead. We don’t have to worry about that anymore, because we were getting past that now’ – as if that battle had been won, turned into a moral fiction. Environmentalism was rendered moot because it had been effectively turned into a moral fiction of non-believability. Rove can count on some in the population who don’t believe the scientists anymore. They are not to be believed. So, how might we question how these ideological problems are struggled over, and what are the modes of meaning, as Stuart Hall once put it, of what those preferred interpretations become – which ones become hegemonic or salient, or still remain in the game? But clearly the new sort of buzzword with the Republicans is ‘We won that fight’. So, what to make of struggles over who’s going to use these terms, to what advantage and for what strategies?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>That might be a plausible conclusion if one considers the popularization of climate change denial. A massive amount of money has been spent by the oil and coal lobbies to change popular consciousness, and the success of that investment is beyond any doubt. So, too, the outsourcing of our dirtier industries to East Asia has made pollution sources less and less visible – and now that we have swung from a brief period of eco-Keynesianism to a regime of austerity politics, we are in the worst possible circumstances for pushing ecological concerns. In times of austerity, they are always perceived in terms of affluent quality-of-life liberals asking for concessions from working people. Without the promise of green jobs, these policies spell out sacrifice to the popular classes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I’m not sure that denial is the correct analysis, however. Elites have known about the unsustainability of capitalist growth since the <italic>Limits to Growth</italic> report was published in 1972. The message was not ignored – it got through. One way of interpreting the class polarization of the last 40 years is to see it as a massive effort at hoarding on the part of elites, who have been busy squirreling away resources from the commonweal. Not denial, but hoarding.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Andrew, there is a different direction that I want to ask you about. Your reflections on critical approaches to culture that do not abandon aspects of social and economic life, as a sheer culturalist approach might, seem to make a lot of sense. But I want to come back to something that was raised in a recent talk you gave at Santa Barbara. During the question and answer session, there was a question raised that went to the problem of ‘race’. The question suggested that in the American context, the new indispensable enemy was Latinos and the immigration issue, I think. (I commented to you immediately after your talk that I didn’t think this argument was sufficient.) For we seem to already have settled on an enemy – a crisis not so much about ‘race’, but also about religion. There’s been a tremendous amount of anxiety since 9/11 that has been amped to such an incredible crescendo around the ‘Muslim crisis’ and its place within the American psyche. It seems to me that this development has perhaps crowded out lots of other debates about labour, and has become a new way in which we organize the way in which we talk about crisis today. I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on that. You live in New York: There’s been this tremendous amount of debate around proposed building of a Muslim cultural centre in Manhattan.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Not so much among New Yorkers, but from outsiders.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Ok. There is the tension now that is informed by religion: the crisis of American society versus the Muslim world or Christian versus Muslim. It seems to me that one can argue that that’s part of the larger tension out there now, and that it brokers significant dialogue around actual concrete problems.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it’s a good question, and there are two obvious responses. One explanation has to do with dependence on Gulf oil and US foreign policy in the region. The safe passage of crude through the Straits of Hormuz has been a fundamental part of national security policy since the Carter administration determined that the US should never again be held hostage by an OPEC embargo. The other window of analysis has to do with the structural need of powerful nations (especially garrison states) for enemies, domestic as well as overseas.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Or the search for a national purpose.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>They are intertwined, in the case of imperial powers. In the decade after the end of the Cold War the US had no discernable or adequate enemy, and it is a very dangerous thing for a major power not to have an enemy. So there was a lot of casting around for an appropriate one. China, of course, was a candidate, but the growth of the Chinese–American trading complex obviated that. An indispensable enemy was finally found – serendipitously, once could say, with the events of 9/11 and best of all from the perspective of national security hawks – and it was a potentially long-term enemy. The ‘War on Terrorism’, with its anti-Muslim foundation, does not have to ever end – unlike the Cold War, which was a finite face-off.</p>
<p>As we have seen the ‘War on Terror’ develop, there clearly is a great deal of overlap between these two explanations: the need to capture and maintain the flow of Gulf oil, and the need for an enemy Other. The result does not look like a simple base–superstructure phenomenon. When it is filtered through the racialized mindset of insular American populism, then it appears to take on a life of its own. The nativist component is much more visible in the case of cross-border migration from the South, and there is a stronger element of ‘forting up’ and hoarding associated with it, especially in a period of perceived resource scarcity like the present.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>What kinds of projects are you currently anticipating that you think you want to get your head into? Can you say a little bit about where those are coming from and where you want to go?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>I am currently finishing a book about urban sustainability in Phoenix, Arizona. Most of the urban sustainability literature is about the good guys: Portland, Curitiba, Freiburg, Malmo, Santa Monica – the successful models. I chose Phoenix because it is one of the world’s most environmentally and politically challenged cities. My working principle was that if Phoenix can become sustainable, then it can be done anywhere. The lessons to be drawn from its effort to become resilient may be applicable to semi-arid regions elsewhere that host the world’s fastest-growing cities. That’s where the biggest challenges are going to be, not necessarily in Seattle or San Francisco. The book was researched and written according to the method of scholarly reporting which I use in most of my book length projects. It’s a blend of ethnography and investigative journalism, and it’s one that I feel comfortable with in terms of my own voice and method.</p>
<p>We haven’t really talked about method in this interview, even though it’s a topic that bedevils cultural studies as a discipline. Leaving aside the broad and eclectic range of projects and practitioners, there is an abiding consensus that it is the object of your study, and the questions that arise from the object of your study that should determine the method that you use and not the other way around. Most four-wall disciplines train you in a method and then ask you to apply it. With the kind of work we do, it’s almost exactly the opposite. We isolate a topic that calls out for a politically fresh angle, and then figure out what are the most timely questions to ask. The methods you choose are simply the best way to get those answers.</p>
<p>I struggled with voice and method for a long, long time because I was trained, first of all, in textual analysis – which means I was trained as a reader, not as a listener, even though I grew up in a culture where storytelling is highly prized. Personal accounts or recollections were not well trusted in textual analysis, so my graduate training in armchair criticism and theory meant that I wasn’t a particularly good listener. I had to learn how to listen, and since I wasn’t trained as an ethnographer, I underwent a process of self-education by going into the field and learning to listen to other people. At the same time, I am always looking for a story, not unlike a journalist. Over the years, I realized that I felt more comfortable with this kind of approach, and I call it scholarly reporting. You’re not working on short deadlines or chasing headlines, like a journalist. But it also differs from four-walled disciplinary ideas about ethnography because you acknowledge the interest of journalists in the topic and field. Many scholarly ethnographers don’t recognize the degree to which journalists are rivals in the field of knowledge.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>When did you first latch onto that term, ‘scholarly reporting?’.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Fairly recently, but only because I was asked specifically to reflect on method. But I have been practising it since <italic>The Celebration Chronicles</italic>, a book I wrote while in residence in Disney’s central Florida town. There was a journalist couple from the <italic>New York Times</italic> also living there at the same time with the express purpose of writing a book. So we were both working, sort of neck and neck, with the same goal. Under the pressure of those circumstances, I think I developed a particular kind of voice that might not have happened otherwise, but I realized that it was one with which I felt comfortable.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JC:</speaker>
<p>Well, it has certainly been a wonderful discovery for you and for your readers.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AR:</speaker>
<p>Thank you.</p>
