<abstract>
<p>The majority of incidence and prevalence studies on childhood behavioral problems report the occurrence of mental health disorders under diagnostic categories. A few studies report prevalence of specific behavior problems identified through direct observation, teacher surveys, or analyses of office discipline referrals. However, each possesses limitations that may be informed by data that report the occurrence of specific behavior problems at the classroom level. The rapidly increasing use of multitiered models of prevention and intervention will benefit from data of prevalence of problem behaviors. The purpose of this study was to identify the “most common” problem behaviors in classrooms in the United States as reported by teachers on a broadband rating scale with a demographically representative sample of 3,600 children and adolescents. Results indicate 17 common problem behaviors of children and adolescents, each in four behavioral domains. Interesting findings include behaviors associated with anxiety, learning problems, and distractibility as the most commonly addressed by teachers in the classroom as opposed to the most frequently addressed by administrators, such as aggression. Implications are discussed for policy makers, teacher educators, administrators, and teachers.</p>

<body>
<p>Studies of incidence and prevalence for specific problem behaviors in public school classrooms are uncommon. Instead, prevalence studies typically focus on the occurrence of specific mental health disorders in children and adolescents. For example, the median prevalence estimate of anxiety disorders is 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426611421157">Costello, Egger, &amp; Angold, 2005</xref>), depressive disorders is 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426611421157">Costello, Mustillo, Erkanli, Keeler, &amp; Angold, 2003</xref>), conduct problems is 2% to 3.32% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426611421157">Roberts, Roberts, &amp; Xing, 2007</xref>), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 3% to 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426611421157">Costello et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Prevalence related to these types of diagnostic categories is used in national health studies to identify need in the population, and may inform national and statewide policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426611421157">Walker &amp; Melvin, 2010</xref>). However, the majority of services delivered to the 14% to 20% of children and adolescents with mental health disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426611421157">O’Connell, Boat, &amp; Warner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426611421157">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999</xref>) occur in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426611421157">Stein et al., 2003</xref>), and educators have challenged broad diagnostic classifications for instructional and service delivery model decisions, after finding that these diagnostic categories lack a certain utility for school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426611421157">Eckert, Hintze, &amp; Shapiro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426611421157">Shapiro &amp; Eckert, 1994</xref>) and preferred instead a more direct behavioral approach with utility for curriculum, instruction, school rules, and discipline policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426611421157">Cipani &amp; Schock, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Prevalence rates of specific problem behaviors in the classroom are beneficial to educators in three areas: (a) as base rates for response to intervention models, (b) in developing schoolwide expectations in positive behavioral support (PBS) initiatives, (c) and in the development of social, emotional, and behavioral standards.</p>
<p>First, for a comprehensive look at global consideration of risk within response to intervention (RtI) models, researchers and practitioners need a clear picture of prevalence and incidence rates or base rates of common problem behaviors. The most valid way to do this would be to use a data source that included many possibilities of childhood mental health problems (i.e., externalizing and internalizing) and problem behaviors using items at the individual behavior level that were indicators or had predictive validity for these more global constructs.</p>
<p>Second, knowledge of the prevalence of common problem behaviors at the classroom level has utility for PBS structure, one of the fastest growing and recently mandated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426611421157">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004</xref>) models for prevention and service delivery. Currently, schoolwide expectations are developed based on the opinions of students, staff, and community members with specific guidelines. The optimized use of these process guidelines likely depend on the skills and expertise of the team leaders or the PBS coaches. Knowledge of empirically supported national norms developed from common problem behaviors in the classroom might enhance schoolwide behavioral expectations by supporting practices that improve discipline as well as social, emotional, and behavioral well-being. In addition to or in support of educator opinion, the most common problem behaviors demonstrated by children and adolescents in public school classrooms can be the foundation for development of schoolwide behavioral expectations.</p>
<p>Third, prevalence rates at the classroom level can be applied as base rates in the development of social, emotional, and behavioral standards. Some states (e.g., Illinois) have social emotional learning standards for all public schools; other states (e.g., Texas, Colorado) are reported to be developing standards. Nationally representative prevalence data on the most common problem behaviors that are linked to social, emotional, and behavioral problems (globally) may be a source of information in the development of state standards.</p>
<sec id="section1-1063426611421157">
<title>Research Methodology for Prevalence</title>
<p>Research methodology for prevalence and incidence of specific problem behaviors includes direct observation, survey research, office discipline referral (ODR) analysis, and teacher ratings of behaviors. Ideally, direct observation (DO) by a variety of raters using a large, random, nationally representative sample of children and adolescents in the United States could identify the most common problem behaviors. However, DO is expensive and multiple raters would likely have differing opinions about appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Researchers using direct observation to measure incidence of maladaptive behaviors can more easily capture externalizing than internalizing behaviors. Furthermore, behavior counting would need a secondary analysis to determine the link to any mental health diagnostic category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1063426611421157">
<title>Direct Observation</title>
<p>To date, we are aware of no studies that have used multiple raters with nationally representative samples of children; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611421157">Snider et al. (2002)</xref> used DO methodology to evaluate childhood tics with a secondary purpose of identifying problem behaviors. Snider et al. used one to three raters who observed 553 children (K-6th grade) in a large racially and ethnically diverse upper-middle class suburban elementary school and found problem behaviors in 25.7% of the sample with higher rates during the winter months. Of this population, 73% demonstrated distractibility, 40% hyperactivity, 15% impulsivity, 12% anxiety, 11% disruptive behavior, and 5% aggressive behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1063426611421157">
<title>Surveys and Rating Scales</title>
<p>An alternate method of evaluating prevalence is measuring teacher perceptions with surveys and rating scales. Teachers are in a unique position to observe many children, are well versed in school and community expectations, and are focused on outcomes that lead to improved academic and life functioning. Although survey data is a more efficient method than DO, it is more temporally distant and may be less reliable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426611421157">Walter, Gouze, and Lim (2006)</xref> completed a mental health needs assessment with 119 inner city elementary teachers from six neighborhood schools representing a “sociodemographic spectrum” (p. 62) and found that 48% believed that disruptive classroom behavior was the largest behavioral concern in their schools. Walter et al. provided examples of disruptive behavior such as getting out of seat, talking out of turn, arguing, and failing to comply with rules and requests.</p>

<title>Office Discipline Referral Analyses</title>
<p>The common method of determining the most frequent problem behaviors demonstrated by students for using within PBS or RtI (for behavior) models is analyses of ODR using an existing data source with high levels of social validity but unknown prosperities of reliability. The reporting is more proximal to the occurrence of the problem behavior, which should make the data more accurate. Several published studies analyze ODRs to determine the most frequent reason for referrals. This is not to be confused with the most common problem behaviors at the classroom level, but instead the most frequent and teacher attention provoking and demanding behaviors.</p>
<p>Two large studies found the most frequent behaviors resulting in ODRs to be specific to developmental stages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611421157">Spaulding et al. (2010)</xref> analyzed 1,510 ODRs across the United States and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611421157">Kaufman et al. (2010)</xref> analyzed ODRs for 1,668 students in a large urban city. Across both studies, the most frequent behaviors resulting in ODRs were aggression (e.g., fighting and defiance) in elementary school, disrespect (e.g., defiance and disruption) in middle schools, and attendance issues (e.g., tardies, skipping, leaving the building) in high schools.</p>
<p>Two studies evaluated ODRs in elementary schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611421157">Putnam, Luiselli, Handler, and Jefferson (2003)</xref> analyzed 748 ODRs for 188 students in one public elementary school in Massachusetts and found the most frequent behaviors resulting in ODR were disruption, harassment, defiance, inappropriate language, and fighting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426611421157">Tidwell, Flannery, and Lewis-Palmer (2003)</xref> evaluated ODRs for 16 elementary schools from Oregon and Hawaii and found the most common reasons were defiance, disrespect, and fighting.</p>
<p>Limitations exist when evaluating prevalence of problem behaviors using ODR analyses. ODRs by definition are unlikely to reveal information about internalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426611421157">McIntosh, Campbell, Carter, &amp; Zumbo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426611421157">Nelson, Benner, Reid, Epstein, &amp; Currin, 2002</xref>). We are yet to see an ODR for anxiety or depression as that is not its purpose. Potentially ODR data may focus on high-intensity/ low-frequency events such as a student threat. Also, a recent survey of ODR data identified the majority of data related to minor infractions such as “tardies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611421157">Harrison, 2009</xref>), similar to the results shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611421157">Spaulding et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611421157">Kaufman et al. (2010)</xref> for high school students, indicating that attendance issues were the most frequent. ODR data have recently come under fire for the use of “double books” in states where reporting numerous ODRs can result in sanctions from the state board of education. Furthermore, teachers and administrators may not use the same criteria for initiating an ODR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426611421157">Morrison, Peterson, O’Farrell, &amp; Redding, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426611421157">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>), and ODRs often represent the culmination of many behavioral incidents rather than a marker of any specific behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426611421157">Sugai, Sprague, Horner, &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1063426611421157">
<title>Teacher Ratings on Broadband Assessment</title>
<p>Another less frequently applied method for acquiring this information would be to use teacher ratings of behavior on a broadband or multidimensional standardized assessment with a normally distributed sample. This is a broader and different source of information than determining which problem behaviors occur most commonly with problem students. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott and Schaefer (1996)</xref> used standardization data from the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426611421157">McDermott, 1994</xref>) with a demographically stratified sample of 5- to 17-year-olds to investigate rare and common problem behaviors demonstrated by American students. Results indicated 20 common problem behaviors within four categories: (a) disruptive and hyperactive (i.e., restlessness, moving, rapping, talking loudly, misbehaving when attending to others, and talking), (b) distractibility (i.e., answering and charging in without thinking, trying to gain attention, gazing around, playing with things, losing, or forgetting materials), (c) withdrawal or anxiety (i.e., rarely offering answers, needing encouragement, waiting to be greeted, appearing shy, wanting teachers’ interest but holding back, appearing aloof, sitting so quietly can’t tell if attending, and never seeking help), and (d) one behavior (i.e., not doing his or her work) that can be associated with learning problems.</p>
<p>With the recent increase in PBS and RtI three-tier models for behavior and the development of statewide social, emotional, and behavioral curriculum standards, a thorough understanding of the most common problem behaviors demonstrated by students in general education classrooms is needed. To date, minimal evidence is available identifying behaviors that teachers perceive as the greatest behavioral concerns with moderate evidence to identify the most frequent externalizing behaviors resulting in ODRs. However, only two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott &amp; Schaefer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611421157">Snider et al., 2002</xref>) identify specific problem behaviors demonstrated at the classroom level. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the literature by articulating the most common types of teacher-rated behavior problems identified through a standardized assessment of multiple dimensions of behavior.</p>

<p>Teachers in the study were recruited by site coordinators (i.e., educators with a degree in psychology or supervised by a psychologist; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611421157">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>). District-level permission was granted and teachers were recruited. Only teachers who agreed to participate were included. Site coordinators requested permission to assess all students. Using the pool of students with obtained consent forms, up to four students were selected from each class whose demographics matched the remaining sample needs. Teachers completed the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611421157">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>) teacher rating scale (TRS) and returned the forms to site coordinators. For clinic/hospital settings, the parent or a clinician identified a teacher at the student’s home campus who rated the child or adolescents’ behavior based on observation in the public school classroom. Teachers returned completed forms via mail to the site coordinator.</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<p>The BASC-2 is a comprehensive multimethod behavioral rating measure that assesses a range of adaptive skills and problem behaviors (i.e., activities of daily living, adaptability, aggression, anxiety, attention problems, atypicality, conduct problems, depression, functional communication, hyperactivity, leadership, learning problems, social skills, somatization, study skills, and withdrawal) in school and home settings with five components, two rating scales (i.e., parent and teacher), a self-report scale, a developmental history, and a system for direct observation of student behavior. The teacher rating scale for children (TRS-C) and the teacher rating scale for adolescents (TRS-A) were used in this study as our interest was in behaviors demonstrated by children and adolescents observed by teachers in general education settings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611421157">Reynolds and Kamphaus (2004)</xref> reported reliability for the BASC-2 TRS scores measured through tests of internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Internal consistency for the TRS-C (i.e., ages 6–11) was 0.88. Results of two tests of internal consistency for the TRS-A were 0.88 (for ages 12–14) and 0.86 (for ages 15–18). Test–retest assessments resulted in a median of 0.86 for child and 0.79 for adolescent forms.

Strength items were eliminated from the sample (e.g., “is creative” or “is energetic”) as the absence of an adaptive behavior does not equate to the presence of a “problem behavior” in the classroom. Removing strength items resulted in the inclusion of 170 items in the TRS-C and TRS-A across 12 behavioral domains (i.e., adaptability, aggression, anxiety, attention problems, atypicality, conduct problems, depression, functional communication, hyperactivity, learning problems, somatization, and withdrawal).</p>
<sec id="section10-1063426611421157">
<title>Rank order and percentage of item responses</title>
<p>The most common problem behaviors in classrooms were identified through a three-step process. First, data from the BASC-2 normative sample were analyzed using a frequency count of item responses. In this initial analysis, the number of teachers’ responses were individually tallied for each of the four possible item responses (i.e., never, sometimes, often, almost always). Second, the frequency counts of item responses were calculated for each of the identified items by weighting the ratings per item response using 0 for “never,” 1 for “sometimes,” 2 for “often,” and 3 for “almost always.” The sum of the weighted responses was then divided by the total number of responses on that item to calculate the mean of each response. Third, the items were rank ordered by mean with a comparison to the percentage of children and adolescents rated as “almost always” and “often” on each item to determine the most frequent behavior problems as indicated by teacher response. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott and Schaefer (1996)</xref>, the highest 20 and lowest 20 behaviors were identified as the most common and most rare problem behaviors, respectively. Mental health need is often identified when at least 4% of the population has been diagnosed with a specific disorder. For example, depressive disorders are identified in 4% of children and adolescents. For this study, the “most common problem behaviors” are identified as the top 10% for children and the top 10% for adolescents with items rated as “often” above 4%. The BASC-2 contains some items that indicate more severe behaviors, these are called critical items as they are “indicators” that require immediate further inquiry (e.g., items that reflect the potential for harm to the child or others; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611421157">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>). Critical items were weighted equally with all other items, as the purpose of the study is not to compare the intensity or severity of the behaviors but the frequency of each.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to articulate the most common teacher-rated problem behaviors demonstrated by children and adolescents in general education classrooms identified through a standardized assessment of multiple dimensions of behavior. From 170 items rated by teachers for children and adolescents, 22 behaviors fell within a top 10% criterion as the most common problem behaviors of children and adolescents. Items ranged from 7.95% of children often demonstrating overall worry to 19.98% being generally distracted and 7.65% of adolescents often demonstrating silly behavior to 13.45% often demonstrating excessive movement. Seventeen items for children and adolescents each and 12 overlapping items (i.e., common for children and adolescents both) were identified as the most common. Social emotional development is a process where skills begin to emerge in young childhood, and become more refined in adolescence and young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426611421157">Caspi, Henry, McGee, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426611421157">Pitzer, Esser, Schmidt, &amp; Laucht, 2009</xref>). As a result of this process, “normal” as well as “problem” behavior may look different for children than adolescents.</p>
<p>The most common problem behaviors of children and adolescents were as follows: makes careless errors, is distracted from tasks, has spelling deficits, demonstrates excessive movement, rushes and hurries through assignments, is distracted during lectures, misunderstands directions, worries about mistakes, demonstrates a short attention span, lacks concentration, and has a mathematics deficit. Common problem behaviors unique of children and not adolescents were as follows: is generally distracted, does not follow directions, has a reading deficit, talks without permission, has a handwriting deficit, and demonstrates overall worry. Most common problem behaviors of adolescents but not children were as follows: demonstrates self-doubt, worries about what others think, worries about personal perfection, requires repeated directions, demonstrates overall worry, and acts in a silly or immature manner. Means for children ranged from 0.75 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.65) for overall worry to 1.16 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.90) for generally distracted and 0.63 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.68) for silliness to 0.85 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.73) worries about making mistakes.</p>
<p>Results for children and adolescents are reported in two sections (i.e., most common problem behaviors of children and most common problem behaviors of adolescents) categorized as internalizing, externalizing, and learning problems. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426611421157">Table 2</xref> presents the percentage of each response (i.e., almost always, often, sometimes, and never) for each of the items identified as common problem behaviors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426611421157">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1063426611421157">4</xref> represent the means and standard deviations of the top 10% of problem behaviors of children and adolescents, respectively, as indicated by teachers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data reported here identify the most common problem behaviors in classrooms across the United States using a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents and a standardized multidimensional teacher rating scale. The data provide an opportunity to evaluate specific externalizing, internalizing, and learning problem item level behaviors and provide important knowledge in this field. Understanding behaviors demonstrated by children and adolescents at the classroom level provides a foundation for establishing schoolwide expectations in PBS and discipline programs, base rates for RtI for behavior, and developing standards to be taught aimed at adaptive skills and replacement behaviors (discussed further in “Implications” section). Discussion follows comparing results with previous studies in the areas of disruptive and hyperactive behaviors, behaviors demonstrating distractibility, behaviors associated with learning problems, and indicators of anxiety.</p>
<p>Disruptive and hyperactive behaviors were found here as most common problem behaviors similar to all previous studies of problem behaviors observed in general education classrooms, teacher perceptions of mental health concerns, and most frequent reasons for ODRs. Teachers rated 5% of children as almost always, 15.31% as often, 4.31% of adolescents as almost always, and 13.45% as often demonstrating excessive movement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611421157">Snider et al. (2002)</xref> observed 40% of children demonstrating behaviors associated with hyperactivity and 11% demonstrating disruptive behavior. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426611421157">Walter et al. (2006)</xref>, teachers perceived “out of seat” behavior as disruptive, and all the ODR studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611421157">Kaufman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611421157">Putnam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611421157">Spaulding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426611421157">Tidwell et al., 2003</xref>) reviewed found disruptive behavior to be a frequent reason for students to be removed from the learning environment. “Out of seat” and “silly” behaviors can be disruptive to the learning environment. Similar to the findings of Walter et al., teachers in the current study also rated 5.06% and 13.09% of children and 3.22% and 9.39% of adolescents as talking without permission almost always and often, respectively. Nine percent of children and 7% of adolescents were found to often demonstrate silly or immature behavior.</p>
<p>We found distractibility to be a common problem behavior of children and adolescents as did studies using direct observation, survey, and teacher ratings. Ten percent of children were almost always and 19.98% were often generally distracted. Nine percent of children were almost always and 18.22% often and 4.06% of adolescents were almost always and 12.18% often distracted from task. Five percent of children were almost always and 13.18% often and 1.95% of adolescents were almost always and 9.62% often distracted during lectures. At the classroom level, distractibility was identified in 73% of children observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611421157">Snider et al. (2002)</xref>, as a mental health concern for teachers surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426611421157">Walter et al. (2006)</xref>, and as a common problem behavior by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott and Schaefer (1996)</xref> using a standardized rating scale. Interestingly, although 7 of the overall 11 most common behaviors of children and adolescents are associated with ADHD, parents reported that 66% of adolescents and 84% of children with ADHD were taking medication.</p>
<p>Among all the studies reviewed, only one mentioned any behavior similar to learning problems in evaluation of common or frequent problem behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott and Schaefer (1996)</xref> found that teachers rated “not doing his/her work” as a most common problem behavior. Similarly, we found that 13% of children and 7% of adolescents often misunderstand directions. Nineteen percent of children and 9% of adolescents have to be told to do something more than once. Thirteen percent of children and 8% of adolescents often make mistakes on assignments because of not following directions. In addition, behaviors associated with hyperactivity and attention problems such as making careless errors, rushing through assignments, lacking concentration, and being generally distracted may manifest as reading, spelling, and math problems. Across all age groups, 9% to 14% often experience problems concentrating and attending to task, which can have a lifelong impact. Postsecondary academic and work environments will require that these students focus, concentrate, and attend to study and/or job responsibilities.</p>
<p>When reviewing behaviors at the classroom level, anxiety was a common problem behavior found in the current study and in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611421157">Snider et al. (2002)</xref> study. We found worry, self-doubt, and the need for perfection among the most common problem behaviors. Eight percent of children and 6% of adolescents often worry. Twelve percent of children often worry about making mistakes, and 12% of adolescents often express self-doubt. Survey and ODR research do not typically recognize internalizing behaviors as common or frequent among children. Behaviors resulting in ODR and those most noticed by teachers are behaviors that disrupt the learning environment and are categorized as externalizing behaviors. Worry and self-doubt may be far less easy to recognize in a classroom setting or may be demonstrated in conjunction with externalizing behaviors. “Needs encouragement” was a common problem behavior found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611421157">McDermott and Schaefer (1996)</xref>, similar to self doubt in this study.</p>
<p>Survey and ODR research results indicate that externalizing behaviors are the greatest behavioral concern of teachers and the most frequent reason for ODR. ODRs are frequently written for harassment, defiance, inappropriate language, verbal threats, fighting, talking out, theft, and bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426611421157">Liaupsin &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426611421157">Pietrzak, Petersen, &amp; Speaker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611421157">Putnam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611421157">Skiba, Peterson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426611421157">Sugai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426611421157">Tidwell et al., 2003</xref>). Results here indicate that these behaviors, although possibly the most frequently addressed by administrators, are not the most commonly faced by teachers in classrooms with a majority of students. Within our sample, teachers report that only 1% to 2% of children and adolescents often bully, use foul language, threaten others, or hit.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>A clear picture of the most common problem behaviors demonstrated by children and adolescents in general education classrooms in the United States is the foundation for early prevention and intervention of emotional and behavioral deficits. Results here have implications for policy makers, administrators, teachers, and teacher educators within the framework of PBS programs, RtI initiatives, and developing and assessing social, emotional, and behavioral standards.</p>
<p>District-level policy changes can be made to intervene with the most common problem behaviors. Schoolwide expectations and base rates for RtI programs are typically developed from reflection-type activities or data representing the most frequent teacher-attention demanding disruptive behaviors. Behaviors with the most immediate and lasting impact on teacher memory are naturally those that are most disruptive (i.e., externalizing); however, prevention and intervention strategies might be more effective if focused on the most common behaviors demonstrated in classrooms (i.e., disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity, distractibility, learning problems, and anxiety).</p>
<p>Statewide and district policy addressing these behaviors can be beneficial to teachers, students, and society. Developing and teaching schoolwide standards based on the most common problem behaviors might eliminate a majority of disruptions to the learning environment giving teachers more time for direct instruction and decreasing teacher frustration. Addressing internalizing as well as externalizing behaviors has the potential to decrease lifelong mental health issues. Ameliorating less severe but common behaviors might prevent individual student behavior from escalating to more severe acting out or internalizing behaviors warranting a mental health diagnosis. Interestingly, item means for children were higher than item means for adolescents, indicating the need for immediate early prevention. Teaching appropriate behavior, replacement behaviors, and coping strategies will create lifelong skills for students to be successful contributing members of society.</p>
<p>Results support the inclusion of most frequent problem behaviors (i.e., behaviors associated with hyperactivity/disruption, distractibility, learning problems, and anxiety) within state-developed standards and curriculum to teach needed social, emotional, and behavioral skills. Some states (e.g., Illinois) have developed explicit social emotional learning standards to be taught and/or assessed by local education agencies and others (e.g., Texas, Colorado) are in the process of determining the feasibility and development of standards. Providing an education that addresses issues for the “whole” student includes teaching behavioral standards that will provide social and emotional skills needed to be productive citizens. Results here provide the foundation for establishing these standards, curriculum to teach the standards, and standard assessment protocols.</p>
<p>School districts are currently creating schoolwide PBS programs and RtI procedures. Educator understanding of the most common classroom-level behavior problems might increase the probability of success of these programs. Data here can supplement other studies defining the most common behaviors that result in removal from the learning environment through ODRs. Development of school rules, procedures to teach these rules, and subsequent reinforcement of rule compliance can be modified or created from these data. Our hope is that intervention of classroom-level behaviors will increase the amount of time students are exposed to instruction. In addition, the most common problem behaviors described here can be the foundation for one- and two-tier interventions within the RtI process.</p>
<p>Preservice and in-service training can directly address each of these categories within the broader construct of classroom management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611421157">Putnam et al. (2003)</xref> found that teacher responses to common classroom behaviors are not typically evidence-based interventions to teach the student more adaptive behaviors but instead are verbal warnings, withholding recess, or making a telephone call to parents. In-service teachers support these findings through reports of lack of skill to prevent or decrease disruptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611421157">Baker, 2005</xref>). Evidence-based interventions to prevent these behaviors by teaching students appropriate behaviors or methods of coping with anxiety, a lack of attention, hyperactivity, and learning problems can be taught to preservice and in-service teachers. For example, direct instruction in interventions to assist elementary students in maintaining attention to task, such as self-management strategies, and coping strategy instruction for adolescents would be beneficial.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although this study used a large nationally representative sample of children and adolescents, potential limitations do exist. Participants (i.e., children and adolescents) were matched demographically to the 2001 U.S. census and teachers were included based on the classroom assignment of the student. In addition, results were not aggregated based on the number of students enrolled in public schools, private schools, hospital settings, or educational placement (i.e., special education classrooms). Teacher demographics and setting variables potentially had an impact on the results. However, only a small number of private schools were included, teachers in public schools rated the students in hospital settings, and teachers were selected from across 40 states decreasing the potential for differences. Further research is needed to determine whether differences exist based on teacher demographics and classroom assignments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although prevalence of childhood and mental health disorders provides an “overall” big picture of the mental health needs of today’s youth, information, such as that found in this study, regarding the most common problem behaviors is needed for establishing schoolwide expectations, base rates for RtI models, and curriculum development and intervention to address common problem behaviors demonstrated by students in public school classrooms. Results of this study add to the findings of previous studies to provide a solid understanding of behaviors faced by teachers at the classroom level. Replication of this study with large nationally representative data with teacher rating scales would further enhance knowledge in the field. Results here provide a foundation for social, emotional, and behavioral standards; preservice and in-service instruction in evidence-based interventions and strategies; and a foundation for one- and two-tier interventions within PBS programs and RtI systems to address common problem behaviors.</p>
