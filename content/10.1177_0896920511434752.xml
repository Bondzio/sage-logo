<p>The crisis that burst in March 2008 in the USA and spread gradually in Europe and elsewhere marked the onset of a new dark era: the ‘Great Recession’, characterized by international economic turbulence through recurrent shockwaves and chain effects of unpredictable outcomes, insecurity, rising unemployment and poverty. In response to the panic caused by the crisis, a series of draconian austerity measures were imposed on working classes. Parallel to deregulation of the welfare state in the USA and Europe over the last neoliberal decades, increasing class polarization and the emergence of severe social inequalities, the recent bailouts of global capitalism were based on a new attack on wages and labour. The books reviewed here discuss exactly this, along with other economic and political developments. Sociologists concerned with neoliberal politics and attempts to understand the current stage of capitalism will find a wealth of information and encounter a range of crucial arguments in these books, which include the writings of 28 authors. Given the variety of methodologies, premises and theoretical purposes (Marxian analysis, neo-institutionalism, neo-Keynesianism, and macro-historical analysis) agreement is obviously not to be expected. Nevertheless, the way the nature of the crisis is represented, the ways its origin, causes, features and possible culmination are conceived, and – most importantly – the way the state, the market and society are theorized, has a number of different implications, both theoretical and political.</p>
<p>One of the many controversies between analysts concerns the role of the USA in the crisis and the future of that country in the international system. What we might briefly term the ‘decline thesis’ figures rather prominently. This approach presents the crisis as the outcome of intensification of financialization since the 1970s, this in turn having been a response to the recession caused by declining profits for capital in the realm of the real economy and the sphere of industrial production and manufacturing. According to this line of argument, the post-war economic boom, the provision of loans to developing countries following decolonization, the expansion of social welfare in the 1950s and 1960s and the social movements (both Marxist and identity-centred) that subsequently challenged the state, were all factors that set the scene for the crisis in the 1970s. The state went into further decline in the 1980s in the face of faltering economic growth, low productivity, decreasing competitiveness, pressures by impatient capital markets, and the shift from creditor to debtor status. Such are the postulates of the ‘decline thesis’.</p>
<p>These assumptions form at least part of the theoretical background to Craig Calhoun and Derluguian’s co-edited book <italic>Business as Usual: The Roots of the Global Financial Meltdown.</italic> According to Calhoun (in the chapter ‘From the current crisis to possible futures’), the era of neoliberalism that started in the 1970s was characterized both by increasing reliance on finance as the source of profits and by the development of new financial instruments and accounting practices aided by new technologies and by such improvements in mathematics as the use of algorithms (pp. 23–25). This initiated a wave of expansion in hedge funds and derivatives trading. Apart from declining profits from industry, the new economy was characterized by attacks on trade unions by neoliberal governments. Economics was finance-driven, with ‘bubbles’ among its permanent features. Calhoun explains that such bubbles imply ‘rapid growth in the value of financial assets without strong foundations in the underlying economy or actual business performance’ (p. 25). For Calhoun these bubbles underlay entire economies, generating the crisis that exploded in March 2008, and in the process transforming global power relations. In this context ‘the US gradually lost the ability to maintain global economic and political order’ (p. 30). Calhoun characterizes the USA as a ‘declining hegemon’, also acknowledging, however, that ‘no other global power has stepped up to replace the US’ (p. 30).</p>
<p>In the chapter ‘The end of the long twentieth century’ in Calhoun and Derluguian’s collection, Beverly J Silver and Giovanni Arrighi situate the decline of the USA in the historical context of the periods of financial expansion categorized by Ferdinand Braudel. These ‘long centuries’ or ‘systemic cycles of accumulation’ (hereafter SCA) (p. 55) paralleling a transition from the city-state to the nation-state and finally to the world-state (p. 61) are:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920511434752" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1) a Genoese-Iberian SCA from the 15th through to the early 17th centuries;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2) a Dutch SCA from the late 16th through to the late 18th centuries;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3) a British SCA from the mid-18th through to the early 20th centuries; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4) a US SCA from the late 19th century to the present.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The writers’ thesis is that financialization is no new phenomenon but has been a ‘recurrent feature of historical capitalism from its early beginnings’ (p. 54) and also that financialization and material production should be understood as different spheres of economic activity. While ‘each of these periods of financialization was preceded by a long period of <italic>material expansion</italic> of the global economy’ (Silver and Arrighi’s emphasis), the ‘successive shifts away from trade and industry and into finance’ were a sign that the material expansion ‘had reached maturity’; it was ‘a sign of autumn’ (p. 55). According to Silver and Arrighi, this is the case also for the USA. They argue clearly that the 2008 financial meltdown ‘is one of the latest indicators’ that US world hegemony is entering its ‘autumn’ and ‘not a new spring’, as suggested by the prophets of the Second American Century who assumed that the 1990s would bring economic revival to the USA. Silver and Arrighi point to patterns of historical recurrence and thus interpret financialization periods as periods of reorganization of the world system.</p>
<p>US decline is also assumed by Immanuel Wallerstein in his historico-economic approach of ‘geopolitical cycles’ (p. 73). In the chapter in the same volume entitled ‘Dynamics of (unresolved) global crisis’, following Kondratieff’s theory on economic waves and downturns, he suggests that US hegemony began after what he calls the ‘thirty years’ war’ between Germany and the USA that continued from 1914 to 1945 (p. 73). According to Wallerstein the period from 1945 to 1970 corresponded not only to the peak in US hegemony but also to ‘the moment of the most expansive Kondratieff upturn of global economic prosperity that the capitalist world economy had ever known in its history’ (p. 71). David Harvey also postulates US decline but relates it to a geopolitical shift within capitalism and the drift of development to China. Harvey’s assumption is that US dominance in the world of production has indeed ‘disappeared to places like China and the rest of East and Southeast Asia’. In his interview with Sasha Lilley in <italic>Capital and its Discontents</italic>, he concludes that ‘the US has a rather more limited position than many people like to think … and it’s no longer dominant as it once was’ (p. 56).</p>
<p>Unlike Harvey, both Wallerstein, who identifies China’s entanglement with the dollar as the country’s ‘biggest economic problem’ and a ‘very tricky and uncertain game’ (p. 79), and Gopal Balakrishnan, are skeptical of China’s purported future role. Contrary to the dominant view that we are in the midst of an inevitable new age of capitalism, Balakrishnan (in the chapter ‘The convolution of capitalism’ in Calhoun and Derluguian’s collection) argues that capitalism has entered upon a phase of stagnation. In this ‘stationary state’ of the economy, as in the USA and Europe, or Japan in the past, China will be able neither, as predicted or hoped by many, to ‘carry the weight of the world economy on its shoulders’ (p. 224), nor to avoid stagnation and ‘unfold in the form of an indefinite extension of its current performance’ (p. 223).</p>
<p>To return to the thesis of US decline, Greg Albo, Sam Gildin and Leo Panitch’s theoretical perspectives differ radically from those of the previous authors. In their book <italic>In and out of the Crisis: The Global Financial Meltdown and Left Alternatives</italic> the three authors start by ascribing a central role to the state in today’s global neoliberalism. Their starting point is that – regardless of the attention paid to international meetings such as the G20 – the responsibility for promoting neoliberalism remains in the final analysis with individual nation states. They accordingly seek to deconstruct certain assumptions about the state that are dominant and so often taken for granted, even by the left. One such assumption concerns the distinction between state and market. As they indicate in the book’s preface, their perspective ‘departs from the common tendency on the Left no less than the Right to judge economic and political developments through the prism of states versus markets, with each crisis marking an oscillation between one pole and the other’ (p. 10). They reject the neoliberal view that markets can be potentially self-sufficient and that market efficiency will be maximized if the state is limited (‘efficient markets theory’). The other side of this neoliberal premise, which the authors sharply criticize, is that the state – which is often seen as a neutral policy maker – can compensate for market failures and serve the abstractly defined public interest. As the authors underline, this binary opposition between state and market encourages neglect of the complex ways in which, in every phase of capitalism – including global neoliberal capitalism – state and market are intertwined in a manner conducive to the reproduction of class societies. This has serious consequences at the level of theory.</p>
<p>One of these consequences is, according to the authors, precisely that there is a misinterpretation of the US role in the current global predominance of neoliberalism, and a corresponding misinterpretation of its role in the economic crisis. They challenge the thesis – which they regard as typical of the North American Left – that the US imperialist power and the American state are in decline. The authors attribute this postulated decline of the American state to extrapolations from phenomena such as the American defeat in Vietnam, the economic turmoil of the 1970s, the abandonment of the Bretton Woods international monetary system (p. 18), and so on.</p>
<p>However ‘plausible’ the arguments that invoke these phenomena, Albo, Gildin and Panitch observe a ‘vicious spiral’ in the ‘decline thesis’ that is derived from them. On the one hand, decline of the USA is assumed; on the other, the neoliberal financialization is conceptualized as the fundamental cause of the current crisis. To the extent that financialization is relegated to the status of a mere response to the lack of investment opportunities in ‘real production’ the ‘decline’ perspective underestimates:<disp-quote>
<p>the penetration of capitalist social relations into new spheres by way of the massive organizational restructuring of the workplace, companies, and sectors; the deployment of new technologies and breakthroughs into new fields for capital accumulation; the penetration and expansion of markets and corporations into geographic spaces previously excluded; the flexibilization of labor and the lowering of working-class wages (p. 33).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>From the viewpoint of the decline thesis as ‘vicious spiral’, the ‘financial crisis demonstrates the limits of the US state capacity to manage economic instability in the interest of the American ruling class as a whole. This inability, in turn, sharpens divisions in the US power bloc, with splits thus beginning to surface between financial and industrial capital’ (pp. 18–19).</p>
<p>The distinction between industrial and financial capital, or alternatively between the ‘real/ productive’ economy and ‘fictitious/speculative’ capital (p. 34) is another theoretical construct that Albo, Gildin and Panitch set out to dismantle. According to them, ‘the populist distinction between the financial and productive sectors relies on a one-sided notion that finance speculates in pieces of paper, and not in providing real goods and services’ (p. 34). This simplification underestimates, they argue, the degree of unity that exists between the main fractions of capital – whether industrial capital versus finance capital or foreign versus national capital – and ignores the functions served by financial markets, such as providing non-financial corporations with mechanisms for managing their risks, comparing and evaluating diverse investment opportunities, etc. (p. 34)</p>
<p>In <italic>Capital and Its Discontents: Conversations with Radical Thinkers in a Time of Tumult</italic>, in which Sasha Lilley interviews a number of different social and political thinkers, Panitch reverts to the subject of the state, and the American state in particular. He criticizes two ideas: first the idea that in the 1950s and 1960s the influence of capital on the state was somehow less than in the neoliberal period from 1970 onwards, and second that the American state is declining. For Panitch, ‘states construct markets and markets depend on states’. Therefore, to undermine the American state would be ‘a means of occluding and avoiding its enormous imperial power in the world’ (p. 79).</p>
<p>The emphasis on the state in Ellen Meiksins Wood’s ‘Empire of capital’ (in Lilley’s volume) comes very close to that of Panitch, albeit approaching from a different direction. While stressing the central role of the state in the ‘empire’ in question, she suggests that her own conception of ‘empire’ be contrasted with that of Hardt and Negri. For the latter writers ‘there is no place of empire’; it is ‘everywhere and nowhere’. In her interview with Sasha Lilley (p. 41), Wood characterizes this position as ‘very politically disabling’ because ‘they say we don’t really have visible concentrations of power and visible targets’. In contrast to Hardt and Negri’s deconstruction of the state, Wood emphasizes how capital cannot itself organize globalization, suggesting that ‘the territorial state may be more than ever the point of concentration of capitalist power’, and that ‘global capital needs the power of the state, and depends on this global system of multiple states’ (p. 41).</p>
<p>Theoretical deconstruction of the state and state-centred politics, not to mention their replacement by often invisible or abstract powers, are both ideas with their origins in the type of postmodern theoretical approach that has dominated the academic scene during the last decades. This is demonstrated by John Sanbonmatsu in his conversation with Sasha Lilley. His critique of postmodernism goes even further than Chomsky’s (in the same volume), and Chomsky finds postmodernism obscure, elitist and sometimes even ‘pretty embarrassing’ for ‘its views about science’ (p. 241).</p>
<p>Sanbonmatsu highlights postmodernism’s ‘obsession with the metaphysics of difference and dissensus’ charging it with having ‘obscured every possible basis for solidarity, mutual aid, and common ground among our many movements’ (p. 221). He discusses the origins of postmodernism in French poststructuralism and deconstructivist linguistics (pp. 220–222). Interestingly, Sanbonmatsu relates the academic fashion of postmodernism to a broader shift involving the organization of knowledge as a commodity in late capitalism: ‘In the past a particular critical idea or concept – the state, say, or patriarchy or the division of labor – was used to illuminate empirical reality’ (p. 230). Through postmodernism (and through abstract notions such as Hardt and Negri’s ‘multitude’) this empirical reality is lost. Further on, Sanbonmatsu criticizes Foucault for not being ‘a particularly political person’ (p. 224), for being ‘uncomfortable with any language of strategy and how to get from point A to point B’ (p. 225), for ‘turning his back not only against any language of socialism and Marxism, but also against humanism per se’ (p. 225), for being uninterested in ‘the division of labor, or who controls the wealth, or the material institutions’ (p. 226), and for being ‘skeptical of any leadership on the left or elsewhere’ (p. 227). Although Sanbonmatsu convincingly targets the individualist impact of postmodernist thought on social and political science, on knowledge and most of all on social movements, he underestimates Foucault’s influence on critical theory and above all the great contribution he made to the understanding of neoliberal politics through his hermeneutics of the notion of power.</p>
<p>Postmodernism is not alone in challenging, and even rejecting, the idea of the state. The same critique is to be found in the context of the ‘new anarchy’. Andrej Grubačić in his conversation with Sasha Lilley focuses on how the old debate between Marxism and anarchism has been updated through this ‘post-left’ ‘new anarchy’. Inspired by Murray Bookchin and the anarchist movements of the 1970s, new anarchy attempts to reconceptualize for today’s neoliberal environment a vision of ‘wide strata against both state and coercive institutions’ (p. 254). He observes the absence of a notion of social class from new anarchy theory and emphasizes the need to rethink class and bring the – for him compatible – traditions of Marxism and anarchism together.</p>
<p>With regard to the crisis of 2008, David McNally’s book <italic>Global Slump: The Economics and Politics of Crisis and Resistance</italic>, offers not only one of the most evocative descriptions of that crisis but also a systematization of both its causes and its effects. With financial instruments such as ‘derivatives’, ‘collateralized debt obligations’, ‘credit-default swaps’ etc. dominating public debate as products understandable only to experts, McNally believes that this economic language has been formulated in such a mystified way as to be distanced from those affected: ‘the ruling class cultivates economic illiteracy’. It aspires to convince us ‘that only a select few can possibly comprehend these weighty matters’ (p. 11).</p>
<p>McNally presents the following review of the economic history of the last decades: the post-war boom (1948–73) was a capitalist stage of high prosperity for large parts of the working class; in the ‘decade of crisis’ (1971–82) industrial output dropped by 10 percent in the global North. Job losses impelled governments to reduce deficits, with a great burst of inflation simultaneously serving to increase uncertainty, and neoliberal experiments beginning to take place (for instance in Chile under the auspices of the Chicago Boys). The ‘sustained expansion’ period (1982–2007), ultimately initiated in the wake of the Volcker monetary shock that aimed at breaking the inflationary spiral and restoring corporate profitability, was characterized by mass unemployment and supplemented by an attack on both wages and trade unions. In this last period, the upward trend in profit rates that got under way from the early 1980s underpinned the subsequent capitalist expansion, which only began to falter with the crisis that emerged in East Asia in 1997, signaling the new problems of over-accumulation that have shaped the present slump (pp. 25–42).</p>
<p>Remarkably, McNally does not share the mainstream view that very little restructuring of capital has occurred since the crises of 1971–82 (p. 46). The thesis that the crisis is simply rooted in the recession that started in the 1970s, ignoring the complex ways in which capital re-organized itself, plays down the fact that it did all this at the expense of labour. Such labour defeats include: the firing of striking air traffic controllers’ members of the PATCO union in 1981 by the Reagan administration; Thatcher’s attack on the National Union of Mineworkers in 1985; or the events in Bolivia when troops were used to crush the tin miners’ union in 1986. McNally argues that analyses of this kind shed no light on the ‘industrial restructuring’ and the ‘leaning’ of production through flexibilization of labour (tiering wages, increasing insecurity, precarization, part-time and contract work) in combination with an increase in direct foreign investment and, since the 1990s, an intensification of industrialization in places such as China, South Korea, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and Mexico (pp. 46–60).</p>
<p>He also provides a clear explanation of the course of events that led from the bursting of the real estate bubble to a wave of bank collapses and then to a series of sovereign debt crises and relapses into recession (p. 8). The ‘Great Bailout’ was a response to the collapse of some of the world’s leading banks, such as Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, and Wachovia bank, or of AIG, the world’s largest insurance company, followed by the meltdown of a series of European banks. This meant, as McNally reminds us, that ‘governments in the world’s largest economies anteed up something in the order of $20 trillion – an amount equivalent to one and a half times the US gross domestic product – via a massive intervention without historical precedent’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>This ‘Great Bailout’ was according to McNally a way of ‘mutating’, as he puts it, private debt into public (p. 4). Though the world’s ruling class ‘lost its swagger’ and its ‘arrogance and ostentation were displaced by fear and trembling’ at the beginning of the crisis (p. 14), the mutation provided them with a new opportunity to organize, according to McNally a ‘war against indigenous lands, public services, unions, and communities of colour’ (p. 2). McNally’s emphasis on the responsibilization process that has been taking place since 2008 is important. In order to prepare for hard austerity measures and having bailed out the very banks, global corporations and financial institutions that created the crisis in the first place, the state launched, as McNally describes it, ‘a rhetoric designed to blame its victims. No longer are global banks or giant corporations at fault … No, the real culprits are poor and working class people who expected too much’ (p. 22). As a result, high unemployment, falling incomes and pensions, huge cuts to health care, education and social welfare, and a campaign against ‘laxity and laziness’ of the poor (p. 25) had to be accepted as the appropriate politics and the inevitable way out of the crisis.</p>
<p>Each of the books reviewed here is of great interest, but in its own way. Marx has shown that capital is not an autonomous entity, but a social relation between owners and wage earners who are dispossessed of the means of production. McNally’s book comes closest to sharing these premises, elaborating them in an evocative and systematic analysis of post-war capitalism’s crises. He explores the development of post-war capitalism not as a story made from above but always <italic>in relation</italic> to labour and class struggle. This relational perspective, i.e. the intertwining of finance-led and industrial capital, as well as between state and market, it is worth noting, is also a strength of Greg, Gildin and Panitch’s analysis of the crisis.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sasha Lilley’s pertinent questions and remarks addressed to a number of different thinkers, the book succeeds in extracting a wealth of information, while at the same time familiarizing the reader with the very core of each theoretical perspective. Calhoun and Derluguian’s co-edited book will be important for sociologists because of the wide range of arguments enlisted in the attempt to correlate the various parameters and focus discussion on specific theoretical aspects of the crisis.</p>
<p>Nancy Fraser, for instance (in ‘Marketization, social protection, emancipation: toward a neo-Polanyian conception of capitalist crisis’ in Calhoun and Derluguian’s collection) defends the revival of the type of large-scale theorizing that has historically been associated with Marxism as a way of understanding what she describes as a ‘multidimensional and overdetermined’ crisis: ecological, social, political, one related to global governance, and a crisis of critique itself (p. 138). In an attempt to avoid economism, she places her analysis of the crisis in a neo-Polanyian framework. Re-reading Polanyi’s ‘Great Transformation’ in the light of today’s crisis, she suggests replacing Polanyi’s understanding of the ‘double movement’ (the conflict between marketization and social protection which led to fascism and world war) by the ‘triple movement’. This adds the often neglected – even by Polanyi – struggles for ‘emancipation’, not only class struggle but also struggle by feminists, anti-imperialists, multiculturalists and New Leftists. Fraser assumes that these three processes are all ambiguous in their implications: social protection ‘affords relief from the disintegrative effects of deregulation but it simultaneously entrenches domination’; deregulation can also have positive effects, such as for example ‘when markets are introduced into bureaucratically administered command economies or when labour markets are open to former slaves’; emancipation ‘produces not only liberation but also strains in the fabric of existing solidarities’ (p. 156). While insisting that ‘none of the three can be adequately grasped in isolation from the others’, in order to ‘get an adequate view of capitalist crisis’ (p. 156), Fraser nevertheless notes that due to neoliberal hegemony ‘emancipation’s ambivalence has been resolved in recent years in favor of marketization’ (p. 157), necessitating a ‘realignment of the poles of the movement’ and calls for a new commitment to emancipation (p. 157).</p>
<p>Just as Fraser speaks of a ‘post-neoliberal era’ (p. 157) as a <italic>fait accompli</italic>, so Caglar Keyder too (in ‘Crisis, underconsumption, and social policy’ in Calhoun and Derluguian’s collection), shares the view that ‘neoliberal ascendancy has come to an end’ (p. 182). His starting point is that the current crisis is primarily a crisis of underconsumption, which has made capitalists reluctant to invest, increased unemployment and depressed living standards for the working classes. Given the defeats of the workers both in the First World and in the South, the declining share for labour in all countries, and the worsening income inequalities became the main factors for the financialization of the crisis (p. 161). Keyder suggests that ‘contrary to the popular belief, the programs of the welfare state have not been dismantled in advanced capitalist societies’ (p. 160). But, he notes further down, the welfare state ‘did not evolve or keep up with the increasing demands due to the changing conditions either’ (p. 161). Governments have not counteracted the intensifying inequality, with the result that a great part of the population has become excluded both from production and from consumption, thus ending up irrelevant for capitalism, which therefore has proceeded to focus on finance-led investments. Keyder accordingly advocates a Keynesian solution and suggests that the most feasible way of working towards a goal that would approximate Polanyi’s ‘double movement’ would be to increase social expenditures, improving income distribution in such a way as to align consumption with productive capacity (p. 176).</p>
<p>Placing the emphasis on technology, Manuel Castells (in the chapter ‘The crisis of global capitalism: toward a new economic culture?’ in the same volume) undertakes an analysis of the specific dynamics that caused the crisis of 2008: liberalization of financial markets; the technological transformation of finance to make it the basis of a world-wide financial market centred on global computer networks; the securitization of every economic entity, activity or asset, elevating financial valuation into the key criterion for assessment of the value of firms, etc.; the dependence of financial markets more on information and less on supply-demand logics; the lack of proper supervision in securities trading; and the intertwining of the Asian/Pacific and US budgets (pp. 187–189). He then puts forward an interpretation of the crisis which links it both with environmental crisis and with the management of urban space, which, ‘has been submitted to the dynamics of real estate’ (p. 192). Real estate has become the prime choice for speculative financial investment, in the process integrating itself inextricably into housing markets. Consumption having been fuelled by risky lending, the collapse of the housing market deprived consumers of the capacity to borrow. ‘The crisis of this particular model of urban growth is’ therefore ‘the key connecting point between the financial crisis, the environmental crisis and the crisis of consumption’ (p. 192). Having exposed the difficulties of what he calls ‘Capitalist Perestroika’, Castells outlines a typology of economic practices that have developed in response to the fading of the global informational capitalism that he assumes, for example consumer cooperatives, urban farming, communal living and banking, volunteer-based social services, etc. Many of these have already been observed in the USA and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like Castells, Daniel Chirot (in ‘A turning point or business as usual?’ in Calhoun and Derluguian’s collection) also places the emphasis on technological changes, suggesting that they ‘lie at the heart of any explanation of why some financial panics lead to far more serious outcomes than others do’ (p. 129). Chirot presents an overview of the discussion in different historical periods on economic swings. He summarizes the theories of business cycles from older theoreticians such as Kondratieff and Schumpeter, to more recent ones such as Rostow, Kuznets, Solomou, Lucas, Mankiw, De Groot and Franses. Technological innovation, Chirot argues, if introduced in a period of capitalist crisis and social panic, can bring about transformations of capitalism that necessitate new, broader state regulation. This is not the case for all capitalist crises, but it does apply for the panic of 2008, when it coincided ‘with the rise of a new age led by revolutionary changes in communications, biotechnology, and health care and probably the start of the development of new sources of electrical power’ (p. 131). In this context, in order to cope with the challenges of the coming new age, according to Chirot, serious social and political reforms and government interventions, are needed (p. 133). Otherwise the possibility of what he justly describes as a ‘very dark scenario’ (p. 135), namely a new world war, cannot be totally excluded.</p>
<p>The books just reviewed are focused mainly on western economies. A few analyses are also provided on other parts of the world, including that by Fernando Coronil. In the chapter ‘The future in question: history and utopia in Latin America (1989–2010)’ in the volume edited by Calhoun and Derluguian, Coronil examines the political and cultural background of Latin America’s ‘turn to the left’ concentrating on ‘the image of the ideal future that animates’ (p. 232) the political turn. In an interview with Sasha Lilley, (in the chapter ‘The agrarian question and multiple paths of capitalist development in East Asia and South Africa’), Gillian Hart discusses the history of how dispossession from land shaped capitalist development in these areas. In Lilley’s volume (in the chapter ‘National capitalism in the Third World’), Vivek Chibber examines the history of the developmental state in the global South and the legacy of alliances that were forged between the state and labour.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in viewpoint, the multiplication of scenarios and the wide range of theoretical outcomes foreseen for the crisis, what becomes clear from a reading of these books is, among other things, first, that the so called <italic>global</italic> crisis is not really so global. While heterogeneous economies such as those of the USA, Greece, Britain, Ireland and Spain undergo recession, other export-driven economies such as China, Germany and South Korea experience (for the time being) growth. Second, despite the efforts of neoliberal governments to persuade the public that the crisis is everyone’s crisis and that this hurricane of extreme fiscal austerity measures is a necessary sacrifice for the <italic>common good</italic> and a priority for the <italic>national interest</italic>, the class character of the crisis is in fact evident. Third, despite the justifications for decline of the state put forward in a number of postmodern or cosmopolitan theories, and notwithstanding the retreat of the welfare state, the crisis has shown that the functions of the state have actually never declined, either in terms of reproducing class society in favor of the ruling classes or of exercising violence and coercion in favor of the politically defined order. The renewed attack on the working classes and their living standards, the rise in unemployment, the neoliberal class state that increases insecurity for present and coming generations, are all developments that make it a matter of priority for the disaffected classes to search for alternatives in their own favor – just as was previously done by the capitalists.</p>
