<abstract>
<p>This is the first descriptive study that uses the survey method to investigate where alumni of Kuwait University’s Master of Library and Information Science program are working and what different functions they are performing. The survey method was used to collect mainly quantitative data from alumni. Inferences about the graduates’ skills, positions, functions, aspirations and behavior are made from the data collected via the questionnaires. The market is fluid and evolving, and graduates are doing diverse functions that are not typical. Problems that have to do with the profession’s image and expectations are voiced. Implications about professional titles and job salaries as well as suggestions for future planning are discussed in light of survey results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information professions are evolving generally, and this is happening more so in Kuwait, where a modern education system goes back to the 1960s. The master’s degree program in Library and Information Science (MLIS) started out within the College of Graduate Studies at Kuwait University. It is the only library and information science (LIS) professional degree in Kuwait. It began admitting students for the 1996–1997 academic year. At the time, it was a significant accomplishment to offer the MLIS without a corresponding undergraduate degree, let alone to have English as its language of instruction. Developments led to the program’s expansion, and it was awarded academic department status within the College of Social Sciences in 2001. In 2002, a minor in Information Studies was added for Social Sciences College students.</p>
<p>The master’s program is a 36-credit program modeled after the American Library Association’s accredited LIS programs. The program has core courses covering basic competencies and functions of the profession, followed by a number of electives to supplement students’ work. The program went through two external evaluations, a process very similar to accreditation and usually required by the College of Graduate Studies for all its graduate programs every 5 years. The first group of students graduated from the MLIS program in June 1998, and between 1998 and 2010 a total of 167 students graduated from the program, of whom 41 (24.5 percent) were men and 126 (75.5 percent) were women.</p>
<p>The study at hand uses the descriptive survey method to determine the market characteristics of Kuwait University’s MLIS graduates from 1998 to 2010. Surveys are useful methods of study when there is an interest in collecting data on aspects of human behavior that need to be quantified and are difficult to observe directly because the number and/or circumstances of the subjects studied are unmanageable. Inferences, both qualitative and quantitative, about the graduates’ skills, positions, functions, aspirations, and behaviors are made from data collected via the questionnaires.</p>
<p>This research is the first attempt to map where MLIS alumni are and what they are doing. Obtaining accurate contact information for alumni proved to be a challenging task prior to administering the survey. The core of this study comprises analysis of a survey questionnaire and the implications of its results. The significance of this study is its contribution to the literature in this field generally and in Kuwait specifically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0340035212456987">
<title>Relevant literature review</title>
<p>The literature on LIS career opportunities has been growing in the last decade as an increasing number of scholars have been paying attention to the subject of the LIS market and future careers. Most of these studies have been carried out in Europe and North America (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212456987">Raguotis and Petuchovaite 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212456987">Marshall et al. 2009a/b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212456987">Ard et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212456987">Shontz and Murray 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212456987">Davis and Moran 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212456987">Khoo et al. 2001</xref>). Their number is an indication of the increasing importance of this area and implies that librarians and information professionals have realized how critical it is to analyze the job opportunities and future careers of LIS graduates in order to improve the field.</p>
<p>An examination of the literature shows that previous studies of the LIS job market and its graduates have not looked into the careers and employment of LIS graduates in the Middle East in general, and no studies of this kind have been undertaken in Kuwait or anywhere in the Gulf region. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035212456987">Alqudsi-ghabra and Al-Ansari (1998)</xref> summarized the justification for the MLIS degree in Kuwait and how it had evolved in light of difficulties, in addition to accomplishments achieved with the establishment of the MLIS at Kuwait University. Since 1998, no study has been carried out to follow up on the status of students who earned the MLIS degree and the implications this degree had for their careers.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0340035212456987">Belzile et al. (2010)</xref> produced a report on competencies for librarians of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL). Competencies fall into seven major areas: foundational knowledge, interpersonal skills, leadership and management, collection development, information literacy, research and contribution to the profession, and information technology skills. This report highlights the areas upon which any LIS program should focus when considering improvements to the field. Undoubtedly, investing in such competencies can only be achieved when there is a systematic evaluation of the career paths of LIS graduates and tracking of whether they have acquired some, if not all, of these competencies. A review of the literature shows that few studies have called attention to marketing issues related to the LIS market.</p>
<p>Two recent studies have looked into career tracking strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212456987">Raguotis and Petuchovaite (2010)</xref> aimed for a systematic way of collecting information about the careers, job positions, and pay levels of LIS graduates. The researchers explored the career experiences of LIS graduates in Lithuania using a Web-based questionnaire and found a high percentage of LIS graduate employment. Results showed that more than half of all respondents (51.9 percent) were working in libraries. One major recommendation of the study was closer interaction between faculty and potential employers. Results also highlighted the importance of promoting research benefits to alumni clubs and professional-based social networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212456987">Marshall et al. (2009a/b)</xref> conducted a study in two parts to explore LIS workforce issues. In the first part of the study, the authors investigated educational, workforce, and career issues facing LIS students to explore the possibility for a career-tracking model. The second part of the study sought to develop an alumni-tracking system that can be used by a wide range of LIS programs. The study found that the LIS workforce is aging and that most LIS graduates tend to work in libraries. Findings of the study highlighted the need for an alumni-tracking system and revealed that most LIS programs have limited resources available for this task.</p>
<p>In addition, earlier studies have focused on LIS alumni tracking. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0340035212456987">Ingram et al. (2005)</xref> reported on the development of a systematic process for locating instructional design alumni and recruiting them to provide feedback from their workplaces. Two major issues were noted in contacting alumni: the first was to locate alumni current contact information, and the second was to facilitate a large response rate through instruments.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that some studies have focused on issues other than alumni tracking, such as the motivations of LIS graduates and professionals and their attitudes toward their fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212456987">Warraich and Ameen (2011)</xref> surveyed the perceptions of junior and senior LIS professionals in Pakistan on LIS curricula and their relevance to market needs in enhancing employability. Through questionnaires, focus group interviews, and observations, it was found that the curricula were up-to-date and well-designed but were not fulfilling the needs of young graduates and their employers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212456987">Ard et al. (2006)</xref> conducted a survey at the University of Alabama's school of LIS to study the career motivations of MLIS students. The authors explored reasons for entering the field, salary expectations, and perceptions of the job market. Based on the findings, the study proposed several recruitment strategies with special emphasis on the key role of reference librarians in future campaigns. The survey showed that working in libraries significantly elevates the chances of entering the LIS profession. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212456987">Davis and Moran (2005)</xref> provided an overview of how LIS students were being introduced to issues related to the development of LIS programs. The authors looked at specialized courses dealing with various aspects of scholarly communication. They also looked into modifications made to some courses and explored the benefits of field experience, graduate assistantships, and participation in institutional projects.</p>
<p>Two recent books provided an overview of job opportunities and careers of holders of MLIS degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212456987">Shontz and Murray 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0340035212456987">Haycock and Sheldon 2008</xref>). For their part, Shontz and Murray described 95 different jobs held by people with MLIS degrees. The authors attempted to show the diversity of what professionals in the field do and can do; they indirectly presented the interdisciplinary aspects within the library and information field. Haycock and Sheldon provided an overview of the LIS profession, the importance of professional education for the profession, and the basic functions and competencies of librarianship.</p>
<p>Apart from perceptions and motivations, some other studies of LIS graduate schools have focused on analyzing the status of their students and applicants in order to predict future careers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212456987">Khoo et al. (2001)</xref> surveyed students and graduates of Information Studies in Singapore to find out whether there were well-defined and coherent clusters of LIS students and applicants who preferred similar subjects. Two clusters were found: a library-oriented one and a non-library group that was more oriented toward information technology and information management.</p>
<p>Building on previous studies and the literature cited, this study aims to add to the literature a descriptive study profiling the status of MLIS graduates in Kuwait.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0340035212456987" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods of study</title>
<p>People’s networks proved highly effective in locating email addresses of respondents, who are all Kuwait University MLIS alumni. Communication with respondents was accomplished through email, mobile messaging, phone calls, and personal encounters, when possible, to solicit contact information of additional alumni and increase participation. Email messages that bounced back were checked several times and corrections were made when possible.</p>
<p>A message indicating the purpose of the study was accompanied by a questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0340035212456987">Appendix A</xref>) consisting of 27 closed- and open-ended questions that sought information in the following areas:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Area 1: Demographic information including name, age, gender, nationality, marital status, and whether the alumnus had children or not during his or her master’s studies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 2: Educational background and performance, including GPAs.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 3: Reasons for joining the MLIS program and means of knowing about the degree and program.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 4: Job titles and salary ranges before and after earning the MLIS degree.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 5: Functions that MLIS alumni perform at work, whether they work in the government or in the private sector, and whether they work in libraries, information centers, or other places.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 6: Skills needed on the job, whether or not their LIS education prepared them for the job, and the skills learned while studying that proved beneficial to them on the job. Haycock and Sheldon’s discussion of competencies (2008) and the Special Library Association (SLA) Competencies for Information Professionals of the 21st Century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0340035212456987">1997, updated 2003</xref>) were reviewed. The Belzile et al. study mentioned in the literature review was also examined. They all provided a framework for the skills investigated, and all fall under professional and personal competencies.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Two open-ended short-answer questions provided an option for respondents to write their opinions. Furthermore, an email address was provided at the end of the survey for those who wanted to communicate more information. These were all text analyzed. Two questions soliciting job titles of alumni before and after obtaining the MLIS degree were text analyzed as well.</p>
<p>Reminders were sent weekly to those respondents who did not respond or who had any unexplained delay in submitting the survey. The survey began on 11 March 2011 and closed on 12 April 2011. Messages were sent throughout the survey period to email addresses as they became available. To cater to the convenience and schedules of all respondents, the survey was sent several times, alternating between weekdays and weekends and mornings and evenings. The respondents are a diverse group of professionals, doctoral students, and academic faculty members in and outside of Kuwait. As in all self-reported studies, data was collected through the survey, a fact that made the information heavily reliant on descriptive analysis. However, quantifying the data was used along with the qualitative data to strengthen the analysis. In cases where answers of ‘other’ exceeded 10 percent, answers were investigated and resulting information analyzed to ascertain its significance and its contribution to the interpretation of results. When deemed significant it was added to the analysis.</p>
<p>Over the 13 years between 1998 and 2010, 167 students graduated from the MLIS program. Of the 167 who had graduated by June 2010, 145 email addresses (87 percent) were verified and deemed usable or updated through social and professional contacts. It is true that case studies may not always be very representative, yet the high response rate makes this study representative of the MLIS market in Kuwait. Out of a total of 145 graduates verified and surveyed, 92 (63.5 percent) responded. For email surveys, this is considered a good response rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0340035212456987">
<title>Objectives and strengths of the study</title>
<p>One of the contributions of this study is to lessen the use of impressions and increase the use of knowledge for decision-making, improvements, and legislation favorable to the profession and its members. Facts aid the knowledge that is prerequisite to any understanding of the market for graduates. Until this knowledge is built on facts and is organized, it will continue to constitute only impressions.</p>
<p>With diversification of technology and constant changes in the field and its surrounding environment, information professionals are continuously being defined by what they do rather than where they do it. Does this apply to the Kuwaiti MLIS alumni? To answer this question, there is a growing need in the case of the MLIS alumni market to ascertain what they do for work as well as where they work. This study seeks to understand what MLIS alumni are doing after graduation and the implications of this on the field in Kuwait as well as on the alumni.</p>
<p>It is essential for planning purposes to understand what functions alumni are performing and how information gathered from them can contribute to the program’s future development and planning, in addition to what ramifications this could have on the profession in Kuwait, and whether there are analogies that can be made with the circumstances of the profession elsewhere. Lack of clarity in information generally breeds obscurity in decision-making and makes the decision-making process unreliable. Establishing contact with graduates and mapping them decreases obscurity. This is a byproduct of the study at hand as well. Additionally, all respondents have a vested interest in the alumni profile, as they feel it is a chance for them to voice their opinions about the profession, professionals, and their issues. This was clearly evident in the high response rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0340035212456987">
<title>Weaknesses and limitations</title>
<p>The major limitation of the survey method is that it relies on respondents’ self-reporting for data collection. Intentional deception, personal biases and grievances, poor memory, distortions or misunderstanding of the questions can all contribute to inaccuracy of the reported data and contribute to the ‘social desirability’ bias of the survey method. In this study this bias is counteracted by the hig h response rate.</p>
<p>The descriptive method does not offer any cause-and-effect interpretations of the studied phenomena. Thus, this market study of MLIS alumni in Kuwait is a descriptive self-report with inferences and analyses made. The study aimed at a high response rate from the beginning. Since the number of alumni was 167 as of the summer of 2010, there was concern that if a pilot study were done, it could contaminate the results of the bigger study sample in two ways: data from the pilot study would be included again in the main results, and the pilot participants would be included in the main study too, meaning that data would be collected from these people twice.</p>
<p>Close to 50 hours were spent by the researchers to complete alumni contact information. People’s networks were used to locate contact information about graduates. In future, this method will present a problem because the number of alumni increases yearly, but it worked to track alumni for this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0340035212456987">
<title>Results of the survey</title>
<p>Of the 92 alumni who responded to the survey, 86 answered all questions and six provided only partial responses. All responses are included in the results of the survey, which are presented in detail below.</p>
<sec id="section7-0340035212456987">
<title>Area 1: Demographic information of respondents, including name, age, gender, nationality, social and marital status, and whether or not they had children while attending school</title>
<p>Results show that 75.8 percent of respondents who reported their gender were female (69) and 24.2 percent were male (22). One person did not report gender. This result conforms with the fact that the LIS profession in Kuwait is female dominated, something that was expected prior to the study, and that agrees with what has been documented in the literature on this profession elsewhere. In this respect, the survey respondents were very strongly representative of the Kuwaiti alumni as a whole. Of the total of 167 students who had graduated from the program by the summer of 2010, 75.5 percent (126 cases) were women and 24.5 percent (41 cases) were men.</p>
<p>As noted above, 75.8 percent of survey respondents were female 24.2 percent were male, a clear indication of the extent to which the survey results accurately reflected the composition of the total population of Kuwaiti MLIS alumni.</p>
<p>Regarding age, 50.5 percent of respondents were 3–40 years old, 27.5 percent were 40–50 years old, 16.5 percent were 20–30 years old, and 5.5 percent were more than 50 years old.</p>
<p>Most of the respondents reporting on their nationality were Kuwaitis (71 cases: 78 percent), with 20 (22 percent) replying that they were non-Kuwaitis; 18 of these stated their nationality, while one respondent did not answer this question. All but one of the respondents gave their names, although it was optional.</p>
<p>As for social and marital status while pursuing the MLIS, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0340035212456987">Table 1</xref> shows that 30.4 percent of all respondents said they were single. The rest reported the following: 15.2 percent were married with no children, 21.7 percent were married with three children, 13.0 percent with two children, 8.6 percent with one child, and 5.4 percent answered “other.” Five respondents (5.4 percent) did not answer this question.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0340035212456987">Table 7</xref> shows that those working in the library and information field described their place of work as being in a public academic institution (20.7 percent), in a private academic institution (10.9 percent), in a special library (7.6 percent), in a public government school (4.4 percent), and in a private foreign school (4.4 percent). However, a large proportion (40.2 percent) answered “non-library” and seven respondents skipped this question. These results become clearer when coupled with the results about the functions performed and shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0340035212456987">Table 8</xref>.</p>
<p>The functions that MLIS graduates perform and the positions they hold are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0340035212456987">Table 8</xref> and include collection development and acquisition (18.5 percent), administration (17.4 percent), technology (16.3 percent), reference (14.1 percent), circulation and organization (each with 13.0 percent), faculty at Kuwait University (KU) (10.9 percent), faculty at the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) (8.7 percent), doctoral student (7.6 percent), publishing (2.2 percent), and scholarship student (1.1 percent). Thus many alumni are performing traditional functions such as collection development and administration and technology, in addition to reference, organization, and circulation. Again, however, a substantial proportion (33.7 percent) answered “non- library”. Multiple responses to this question were allowed, and the results indicate that many respondents are performing more than one function on the job.</p>

<p>If looked at in depth, the high proportion of responses in the “non-library” category in both <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0340035212456987">Tables 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0340035212456987">8</xref> suggests that many alumni work in non-library institutions and perform functions that are not library-related. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0340035212456987">Table 8</xref> the responses in the “non-library” category, when added to those for faculty members and doctoral students could mean that the “non-library” category overall is of a significant size. However, other than the faculty category there could be some who are doing their degree while still working in libraries, performing several functions as well. It was therefore decided to further investigate the 31 “non-library” answers. Only four respondents were found to be in supporting academic roles; the rest were in non-traditional functions. These included research, virtual librarian, information, networking, and other non-library-related roles.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0340035212456987">Table 9</xref> presents the results regarding skills that the respondents wished they had learned during the MLIS program. The answers, in descending order, included Web design (50.0 percent), digital media and digitizing (33.6 percent), leadership (23.9 percent), communication (22.8 percent), management (18.4 percent), Internet search (14.1 percent), bibliographic instruction (9.7 percent), collection development (7.6 percent), cataloging and organization (5.4 percent), and “other” (14.1 percent). Multiple answers were allowed, and although 12 respondents did not answer this question, the results suggest that many of those who did respond identified two or more skills they wish they had learned during the program.</p>

<p>When asked if skills learned in the MLIS program were helpful on the job, 83 out of 92 respondents answered the question, with 77.1 percent of them answering “yes” and 13.0 percent answering “no”.</p>
<p>Two short-answer essay questions provided respondents the option to give their opinions. First, respondents were asked to write anything they thought would help advance the status of the field, degree, or professionals working in the field. Fifty-four respondents (58.7 percent) out of 92 responded to this question. In the next question, respondents were asked, “If you were to go back, would you still seek an MLIS?” Eighty respondents (87.0 percent) answered this question. Answers to both questions were text analyzed as follows: Qualitative data collected from these open-ended questions was coded according to themes and incorporated into the survey results. The aim of these questions was to explore in-depth information related to perceptions of graduate students toward the field. As the content was text analyzed, themes emerged from the open-ended questions. These themes are job opportunities, advancement of the program, and negative and positive perceptions of the program in general.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of job opportunities before and after joining the MLIS program, text analysis revealed that the majority of respondents worked in the education field as teachers before joining the MLIS program, while a few worked as librarians. However, the majority of respondents said they worked as librarians after getting the degree, while only six said they were teachers. This implies that a good percentage of students changed careers to be in line with what they studied. As the data shows, 44.6 percent changed job titles and 56.5 percent experienced salary increases.</p>
<p>When asked about what might help advance the status of the field, text analysis revealed that the most frequently repeated words and phrases were related to changing the title of the program, offering more training in IT skills, developing more coursework, and specializing in nontraditional areas within the existing program, such as knowledge management, information technology, and information literacy.</p>
<p>The issue of specialization has also been raised in the literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212456987">Khoo et al. (2001)</xref>, who found two clusters of LIS students: a library-oriented one and a non-library group that was more concerned with information technology and information management. In addition, the notion of coursework development also reflected work done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212456987">Davis and Moran (2005)</xref>, who looked into modifications made to some courses and also explored the benefits of field experience.</p>
<p>Other important issues that emerged from the qualitative analysis were related to developing a doctoral program in LIS in Kuwait, so students can pursue a doctorate without having to travel abroad should they be interested in staying in academia. Furthermore, textual analysis revealed some negative perceptions of the program. One was that the degree was not useful in terms of employment opportunities. Another was that the title of the program did not reflect current trends in the field. These results have implications for considering improvements to the program, making it more tailored to the students’ needs. Results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0340035212456987">Table 9</xref>) showing that 50.0 percent of respondents wished they had learnt Web design, 33.7 percent wished they had learnt about digital media and 14.1 percent wished they had learnt Internet searching indicate a growing interest in modern trends and technology skills of the field. A look at the skills alumni wish they had learnt while studying for the MLIS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0340035212456987">Table 9</xref>) may reflect shortcomings in the curriculum and suggest areas where courses need to be introduced or enhanced. If Internet searching is taken as an example, although it gets a high percentage as a skill most useful on the job (70.6 percent in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0340035212456987">Table 10</xref>), and as a skill learnt while working on the MLIS (73.9 percent in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0340035212456987">Table 11</xref>), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0340035212456987">Table 9</xref> shows that 14.1 percent of respondents still wish they learnt it during the MLIS program, suggesting some shortcomings in that aspect of the course that till need to be addressed. Generally these percentages can be understood better if we compare the results of opinions regarding skills deemed useful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0340035212456987">Table 10</xref>) and skills alumni wish they had learnt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0340035212456987">Table 9</xref>). This can explain the differences between skills deemed useful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0340035212456987">Table 10</xref>) and those learnt while studying for the MLIS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0340035212456987">Table 11</xref>). Additionally, if the skills alumni see as useful on the job (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0340035212456987">Table 10</xref>) are juxtaposed to the skills they wish they had learnt while studying (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0340035212456987">Table 11</xref>) the results broadly agree with each other.</p>
<p>The results also shed light on the perceived image of the profession and its professionals. Alumni emphasize the importance of changing the name of the program and degree to reflect the new roles and nature of the profession in light of technology advancements. Furthermore, the results point to the importance of more in-depth study of developing specialization tracks within the program in light of the needs of the alumni community already in the job market.</p>
<p>Text analysis of the answers as to whether graduates would still seek an MLIS if they were to go back revealed that out of a total of 92 respondents, 80 (87.0 percent) answered, and 12 (13.0 percent) skipped the question. Out of the 80 respondents who answered, 56 (70.0 percent) answered “yes” and 24 (30 percent) answered “no.” Positive responses then were looked at and found mostly related to enjoying the field, getting the degree, and self-development, whereas negative responses revolved around employment issues after gaining the degree and the general negative attitude of people toward the title of the program. These results have implications for different stakeholders, requiring exerting more effort to enhance program marketing, as mentioned above.</p>

<title>Analysis and discussion</title>
<p>The Kuwaiti MLIS alumni market is evolving. It is dominated by Kuwaiti females who are married and are family caretakers, mostly in their 30s. Almost half of surveyed alumni pursued their MLIS as part-time students and have been on the job for more than 10 years. More than half of the alumni came from the humanities, sciences, social sciences, and education. They came mostly from the different colleges of Kuwait University and had GPAs greater than 3.0. There were 24 respondents (26.4 percent) who answered “other” for their undergraduate major. Those other majors were found to be mostly in the humanities, English and communications, and to a lesser extent in business and political science. This means that the LIS major is appealing to English literature students because it is taught in English and to communications majors because it is taught in English and also because of the closeness of the communications and information professions. The fact that this program accepts students from different faculties of the university and the fact that it is taught in English makes it appealing to students from other faculties.</p>
<p>The results, interestingly enough and contrary to what was expected, show that the MLIS is a conscious choice for these students. Data collected shows clearly that desiring a master’s degree, self-actualization and interest in the filed are the most common reasons why those alumni sought the degree. Since obtaining a degree is socially desirable, this presents a golden opportunity for the field to enhance its image and market itself as a nontraditional discipline. The same analysis could apply to political science and business majors, taking into consideration the appeal of management and policy issues to these majors. Other faculties and colleges had minor representation. Interestingly enough, 65.2 percent of the alumni graduated with GPAs above 3.5 and another 30.2 percent of them graduated with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.5. There seems to be consistency in the academic performance of alumni on both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Contrary to what was expected, students coming into the MLIS program are shown by these figures to be very competent students, accomplished as both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>People’s networks seem to be the best marketing medium for the program; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0340035212456987">Table 4</xref> shows that more than 40 percent of respondents knew about it through their friends. Combined with those who knew about the program from family members, a total of 45.6 percent got their information through personal relationships. This sheds light on the primacy of people’s networks and their effect in a culture such as the Kuwaiti one, and it further highlights the importance of capitalizing on social media for any public relations campaign for the MLIS. This could be very powerful if combined with social media on the university’s Web sites and campus. This result is in line with recommendations made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212456987">Raguotis and Petuchovaite (2010)</xref>, which highlighted the importance of promoting research benefits to alumni clubs and profession-based social networks. Actually, two existing projects played some role in publicizing this study to the alumni. A 4-year-old blog, developed by one of the alumni when he was a student, acted as a platform for students’ opinions, observations, and the exchange of ideas and information. Additionally the same graduate developed a Facebook group account for MLIS alumni, LISKW, in early 2011.</p>
<p>A sizable number of alumni (56.5 percent) had a salary increase and 44.5 percent had a job title change after obtaining the MLIS. This is an unexpected finding that completely dispels existing impressions, and it can be used to market the program and profession. Furthermore, the fact that 38.0 percent, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0340035212456987">Table 5</xref> shows, had salaries greater than KWD 1000 a month could be related to the fact that 60.9 percent of respondents were employed in government (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0340035212456987">Table 6</xref>). However the numbers employed in private academic or supporting academic positions in Kuwait University or PAAET shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0340035212456987">Table 8</xref> are expected to stabilize or decrease in the future and make way for the preparation of more professionals in the field and fewer academics. Other studies in the literature have also looked at salary expectations and perceptions of the job market, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212456987">Ard et al. (2006)</xref>, who proposed several recruitment strategies for improving the careers of MLIS students. When and if strategies are formulated for the Kuwaiti market, findings of this study need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212456987">Shontz and Murray (2007)</xref> showed, the functions and jobs performed by holders of LIS degrees are various, and in Kuwait they are, too. It is worth mentioning that 77.1 percent of the Kuwaiti alumni surveyed consider the skills learned during their graduate study to be beneficial to their jobs, answering one of the survey questions.</p>
<p>Respondents’ answers about skills they wish they had learned versus skills useful for them on the job were slightly different. Future planning of the program and department needs to take into consideration the skills deemed beneficial on the job. A closer look shows that they combine traditional and nontraditional skills such as Internet searching, management, communication, leadership, cataloging and organization, collection development, digital media and digitizing, Web design, and bibliographic instruction. Most studies that have looked into the skills and competencies of MLIS professionals emphasize the professional and personal components. This is compatible with what has been discussed in the literature review regarding the seven major areas of competencies declared by CARL: foundational knowledge, interpersonal skills, leadership and management, collection development, information literacy, research and contribution to the profession, and information technology skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0340035212456987">Belzile et al. 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212456987">Raguotis and Petuchovaite (2010)</xref>, in their study of LIS alumni, pointed to the importance of reporting research findings to alumni, and it is clear that alumni can benefit from professional development opportunities to enhance and update their skills while on the job.</p>

<sec id="section13-0340035212456987">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>This study points to deficiency in the current tracking system for alumni, and points out the importance of having an efficient online system that tracks alumni both geographically and professionally. Capitalizing on technology capabilities to track and keep in touch with alumni seems to be a very viable method, such as a continuous online information tracking system for alumni through Kuwait University, in which students who graduate from Kuwait University would be eligible to keep their email addresses updated for life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212456987">Marshall et al. (2009a/b)</xref> conducted a study in two parts to explore LIS workforce issues and pointed to the importance of institutions committing the necessary resources to establish such a tracking system. Kuwait University needs to commit resources toward that end.</p>
<p>Professionals in the field are beginning to form groups, and it is expected that they will have a stronger presence as well as impact that will advance the status of the profession and its professionals. Job titles and corresponding salaries are initial causes for these groups in the future. One problem is that the government civil service and accounting system does not consider the professional master’s degree in LIS if the holder of it has an undergraduate degree in a field other than LIS. This issue should be a priority for any group that forms in the future, and it entails educating decision-makers about the nature of the field and its degrees and clarifying the significance of a broad liberal education to professionals.</p>
<p>A sizable number of the responding alumni come from diverse backgrounds and hold undergraduate degrees from fields other than LIS. This clearly emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of this field and the professional nature of the degree offered.</p>
<p>Students emphasized the importance of getting more practical, rather than theoretical, courses and experiences. In one case in which the alumnus is working in a Western country, the alumnus emphasized that the MLIS from Kuwait University was honored, however, the skills needed for the job include project management, ethics, copyright, and professional practices. Those areas need to be included in the curriculum.</p>
<p>Students took time and effort to send email messages along with the questionnaire to further elaborate on issues they thought were of importance. In some cases, alumni communicated if they had any technical problem submitting the questionnaire online. Others took the time to email the researchers confirming that they had submitted their results and, in other cases, to provide other alumni email addresses. This clearly indicates their eagerness to participate and voice their concerns, and above all it shows their interest in the profession. This eagerness is worth mentioning because it reflects a professional commitment and affinity to the field.</p>
<p>Holders of the MLIS degree have a multitude of choices. Any marketing of the degree and the profession needs to take into consideration that a sizable number of alumni are working outside the field. As the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212456987">Shontz and Murray (2007)</xref> study shows, the literature points to at least 95 possible different jobs for holders of the MLIS. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0340035212456987">Marshall et al. (2009)</xref> study of LIS workforce issues pointed to the need for an alumni tracking system to know where graduates are and what they are doing with their degrees. This is clearly needed in the case of the alumni studied in this research.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on social media to enhance both the image of the profession and the professionals needs to be considered. Social media is an efficient tool to help track alumni and an attractive one for the alumni. A blog administered by one of the alumni was established in 2007, and a group Facebook account exists as well. Together, these could partially serve this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0340035212456987">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The market of MLIS alumni is young and evolving. Results of this survey show it is dominated by young females who are working hard to get their degrees while being on the job and taking care of a family at the same time. The functions they perform and the places they work are varied, and technology is changing how and where they perform their jobs. Planning needs to consider this variety and needs to capitalize on the capabilities of social media to market and spread knowledge about the field and its professionals. Studies are needed to further assess qualitative data and consider changes to curricular content. Results of this survey will enhance outcomes of the graduate program in Kuwait and in other countries that share a similar cultural background and similar characteristics.</p>
<p>Finally, getting contact information for alumni and communicating with them was a long, detailed, and tedious job, which points to the lack of a reliable tracking and contact system, something that modern social media can easily make possible. The study at hand affirms the importance of an alumni tracking system that capitalizes on social media.</p>
