<abstract>
<p>Medical mistakes, especially ones with significant adverse events, can erode the trust and bonds between and among parents, patients, and health care professionals. Prevention of medical mistakes should be the goal of every health care organization, and participation in quality improvement processes aimed at patient safety is an ethical duty for all health care professionals. But when mistakes occur, health care organizations and professionals should rapidly move toward disclosure and apology. These duties of honesty, disclosure and apology are based ethically on core health care principles and values. Health care organizations should require disclosure-and-apology training, especially for front-line personnel; provide assistance to clinicians with these difficult conversations; and invest in resources to address the moral distress experienced by professionals, who are often the “second victims” of medical mistakes.</p>

<p>Mistakes happen in all spheres of life, from overfertilizing a potted plant to rear-ending a car after failing to maintain a safe distance. Some mistakes can have little or no negative consequences, while others can be devastating and even deadly. The same is true in health care. For example, the wrong dosage of a medication can be given to a patient, as when 3 premature infants died after receiving 1000 times an ordered dose of heparin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073813477690">1</xref></sup> or when a 2-year-old boy lost his hearing after receiving twice the correct dosage of chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073813477690">2</xref></sup> Other examples include patients receiving the wrong surgery or receiving the correct surgery on the wrong body site. Such medical mistakes are significantly injurious to patients, overwhelming for children’s parents and families, and distressing and traumatic for health care professionals, who are often called the “second victims” of medical errors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073813477690">3</xref></sup> Medical mistakes, especially ones with significant adverse events, can erode the trust and bonds between and among parents, patients, and professionals.</p>
<p>Medical mistakes are more openly discussed and reported than they were 20 years ago. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include the publishing, in 1999, of the Institute of Medicine’s highly influential document <italic>To Err Is Human, Building a Safer Health System</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073813477690">4</xref></sup> The document’s startling statistics noted that more people die annually in U.S. hospitals as a result of medical mistakes than from motor vehicle accidents or from breast cancer, and the financial toll of these mistakes is literally billions of dollars per year. Since 1999, there has been a significant increase in the publication of position papers, recommended policies and procedures, conceptual essays, empirical research, and summary reports on an expanding list of issues and concerns related to medical mistakes. Much of this published literature and reflection can be clustered under 2 main categories: (1) prevention of medical mistakes and (2) disclosure and apology when mistakes occur.</p>
<p>A preamble, though, for any discussion of medical mistakes is defining, describing, and differentiating medical mistakes from other kinds of adverse events. This is not an easy task. Some events are clearly errors, like the examples given above. But most adverse events experienced by patients are not the results of mistakes but are anticipated side effects and risks associated with medical and surgical interventions, or the negative sequelae of disease processes. Some events can be characterized as “near misses” because they do not reach patients—but if they had, they would have resulted in serious consequences. Other incidents are indeed medical errors but fortunately do not result in patient harm. And finally, even if a medical mistake occurs resulting in harm to a patient, the mistake does not necessarily mean that the health care professional was “negligent.” Therefore, one of the more challenging tasks when discussing and strategizing about medical mistakes is identifying criteria, language, and processes to describe and differentiate medical mistakes from other adverse events, near misses, and negligent actions. Three elements of a generic and workable description of a medical mistake are the following: (1) a failure of a planned action to be completed as intended, or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim; (2) an action or a result that is preventable; and (3) an action that does not necessarily result in patient harm.</p>
<p>Ideally, <italic>prevention</italic> of medical mistakes is the best policy and practice. Because health care professionals should be committed to the ethical principle of “do no harm,” to patient best interests, and to an organizational culture of patient safety, they and the facilities where they work have an ethical responsibility to be continuously engaged in process improvements that enhance quality of care and prevent medical mistakes. The National Quality Forum, since 2001, has promoted such quality improvement strategies by listing and calling attention to “never events” that Forum leadership view as preventable and that should never happen in hospitals (eg, wrong site surgery, infant discharge to the wrong person, stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcers after admission).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073813477690">5</xref></sup> Similarly, the Leapfrog Group (a coalition of corporations, public agencies, and health care consumers and purchasers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073813477690">6</xref></sup> has focused on reducing preventable mistakes through strategies including publicly reporting quality and outcomes data. An example of a statewide initiative to promote patient safety, and to reduce and prevent medical errors among 8 pediatric hospitals, is the Ohio Children’s Hospitals Solutions for Patient Safety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073813477690">7</xref></sup> with each hospital sharing successes and failures to improve the quality of health care in Ohio for children.</p>
<p>Despite significant and continuous efforts to improve quality and prevent mistakes, no health care delivery system or its professionals will ever be perfect. So when medical mistakes occur, <italic>honesty</italic> becomes the best policy and practice, especially regarding disclosure of mistakes to parents and patients. This assertion of the dual duties of honesty and disclosure is based on multiple ethical foundations, including a model of decision making that views parents as partners with professionals in promoting the health and well-being of children; the fiduciary relationship among clinicians, patients, and their parents; a robust process of informed consent or permission; respect for parental rights; and the values of truth-telling and transparency. Ethical justifications for honesty and disclosure can also be based on the positive consequences resulting from disclosure of medical mistakes. A position paper by the Harvard Hospitals summarized well this kind of ethical “consequentialist” justification: “Honest communication promotes trust between patient and provider, so that the primary focus for the clinician-patient relationship remains patient care. Further, open discussion about errors can promote patient safety by encouraging clinicians to seek systems improvements that minimize the likelihood of recurrence.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073813477690">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additional insights, motivations, and nuances for disclosure of medical mistakes are gained from official position statements by some health care “authorities.” The American Medical Association asserts: “In these situations [when a patient suffers significant medical complications resulting from a physician’s mistake], the physician is ethically required to inform the patient of all facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred. Only through full disclosure is a patient able to make informed decisions regarding future medical care.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073813477690">9</xref></sup> Further, the American College of Physician states, “Physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors made in the course of care if such information is material to the patient’s well-being. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073813477690">10</xref></sup> And finally, The Joint Commission, in an Element of Performance attached to its standard RI.01.02.01, requires the following: “The hospital informs the patient or surrogate decision-maker about unanticipated outcomes of care, treatment, and services that relate to sentinel events considered reviewable by The Joint Commission.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073813477690">11</xref></sup> A sentinel event is defined by The Joint Commission as “an unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk thereof.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073813477690">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The above ethical justifications and nuances lead to the conclusions that not all medical mistakes must be disclosed, but that professionals, at a minimum, have an ethical obligation to disclose mistakes or unanticipated outcomes resulting in serious or significant injury and harm and/or that are material to a patient’s well-being.</p>
<p>In conjunction with disclosure of medical mistakes, should health care professionals apologize for mistakes? In the wider realm of human relationships, apologies can be healing, repair violations of trust, show respect, promote humility and empathy, dissipate anger, and emphasize a relationship’s intrinsic value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073813477690">13</xref></sup> But the dark cloud that hangs over apology after a medical mistake is whether the apology will increase the likelihood that clinicians will be sued in a court of law—because an apology, depending on how it is worded, can be interpreted as an admission of fault and wrongdoing. As a result, some hospital lawyers and risk managers can be supportive of disclosures after medical mistakes but much more cautious or discouraging of apologies. In the literature on apology, a distinction has emerged between an <italic>Expression of Sympathy</italic> and an <italic>Expression of Responsibility</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073813477690">14</xref></sup> As an illustration, imagine a physician ordering an overdose of chemotherapy for a child with leukemia resulting in serious harm to a child, and that the physician order is an unambiguous and preventable mistake. The physician could say to the parents: “I’m sorry your child suffered complications from the chemotherapy,” which would be an Expression of Sympathy. Or the physician could say: “I’m sorry I made a mistake about the dose of chemotherapy, resulting in the complications your child experienced,” which would be an Expression of Responsibility. Many parents might find the second expression more honest, authentic, and satisfying, whereas many clinicians (and their legal advisors) might find the second expression more risky, distressing, and unsettling. Certainly, some expression of apology should accompany disclosure after a medical mistake. But given the current medical-legal climate of U.S. health care, the best that clinicians could be able to provide in many situations are apologies that are Expressions of Sympathy, with Expressions of Responsibility remaining an aspirational practice.</p>
<p>Prevention of medical mistakes should be the goal of every health care organization, and participation in quality improvement processes aimed at patient safety is an ethical duty for all health care professionals. But when mistakes occur, especially if they result in significant harm, health care organizations and professionals should rapidly move toward disclosure and a form of apology. But such disclosure-apology discussions with parents can be complex and subtle, and should be tailored to the nature of the event, the clinical context, and the clinician-parent-patient relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073813477690">15</xref></sup> Health care organizations should require disclosure-and-apology training, especially for front-line personnel; provide “just-in-time” coaching and Critical Event/Rapid Response Teams to assist clinicians with these conversations; and invest in resources to address the emotional and moral distress experienced by professionals, who can be the “second victims” of medical mistakes.</p>
