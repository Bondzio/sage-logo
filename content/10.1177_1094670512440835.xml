<abstract>
<p>This study aims to explicate why customers stay in service relationships, while additionally examining how different forms of commitment to these relationships affect customers' voice, both within and outside of the relationship. Based on qualitative interviews and an extensive literature review, we provide and test a framework linking staying reasons to commitment to voice utilizing a survey of 685 online panelists in committed service relationships. Our results illustrate the differential effects of staying reasons on commitment and commitment on voice. Social balance theory, social influence theory, and escalation of commitment provide important theoretical bases for why individuals stay. We examine a number of unexamined or underexplored gaps in the literature, finding seven notable links relative to staying reasons and commitment (relational benefits and resistance to change to calculative commitment; subjective norms and sunk costs to affective commitment; procedural switching costs, avoidance of conflict, and resistance to change to normative commitment). Additionally, a number of less explored, as well as previously studied, findings between commitments and voice are noted, including the strong negative impacts of calculative commitment and silent endurance on voice. This suggests the importance of the service provider not locking the customer in too tightly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding what drives consumers to stay in relationships with service providers is of critical importance to marketers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512440835">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>), with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512440835">Bolton, Lemon, and Verhoef (2004</xref>, p.287) arguing for the need to understand the “key drivers” of relationships better. We call the key drivers for staying in relationships “staying reasons.” Unfortunately, staying reasons have only received limited attention in the literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512440835">Colgate et al. 2007</xref>), although marketers consider retention of customers to be the holy grail in marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512440835">Reichheld 1993</xref>; Sewall and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670512440835">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A central construct in understanding relationships is customer commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512440835">Bansal, Irving, and Taylor (2004)</xref> argued for the inclusion of commitment in the study of service provider switching. However, here we argue that commitment to the service provider, representing relational continuity between the parties, holds even greater promise in studying why individuals stay with service providers, but a comprehensive framework assessing the relationship between two constructs has not been forthcoming.</p>
<p>Further, in line with a call to study the effects of commitment on important discretionary behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512440835">Bansal, Irving, and Taylor 2004</xref>), we draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512440835">Hirschman’s (1970)</xref> ideas on voice. We address three voice elements—positive and negative word of mouth (PWOM and NWOM) to others, which can have a powerful impact on the sales and profitability of the company, and communication (or lack of) with the firm (a critical component of the consumers' interaction with the firm).</p>
<p>We use the three-component commitment model to connect the two constructs (staying reasons and voice) in an overarching framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512440835">Figure 1</xref>
). This framework is articulated below and the model empirically tested on a group of consumers in committed relationships with service providers.</p>

<title>Overview of Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>While much of the research on commitment treats it as a global concept, researchers in marketing increasingly turn to the three-component view of commitment from organizational behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512440835">Meyer and Allen 1997</xref>) to understand committed customer-firm relationships better. This perspective includes three types of commitment—affective, normative, and calculative.</p>
<p>
<italic>Affective</italic> commitment addresses the idea of individuals “wanting” to stay. This is the traditional view of <italic>commitment</italic> and relates to dedication-based factors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512440835">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>). <italic>Calculative</italic> 
<italic>commitment</italic> involves individuals feeling that they “have” to stay, for example, perhaps they have a contract, perceive high switching costs, or feel there are no reasonable alternatives available. They are locked in (i.e., constraint based). Finally, <italic>normative</italic> 
<italic>commitm</italic>
<italic>ent</italic> involves individuals feeling that they “should” stay in a relationship due to a moral or personal obligation, that is, based on social pressure. Normative commitment is the most misunderstood component and it is not clear when or how its staying reasons are dedication based versus constraint based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512440835">Meyer, Allen, and Smith 1993</xref>). While commitment reflects a motivation or willingness to stay with a service provider (regardless of the reasons why), the dominant commitment type (or types) are often the primary drivers of behaviors toward the provider (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512440835">Herscovitch and Meyer 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, commitment, regardless of type, is the “glue” that keeps people in relationships, even in the possible face of dissatisfaction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670512440835">Han, Kwortnik, and Wang 2008</xref>), with higher repurchase intentions clearly related to commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670512440835">Jones, Dacin, and Taylor 2011</xref>). Thus, commitment perfectly represents the state that consumers are in when they decide to stay in a relationship. They may stay for positive and/or negative <italic>staying reasons</italic> (which are defined as the reasons why someone stays in a relationship), but they are in a committed relationship. Researchers note the importance of understanding more about the antecedents and consequences of commitment components (cf. Bansal, Irving, and Taylor 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512440835">Geyskens et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. 2007</xref>). Thus, the first goal here is to identify and study the differential effects of staying reasons on commitment components.</p>
<p>Based on qualitative work and the existing literature, we identify four categories of staying reasons, with several involving two subdimensions, producing six staying reasons of interest: relational benefits, two types of switching barriers (sunk costs and procedural switching costs), subjective norms, and two personality variables (avoidance of conflict and resistance to change).</p>
<p>The first two dimensions, relational benefits and switching barriers, are similar to the two overarching staying dimensions identified by Colgate and his colleagues in his study of why customers decide to stay after a serious consideration to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512440835">Colgate et al. 2007</xref>). These include affirmatory factors and switching barriers and represent the positive (dedication-based) factors and negative (constraint-based) factors, respectively. The literature also supports the switching barrier subdimensions revealed in our qualitative work—sunk costs and procedural switching costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512440835">Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty 2002</xref>). <italic>Relational benefits</italic> are the positive effects of maintaining a relationship. <italic>Sunk costs</italic> (also known as relationship-specific investments) involve perceptions of investments of time, money, and/or energy put into the relationship over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512440835">Bendapudi and Berry 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670512440835">Rusbult 1980</xref>), while <italic>procedural switching costs</italic> involve perceptions of the costs involved to locate and move to a new provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The other factors, subjective norms and personality variables, have received less research attention relative to this area of research. <italic>Subjective norms</italic> refer to a person’s perceptions that important people think s/he should or should not engage in a particular action or hold a particular attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512440835">Fishbein and Ajzen 1980</xref>). They have received some attention as an antecedent to normative commitment (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512440835">Bansal, Irving, and Taylor 2004</xref>), while researchers have not linked the two personality variables, avoidance of conflict and resistance to change, to commitment. However, our interviews suggested the viability of these relationships. <italic>Avoidance of conflict</italic> is an attempt to protect the self from conflict, disapproval, and negative attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512440835">Brock 1999</xref>), while <italic>resistance to change</italic> involves preferring the status quo and not wishing to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512440835">Diamond 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A second goal of this paper is to examine how commitment components affect a customer’s <italic>voice</italic>, that is, verbal expressions to the company or others. We identify three subcomponents of voice here—PWOM, NWOM, and silent endurance. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512440835">Hirschman’s (1970)</xref> theory of exit, voice, and loyalty an individual who experiences dissatisfaction with an organization (in our case, a service provider) has two options: exit (which our sample has ruled out) or voice, with voice defined as an attempt to express “dissatisfaction directly to management” or through “a general protest addressed to anyone who cares to listen” (p. 4). Thus, his view of voice deals with either the individual engaging with the organization for improvement or letting others know about the negative experience (i.e., <italic>NWOM</italic>). Further, he says that some individuals stay, hoping that things will improve, noting that they may “suffer in silence” (p. 38). We call this idea <italic>silent endurance</italic>, noting that often individuals stay because they feel that they can neither exit nor effectively voice complaints or concerns (i.e., a lack of voice). Finally, we also identify <italic>PWOM</italic>, which involves telling others good things about a firm, as the third voice component of interest here.</p>
<p>Bloemer and Odekerken-Schröder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512440835">2007</xref>) studied complaining (variable included complaining to the firm and others) and PWOM relative to all commitments in a bank setting, while others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512440835">Fullerton 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. 2007</xref>; Verhoef, Franses, and Hoekstra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512440835">2002</xref>) connect NWOM and PWOM to affective and calculative commitment. However, no effort connects all commitment components to all voice components in a cross-industry study. Thus, by studying the staying reasons producing commitment and the commitment antecedents of voice, we provide a comprehensive view of commitment and voice.</p>
<p>Toward these goals, we first conduct and analyze 22 depth interviews on the topic. Next, based on the qualitative findings, a literature review, and pretesting, we develop and test our model. Besides developing a comprehensive framework of staying reasons, commitment components, and voice elements, our findings illustrate the differential effects of staying reasons on commitment types and commitments on voice. Social balance theory, social influence theory, and escalation of commitment provide the important theoretical bases for reasons why individuals stay in relationships.</p>

Gwinner, Gremler, and Bitner’s widely accepted paradigm includes special treatment, social, and confidence benefits. <italic>Special treatment benefits</italic> refer to the preferential treatment customers may obtain from an ongoing relationship with a provider. <italic>Social benefits</italic> refer to the personal bonds and friendships between the customer and members of the firm. Finally, <italic>confidence benefits</italic> relate to the comfort or security a consumer has in a relationship and are similar to trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512440835">Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner and Gremler 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>All three benefits link to affective commitment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512440835">Table 1</xref> for a sampling of these studies), based on reciprocity and social exchange theory (Blau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512440835">1964</xref>), with this established connection shown in the first hypothesis. On the other hand, researchers pay less attention to the potential linkages between relational benefits and the other commitments. However, we also anticipate a positive relationship between benefits and normative commitment. The logic of this link, peripherally studied relative to personal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512440835">Barksdale, Johnson and Suh 1997</xref>), also draws from the reciprocity and social exchange (Blau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512440835">1964</xref>) paradigms. In social exchange theory, the exchange of resources tends to produce a sense of obligation by the recipient to reciprocate in kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512440835">Eisenberger et al. 1997</xref>; Susskind, Kacmar, and Borchgrevink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670512440835">2003</xref>).<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Subjective norms→commitment</title>
<p>Another important reason to stay in a relationship is due to strong subjective norms (<bold>
<italic>snorm</italic>
</bold>). When one feels pressure to do or not do something, the feeling to comply is strong (partially due to reciprocity regarding someone cared about or social pressure). The feeling to comply with others' wishes may produce affective commitment due to internationalization of the information or identification with the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512440835">Bearden and Etzel 1982</xref>). Variables similar to subjective norms, such as organizational support (Rousseau and Aubé <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512440835">2010</xref>; Vandenberghe, Bentein, and Stinglhamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094670512440835">2004</xref>), have been linked to affective commitment, although the relationship per se has not been studied<list list-type="bullet">

This desire to please or to “not displease” others can produce higher normative commitment.

<title>Switching barriers→commitments</title>
<p>As noted earlier, we identify two important switching barriers: sunk costs and procedural switching costs. <italic>Sunk costs (</italic>

While we believe that sunk costs should positively link to all three commitments, only the relationship between sunk costs and calculative commitment is established in the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512440835">Table 1</xref> for relevant studies). However, when one invests time, money and/or effort in a relationship, one should feel more positively toward the service provider and desire to stay (i.e., affective commitment). This may be due to escalation of commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512440835">Bobocel and Meyer 1994</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512440835">Bendapudi and Berry (1997</xref>, p. 20) address escalating commitment as self-justification, “They may rationalize that their commitment is not driven by dependence but instead by their own volition, for instance, by dedication.”</p>
<p>Further, sunk costs should also produce a sense of obligation to stay in the relationship (i.e., normative commitment), following from a need or desire to reciprocate (Blau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512440835">1964</xref>), as well as due to an escalation-to-commitment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512440835">Bobocel and Meyer 1994</xref>). Meyer et al.

On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. (2007)</xref> argue that procedural switching costs make customers feel like “hostages” in the relationship (Sharma and Patterson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670512440835">2000</xref>, p. 484), producing an expected positive relationship between procedural switching costs and calculative commitment.<list list-type="bullet">

We identify two such factors—avoidance of conflict (<bold>
<italic>avoid</italic>
</bold>) and resistance to change (<bold>
<italic>resis</italic>

</list>Individuals who possess a conflict-avoiding personality prefer not to assert themselves in order to preserve smooth relations with others (Schroeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094670512440835">1965</xref>). They seek positive reinforcement and need to be seen as pleasant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512440835">Brock 1999</xref>), and thus, they often endure, rather than confront. Avoidance of conflict may be associated with feelings of obligation both to stay in a relationship due to a sense of obligation to the provider (normative commitment) and to a need to stay due to an inability to confront the provider (calculative commitment). These hypotheses are untested in the literature.<list list-type="bullet">

These individuals may feel locked into relationships due to a sense of obligation (normative commitment) and an inability to leave (calculative commitment).

This may be due to an interpersonal connection with the service provider, so s/he may be less likely to complain to the service provider but instead “just stays.” If s/he is unhappy, s/he may both suffer in silence and tell others about her unhappiness. Thus, in a social pressure-based relationship, s/he may feel as if s/he is a hostage, much as someone with high calculative commitment might feel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512440835">Kim, Ok, and Gwinner (2010)</xref> suggest that social pressure-based relationships may produce acquiescence or passive conformance.

<title>Commitment interrelationships</title>
<p>The relationship between the commitment components is somewhat controversial. Researchers often just treat them as correlated, especially in the management literature. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512440835">Bansal, Irving, and Taylor (2004)</xref> and Meyer and Smith (2001) argue that affective commitment should influence normative commitment, noting that individuals who want to stay with a company may also feel a sense of obligation to do so. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512440835">Bansal, Irving, and Taylor (2004)</xref>, in a study of customers of auto repair shops, did not find this link, Meyer and Smith (2001) in an employee-firm context did. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670512440835">Cater and Zabkar (2009)</xref> find this link with professional service providers, suggesting that past positive experiences with the service provider creates a psychological bond. This linkage may exist due to a desire to reciprocate to the party for which a positive relationship exists.</p>
<p>Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512440835">Barksdale, Johnson, and Suh (1997)</xref> find a causal link between normative and calculative commitment in their study of patient-physician relationships in both fee-based and managed care relationships. The underlying rationale is that feeling a sense of obligation produces a need to stay, thus, linking obligations to feelings of constraint and lack of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512440835">Averill 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512440835">Deci and Ryan 1985</xref>).<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Silent endurance→WOM</title>
<p>When an individual “silently endures,” s/he may experience tension or frustration (regardless of why s/he is staying in the relationship). While their relationship overall with the firm may be positive, s/he may feel that s/he cannot complain (perhaps to shield the provider’s feelings), which may cause frustration. Negative affect tends to increase WOM activity (Westbrook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094670512440835">1987</xref>). Similarly, a frustrated customer who does not complain to the service provider may complain to others to release this frustration and may say fewer positive things. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. (2007)</xref> find that negative emotions (frustration, anger, and irritation) relate positively to NWOM. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512440835">Hirschman’s (1970)</xref> exit, voice, and loyalty theory suggest that when customers are unable to exit a relationship, they seek ways to voice their displeasure, including NWOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512440835">Geyskens et al. 1996</xref>). Singh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512440835">1990</xref>) argues that consumers are more likely to engage in NWOM when they believe their complaint efforts will be futile.

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section18-1094670512440835">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Our method included three stages. First, we conducted 22 depth interviews focusing on why individuals stay in relationships to identify the most prominent staying reasons. The researchers extensively and exhaustively analyzed these interviews by means of content analysis to develop the dimensions and subdimensions addressed here, with interjudge reliabilities in excess of 80%. Next, we conducted several pretests in which students served as the data collectors to assess our scales. Finally, we conducted the main study in which we drew an online panel using Zoomerang. This company maintains an online consumer panel of about 2.5 million consumers worldwide, including over 1 million consumers across the United States.</p>
<p>For the current study, Zoomerang randomly selected individuals for e-mail invitations based on the U.S. Census for age, gender, and household income. Individuals responding to the invitation provided responses about a service provider that they felt some personal sense of obligation to stay with (given that they could identify such a service provider). Given that affective commitment should affect normative commitment, which should affect calculative commitment, identifying relationships involving normative commitment (obligated relationships) ensured that the relationships examined represented “committed relationships.” We did not prespecify whether staying reasons were mostly positive or negative. Seven hundred and forty-two panel members responded to the survey invitation and identified such a relationship. Fifty-seven responses were dropped due to careless responding or to an inability to explain why they felt obligated to stay with the service provider, leaving a final sample of 685.</p>
<p>A wide variety of service industries appear in the responses, with the five most heavily represented being (1) doctor, health care provider, dentist (<italic>n</italic> = 176); (2) bank, mortgage lender, financial advisor, accountant (<italic>n</italic> = 125); (3) hairstylist, barber, manicurist (<italic>n</italic> = 90); (4) veterinarian (<italic>n</italic> = 63); and (5) car repair (<italic>n</italic> = 49).</p>
<p>The mean length of the relationship is 9.22 years (standard deviation = 9.28; range: 1-60 years). The sample is 45% male, with a range of age categories (37% are 19-35, 35% are 36-55, and 28% are 56 years or older). About 27% of the sample is single, 57% is married, 8% divorced, and the remaining 8% are either widowed or living with a partner. The sample is similar in composition to U.S. census data (U.S. Census Bureau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670512440835">2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section19-1094670512440835">
<title>Measures and Pretests</title>
<p>To measure our constructs, we drew our items from existing scales and adapted them as necessary, while we created a new scale for silent endurance, with items drawn from our qualitative interviews and from related literature and evaluated for content and face validity. The scales and instrument were thoroughly pretested to reduce the number of items needed in the final survey, to test the administration of the survey, and to minimize any clarity issues.<sup>

<p>The final instrument contains items that measure the following 12 constructs: relational benefits (composed of special treatment benefits, social benefits, and confidence benefits), subjective norms, sunk costs, procedural switching costs, avoidance of conflict, resistance to change, affective commitment, normative commitment, calculative commitment, PWOM, NWOM, and silent endurance. The final scale items (after the final confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)) and their sources appear in the first several columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670512440835">Table 3</xref>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>In the measurement model, we model relational benefits as a second-order construct, comprised of special treatment benefits, social benefits, and confidence benefits. There were two reasons for this approach. First, these dimensions represent the underlying dimensions of relational benefits reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670512440835">Gwinner, Gremler, and Bitner 1998</xref>; Vazquez-Carrasco and Foxall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670512440835">2006</xref>). Second, the relatively high correlations between the benefit subdimensions (ranging from .47 to .80) are indicative of a higher order construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670512440835">Anderson and Gerbing 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>All other variables are modeled as first-order constructs. We purified the measures with an initial confirmatory analysis in AMOS, dropping several items with low standardized factor loadings. The model was re-run. In this final model, all factor loadings are significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and all standardized factor loadings of the indicators are above .50. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670512440835">Table 3</xref> presents the final loadings based on the purification model using Amos 6.0, along with reliability coefficients and AVEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670512440835">Anderson and Gerbing 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670512440835">Fornell and Larcker 1981</xref>). We obtained a χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1094670512440835">

</xref>
</sup> of 2,368 with 968 degrees of freedom and a χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio of 2.45, with ratios between 2 and 5, indicating an acceptable fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512440835">Marsh and Hocevar 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670512440835">Bollen’s (1989)</xref> incremental fit index (IFI) is .93, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512440835">Bentler’s (1989)</xref> comparative fit index (CFI) is .92, with an RMSEA of .046, indicating an acceptable model fit. Further, composite reliabilities are strong, ranging from .73 to .93, while AVEs are .49 to .77, which are also reasonable.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670512440835">Table 4</xref>
 presents the correlations (below the diagonal), means, and standard deviations for the constructs. The means for the commitment types in this sample are instructive here. The mean for affective commitment is 3.35, while it is 2.93 for normative commitment and 2.50 for calculative commitment (with mean comparisons different at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Thus, although respondents answered the questions relative to relationships in which they felt some sense of obligation, affective commitment received the highest mean score. This is not surprising, given the importance of affective commitment (relative to the other commitments) to consumers in committed relationships, consistent with a long history of the importance of this construct in the literature.</p>

<p>We assessed discriminant validity with the variance-extracted test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670512440835">Fornell and Larcker 1981</xref>). All constructs achieve discriminant validity, except for two variables. The squared correlation for special treatment benefits and social benefits (.80<sup>2</sup> = .65) exceeds the AVE of social benefits (.56). Therefore, we tested the fit of a 3-factor second-order model (confidence, special treatment, and social benefits as separate subdimensions) against a 2-factor second-order model (where special treatment benefits and social benefits are combined into one dimension and confidence benefits is the second subdimension) to further assess the discriminant validity of these subdimensions. The results indicate that the 3-factor model fits the data better (χ<sup>2</sup> for the 3-factor model = 84.72 with 17 <italic>df</italic>; χ<sup>2</sup> for the 2-factor model = 197.9 with 19 <italic>df</italic>; Δ χ<sup>2</sup> = 113.18 with 2 <italic>df</italic>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Therefore, our relational benefits' higher order construct has three subdimensions, consistent with the literature and our expectations.</p>
<p>We investigate the threat of common method variance in two ways. First, we used the Harman 1-factor test. No single factor emerged from the analysis nor did a single general factor account for most of the variance in the variables, indicating that common method variance may not be an issue. The second method was the marker variable technique by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512440835">Lindell and Whitney (2001)</xref>, in which we chose a measure collected in the survey but unrelated to the constructs of the model. The marker variable used was attractiveness of alternatives. This measure was a 3-item scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512440835">Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty (2000</xref>; α = .83). We then used the lowest positive correlation between this construct and the constructs in our model, which was .01 (i.e., the correlation between attractiveness of alternatives and avoidance of conflict). This correlation was used to create adjusted correlations between the constructs in the model, partialling out the effect of this marker-variable correlation from the uncorrected correlations in the model. The adjusted correlations appear above the diagonal in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670512440835">Table 4</xref>. Next, we assessed the significance levels of the adjusted correlations to determine whether there were any differences in significance levels between the uncorrected correlations and the adjusted correlations. All the uncorrected correlations that were significant before this adjustment were still significant after the adjustment. This implies that common method bias is not a concern in our model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512440835">Lindell and Whitney 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>For the structural model (using Amos 6.0), aggregate measures were created and error terms for the constructs were set, using procedures put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512440835">Jöreskog and Sorbom (1993)</xref>. To mitigate concerns of the potential effect of other variables not identified in our model, we regressed all items in our model on several covariates and then we obtained the residuals (i.e., the items with covariate effects parceled out). We then used these residuals to test our hypothesized model in AMOS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094670512440835">Luo and Bhattacharya (2006)</xref> for a similar approach). The covariates include the following: industry type based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512440835">Lovelock’s (1983)</xref> classification scheme<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1094670512440835">

</xref>
</sup>, the frequency of contact the respondent had with the service provider (responses ranged from once a week to less than once a year); the length of time in the relationship (indicated by months or years in the relationship); and whether or not a contract existed (yes/no response). These covariates capture factors relative to the type of company and nature of the relationship between the provider and respondent.</p>
<p>The results of the initial structural model indicated a poor fitting model. (Bentler and Bonett's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670512440835">1980</xref>) normed fit index (NFI) = .92, CFI = .92 and the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio =12.46; (χ<sup>2</sup> = 224.34 with 18 <italic>df</italic>). Our initial model had all staying reasons going through the commitment components to all of the voice elements; however, the modification indices indicated five potential direct paths from staying reasons to voice elements. In examining these paths, we felt that they could be supported theoretically, thus, we added them to our final model. We acknowledge that we did not anticipate that commitment would fully mediate all staying reasons but did not attempt to model the potential direct effects for the sake of parsimony. These added paths and their results appear at the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1094670512440835">Table 5</xref>
. The results from this revised structural model indicate an adequate fit (NFI = .98, CFI = .99 and the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio =3.68; χ<sup>2</sup> = 47.93 with 13 <italic>df</italic>). The model explains 56% of the variance in affective commitment, 44% of the variance in normative commitment, 55% of the variance in calculative commitment, 56% in PWOM, 36% in NWOM, and 53% in silent endurance.

<p>The analysis supports two of the three relational benefit hypotheses, that is, relational benefits are positively associated with affective commitment (Hypothesis 1<sub>ben</sub>: β =.40, <italic>t</italic> = 10.68) and negatively associated with calculative commitment (Hypothesis 3<sub>ben</sub>: β = −.36, <italic>t</italic> = −9.05). Further, two of the three subjective norms hypotheses are supported by the analysis, with subjective norms positively associated with affective commitment (Hypothesis 1<sub>snorm</sub>: β = .24, <italic>t</italic> = 6.75) and normative commitment (Hypothesis 2<sub>snorm</sub>: β = .22, <italic>t</italic> = 5.30) but not with calculative commitment (Hypothesis 3<sub>snorm</sub>: β = .05, <italic>t</italic> = 1.17). Also, sunk costs are associated with affective and calculative commitment (Hypothesis 1<sub>sunk</sub>: β = .37, <italic>t</italic> = 9.81; Hypothesis 3<sub>sunk</sub>: β = .11, <italic>t</italic> = 2.71) but not with normative commitment (Hypothesis 2<sub>sunk</sub>: β = .02, <italic>t</italic> = .48).</p>
<p>Procedural switching costs are associated with normative and calculative commitments, as expected (Hypothesis 2<sub>pswitch</sub>: β = .20, <italic>t</italic> = 5.04; Hypothesis 3<sub>pswitch</sub>: β = .15, <italic>t</italic> = 4.99, respectively) and also unexpectedly, and negatively, with affective commitment (Hypothesis 1<sub>pswitch</sub>: β = −.07, <italic>t</italic> = −2.05). The analysis supports the expected relationship between avoidance of conflict and normative commitment (Hypothesis 2<sub>avoid</sub>: β = .17, <italic>t</italic> = 4.87), but instead of finding a positive relationship with calculative commitment we found a low, but significantly positive, relationship with affective commitment, thus failing to support Hypothesis 1<sub>avoid</sub> or Hypothesis 3<sub>avoid</sub>. The analysis supports all resistance to change hypotheses, on the other hand. It is positively related to normative and calculative commitments (Hypothesis 2<sub>resis</sub>: β = .11, <italic>t</italic> = 2.80; Hypothesis 3<sub>resis</sub>: β = .08, <italic>t</italic> = 2.08, respectively) but not related to affective commitment (Hypothesis 1<sub>resis</sub>: β = .04, <italic>t</italic> = 1.10).</p>
<p>While affective commitment relates positively to PWOM as expected and is not associated with silent endurance, its effect on NWOM was not supported by the analysis (Hypothesis 4<sub>aff</sub>: β = .19, <italic>t</italic> = 4.09; Hypothesis 5<sub>aff</sub>: β = −.04, <italic>t</italic> = −.93; Hypothesis 6<sub>aff</sub>: β = −.01, t = −.11, respectively). As expected, normative commitment did not relate to PWOM (Hypotheis 4<sub>norm</sub>: β = −.03, <italic>t</italic> = −.55), but it did negatively influence NWOM and did not influence silent endurance, in contradiction to the hypotheses (Hypothesis 5<sub>norm</sub>: β = −.12, <italic>t</italic> = −2.04; Hypothesis 6<sub>norm</sub>: β = .02, <italic>t</italic> =.26, respectively). In support of all three calculative commitment hypotheses, it related negatively to PWOM and positively to NWOM and silent endurance (Hypothesis 4<sub>cal</sub>: β = −.11, <italic>t</italic> = −2.01; Hypothesis 5<sub>cal</sub>: β = .22, <italic>t</italic> = −3.44; Hypothesis 6<sub>cal</sub>: β =.46, <italic>t</italic> = −8.87, respectively). Affective commitment predictably influences normative commitment, while normative influences calculative, as expected (Hypothesis 7: β = .38, <italic>t</italic> = 6.88; Hypothesis 8: β = .53, <italic>t</italic> = 12.02, respectively). Finally, silent endurance influences PWOM negatively and NWOM positively, as expected (Hypothesis 9: β = −.21, <italic>t</italic> = −4.53; Hypothesis 10: β = .48, <italic>t</italic> = 9.53, respectively).</p>

<title>Model Comparison</title>
<p>It is important in using structural equation modeling to compare rival models (Bollen and Long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670512440835">1992</xref>). Our conceptual model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512440835">Figure 1</xref> indicates that our antecedent variables go through commitment to influence voice. As noted in the results section, we added five direct paths from reasons to voice elements to improve the fit of the model. However, this revised model still suggests that commitment mediates many of the effects between reasons and voice. We compare this model against a direct effects model where all reasons and the three commitment components directly influence voice. The paths between the commitment variables (affective to normative; normative to calculative) remained and the paths between our voice elements remained (silent to PWOM; silent to NWOM) in this direct effects model. The fit of the direct effects model is: χ<sup>2</sup> = 347.86; <italic>df</italic> = 13; <italic>p</italic> &lt;.01, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 26.76, CFI = .88, akaike information criteria (ACI) = 477.86, NFI = .88, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .12, root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = .19. We compare this new model against our hypothesized model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1094670512440835">Table 5</xref>. Our model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1094670512440835">Table 5</xref> is clearly superior based on the chi-square estimate (47.93 vs. 347.86); chi-square/<italic>df</italic> ratio (3.68 vs. 26.76), AIC (177.94 vs. 477.86) and all fit measures (e.g., NFI: .98 vs. .88; RMSEA: .06 vs. .19).</p>

<title>Discussion and Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Based on both qualitative and quantitative research, the current research addresses important staying reasons as antecedents to the three commitment components, as well as the commitment components' effects on three important elements of voice. This is the first fully comprehensive effort in the literature to link this full set of variables together and the explained variance of the commitment and voice variables is reasonable, ranging from .36 to .56. Additionally, although we assess all linkages, we are most interested in those relationships not yet tested nor clearly established (i.e., those highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512440835">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1094670512440835">2</xref>), thereby contributing to some important gaps in our knowledge about these relationships. While the analysis does not support all links, a number of important and understudied relationships find support.</p>
<sec id="section25-1094670512440835">
<title>Staying Reasons→Commitment Findings</title>
<p>We first linked staying reasons to the three commitment components. We predicted 18 relationships, with 12 of these supported by our analyses (with 7 of these supported relationships previously untested or unclear). Beyond the expected link of relational benefits to affective commitment, we also found strong support for a less studied link—the negative relationship between relational benefits and calculative commitment. This finding suggests the importance of relational benefits on two of the three commitments. The negative relationship between relational benefits and calculative commitment suggests that relational benefits reduce a consumer’s feelings of being a hostage in a relationship and indicates how differently the commitments operate. On the other hand, we wondered whether the lack of relationship between relational benefits and normative commitment was due to our combining the benefits together and wondered specifically whether social benefits positively relate to normative commitment if examined alone. However, this was not the case (social benefit: β = .06, <italic>t</italic> = 1.31), suggesting that combining benefits did not obfuscate our findings.</p>
<p>With regard to subjective norms, our results show that when customers perceive that important others think they should stay, they often want to stay and become personally committed (affective commitment). They also feel that they should stay (normative commitment). This influence may be due to an internalization of the idea or identifying with the influencing party. Our qualitative results contain many examples of individuals who said they stay with a service provider because their friends or family use the provider, recommended the provider, or encouraged them to stay. Interestingly, the subjective norms to affective commitment link has received little attention in the literature, while the lack of effect of subjective norms on calculative commitment suggests that their effects work through a consumer’s affective and normative commitment, rather than directly on calculative commitment.</p>
<p>With regard to sunk costs, our analysis supports their expected effect on calculative commitment, but additionally they also positively affect affective commitment, as suspected. This effect could be due to an escalation of commitment. On the other hand, sunk costs do not directly affect normative commitment but seem to operate through the other types of commitment. The importance of sunk costs to affective commitment is intriguing since they have primarily been associated with calculative commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670512440835">Gwinner, Gremler, and Bitner (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512440835">Colgate et al. (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512440835">Paul et al. (2009</xref>) identify the importance of history in staying, which is close to the idea of sunk costs. However, this idea drops out in the quantitative phase of Gwinner, Gremler, and Bitner’s study and does not appear in Colgate’s final staying factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512440835">Paul et al. (2009)</xref> relate history to benefits and higher level motivational values but not to commitment.</p>
<p>With both relational benefits and sunk costs drawing support from Blau’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512440835">1964</xref>) social exchange theory and its underlying idea of reciprocity, this research reinforces the importance of this theory in this domain. Individuals feel indebted to service providers who have given to them or who have gone out of the way for them in the past and/or to whom the customers have expended (invested) much effort and time in the past. This phenomenon also suggests the power of gratitude addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512440835">Palmatier et al. 2009</xref>.</p>
<p>In regard to procedural switching costs, the analysis supports their expected effects on calculative commitment, as well as on normative commitment, which was untested. We argue that this latter effect may be due to the consumer’s rationalization and escalation of commitment to the party involved. We were expecting a null relationship between procedural switching costs and affective commitment, but a slightly (but significant) negative relationship between the two was obtained, suggesting that these perceived costs (which cause a consumer to feel locked into a company) can reduce positive affect toward the company.</p>
<p>Given that no previous study has examined the personality variables studied here relative to the commitments, this area is a virgin territory, and four of our six hypotheses find support. Both avoidance of conflict and resistance to change positively relate to normative commitment, suggesting the strong effect of personality on commitment due to social pressure or obligation. Oddly, however, the relationship between avoidance and affective commitment was not neutral, but slightly positive (perhaps also due an escalation of commitment and rationalization), while the expected effect of avoidance on calculative commitment did not materialize. The analysis supports all of the resistance to change hypotheses, including the previously untested relationship of resistance to change tending to lock the consumer in (i.e., positively associated with calculative commitment). Thus, the findings suggest a weak but relevant impact of personality variables on commitment. Additionally, the personality variables have some direct positive effects on silent endurance, which we did not initially model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1094670512440835">Table 5</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1094670512440835">
<title>Commitment and Voice Findings</title>
<p>The analysis generally supports the commitment components and voice elements hypotheses, with 10 of 13 hypotheses supported (with four supported hypotheses previously untested or receiving minimal support in the past). While the analyses support the expected effects of affective commitment and calculative commitment on PWOM, we had expected normative commitment to affect silent endurance and NWOM positively, but instead it negatively affected NWOM and did not affect silent endurance. This suggests that higher normative commitment reduces WOM to others, while having no influence on silent endurance. Given a positive link between subjective norms and silent endurance in the final model, subjective norms seems to capture the impact of other’s influence on not voicing better than normative commitment does.</p>
<p>Further, the findings relative to calculative commitment are consistent with expectations and past findings, although past findings are few. These findings show the strength of the negative influence of calculative commitment on voice, while normative commitment has minimal direct effects and affective commitment only affects PWOM. However, normative commitment still has some significant total effects on voice (normative → PWOM: β = −.141, <italic>t</italic> = 3.36; normative → silent: β = .259, <italic>t</italic> = 4.98; normative → NWOM: β = .120, <italic>t</italic> = 3.08). These findings interestingly imply a negative impact of normative commitment on voice.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful (and previously unexplored) findings here are the strong relationships between silent endurance and PWOM and NWOM. The relationship between silence and NWOM has only been hinted at in the past conceptually (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512440835">Hirschman 1970</xref>) and in one empirical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512440835">Jones et al. 2007</xref>). Thus, consumers who feel they cannot complain to their service providers express their unhappiness to others and do not say positive things about the firm.</p>
<p>Finally, the interconnections between commitments find support here, with affective commitment influencing normative commitment, which influences calculative commitment. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670512440835">Meyer and Parfyonova (2010)</xref> recently suggested that normative commitment has two faces. Under its positive face, affective and normative commitments are strongly associated; while under its negative face, it is more strongly associated with calculative commitment. This idea may explain why our analysis did not support several hypotheses relative to normative commitment, suggesting the need to understand normative commitment’s connection to other commitments better.</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>Discretionary behaviors, such as voice, are strongly associated with an individual’s commitment to a firm. However, clearly, different forms of commitment affect voice differently. Firms should do everything possible to avoid silent endurance in their customers. This silence produces active WOM to others, much of which is not positive. Thus, firms need to make communicating with them easy and painless for their customers. Customers should feel they can give honest, anonymous feedback to the firm, and employees need training in how to encourage customers to “open up.” Suggestion boxes, e-mails, or blogs should be encouraged.</p>
<p>Further, firms need to understand their customers. Customers who stay because they do not want a conflict or do not want to change are of particular concern. Firms need creative solutions—such as offering individuals opportunities to switch to another person in the operation that they may like better, without having to confront their former service provider. These customers could be encouraged to work with multiple employees within the same firm, to avoid that lock in feeling with a particular service employee.</p>
<p>Additionally, given the strong negative relationship between relational benefits and calculative commitment, silent endurance, and less PWOM, firms should emphasize and measure relational benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670512440835">Burnham, Frels, and Mahajan (2003</xref>, p. 109) state “firms appear to be stuck in a ‘satisfaction trap,’ a myopic belief that customer satisfaction and service quality are the only tools for managing customer retention.” Thus, a clear alternative candidate is relational benefits.</p>
<p>With subjective norms, firms can emphasize the importance of the opinions of others and who is best and most trustworthy at providing those opinions than friends and family. Also, firms can focus on social networks or community clubs as ways to establish personal connections. However, firms should do so cautiously, given that customers should not feel both obligated and unhappy (i.e., the high normative commitment–calculative commitment condition). Also, the positive link noted between subjective norms and silent endurance suggests that customers may be less willing to complain to service providers that they are staying with due to social pressure. Thus, firms need to ensure that these individuals be able to anonymously complain or voice their concerns.</p>
<p>While sunk costs have some impact on calculative commitment, they also strongly influence affective commitment. Thus, firms may want to emphasize the importance of the customer’s past history with the firm. However, this should be done cautiously, given that the total net effect of sunk costs on silent endurance is positive (β = .091, <italic>t</italic> = 2.94), suggesting that past investments or history may cause a customer to be less willing to voice concerns and suggestions for improvement to the firm.</p>
<p>Finally, customers need to feel that they are not locked in (high calculative commitment)—and that they can move, either to a different firm or different employee in the same firm because of calculative commitment’s negative effects on voice. Over time, their frustration can turn negative (beyond silent endurance), which can take many forms, from exiting the firm to retaliating against it.</p>
<p>Thus, our research clearly shows that different forms of commitment have different effects on voice outcomes. Firms wishing to build loyal customer advocates need to recognize that calculative commitment may have short-term beneficial effects but can be detrimental in the long term, given its potential harm on positive customer relations (less PWOM, more NWOM, and more silent endurance). Further, feelings of being unable to “voice” to the service provider may chip away at the relationship with the firm, with these impressions passed on to others, as well.</p>

<sec id="section28-1094670512440835">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Although this study provides new insights into the factors (both positive and negative) that keep customers in service relationships, there are limitations to consider. For example, although the sample exhibited broad representation in a number of demographic categories, it is not a random sample. Therefore, future research should investigate the variables studied here across other populations. Additionally, although real behavioral data would be difficult to obtain in regard to these variables, there is always a concern with using self-report data only.</p>
<p>Further, while individuals talked about a wide range of contexts, contextual effects are always a concern. Although we found no contextual findings, generalizability is always a concern, especially noting that other studies have found some contextual effects. Another concern is our initial screening question, which focused on individuals in obligation-oriented relationships. Future research should expand on the type of relationships solicited from respondents. Also, many routes to commitment and their interrelationships should be explored. Future studies should also specify the target of the commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512440835">Jones, Taylor, and Bansal 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Future studies should break relational benefits out to ascertain their unique effects. Further, the adapted items used for the special treatment scale were not true to the original scale items, which addressed a comparison between service providers, which may have affected the results. Additionally, the exploration of normative commitment vis-à-vis other commitments offers great opportunities, as it is the most misunderstood commitment type. Studying commitment profiles should prove useful in understanding the two faces of normative commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670512440835">Meyer and Parfyonova 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, in conclusion, there are many opportunities for research in this area. Besides the above-mentioned research topics, the following areas are ripe for study: the effects of interactions between staying reasons on commitment; staying reason profiles of committed consumers (based on different commitment profiles as well); the emotions of consumers in committed relationships that most likely drive commitment and voice at a deeper psychological level; the effects of environmental, partner, interaction factors on staying reasons and commitment (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512440835">Bendapudi and Berry 1997</xref>); the effects of the personality variables studied here or other personality variables on voice, especially on silent endurance (given that several links were revealed in the revised model); and finally, the breaking point of consumers in regard to when they decide to exit a relationship (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512440835">Coulter and Ligas 2000</xref>). Additionally, meta-analyses of these topics would be useful.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, in this article we examine the staying reason antecedents of commitment components, developed from our qualitative interviews, as well as several voice elements here. While this research domain has received considerable attention in the past, we provide and study a comprehensive framework of these relationships, focusing attention on some less tested links. We encourage others to continue to pursue this research domain.</p>

<p>The first round of pre-esting used an online survey (Survey Monkey). Students in several upper level undergraduate marketing classes at two southeastern universities earned extra credit by recruiting nonstudent participants for the survey. Eight hundred and ninety respondents participated in the pretest survey. Items were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to reduce the item pool. In a second round of pretesting, formatting of the survey on the Zoomerang site, time to take the survey, and assessment of problems with the survey were addressed. Twenty marketing faculty and doctoral students completed the survey online and provided feedback for corrections, resulting in the final instrument.</p>

<p>We compared our results to a model where we did not control for the four covariates listed earlier. Three small changes occurred when we did not include these covariates. In all three cases relationships that were close to .05 significance levels failed to reach the .05 level (proc. switching costs → affective; calculative → PWOM) or vice versa (resistance to change → affective). These changes were very small, thus mitigating concerns as to the potential influence of these covariates or other covariates not in our model. We also tested to see whether there were industry differences in this model, given some past results suggesting differences (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512440835">1990</xref>). For this test, we used the industry classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512440835">Lovelock (1983)</xref>, noted above as a moderator. The unconstrained model (all industries allowed to vary) has a χ<sup>2</sup> of 83.04, 39 <italic>df</italic> The constrained group has a χ<sup>2</sup> of 155.55, 113 <italic>df</italic>. The difference in χ<sup>2</sup> (72.51 with 74 <italic>df</italic>) is not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .527), indicating that the unconstrained model does not fit our data better than the constrained model, hence the structural paths across the industries are equivalent.</p>
