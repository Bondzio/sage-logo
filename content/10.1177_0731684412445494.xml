<abstract>
<p>This paper presents numerical modeling of the flexural behaviour of sandwich panels composed of [0/90] woven glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and polyurethane foam core, including various patterns of glass fibre reinforced polymer ribs, as well as cores of different densities. A robust finite element model has been developed. It accounts for material nonlinearities; most pronounced in soft cores and [0/90] glass fibre reinforced polymer ribs in shear, as well as geometric nonlinearities arising in panels without ribs, in the form of a reduction in panel thickness and excessive shear deformation. The model captures both material failures and stability failure, essentially skin wrinkling in compression. The model is successfully validated using a large experimental database and predicts well full flexural responses. It is shown that ribs allow compression skin to reach its full material strength. Panels without ribs fail by skin wrinkling under concentrated loads, while those under distributed loads fail either by excessive shear deformation or diagonal fracture of the core, depending on core density. Failure of glass fibre reinforced polymer tension skin never occurred in this study. For panels without ribs, the three-dimensional finite element model agrees closely with a simplified two-dimensional model. A parametric study addressing longitudinal rib spacing showed that flexural strength increases as rib spacing reduces, until it stabilizes at a rib spacing-to-panel thickness ratio of 2.93.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412445494" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sandwich panels are commonly used in aerospace, automotive and transportation industries, but are not as common in structural engineering applications. They have a great potential to be used for light-weight decking, roofing, and insulated walls. Typically, sandwich panels are composed of two skins, with a low-density core in between. The skins may be made from metallic or composite materials, while the cores may take various forms such as honeycomb, Z-or I-shaped ribs, and solid polymeric cores. The system offers structural efficiency at low dead weight.</p>
<p>Several modelling techniques of sandwich panels have been developed. Demiray et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412445494">1</xref></sup> developed a finite plate element for panels with a compressible core. The study highlighted the local wrinkling instability of the skin arising from core compressibility. Ha<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412445494">2</xref></sup> summarized a range of possibilities of finite element (FE) analyses of sandwich panels, varying from a simple element with only three degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node to a complex layered element. Noor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412445494">3</xref></sup> reviewed the recent developments in computational models and sensitivity of the panel response to variations in material and geometric parameters. Lok and Cheng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412445494">4</xref></sup> established the elastic stiffness properties and behaviour of truss-core panel, where the system was transformed into an equivalent orthotropic two-dimensional (2D) thick plate, and as such, the study did not address buckling and local bending of the skins and core webs. Chang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412445494">5</xref></sup> studied the bending behaviour of corrugated-core sandwich plates with various boundary conditions. Some small-scale tests were also carried out on sandwich panels to validate numerical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412445494">6</xref></sup> Heimbs et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412445494">7</xref></sup> tested sandwich structures with textile-reinforced composite foldcores under compression, shear, and impact loads. The study showed that the high stiffness of the foldcores lead to a localised impact damage. Baranger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412445494">8</xref></sup> studied the behaviour of aramid folded cores under crushing loads. The study showed that the geometrical effects could affect the crushing load for such panels.</p>
<p>In this study, rigorous FE models are developed for medium- and large-scale sandwich panels using the ANSYS program. The panels comprise glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins and polyurethane foam cores. Panels with and without GFRP ribs of different configurations connecting the two skins are studied. For panels without ribs, polyurethane cores of different densities are studied. The FE models account for both the material and geometric nonlinearities. Geometric nonlinearities arise from the excessive softness of the polyurethane core, which leads to localized compressibility and change in thickness as well as excessive shear deformations. The effects of loading pattern on deformation and failure modes are also studied. The model captures both stability failure of skin wrinkling as well as strength failure, typically in the core by shear or by compression skin crushing. The model was successfully validated using the results of a comprehensive experimental program.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412445494"><title>Summary of the experimental programs</title>
<p>Two experimental programs were carried out. In the first program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445494">9</xref></sup> sandwich panels without ribs were tested in flexure using different loading configurations. The panels consisted of two types of closed-cell polyurethane foam core, namely soft (low-density) and hard (high-density) polyurethane foam, sandwiched between two GFRP skins. The skin E-glass weave comprised longitudinal, transverse, and through-thickness layers of roving, with fiber weight fractions of 48.8%, 50.3%, and 0.9%, in the three directions, respectively. It can be seen that the transverse direction has about 3% higher weight of fibres.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412445494">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the test matrix and parameters tested in that study, including loading type, core density, and failure modes. Specimens P1 to P6 were fabricated using the 32 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density foam while specimens P7 to P10 were fabricated using the 64 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density foam. Specimens P1 and P2 were tested in three-point and four-point bending, respectively, while all other specimens were tested under uniformly distributed load simulated by eight loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445494">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Specimens (P3 to P5) and (P7 to P9) were identical in each group, to confirm repeatability of performance and reproducibility of test results. All the panels were 78 mm thick, including two 1.6 mm thick skins, and had a span of 1400 mm with their full breadth (300 mm) supported. Also, loads were applied across the full width. The line loads were applied using 50-mm wide rigid steel strips resting on Teflon thin plates, in order to protect the panel from stress concentration. Strain gauges were used to monitor the longitudinal strains at mid-span, on the upper skin (compression) and on the lower skin (tension). Mid-span deflection was monitored using linear potentiometers.

<p>In the second program,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412445494">10</xref></sup> sandwich panels (S1 to S6) with different rib configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445494">Figure 1(b)</xref>) were tested. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412445494">Table 2</xref> presents a summary of the test matrix. Panels S1 to S3 were 2437 × 635 × 78 mm while S4 to S6 were 2537 × 685 × 78 mm. All panels were 78 mm thick, including a closed-cell polyurethane foam core of a 32 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density, along with two 1.6 mm thick GFRP skins. Panel S1 did not include any ribs. Panels S2 and S3 included internal longitudinal ribs at mid-width and S3 also included additional internal transverse rib at mid-length. Panel S4 included only exterior ribs at all four sides. Panels S5 and S6 also included exterior ribs at all four sides. Additionally, they both included internal longitudinal ribs at mid-width while S6 also included additional internal transverse rib at mid-length. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445494">Figure 1(b)</xref>, the internal ribs consisted of two back-to-back C-shaped woven fabric of the same material of the skins (detail ‘B’), while the exterior (edge) ribs consisted of one C-shaped woven fabric (detail ‘C’). As such, the total GFRP skin thickness at locations of the flanges of the ribs was doubled, to 3.2 mm. The flange width of each of the C-shaped ribs was 75 mm. The total web thickness of one internal rib was 3.2 mm and for an exterior rib was 1.6 mm. All panels were tested at a span of 2400 mm under four discrete line loads, each spread over a 286 mm width using a system of steel plates and rubber pads (see arrangement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445494">Figure 3(d)</xref>).

<p>In this study, two models were developed, namely a 2D and a 3D models. The 2D model is a rather simple approach, taking advantage of the plane stress condition of sandwich panels without any ribs in one-way bending. It used beam elements to model the top and bottom skins and plane stress elements to model the polyurethane foam core. The 3D model used orthotropic shell elements for the skins and continuum solid elements for the core. Solid elements were not used for the skins because they are quite thin, 1.6 mm compared to the 75 mm thick core. As such, solid elements for skins would have caused problems with the elements aspect ratio and would have required an extremely refined mesh, which would have not been feasible.</p>
<p>Since the plane stress elements in the 2D model, and the solid elements in the 3D model, have translational degrees of freedom (TDOFs) only, while their corresponding skin beam elements and shell elements, respectively, have additional rotational degrees of freedom (RDOFs), the constraint DOFs between each corresponding node for both the 2-D and 3-D models were defined only for these TDOFs. However, when the independent node of the skin element undergoes an angular displacement, the dependent node of the core element has an equivalent translational displacement, allowing for the deformation compatibility between the skins and the core elements. The displacement of the independent node of the skin element is calculated from the element shape functions which take into account the RDOFs for that element. Therefore, the corresponding nodes at the interconnecting line (in the case of 2D model) or surface (in the case of 3D model) will have the same deflection values without violating the defined DOFs at those nodes.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412445494"><title>The 2D model</title>
<p>The 2D model is used only for panels without ribs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445494">9</xref></sup> Taking advantage of symmetry, only one-half of the full panel was analyzed, using appropriate boundary conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the geometry of the sandwich panels tested by Sharaf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445494">9</xref></sup> and the dimensions used in the model. The model was taken 3 mm in breadth (i.e. 1% of the total 300 mm breadth of the specimen). The GFRP skins were modeled using 2-D beam element BEAM23 with a cubic displacement function. BEAM23 is a uniaxial element with tension, compression, and bending capabilities. The element has three DOFs at each node, namely translations in the nodal x and y directions and rotation about the nodal z-axis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the geometry, node locations, and the coordinate system for this element. The element is defined by two nodes, the cross-sectional area, the moment of inertia, the thickness (skin thickness), and the material properties.

<p>The polyurethane foam core was modeled using plane stress element PLANE82 with quadratic displacement function and a capability of thickness effect. The six-node triangular element is defined by three corner nodes and three mid-side nodes. Each node has two DOFs, namely translations in the nodal x and y directions. The thickness effect is taken into consideration to simulate the accurate moment of inertia as well as the overall bending stiffness of the sandwich panel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the geometry, node locations, and coordinate system for this element.</p>
<p>The interface between the GFRP skins and polyurethane foam core was considered in full contact state. In all the panels tested in the studies by Sharaf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445494">9</xref></sup> and Fam and Sharaf,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412445494">10</xref></sup> it was observed that no relative slip occurred between the skin and adjacent part of the core, essentially a full adhesion. The corresponding nodes were then coupled together for the TDOFs. Both, the material nonlinearity for the GFRP and the polyurethane foam as well as geometric nonlinearity were taken into consideration. The applied loads were modeled as line loads to simulate the exact loading condition in the experimental study. The mesh was refined at the interface between the skins and the core to obtain an accurate deformed profile of the skins as well as to obtain a converged solution.</p>
<p>In order to determine the appropriate mesh density, a mesh refinement process and a convergence study was conducted. Three numerical simulations of different mesh densities, namely coarse, intermediate, and fine, were first carried out on the sandwich panel. The total numbers of elements were 1171 elements for the coarse mesh, 3278 elements for the intermediate mesh, and 8216 elements for the fine mesh. The predicted maximum load carrying capacities were almost identical for the intermediate and fine meshes; however, the computer run-time dramatically increases with refining the mesh size. As such, to obtain a smooth deformed profile for the sandwich panel, the intermediate mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445494">Figure 3(a)</xref>) was deemed sufficient and was used in subsequent 2D analyses.

A 3D shell element SHELL99 was used to model the GFRP skins. The element is defined by eight nodes and has both bending and membrane capabilities. It has six DOFs at each node, namely translations in the nodal x, y, and z directions, and rotations about the nodal x, y, and z-axes. The element has a quadratic displacement function. The geometry, node locations, and the coordinate system for this element are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(b)</xref>. A 3D SOLID186 element was used to model the polyurethane foam core and the loading steel plates. The element is defined by twenty nodes having three DOFs at each node, namely translations in the nodal x, y, and z directions. Also, it has a quadratic displacement function. The geometry, node locations, and the coordinate system for this element are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(b)</xref>.</p>
<p>Full contact behaviour is assumed between the GFRP skins and the polyurethane foam core, as indicated earlier. Full coupling constraints were applied between the corresponding nodes at both the GFRP skin and the polyurethane foam core for the TDOFs. The nonlinear material behaviour for both GFRP and polyurethane foam was taken into account. Also, the geometric nonlinearity due to the softness of the polyurethane foam core was considered. The applied load was in the form of line loads acting on the steel plates as a simulation of the experimental conditions.</p>
<p>A surface-to-surface contact pair CONTA174 and TARGE170 was used to simulate the contact between the loading steel plates and the top skin and also between the bottom skin and the support plates. CONTA174 is used to represent contact and sliding between 3D ‘target’ surfaces (TARGE170) and a deformable surface, defined by this element. The element is applicable to 3D structural analyses. This element is located on the surfaces of 3D solid or shell elements that have mid-side nodes. The element has eight nodes as the underlying element, SHELL99 or SOLID186. It has the same geometric characteristics as the solid or shell element face with which it is connected. Contact occurs when the element surface penetrates one of the target segment elements (TARGE170) on a specified target surface. The geometry and node locations for both elements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445494">Figure 2(b)</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to determine the appropriate mesh density, a mesh refinement process and a convergence study was conducted, similar to the 2D model.

The figure shows that variations in ultimate load in general are very small and that the intermediate and fine meshes produce very close results. However, the computer run-time dramatically increases with refining the mesh size. Therefore, to obtain a smooth deformed profile for the sandwich panel, the intermediate mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445494">Figure 3(c)</xref>) was deemed sufficient and was used in all subsequent analyses of the panels tested by Sharaf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445494">9</xref></sup></p></sec>

<p>For the panels tested by Fam and Sharaf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412445494">10</xref></sup> with different rib configurations, the FE model was the same as described in the previous section, except for the addition of the GFRP ribs. The ribs were modelled using SHELL99 element as the skins. Full contact was assumed between the rib and the adjacent core. The corresponding nodes were coupled for the TDOFs. Since the loading areas on the top panel skin extended over a wide region, loading was applied directly to the top skin in the form of a uniform pressure within the effective foot print of the rubber strips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445494">Figure 3(d)</xref>).

<p>A mesh refinement process and a convergence study were conducted in order to determine the appropriate mesh density. The same technique used for the previous 3D model was used. Three preliminary numerical simulations of different mesh densities, namely coarse, intermediate, and fine were conducted. The three models were carried out on the control sandwich panel (S1). The total number of elements was 12,154 elements for the coarse mesh, 36,834 for the intermediate mesh, and 77,170 for the fine mesh. The predicted maximum load-carrying capacity was very close for the intermediate and fine meshes; therefore, it was decided to use the intermediate mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445494">Figure 3(d)</xref>) in all the analyses that followed.</p></sec></sec>

<p>The constituent materials have a nonlinear behaviour, especially the polyurethane foam. As such, it was important to take material nonlinearity into account in the FE model.

<sec id="sec9-0731684412445494"><title>Failure criteria</title>
<p>Two types of failure were considered, namely a stability failure based on skin wrinkling (local bucking, inward or outward) and a material failure, such as foam core shear failure, compression skin crushing, or tension skin rupture. Stability failure was detected when the solution fails to converge, suggesting very large and sudden displacement caused by local buckling (wrinkling) or skin delamination and leads to a highly distorted model that causes the numerical run to terminate. Material failure was detected when the ultimate strain or stress of any of the two materials used is reached in tension, compression, or in shear. For GFRP, this is typically detected by the Tsai-Wu failure index reaching unity.</p></sec></sec>

It can be seen that the 2D and 3D FE models gave very close results, both in reasonable agreement with test results. For panels P3 to P9, because the high complexity of the test setup for such panels and the load distribution mechanisms, the authors believe that the applied load may have not been perfectly symmetric and uniform on the top skin. The load-strain responses of the panels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412445494">Figure 5(b)</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445494">Figure 6</xref> shows the deformed shapes of the panels under different load schemes. Panels P1 and P2, under three-point and four-point bending, respectively, failed experimentally and numerically by compression skin inwards wrinkling under the concentrated loads. This was due to a localized foam core compression failure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445494">Figure 6(a)</xref> and (b). The localized wrinkling in panel P1 at mid-span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445494">Figure 6(a)</xref>) resulted in a disturbed region with excessive increase in the compression strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412445494">Figure 5(b)</xref>). The FE models, although predicted very well the ultimate load and the failure mode of panel P1, underestimated the localized compressive strain. In panel P2, however, mid-span strains were predicted reasonably well. This is because the disturbed region from the localized effect of wrinkling under the load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445494">Figure 6(b)</xref>) was away from mid-span location. Panels P3 to P5 with soft core and uniform loads failed by excessive shear deformation of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412445494">Figure 7(a)</xref>), associated with excessive deflection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412445494">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445494">6(c)</xref>).

<p>Panel S1 failed experimentally by outward wrinkling of the top skin between the first and the second loading points, instead of failing at mid-span as predicated by the FE model, and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412445494">Figure 9(a)</xref>. Perhaps this could be due to some dimensional imperfections in the experiment, slightly compromising symmetry. The predicted failure by the 3D model was also due to outward wrinkling of the top skin, similar to the experiment, indicated by solution divergence due to instability and excessive top skin deformation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412445494">Figure 9(a)</xref> shows the Tsai-Wu failure criteria index value.

<p>The failure mode for panel S2 with one longitudinal rib at mid-width is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412445494">Figure 9(b)</xref>. In the experiment, the panel failed primarily by top skin crushing at the edge of the flange of the C-shaped rib near the panel centre line and also by a secondary outward wrinkling of the top skin at the panel edge. The predicted primary failure mode was similar to the experimental one for top skin crushing at the flange edge of the rib. This was indicated by solution divergence due to GFRP material failure, as the Tsai-Wu failure criteria index reach unity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412445494">Figure 9(b)</xref>). With regard to the secondary failure mode of skin wrinkling, the model showed the tendency for an inward wrinkling near the panel edge. This is evident by the numerical strain behaviour showing sudden increase in the compressive strains near the maximum load (curves ‘b’ and ‘c’ on the compression side, for panel S2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412445494">Figure 8(b)</xref>).</p>

The panel failed experimentally by top skin crushing at the transverse rib edge, near the panel mid-span.

<p>Panel S4 with an exterior rib (diaphragm) failed by outward wrinkling and splitting at the skin-rib joint. Failure was due to the lack of sufficient flange width of the edge rib which triggered the skin to separate from the exterior rib.

<p>The experimental study by Fam and Sharaf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412445494">10</xref></sup> included limited number of rib configurations and did not address the effect of spacing of longitudinal ribs on the ultimate strength of the panel. As such, the 3D FE model, after being validated, was used in a parametric study to investigate further longitudinal rib spacing and also to establish the optimal spacing. The dimensions, skin thickness and mechanical properties of the panels used in the parametric study were the same as the tested panels reported by Fam and Sharaf,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412445494">10</xref></sup> namely 2500 × 685 × 78 mm. In addition to the configurations of panels S1, S2, S4, and S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445494">Figure 1(b)</xref>), two configurations, S-new1 and S-new2, were added. S-new1 is a panel similar to S5 but with two longitudinal inner ribs running at one-third points of panel width, instead of the single mid-width rib, in addition to the two longitudinal edge ribs. S-new2 is similar to S-new1 but with three longitudinal inner ribs running every quarter width point, in additional to the edge ribs. All panels were loaded in the same manner as the experimental specimens. The internal and edge ribs were modeled as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445494">Figure 1(b)</xref>, basically a C-shape for the exterior rib and two back-to-back C-shapes for the interior rib. Since panels S1 and S2 of the experimental study were slightly smaller in width (635 mm) than S4 and S5 (685 mm), modeling of S1 and S2 configurations was repeated in this parametric study, assuming a 685 mm width, for consistency, to enable comparison with the other configurations.</p>
<p>The two additional panels studied in the parametric study failed by top skin crushing at mid span, as indicated by Tsai-Wu failure criteria index reaching unity at failure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412445494">Figure 10</xref> shows the variation of the panel strength in terms of the ultimate moment of the panels with ribs, normalized with respect to that of panel S1 without ribs, versus the rib spacing-to-panel thickness (S/t) ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412445494">Figure 10</xref> shows a trend of increase in strength as the number of longitudinal ribs increase, until the strength stabilizes at about 2.2 times that of panel S1 (without ribs). This suggests that an (S/t) ratio of 2.93 is optimal to achieve the maximum strength for panels with this type of rib configurations.

<sec id="sec14-0731684412445494"><title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>In this paper, a numerical investigation into the flexural behaviour of sandwich panels composed of GFRP skins and ribs and polyurethane foam core is presented. Different patterns of ribs and different core densities were studied. A robust FE model, accounting for geometric and material nonlinearities, has been developed. The material nonlinearities were most pronounced in the relatively soft polyurethane core in tension, compression, and shear, and in the GFRP ribs in shear, given their [0/90] cross-ply laminate architecture. The geometric nonlinearities arise from the fact that, in absence of GFRP ribs, the soft polyurethane core could result in significant reduction in the overall panel thickness as well as significant shear deformations. The model also captures both the ‘material strength’ failure mode through a Tsai-Wu failure criteria index for the GFRP or tensile fracture of the core and ‘stability’ failure mode, usually by GFRP skin wrinkling in compression.</p>
<p>The model was successfully validated using a large database of experimental results and predicted well the full flexural responses and failure modes. For panels without ribs tested in one-way bending, both the 2D and 3D FE models provided very close predictions, with insignificant differences, for panels with both low-density and high-density polyurethane cores.</p>
<p>The ribs allow the compression skin to reach its full material compressive strength. Panels without ribs under concentrated loads generally failed by skin wrinkling, while those under relatively distributed load fail by excessive shear deformation in the case of low-density foam core or diagonal fracture in the case of high-density core. Failure of the GFRP tension skin seems very unlikely in sandwich panels with or without ribs.</p>
<p>A parametric study into the effect of longitudinal GFRP rib spacing showed that flexural strength increases as the rib spacing reduces, until it stabilizes at a rib spacing-to-panel thickness ratio of 2.93. In this case, the maximum achievable flexural strength was 2.2 times that of a panel without any ribs.</p></sec>
