<abstract>
<p>The objective of this article is to understand the extent to which location in a geographic cluster can explain international alliance formation. Geographic clusters are characterized by several dimensions: agglomeration economies, institutional forces and a manager’s mental models create the environment within the cluster. Therefore, to develop the research propositions, which were tested on a sample of US biotechnology start-ups, the study specifically analysed cluster size and firm competitive behaviour within the cluster to explain the propensity of a start-up to engage in new international alliances. It also examined the potential moderating effect of cluster evolution. Results show that merely being located in a geographic cluster in itself does not increase the probability of forming a new international alliance. Within clusters, internationalization of start-ups through alliance formation results mainly from mimetic behaviour.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small biotechnology companies tend to cluster in geographic areas to benefit from reciprocal technology spillovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611402565">Almeida and Kogut, 1999</xref>), information flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611402565">Porter, 1990</xref>), capital venturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611402565">Powell et al. 2002</xref>) and collaboration opportunities with institutes and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611402565">Audretsch and Feldman, 1996</xref>) or other firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611402565">Scott, 1989</xref>). Cluster development has been shown to be an important factor in the growth of local industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611402565">Porter, 1990</xref>) and in the success of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, within a geographic cluster, knowledge may become increasingly limited, and one way to overcome this lack of knowledge is to pursue international alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>International alliances are formed in complex and uncertain environments that require organizational learning which occurs in several ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>) and can be fostered by the firm’s geographic location. Hence, researchers in international strategy increasingly are investigating the role of regional clusters as features of international industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611402565">Tallman et al., 2004</xref>). Clusters may act as a centripetal force that attracts foreign firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611402565">Coombs et al., 2006</xref>); in addition, clusters may strengthen a firm’s competitive advantage, thereby driving internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611402565">Mariotti and Piscitello, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611402565">Mariotti et al., 2008</xref>). Although several studies have investigated the advantages of clustering in the internationalization process of SMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611402565">Brown and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611402565">Mariotti and Piscitello, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611402565">Mariotti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611402565">McHardy Reid et al., 2005</xref>), few studies have specifically analysed the impact of cluster characteristics on international alliance formation. From this perspective, we aim to contribute to the literature on SME internationalization and the role of geographic location. The objective is to understand to what extent location in a geographic cluster can explain international alliance formation and, more specifically, what characteristics of geographic clusters may promote international alliance formation.</p>
<p>Geographic clusters are characterized by several dimensions. Agglomeration economies, institutional forces and a manager’s mental model create the environment within the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611402565">Mariotti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John (1996)</xref> suggest that this environment is changed over time by these same forces. Therefore, to develop our research propositions, we specifically analysed cluster size and firm competitive behaviour within the cluster to explain the propensity of a start-up to engage in new international alliances. We also examined the potential moderating effect of cluster evolution. In this article, an alliance was considered to be a contractual agreement. We tested our hypotheses using an event history analysis of 173 international alliances formed by 175 start-ups in the US biotechnology sector. Our results reveal mimetic behaviour in international alliance formation within a geographic cluster, complementing recent studies on international alliance formation at the industry level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows: the first section reviews the literature and formulates the hypotheses; the next section presents the empirical analysis; and the section following presents the empirical findings. The final section presents a discussion of the findings, certain limitations and directions for future research.</p>

<title>The key role of international alliances and the cluster effect</title>
<p>International alliances are collaborations formed between a local entity and an overseas counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611402565">Saffu and Mamman, 2000</xref>). Why are international alliances so important? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611402565">Lu and Beamish (2001)</xref> suggest that geographic expansion is one of the most important paths for firm growth. Other studies on alliances have pointed out several benefits, including risk- minimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611402565">Hagedoorn, 1993</xref>) and, more specifically, better access to foreign resources and knowledge as well as network resources such as capital and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611402565">Hanna and Walsh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611402565">Phene et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, traditionally it has been suggested that small firms are at a relative disadvantage to large firms when it comes to any form of internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611402565">Oviatt and McDougall, 1994</xref>). Yet, size is not necessarily a barrier to internationalization, because SMEs can develop and maintain a competitive advantage by possessing scarce, unique and sustainable resources and capabilities, and consequently attempting to grow internationally (Mariotti and Piscittelo, 2004). The local environment and externalities associated with the location of specific resources and capabilities can play a crucial role by helping firms develop their competitive advantage and uniqueness or inimitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611402565">Porter and Rivkin, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611402565">Al-Laham and Souitaris (2008)</xref> found that international alliances are facilitated when firms are embedded in knowledge-intensive regional clusters. The effects of externalities stemming from geographic clustering may favour SME internationalization. Geographic clusters are ‘groups of geographically proximate firms in the same industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611402565">Bell, 2005</xref>: 287). Previous research suggests that firms that are geographically close are likely to behave similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611402565">Burt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611402565">Greve, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611402565">Staber, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the structural and behavioural features of regional clusters might impact upon a firm’s decision to undertake international alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611402565">Mariotti et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, clusters go through growth phases: origination (rapid growth in the number of firms), convergence (slower growth) and reorientation (decline) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John, 1996</xref>). If we control for cluster age and cluster growth, the dynamics of different clusters may differ in terms of international alliance formation.</p>
<sec id="section3-0266242611402565">
<title>Agglomeration economies and international alliance formation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611402565">Marshall (1920)</xref> recognized that firms benefit from not only their own resources, but also many aspects of their geographic location. Geographic industry clustering generates positive externalities, which have the potential to improve the performance of agglomerated firms. Several positive externalities might stem from cluster location: clustered firms benefit from the efficient scale of nearby suppliers, the ability to exploit collective knowledge and network-based effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611402565">Bell, 2005</xref>). For example, by capturing knowledge spillovers, firms often can improve their products or processes at low cost thereby, enhancing performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611402565">Zaheer and George, 2004</xref>) and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611402565">Bell, 2005</xref>). These externalities increase with increasing number of firms in the cluster due to economies of agglomeration.</p>
<p>In larger clusters, firms appear more likely to raise capital through private equity placements, patents (up to a certain cluster size) and entering into alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al., 2006</xref>). Several studies have noted that foreign multinational firms are attracted to regions with industry clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611402565">Birkinshaw and Hood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611402565">Shaver and Flyer, 2000</xref>) due to the available technological resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611402565">Majocchi and Presutti (2009)</xref> showed that a high concentration of firms in similar industrial sectors attract high foreign investment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">Fernhaber et al. (2008)</xref> stress that ‘a venture’s presence in a recognized industry cluster location should make internationalizing operations seem like a more feasible option’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">2008</xref>: 269). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611402565">Coombs et al. (2006)</xref>, foreign firms invest in response to region-specific – as opposed to country-specific – advantages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1a: The probability that a firm <italic>i</italic> will form an international alliance in period <italic>t</italic> increases with the size of the cluster in which it is located.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The proximity of similar firms increases cooperation between firms, resulting in lower average costs. The cooperation model does not necessarily apply to international strategic alliances. At the country level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611402565">Narula and Hagedoorn (1999)</xref> noted that firms from small countries tend to be more highly involved in international investment, and have a greater propensity to engage in international strategic alliances than firms from large countries. This is because local demand is often sufficient to achieve economies of scale in large countries, whereas small-country firms must seek overseas markets to achieve similar economies. In this sense, cluster size may have a negative effect on international alliance formation. Contrary to our previous hypothesis, this argument leads to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1b: The probability that a firm <italic>i</italic> will form an international alliance in period <italic>t</italic> decreases with the size of the cluster in which it is located.</p>

<sec id="section4-0266242611402565">
<title>Mimetic behaviour and international alliance formation</title>
<p>Mimetic behaviours have been observed frequently over short geographic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611402565">Bell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611402565">Burt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611402565">Greve, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611402565">Staber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611402565">Vicente et al., 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611402565">Greve (1998)</xref> found that a market position adoption is likely to be imitated in a geographically proximate market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611402565">Bell (2005)</xref> suggests that the geographic proximity of firms in the cluster enhances direct observation of competitors. By analysing innovation activities, he showed that a mimetic process can emerge in which firms innovate as a function of the degree to which other firms in their cluster innovate.</p>
<p>The concept of mimetism has been employed also to explain strategic behaviour and, more specifically, alliance formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611402565">Garcia-Pont and Norhia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611402565">Pangarkar and Klein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Three types of motives drive firms to adopt mimetic behaviours or to converge on the same decision within clusters. First, according to institutional theory, uncertainty is a powerful force that encourages a pattern of conformity through imitation, known as ‘mimetic isomorphism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611402565">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>). Uncertainty makes the choice of appropriate strategies unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611402565">Haveman, 1993</xref>). It has been largely shown that international alliances add inherent risk and uncertainty due to new and relatively unknown surroundings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611402565">Kogut and Singh, 1988</xref>). Consequently, ‘organizations tend to model themselves after similar organizations in their field that they perceive to be more legitimate or successful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611402565">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>: 152).</p>
<p>Second, accessibility and information exchange is involved. Short geographic distance favours information exchange through social and professional interactions, recruitment from a common professional labour pool and high employee mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611402565">Porter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611402565">Saxenian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611402565">Scott, 1989</xref>). Within a cluster, proximity and interaction mechanisms increase an agent’s capacity to observe decisions made by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611402565">Burt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">Fernhaber et al., 2008</xref>). When uncertainty is strong, the informational effect comes into play and mimetic behaviours can develop, based on the observational learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611402565">Staber, 2010</xref>). Firms within a same cluster tend to know what others in that cluster know: for example, international partners build their reputations through such ties. By enhancing direct observation of competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611402565">Burt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611402565">Pascal and McCall, 1980</xref>), geographic proximity may drive firms to mimic these competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611402565">Staber, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, another motive stems from cognitive theory. According to Pourder and St John, within a same cluster ‘several factors create a propensity for managers and key technical employees to have similar cognitive frameworks or mental maps’ (1996: 1200). For example, because managers within clusters are exposed to the same information sources, they are likely to form similar perceptions of the environment and to make similar strategic choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611402565">Staber, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Imitation provides one explanation for the dynamics of alliance formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611402565">Garcia-Pont and Norhia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>). More firms forming alliances generate a competitive pressure on the remaining firms to follow, leading to a ‘competitive bandwagon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611402565">Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611402565">Pangarkar and Klein, 1998</xref>). Consequently, the probability that a firm will form an international alliance may hinge on the number of firms in the cluster that have previously formed international alliances. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2a: The probability that a firm <italic>i</italic> in a cluster will form an international alliance in period <italic>t</italic> increases with the density of similar-sized firms that have formed international alliances in period <italic>t</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the number of international alliances within the cluster increases, competition for attractive partners and projects might intensify. As Yeniyurt noted, ‘the competition for resources fosters a situation in which density increases have a negative effect on new formations’ (2009: 305). More specifically, location-specific technologies within a cluster may become scarcer, and firms can have more difficulty attracting foreign partners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">Fernhaber et al. (2008)</xref> stressed that ‘with more firms operating from the region, a venture’s access to and consequently, ability to work with, foreign partners may become limited’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">2008</xref>: 270). Consequently, a non-monotonic relationship is expected between the density of firms that have formed international alliances and the formation rate of international alliances. This leads to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2b: The relationship between the density of internationalized firms (firms that have formed international alliances) in a cluster <italic>j</italic> and the likelihood of a firm <italic>i</italic> in a cluster <italic>j</italic> to form an international alliance is curvilinear (an inverted U-shape).</p>

<title>Cluster evolution and international alliance formation</title>
<p>Clusters evolve as they go through life cycles, due to external and internal forces. Several studies have emphasized that diseconomies of agglomeration may result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611402565">Almeida and Kogut, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611402565">Audia and Rider, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611402565">Zheng, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John (1996)</xref> suggest that the strength of economies and agglomeration diseconomies varies with the age of the geographic cluster. They propose that geographic clusters evolve through three evolutionary phases: origination of the cluster and emergence of the ‘hotspot’ identity, convergence of clustered firms and firm reorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John, 1996</xref>). In the early phases, a manager’s mental model of competitors converge. This contributes to a macro-culture, which in turn leads to homogeneity and inertia. Over time, clusters enter into a reorientation phase, during which firms consider alternatives beyond the usual geographic boundaries and recognize the dangers of conformity. Mimetic behaviours are the agent’s rational response to uncertainty in emerging contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611402565">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>) and therefore, are more likely to occur in earlier cluster phases. In an emerging context, it would be more rational to imitate agents than to spend time and money seeking solutions and testing them. These early mimetic behaviours, which also provide the rationale for the firm’s location choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611402565">Vicente et al., 2006</xref>), give way to new, more autonomous behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611402565">Pourder and St John, 1996</xref>). This suggests that cluster age moderates a firm’s mimetic behaviour, making it less salient in older clusters. This leads to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3a: The cluster age of a firm <italic>i</italic> will moderate the effect of the density of internationalized firms in that cluster (the density of firms that have formed international alliances), on the likelihood that firm <italic>i</italic> will form an international alliance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beyond a certain point, the marginal benefits of being located in a cluster decline with increasing growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al. (2006)</xref> showed that cluster size has a positive but declining influence on the rate of discontinuance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611402565">Audia and Rider (2010)</xref> assume that during the cluster reorientation phase, industrial decline may diminish agglomeration economies such as knowledge spillover and labour pooling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611402565">Fernhaber et al. (2008)</xref> showed that a firm’s internationalization is positively related to industry clustering concentration only up to a point, after which it becomes negative. Indeed, as group size increases, access to information becomes more difficult. For example, theoretical studies on networks have shown that network size has a curvilinear effect on the pathway number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611402565">Borrett and Patten, 2003</xref>). This means that system size has a stronger influence on system structure growth (increasing number of connections) in smaller networks. Relational proximity, as defined by the interaction structure, appears to be higher in smaller clusters. This suggests that larger clusters operate as global hubs, which leads to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3b: Cluster size will moderate the effect of the density of internationalized firms in that cluster (the density of firms that have formed international alliances), on the likelihood that a firm <italic>i</italic> in a cluster <italic>j</italic> will form an international alliance.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data for this study were obtained from <italic>BioScan</italic>, an electronic directory of biotechnology enterprises published by Thomson American Health Consultants. Researchers have used <italic>BioScan</italic> extensively in earlier studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611402565">Zaheer and Georges, 2004</xref>). There are approximately 1207 biotechnology companies in the USA, including 630 companies with fewer than 250 employees, of which 175 are start-ups founded after 2000. We examined these 175 companies to assess the impact of cluster characteristics on the internationalization of small, start-up firms that have formed international alliances. About 51 percent of start-up biotechnology alliances are international, and 14 percent of the 175 start-up biotechnology firms have established at least one alliance with a foreign partner.</p>
<p>Geographic clusters are usually formed around sets of common technologies, dense exchange networks and other relationships between firms in the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611402565">Zaheer and Georges, 2004</xref>). Owing to a lack of geographic precision and consensus, clusters have been studied from a variety of perspectives. For example, authors have used the state as the unit of location (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611402565">Audretsch and Feldman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611402565">Prevezer, 1997</xref>) and zip codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611402565">Zaheer and Georges, 2004</xref>) or the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611402565">Coombs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611402565">DeCarolis and Deeds, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al., 2006</xref>) to identify geographic clusters. We chose MSA as the boundary for cluster activity because a majority of biotechnology agglomeration studies have used this analysis level, making it easier to compare findings.</p>
<p>A striking characteristic of biotechnology firm location is strong concentration in nodes of excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611402565">Cooke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611402565">Feldman, 2001</xref>) and a defining feature of Strategically Targeted Academic Research (STAR) teams is the number of dedicated biotechnology firms involved. The firms in our sample are mainly located within nine clusters (69.2%):</p>
<list id="list1-0266242611402565" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>San Franscisco–Oakland–San José;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Philadelphia–Camden–Vineland; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Seattle–Tacoma–Olympia.</p></list-item></list>
<p>These clusters are considered to be biotechnology centres because they involve high levels of biotechnology research and commercialization: 11 percent are located in median metropolitan areas, with median levels of biotechnology research and commercialization (Austin–San Marcos, Cleveland–Akron, Dallas–Fort Worth, Indianapolis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611402565">Cortright and Mayer, 2002</xref>). Of the 175 firms, 9 percent are located either apart from a geographic cluster or in a non-significant biotechnology cluster, such as Phoenix–Mesa–Scottsdale, Las Vegas or San Juan–Caguas–Arecibo. In biotechnology research centres with limited commercial activity, 13 percent are located (Chicago–Gary–Kenosha; Detroit–Ann Arbor–Flint; Houston–Galveston–Brazoria; St Louis).</p>

<title>Statistical model</title>
<p>We constructed an event history for each firm. In the real world, changes may occur at any point in time. However, our data misleadingly imply continuity: measures of time are imprecise and given by year, consequently the data are discrete. Event history data for discrete time processes record the dependent variable as a series of binary outcomes denoting whether or not the event of interest occurred at the observation point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611402565">Box-Steffensmeier and Bradford, 2004</xref>). Each firm’s history begins at the time of its incorporation and ends at the time of an event (such as an alliance) or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. The second period begins in the following year and ends at the time of the event or at the end of the year. This pattern continues until the firm exits or until the end of the observation period.</p>
<p>We used a discrete time-repeated event history with time-varying covariates to test our hypotheses. The complete and general specification of the model was as follows:</p>

<title>Cluster size</title>
<p>We tested H1a and H1b using cluster size, i.e. the number of other biotechnology firms that were active in the firm’s MSA in each of the five years. Data were collected from the <italic>Bioscan</italic> database and coded. Clusters are composed of firms with similar and complementary capabilities. The vertical dimension comprises firms with dissimilar activities, and the horizontal dimension firms with similar activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611402565">Maskell, 2001</xref>). We considered a cluster to be a group of firms within one industry located in one geographic area. Hence, we retained the horizontal dimension to determine cluster size. Biotechnology firms are located in 87 MSAs (each counting as a cluster) throughout the USA. Small companies with fewer than 50 employees and established after 2000 account for 14.5 percent of the firms. Our sample covers 37 MSAs. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al. (2006)</xref>, cluster growth rate was introduced into the models: ‘Cluster growth rate is used as a control variable because it may correlate with trends and future expectations in the cluster that may otherwise be attributed to cluster size’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al., 2006</xref>: 229).</p>

Our second hypothesis states that the likelihood that a small firm will enter into an international alliance depends on the number of other firms located in the same cluster which have contracted an international alliance in the previous year. The international neighbourhood of a firm i located in a cluster j is the number of other small firms in the cluster j that have contracted an international alliance during the period t-1:</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611402565">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results of the logit analysis. From left to right across the table, models 1 and 2 explore the independent effects of cluster size, cluster growth rate and the density of internationalized firms (firms that have formed international alliances). In order to test H2b, that the strength of mimetic behaviour is non-monotonic, model 3 includes a term equal to the square of the measure used in the analyses. Model 4 tests the main effects of the principal variables. Subsequent models (models 5 and 6) introduce the interaction terms. To test these interaction effects, we mean-centred all three independent variables, created a separate multiplicative term between cluster size and the density of internationalized firms and between cluster age and the density of internationalized firms, and entered each multiplicative term into separate models. Model 7 explores the effects of the main variables simultaneously and model 8 explores the effects of the nine control variables. Model 9 is a multivariate model that simultaneously introduces all the independent and control variables in our study. A non-significant result on the Hosmer and Lemeshow test demonstrates that all the models adequately fit the data.</p>

<p>Our models showed no support for cluster size effect, as postulated in H1a and H1b. The effect of cluster size is negative but insignificant in the univariate model (model 1) and in the subsequent models. Our results provide strong support for H2a, that the likelihood that a given firm will form an international alliance depends on the cluster’s international alliance-forming behaviour. The overall model (model 9) is significant at <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001. The coefficients remain significant in all subsequent models. The significance of the quadratic term for international alliance density further suggests that international influence through other firms’ behaviour has a diminishing effect on the likelihood of international alliance formation after a certain saturation point. The relation is non-linear, and the results support H2b (model 3).</p>
<p>Model 5 introduces the interaction effect between cluster age and internationalized firms density (the density of firms that have formed international alliances). The main effect of cluster age is not significant in any model, neither is the interaction effect. H3a is not supported.</p>
<p>Model 6 introduces the interaction effect between cluster size and internationalized firms density (the density of firms that have formed international alliances). The interaction term is negative and significant (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001 in model 6 and <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05 in models 7 and 9), implying that the rate and intensity of international alliance formation decreases with increasing cluster size. H3c is supported.</p>
<p>The significance of some control variables in the models suggests that international alliance formation can be due in part to the existence of previous alliances and to certain firm characteristics. These results replicate prior findings, that international alliance formation is influenced by past domestic alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611402565">Al-Laham and Souitaris, 2008</xref>), past international alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611402565">Garcia-Pont and Norhia, 2002</xref>), firm size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611402565">Al-Laham and Souitaris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611402565">Coombs et al., 2006</xref>) and ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611402565">Rothaermel, 2002</xref>).

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was not only to determine whether a relationship exists between the geographic location of biotechnology firms and international alliance formation, but also to identify the motive for this relationship by investigating different characteristics of clusters. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature on internationalization in clusters and start-ups. International alliance formation is an important step in the internationalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611402565">Majocchi and Zucchella, 2003</xref>). First, we conducted a longitudinal study using event history analysis to understand the dynamics of internationalization in start-ups, with a specific focus on international alliance formation.</p>
<p>Based on current agglomeration economies theory, some research has suggested the significant effect of cluster size on a firm’s internationalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611402565">Al-Laham and Souitaris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611402565">Coombs et al., 2006</xref>). Our first interesting finding is that merely being located within a geographic cluster does not enhance start-up internationalization. More specifically, cluster size does not have a significant effect on international alliance formation. This suggests that start-ups in biotechnology centres and non-significant biotechnology clusters have about the same propensity to form international alliances. This result corresponds to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611402565">Zaheer and Georges (2004)</xref>, who found no significant link between cluster size and a firm’s market value, which suggests that the firm’s degree of attractiveness to the foreign partner does not depend on the size of the cluster in which it is located. Currently, there is no consensus on the role of cluster size: some studies have shown that firms are more likely to fail with increasing cluster size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611402565">Folta et al., 2006</xref>), with a non-linear relationship between cluster size and firm performance.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that the dynamics of international alliance formation within a cluster can be explained primarily by local mimetism. Geographic grouping tends to occur among firms that establish international alliances – and hence, adopt similar strategic development plans. Nevertheless, our results also show the limits of mimetic behaviour. The density of international alliances within a cluster has a non-monotonic effect on a firm’s propensity to enter into new international alliances. Although international alliances are enhanced by prior international connections in the cluster, more extensive interconnections do not appear to improve international alliance formation over more limited international connections in the cluster. The scope of mimetism is limited, and this is consistent with evolutionist theory. In order to reduce uncertainty, firms and their managers imitate each other. Although mimetism can appear to be a rational economic behaviour, a cognitive perspective reveals the non-linearity of such behaviour. The common pattern of a manager’s cognitive map at a certain point provides opportunities for mimetism, and explains the non-linearity of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al. (2009)</xref>, who explain that once an industry attains a critical mass of international alliances, the propensity to seek new alliances declines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611402565">Garcia-Pont and Norhia (2002)</xref> believe that by considering the industry as the unit of analysis, these studies may have glossed over the level at which mimetism actually takes place. Our findings show that the dynamic of international alliance formation can be explained in terms of local mimetism. Mimetism can take place at the cluster level and is mitigated by cluster size; hence, cluster size plays a significant role, as mimetic behaviour decreases with increasing cluster size.</p>
<p>Mimetic behaviour can explain why SMEs are participating increasingly in international activities shortly after their inception, known as the international born-global phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611402565">Knight and Cavusgil, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, future research should take into account the technological specialization in clusters to determine whether certain geographic areas are more internationalized than others. Some biotechnology niches can be more internationalized than others. Clusters tend to be specialized, which implies that firms involved in international alliances tend to be co-located with other firms involved in international alliances.</p>
<p>Our results also highlight a non-significant effect of cluster age. This suggests that clusters may grow at different rates and that life cycle duration may differ among clusters.</p>
<sec id="section24-0266242611402565">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Although this study makes a contribution to the international alliance literature, several limitations should be noted. First, this study is based on secondary data. This provides limited insight into the temporal aspects of cluster evolution and the internationalization process of firms. Second, further work should introduce more specific cluster characteristics, such as the number of universities and public institutions involved, or the amount of government funding, in order to determine the cluster’s degree of attractiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0266242611402565">
<title>Directions for further research</title>
<p>Our approach is one of many in understanding internationalization. Several reasons may explain SME internationalization. One perspective considers that SME internationalization is a specific strategic choice of each firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611402565">Arranz and Fernandez De Arroyabe, 2009</xref>), which acts independently of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611402565">Garcia-Pont and Norhia, 2002</xref>). The traditional view of internationalization considers that small firms progress linearly and gradually on the path of internationalization. Nevertheless, some research stresses that some firms are ‘born global’. The rapidity of the internationalization phenomenon can stem from multiple factors, such as a CEO’s formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611402565">Ulubasoglu et al., 2009</xref>) or a CEO’s international experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611402565">Van Gils and Zwart, 2009</xref>). Moreover, another perspective suggests that organizational actions can be predicated on the actions of other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611402565">Yeniyurt et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, our approach proposes that SME internationalization through alliances also can be explained by mimetism. Our results suggest that some specific cluster characteristics enhance the degree of interdependence across certain clusters, which in turn favours mimetic behaviour. These results raise some questions and issues that merit further exploration. Is local mimetism the primary dynamic that explains the formation of international alliances in clusters? Which informal cluster characteristics favour mimetic behaviour? Which informal local network characteristics promote mimetism?</p>
