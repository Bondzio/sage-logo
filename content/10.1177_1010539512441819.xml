<abstract>
<p>The effect of community capacity on health was evaluated by assessing the community via a questionnaire that included a capacity index in the social capital scale. The impact of the length of residence and the size and solidarity of networking on community capacity was also explored. The authors used logistic regression models controlling for sociodemographic factors and health behaviors among 1019 residents. The results indicate that lower community identity and social trust all led to statistically poor health levels. The manner in which members perceive their community was determined by cohesion, participation, length of residence, and the extent and strength of a member’s network. Partnerships among and the subsequent organization of public resources by community members helped solidify the sense of community. With enhanced levels of sense of community, the collective level of health among residents can be readily and effectively improved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reviews of community capacity have accumulated considerable momentum amid the growing recognition of “neighborhood” as a unit of health promotion projects, following the prevalence of “social determinants of health.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512441819">1</xref></sup> This means that an individual’s health behavior is nested in a physical and social space, which signifies that one’s residence and the relevant community context function as key deciding factors, beyond the conventional health model, which focuses solely on individual medical interventions. In this study, the social context or the core of the social environment can be reconceptualized in terms of social capital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512441819">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512441819">3</xref></sup> In Europe and America, a number of studies have already developed scales for the measurement of social capital that demonstrate its effects on the physical and mental health of community residents. According to such research, a low level of social capital appears to result in a lower participation rate by the public in the local communities, which then correlates with a lower degree of social trust and, ultimately, a higher death rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441819">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512441819">5</xref></sup> Social capital at the community level refers to the sharing of identity among the members, close communication, and connectedness based on mutual reliance and equal participation.</p>
<p>Based on these studies, the argument has been put forth that the development of the community and solidarity could contribute to the promotion of public health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512441819">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512441819">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512441819"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup> Community capacity formulates a sense of community by fostering cohesive trust among the individuals and facilitates collaboration between organizations at the community level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512441819">9</xref></sup> Conceptually, these two share a great deal in common. However, as for capacity, a sense of community is regarded as a fundamental factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512441819">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512441819"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512441819">12</xref></sup> That is, whereas social capital is indicative of relatively objective conditions of community, community capacity represents the concept of competencies that can be used for community development and improvements in health by voluntarily organizing these conditions on the basis of residents’ fellowships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, quantitative research on community capacity, including its underlying mechanisms, has yet to be conducted to a sufficient degree. In particular, by merely concentrating on the statistical modeling of social capital, the preceding studies have not adequately evaluated the relationship between community capacity and health and its determinant factors, despite their conceptual strength. Under such circumstances, several studies on community capacity have been conducted to explore the formation process and functional method of social capital by converting social capital’s approach level into specific community units. As Minkler and Wallerstein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512441819">9</xref></sup> pointed out, community capacity is a process of change that can occur in a cohesive community; the cooperative efforts of residents can result in strengthened community capacity. Labonte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512441819">13</xref></sup> also emphasized that social capital is a historical entity at the community level, which is built by both inclusion and exclusion functions.</p>
<p>However, to date, quantitative evidence regarding community capacity remains limited and in an embryonic stage because measurement scales and indicators have not been fully discussed or systematized because of the difficulty of measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512441819">14</xref></sup> and because of the preconception that community capacity is difficult to assess via a quantitative model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512441819">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512441819">16</xref></sup> Community capacity, however, also needs to be evaluated in its relation to health status because social capital verification has been greatly advanced by improvements in the relevant models.</p>
<p>Community capacity forms via residents’ cooperation and collaboration as a result of long-term living in a community. The sense of community and fellowship that is created over this prolonged period is expected to affect collective health status. This study addressed 2 research questions: the community contextual effect, that is, whether or not the community capacity is correlated with the residents’ levels of health in broad terms and, if such a correlation exists, identifying the decisive factor in increasing the community capacity. A strategy for developing community capacity will offer some practical guidance in conducting population-based health promotion programs, if the determinant factor is known.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539512441819">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The research data set came from the study titled “Community Capacity Assessment and Development Toward Health Promotion and Healthy City: A Case Study of D-district in 2006” (N = 1019). This research covered 1 district consisting of 15 neighborhoods and a population of about 380 000 in the northeast of Seoul that was formed in 1960 and which prides itself on its long history and strong bonds within the community. The sample was selected via proportional stratified sampling depending on the populations of the respective neighborhoods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539512441819">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We restructured the indicators of community capacity except for the scale of community identity, which was derived from the Integrated Questionnaire for the Measurement of Social Capital developed by the World Bank.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512441819">17</xref></sup> It consisted of 6 dimensions: groups and network, trust and solidarity, collective action and cooperation, information and communication, social cohesion and inclusion, and empowerment and political action. The following revised measurement scales were used. The revised scale is based on the results of capacity measurement tool development that took place in South Korea after 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512441819">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first measurement scale was social trust, which is based on the interrelationship within a community. Social trust and mutual relationship is, however, an abstract concept and can be determined differently from individual to individual; it is thus difficult to measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512441819">17</xref></sup> In this study, attitudes toward general reciprocity based on the study of Kawachi, Kennedy, and Glass were measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512441819">18</xref></sup> The question items are composed of 10 sections, including safety, personal reliance, and trust in the organizations (Cronbach’s α = .867).</p>
<p>The second measurement scale was social cohesion. According to the social capital scale used by the World Bank, questions regarding a community’s social cohesion include social inclusiveness, sociality, conflict, and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512441819">17</xref></sup> Social inclusion refers to familiarity toward the community, whereas social conflict refers to thoughts regarding the differences among residents and the frequency of violence resulting from such differences. Sociality is measured by the number of social meetings with other community residents, the number of leisure activities, and the anxiety regarding violence and crime, as surveyed via these community-level units. The 6 questions investigated were as follows: heterogeneity, conflicts, frequency of residents’ meeting, informal social gatherings, the number of social groups, and the diversity of a given group’s membership (Cronbach’s α = .884).</p>
<p>The third measurement scale is community participation. The WHO defines citizens’ community participation as empowerment cultivation by individuals and families for self-development and local development after their awareness of the responsibilities for their own health status as well as that of the entire community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512441819">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512441819"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539512441819">21</xref></sup> However, with regard to the scale of magnitude and relevance to other studies, citizens’ community participation is herein confined to their collective action for the community. It consists of 6 questions: experience participating in community issues, willingness to participate, whether or not a person has cast a vote in a previous election, whether a respondent has the intention to donate time or money for public projects of the community, and whether a respondent has voluntary work experience (Cronbach’s α = .808).</p>
<p>The fourth measurement scale involves the social network. This scale examines the frequency of meeting friends or neighbors, factors in the environment available for help, and norms regarding social support. From a perspective in which social capital is regarded as an individual network, a person’s social relationship, spontaneity of participation in social associations, and the size and solidarity of social supporting groups are important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512441819">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512441819">23</xref></sup> This study measured the network’s size and the solidarity of representative social gatherings: volunteer service, colleagueship, friendship, community clubs, religion, and social activities. The former shows whether or not each group participated, and the latter shows the level of participation from each group presented on a 4-point Likert-type scale (Cronbach’s α = .892).</p>
<p>The final measurement scale is community identity (a sense of community). For the measurement scale concerning community identity, the scale of Chavis, which is designed to measure the psychological cognitive structure of particular regions, is broadly used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512441819">24</xref></sup> In this study, these indicators were composed of 10 questions scored on a 5-point Likert scale in terms of community citizens’ sense of belonging, influence, necessity, satisfaction, and sympathy (Cronbach’s α = .908).</p>
<p>These 5 community capacity–related independent variables were used to explain the health status of local residents as the dependent variable. The residents’ self-rated health status was measured using a 5-point Likert scale, and the resulting classifications of “healthy” or “poor health” were used as dependent variables. After the social network variable and the length of residence variable were added, the sense of community was set as the dependent variable to increase the model’s precision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539512441819">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>The analysis was processed in 2 steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512441819">25</xref></sup> In the first, a community capacity model was used as a sort of contextual effect. This is a binary logistic regression model that uses gender, age, BMI, health behavior, and 4 community capacities (social trust, cohesion, participation, and community identity) as the independent variables and personal health level as the dependent variable. This process elucidates the effect of community capacity on health status. The dependent variable was the residents’ self-rating of their health conditions (healthy and poor health), adopting <italic>normal</italic> as the standard. This approach is based on the results of existing studies supporting the notion that a community’s contextual effects are found more accurately in health deterioration than in health improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second step is the capacity determinants model. This is an ordered logistic regression model that sets the socioeconomic variable as controlled. The independent variables are health behaviors, the community capacity variable, the size and solidarity of the individual network, and years of residence. The dependent variable is the sense of identity of the residents recorded at 3 levels: top, middle, and bottom. This model attempts to evaluate the community contextual effect by establishing a sense of community identity—which in previous studies was referred to as a unique dimension of community capacity—as the dependent variable and also attempts to identify the determinants that explain this contextual effect.</p>

<title>Effects of Contextual Variables on Residents’ Health</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539512441819">Table 2</xref>, as far as the basic model into which socioeconomic variables were input, men scored worse on self-rated health than women (odds ratio [OR] = 1.376; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.070-1.775), and those younger than 30 years were healthier than those older than 50 years (OR = 0.508; 95% CI = 0.360-0.721). When health behavior variables were added, those who exercised continuously were healthier than those who did not (OR = 0.540; 95% CI = 0.411-0.730). In the final model, into which community capacity variables were input, a significant level of health deterioration was observed among those with lower community identity (OR = 0.956; 95% CI = 0.920-0.975), social trust (OR = 0.623; 95% CI = 0.418-0.928), and community participation (OR = 0.873; 95% CI = 0.750-0.989). These results corroborate the relationship between community capacity and health status, suggesting that low community capacity translates into poor collective health status within the community. A gender gap tended to appear in terms of community capacity, in the sense that the CI between men and women was quite large in model III, although the difference was not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Determinants of Community Capacity</title>
<p>To evaluate the fundamental meaning of community capacity, we must determine the process by which community capacity is promoted. Additionally, it is necessary to confirm whether or not the variation of community capacity between the residents is sizeable. The components of community capacity were assessed below using the age-adjusted length of residence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539512441819">Table 3</xref>). This model was consistent with the previous logistic regression model, but the length of residence, the individual network’s size, and solidarity were added as key independent variables. The Nagelkerke’s <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of the final model was 0.249.</p>

<p>The analysis results showed that sense of community identity was correlated positively with the rise in the network’s solidarity (<italic>B</italic> = 1.021; standard error [SE] = 0.006), community participation (<italic>B</italic> = 1.324; SE = 0.125), cooperation (<italic>B</italic> = 1.514; SE = 0.211), and length of residence (<italic>B</italic> = 1.089; SE = 0.019). Specifically, because community cohesion and participation had significantly large <italic>B</italic> coefficients, they were chosen to be core factors in capacity building. On the other hand, social trust did not bear statistical relevance to community identity. According to this result, cohesion, participation, and social network were more important components of community capacity than social trust as a core variable of social capital. The positive correlation between a longer duration of residence and a greater sense of community could be interpreted to mean that these factors had been gradually formed over a long period of residence in the region.</p>
<p>In the final model, the housewives had a higher sense of community identity, by 1.571 times (SE = 0.267), than the unemployed. White-collar workers had an overall lower level of community identity than those in other occupations. Those in the lower income bracket (less than $2000 per month) evidenced a stronger sense of identity, by 1.235 times (SE = 0.204), than those in the higher income bracket (earning more than $3000 per month). This result revealed the presence of a certain group that leads the promotion of community capacity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Community capacity is a practical strategy in which members of the community recognize and manage their health-related condition and enhance their self-efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512441819">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512441819">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512441819">26</xref></sup> In this study, the social determinants of health constitute a critical infrastructure in the community capacity concept because they include socioeconomic background, neighborhood space, health promotion/risky behavior, primary health care systems, and others. In other words, community capacity is both theoretically and practically important as an effect of the community on the individual resident—that is, as a contextual effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup> The principal objective of this study was to assess the effects of community capacity on health using these 2 models and to determine the decisive factors that constitute community capacity.</p>
<p>First, according to the contextual effect model, those in the younger age group, the higher income group, and the regular exercisers’ group were healthier. Simultaneously, a higher degree of social trust, stronger sense of community identity, and greater participation in small organizations were positively correlated with better health. Therefore, our results showed that the contextual effect demonstrates a specific pattern: as capacity building increases, there is a statistically significant, positive effect on the individual’s health, so long as other health-related factors are controlled for. However, we were unable to apply multilevel analysis to confirm the existence of a contextual effect, owing to limitations in the data set. Nevertheless, the 4 variables measured in this study have been recognized as significant, in that they are factors formed via the interrelationship between individuals and community.</p>
<p>Second, in the community capacity determinant model, the community identity was relatively higher for housewives and those with a relatively low income. Simultaneously, the sense of identity also tended to be higher when the individual had resided in the region for a long time, forging strong relationships with the neighbors, as well as when the individual lived in a highly cohesive area while participating actively in regional issues. Thus, if community capacity is defined narrowly as community identity, it may be that its components, which include cohesiveness, participation, and a social network, can be formed when residents live in the same community for a certain period and thus become increasingly integrated with the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup> However, considering the cross-sectional nature of this study, the results of this research cannot be interpreted as indicative of a cause and effect relationship. Thus, in accordance with the theoretical groundwork laid by Chaskin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539512441819">27</xref></sup> it is reasonable to surmise that the above-mentioned factors, including the length of residence, are necessary conditions for creating capacity. However, the required conditions for capacity building are active participation and cooperation through personal attachment to neighboring areas because it is possible for an individual to neither participate in nor cooperate with the regional society despite residing in the area for a long time. Ultimately, active participation and cooperation create improvement effects in collective health. In particular, this study confirms that full-time housewives and low-income residents are highly likely to play a pivotal role in the development of community capacity. Thus, the creation and spread of community capacity can occur gradually through a particular lower-income group within the community and in particular can be initiated within the lower socioeconomic classes or regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512441819">28</xref></sup> In other words, capacity building promotes self-empowerment or current service improvement activities through people who desire change and spearhead awareness of the problem.</p>
<p>Once community capacity grows, social, political. and physical environments can be changed by the creation of a health-supportive environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539512441819">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539512441819">30</xref></sup> Community capacity and its related effects on improving health or suppressing unhealthiness result from such processes. This mechanism is similar to the social support and network’s effect on health combined with the theory regarding such community change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup> Up to now, the effect of community capacity has not been fully reviewed via a quantitative method. This study, however, attempted to determine which factors result in the formation of community identity as a key element of community capacity, thereby offering quantitative bases to demonstrate the effects of capacity enhancement projects.</p>
<p>The neighborhood can enhance the individual’s sense of identity with a community when it voluntarily creates social networks, performs activities under the auspices of grassroots associations, and organizes public goods. Based on the relationship between the community capacity indices and health as seen in this study, various public health programs for increasing capacity, particularly the sense of community, can be tried. However, the present study may have been affected by the cultural characteristics of South Korea, which has a strong community consciousness and places great value on group unity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512441819">8</xref></sup> In addition, because the study target was restricted, urban-rural differences could not be taken into consideration. Further examination of these elements is required in subsequent studies.</p>
