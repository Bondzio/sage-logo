<abstract>
<p>Words mean different things in different contexts, a phenomenon called polysemy. People talk about <italic>lines</italic> of both people and poetry, and about both <italic>long</italic> distances and <italic>long</italic> times. Polysemy lets a limited vocabulary capture a great variety of experiences, while highlighting commonalities. But how is this achieved? Are polysemous senses contextually driven modifications of core meanings, or must each sense be memorized separately? We show that participants’ ability to avoid referentially ambiguous descriptions of pictures named by polysemous words provides evidence for both possibilities. When senses followed a regular pattern (e.g., animals and the foodstuffs derived from them; <italic>noisy chicken, tasty chicken</italic>), participants avoided using ambiguous labels in referentially ambiguous situations (e.g., both types of chicken were present), a result indicating that they noticed a common meaning. But when senses were idiosyncratically related (e.g., <italic>sheet of glass, drinking glass</italic>), participants frequently produced ambiguous labels, a result indicating that the meanings were separately stored. We discuss implications for the relationship between word meanings and concepts.</p>

<body>
<p>Although the concepts people use to think about the world appear to be unambiguous, the words used to express these concepts are clearly not. This is most obvious in the case of homophones, like <italic>bat</italic> or <italic>bank</italic>, but in fact, almost every common word is subtly ambiguous, a phenomenon called polysemy. For instance, one can talk about <italic>lines on a page, lines of people, lines of text, fishing lines, telephone lines</italic>, and so on. Each sense of <italic>line</italic> means something slightly different, but these senses are all clearly connected by a common thread.</p>
<p>These linked senses provide language with vivid expressive power in a very economical fashion: A single word can have many interpretations, and even when its interpretation is fixed by context, the other senses can be alluded to. An account of polysemy is therefore necessary for explaining the limitless possible meanings that can be generated by combining words.</p>
<p>In addition, as a conduit between words and concepts, polysemy can help explain how language and thought are linked. Those common threads that permit expressivity are presumably a reflection of, and may themselves influence, links between nonlinguistic concepts. By placing multiple senses under a common term, language highlights similarities and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed as individuals learn about the world. Moreover, by frequently highlighting metaphorical or analogical relationships (e.g., <italic>long</italic> describes both spatial extension and temporal duration; <italic>hard</italic> describes both a physical attribute and a personality trait), polysemy may provide one avenue by which metaphors influence cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612472205">Barsalou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612472205">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612472205">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612472205">Landau, Meier, &amp; Keefer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612472205">Uleman, 2005</xref>). In light of all this, it is important to understand exactly how words are linked to their underlying concepts.</p>
<p>Theorists agree that a homophonous word has multiple separate meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612472205">Ferreira, Slevc, &amp; Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612472205">Levelt, Roelofs, &amp; Meyer, 1999</xref>). But the representation of polysemous words, or polysemes, is more controversial. One possibility, suggested by both psychologists and linguists, is that different senses do not need to be stored and represented at all. Instead, apparent senses are actually elaborations on an underspecified core meaning, which lists only characteristic and critical features (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612472205">Caramazza &amp; Grober, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612472205">Frisson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612472205">Nunberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612472205">Strigin, 1998</xref>). For instance, <italic>line</italic>’s meaning might specify a one-dimensional spatial extension but omit mention of paper, people, or text—information that has to be filled in using context and world knowledge.</p>
<p>Consistent with these <italic>core-meaning</italic> approaches are studies showing that people’s responses to polysemous words and to homophonous words are different in various experimental paradigms. Lexical decision times for words go down as the number of distinct polysemous senses increases, but go up as the number of distinct homophonous meanings increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612472205">Rodd, Gaskell, &amp; Marslen-Wilson, 2002</xref>). Reading times are not reliably greater for sentences that use less-frequent senses of polysemous words (e.g., <italic>Korea</italic>’s sense in referring to a specific war) than for sentences that use more-frequent senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612472205">Frazier &amp; Rayner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612472205">Frisson &amp; Pickering, 1999</xref>), whereas reading times do typically increase for sentences that use relatively infrequent meanings of homophonous words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612472205">Frazier &amp; Rayner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612472205">Rayner &amp; Frazier, 1989</xref>). These differences suggest that senses and meanings are processed differently.</p>
<p>The notion of core meaning satisfies the intuition that senses are related. But for any given polysemous word, it has proven hard to precisely specify a core meaning that captures all the associated senses but not the unassociated senses. This difficulty has led other researchers to propose that senses have to be individually learned rather than inferred on-line (<italic>stored-meaning</italic> theories); that is, polysemous and homophonous words have the same representational format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612472205">Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612472205">Lehrer, 1990</xref>). Consistent with this idea, a series of studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612472205">Klein and Murphy (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612472205">2002</xref>) found that responses to polysemous and to homophonous words are similar in several lexical processing tasks. For instance, reading a polysemous or homophonous word used with one sense or meaning (<italic>liberal paper</italic>) increases reading times for the same word used with a different sense or meaning (<italic>wrapping paper</italic>).</p>
<p>Stored-meaning theories have one major difficulty: In their simplest form, they cannot account for the productivity of polysemy. Many senses of polysemous words follow predictable, generalizable patterns, a phenomenon called <italic>regular</italic> polysemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612472205">Apresjan, 1974</xref>). For example, food produced from an animal or plant typically takes the same name as that animal or plant (e.g., <italic>tasty chicken</italic>), and this pattern can be extended for novel foods (e.g., <italic>tasty penguin</italic>). Regular polysemy stands in contrast to <italic>irregular</italic> polysemy, in which the senses of a word do not follow a predictable and generalizable pattern (e.g., the different senses of <italic>line</italic> or <italic>paper</italic>).</p>
<p>Stored-meaning theories cannot explain productive regular polysemy without introducing additional machinery to generate senses. This can be done in multiple ways. For instance, some theories assume that productivity is caused by operations akin to morphological rules (e.g., an animal → food rule transforms <italic>chicken</italic> from its base animal meaning to a foodstuff meaning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612472205">Copestake &amp; Briscoe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612472205">Lehrer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612472205">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612472205">Rabagliati, Marcus, &amp; Pylkkänen, 2011</xref>), whereas other theories assume that productivity results from a complex generative structure in the lexical entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612472205">Pustejovsky, 1995</xref>). Either way, according to a stored-meaning theory, the representation of regular polysemy, for which different senses are generated, is different from the representation of irregular polysemy, for which different senses are stored. By contrast, core-meaning theories can explain both regular and irregular polysemy using a single approach: Context and world knowledge combine to specify the best interpretation for a core meaning in a given instance.</p>
<p>The critical question, then, is this: Does polysemy reflect a mixture of stored irregular senses and generated regular senses, or are all polysemous senses generated through core meanings? Although previous experimental work has tended to elide the distinction between regular and irregular polysemy, this difference may explain the literature’s divergent findings. Many experiments providing evidence for core meanings used regular polysemes as stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612472205">Frazier &amp; Rayner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612472205">Frisson &amp; Pickering, 1999</xref>), whereas the experiments finding similar results for homophonous and polysemous words used mainly irregular polysemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612472205">Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612472205">2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612472205">Klepousniotou, Titone, and Romero (2008)</xref> provided further evidence for a distinction between types of polysemy. They replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612472205">Klein and Murphy’s (2001)</xref> demonstration of a reaction time cost for switching between polysemous senses (e.g., reading <italic>liberal paper</italic> and then <italic>wrapping paper</italic>), but showed that this cost disappeared for a subset of polysemes with highly related senses. Examination of their stimuli indicates that regular polysemes (e.g., <italic>chicken</italic>) made up the majority of this subset, suggesting that the difference between regular and irregular polysemy (rather than, or in addition to, the relatedness of the stimuli) might explain why switching between senses sometimes caused a reaction time cost and sometimes did not.</p>
<p>However, the difference could also have arisen from other features of the stimuli. In particular, it is not clear whether the context provided for the polysemes with highly related senses was strong enough to make participants switch senses. For example, the sequence <italic>sandwich lunch</italic> followed by <italic>afternoon lunch</italic> was intended to make participants switch between a concrete and an abstract sense of <italic>lunch</italic>, but neither sense was clearly ruled out in each case. Furthermore, the adjectives disambiguating the sense of polysemes with highly related senses were, by necessity, semantically related to both senses, which potentially could have overridden any inhibitory priming. In short, because it is uncertain how to interpret the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612472205">Klepousniotou et al. (2008)</xref>, this experiment does not provide clear evidence for a distinction between types of polysemy.</p>
<p>To directly test whether irregular and regular polysemes have different types of representations, we moved away from comprehension measures to a new paradigm: ambiguity avoidance in language production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612472205">Ferreira et al. (2005)</xref> showed that when participants are asked to unambiguously identify a pictured object that has a homophonous label (e.g., a baseball bat), they mistakenly produce a temporarily ambiguous name if a homophonous foil is also depicted (e.g., “bat . . . no, baseball bat” if the display includes the animal also referred to as a bat). However, they immediately recognize and avoid ambiguity if the foil is a second instance from the same category (e.g., “larger baseball bat”). That is, participants avoid ambiguities at the level of word meaning, but not phonology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612472205">Ferreira (2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612472205">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>) argued that these results indicate that speakers can detect overlap in meaning while formulating a message. But because homophones lack semantic overlap, speakers must rely on error-prone, comprehension-based detection to monitor their speech for potential ambiguity in the case of homophones.</p>
<p>According to these results, if each polyseme has a single core meaning, then participants should be able to avoid ambiguity when naming objects that have polysemous labels. But if polysemy relies on two different types of representations, with the different meanings of irregular polysemes being stored separately and the meanings of regular polysemes being generated from common core meanings, then ambiguity avoidance should be less frequent for irregular polysemes than for regular polysemes.</p>
<p>We therefore compared naming patterns when ambiguity was caused by depictions of objects with homophonous labels, irregularly polysemous labels, or regularly polysemous labels, or by depictions of two instances from the same category. On each trial, four pictures were displayed on a screen and assigned an order from 1 to 4. Participants memorized the order and then named the pictures in order. To quantify ambiguity avoidance, we compared the proportion of ambiguous names produced in the presence of a same-name foil with the proportion of ambiguous names produced in the absence of a same-name foil.</p>

<p>Fifty-two individuals whose first language was English (undergraduates or members of the Cambridge, MA, community) participated for course credit or cash.</p>

<sec id="section3-0956797612472205">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The experimental materials were 340 photographs of objects, including 36 target-foil pairs. In 6 of these pairs, the names of the target and foil were homophonous. In 12, the same irregular polyseme was the name of both the target and the foil. In another 12, the same regular polyseme was the name of both the target and the foil. Finally, in 6 pairs, the target and foil came from the same category. The pairs were normed so that the probability of providing the intended ambiguous name (e.g., <italic>bat</italic>), without prenominal modification, did not differ significantly within pairs or across the four ambiguity types (see Stimuli in the Supplemental Material available online for norming information and a list of stimuli).</p>
<p>For determining homophony and polysemy, we used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612472205"><italic>Oxford English Dictionary Online</italic> (2012)</xref>. Our criterion for homophony was that the two meanings had separate entries. Our criterion for irregular polysemy was that the two senses were listed under the same entry (regular senses were not always listed, as dictionaries tend to exclude predictable information). Six of the irregular polysemes did not fall under any systematic pattern of polysemy that we are aware of (e.g., <italic>shirt button</italic> vs. <italic>emergency button, single-edge razor</italic> vs. <italic>electric razor</italic>), and the other six fell under a pattern in which a material describes a product (e.g., <italic>sheets of glass</italic> vs. <italic>drinking glass, sea sponge</italic> vs. <italic>kitchen sponge</italic>). This pattern is common cross-linguistically, but (unlike in the case of regular polysemes) the extended meaning is unpredictable (e.g., it is unclear what <italic>a titanium</italic> would be). Regular polysemes also followed two patterns: In some pairs, the polysemes referred to an object and the food derived from it (e.g., <italic>noisy chicken</italic> vs. <italic>tasty chicken, stalks of corn</italic> vs. <italic>kernels of corn</italic>), and in others, the polysemes referred to an object and a representation of that object (e.g., <italic>real monkey</italic> vs. <italic>toy monkey, real zebra</italic> vs. <italic>toy zebra</italic>). Same-category items were visually dissimilar category members (e.g., <italic>luxury boat</italic> vs. <italic>rowboat, small dog</italic> vs. <italic>large dog</italic>).</p>
<p>Participants received 36 experimental trials and 40 filler trials in random order. Eighteen of the experimental trials were ambiguous (target, foil, and two filler pictures), and 18 were unambiguous (target and three filler pictures). Experimental-trial type (unambiguous, ambiguous) and ambiguity type (homophone, irregular polyseme, regular polyseme, same category) were varied within subjects, using a Latin square design. Within each target-foil pair, which object was the target and which was the foil was counterbalanced across participants (e.g., for half the participants, the baseball bat was the target, whereas for the other half, the animal bat was the target). To encourage both simple and complex labels, we created the filler trials such that the third picture was best described by a single word (<italic>pen</italic>) in half the trials and was best described by a complex phrase (<italic>washing machine</italic>) in the other half.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0956797612472205">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>On each trial, four pictures were displayed in a cross pattern, with position randomized. After a 2.5-s preview, the pictures were labeled consecutively from 1 to 4, with a 500-ms pause between labels. On experimental trials, the target picture was always in third position, and the foil (or a filler replacement) in fourth. Following a 1-s pause, the numbers disappeared, and participants named each picture in order.</p>
<p>Participants were told that the study was assessing communication, that some trials would be ambiguous, and that they should name the pictures aloud in such a way that another person could reconstruct the ordering. The experiment began with 10 practice trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0956797612472205">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Responses on experimental trials were transcribed and coded by a research assistant, and reliability-coded by the first author. Agreement was 97%; disagreements were resolved through discussion. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612472205">Ferreira et al. (2005)</xref>, we coded whether the description of the target (third) picture lacked prenominal modification (e.g., <italic>glass, glass for a window, glass pane</italic>), which would make the description temporarily ambiguous on ambiguous trials. We refer to these descriptions as <italic>bare</italic> names and compare their use with the use of unambiguous descriptions, which included premodification (e.g., <italic>pane of glass, window glass</italic>) or did not use the polysemous word (e.g., <italic>screens</italic>).</p>
<p>We analyzed how bare-name production varied over trial type (unambiguous, ambiguous), ambiguity type (homophone, irregular polyseme, regular polyseme, same category), and their interaction using a mixed-effects logistic regression with maximally appropriate random-effects structure: random intercepts for subjects and items, a random by-subjects slope for each fixed effect, and a random by-items slope for trial type (as the ambiguity type of an item was fixed). We dummy-coded our predictors so that the homophone condition served as a baseline against which we compared effects for the other ambiguity types.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797612472205" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The proportion of bare names in the unambiguous trials of the homophone condition did not differ from the proportion of bare names in the unambiguous trials of any of the other ambiguity-type conditions (all <italic>z</italic>s &lt; 1.4, n.s.; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612472205">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612472205">Table 1</xref>). For homophones, the proportion of bare names did not differ reliably between unambiguous and ambiguous trials (<italic>M</italic><sub>unambiguous</sub> = .56, <italic>SD</italic> = .28; <italic>M</italic><sub>ambiguous</sub> = .44, <italic>SD</italic> = .33), <italic>b</italic> = −0.71, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.44; Wald’s <italic>z</italic> = 1.61, n.s. That is, participants had difficulty avoiding ambiguity. Our regression tested whether the effect of trial type in the other ambiguity-type conditions differed from this baseline. As in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612472205">Ferreira et al. (2005)</xref>, participants were better able to avoid ambiguity for the same-category items: The decrease in bare-name production in ambiguous trials (<italic>M</italic><sub>unambiguous</sub> = .55, <italic>SD</italic> = .32; <italic>M</italic><sub>ambiguous</sub> = .15, <italic>SD</italic> = .23) was reliably larger in the same-category condition than in the homophone condition, <italic>b</italic> = −2.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.66; <italic>z</italic> = 3.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

<p>Note: The analysis tested the effects of trial type (unambiguous, ambiguous), ambiguity type (homophone, irregular polyseme, regular polyseme, same category), and their interaction on bare-name production. Predictors were dummy-coded so that unambiguous trials in the homophone condition served as the baseline (intercept). Reported effects of predictors show differences from that baseline. In the case of the interaction terms, the coefficients for the regular-polysemy and same-category conditions show reliable effects of ambiguity beyond those observed in the homophone condition, which the irregular-polysemy condition did not show. Standard errors are in parentheses.</p>

<p>Critically, the patterns for irregular and regular polysemy diverged. The effect of trial type for irregular polysemes (<italic>M</italic><sub>unambiguous</sub> = .60, <italic>SD</italic> = .22; <italic>M</italic><sub>ambiguous</sub> = .44, <italic>SD</italic> = .22) was not reliably different from the effect of trial type for homophones, <italic>b</italic> = −0.16, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.51; <italic>z</italic> = −0.32, n.s. But regular polysemes had a pattern like that of same-category items, showing a reliably larger difference between unambiguous and ambiguous trials (<italic>M</italic><sub>unambiguous</sub> = .66, <italic>SD</italic> = .23; <italic>M</italic><sub>ambiguous</sub> = .28, <italic>SD</italic> = .21), <italic>b</italic> = −1.76, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.56; <italic>z</italic> = −3.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. A direct comparison showed greater ambiguity avoidance for regular than for irregular polysemes, <italic>b</italic> = −1.64, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.47; <italic>z</italic> = 3.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (see Direct Comparison of Irregular and Regular Polysemes in the Supplemental Material). These results support a distinction between the representations used in regular and irregular polysemy, and they are inconsistent with theories in which all senses are inferred from core meanings. (An additional analysis showed the same pattern of results when we counted fluent phrases, such as <italic>glass pane</italic>, as unambiguous. Additional experiments with longer and shorter preview times also replicated these results. For details, see Analysis Using Stricter Ambiguity Coding Criteria and Further Experimentation in the Supplemental Material.)</p>
<p>We then tested alternative explanations for the difference between the irregular- and regular-polysemy conditions. First, we considered whether the patternlike nature of regular polysemy allowed participants to predict potentially ambiguous picture pairs (see Analysis of Order of Presentation in the Supplemental Material). If so, ambiguity avoidance should have increased over the course of the experiment in the case of regular polysemes. We added to the original regression a dummy variable indicating which half of the experiment each trial occurred in, along with this variable’s full set of interactions. However, ambiguity avoidance for regular polysemes did not vary between the two halves of the experiment, <italic>b</italic> = −0.37, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.70; <italic>z</italic> = 0.53, n.s.</p>
<p>Next, we tested a similarity-based explanation (see Analysis of Similarity in the Supplemental Material). We contrasted two models, one in which the effects were solely due to differences in similarity and one in which they could additionally be caused by differences in lexical representation between irregular and regular polysemes. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we collected similarity ratings for the picture pairs (asking how much the objects had in common, on a scale from 1 to 7; <italic>n</italic> = 24–30 per pair). We then evaluated whether a model containing trial type, similarity (centered and standardized), and their interaction as predictors explained as much variance as a more complex model that also included ambiguity type and the interaction of ambiguity type and trial type as predictors (we did not include a three-way interaction, which would have modeled differential similarity effects on ambiguity avoidance for each ambiguity type). The larger model explained significantly more variance, χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 22.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Thus, similarity may play some role in ambiguity avoidance in this task, but it does not fully explain the differential performance in the irregular- and regular-polysemy conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612472205">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Polysemy lets a limited vocabulary capture a great variety of experiences, while highlighting commonalities. Our participants’ failure to notice and preempt referential ambiguity in the case of irregular polysemes, and their relative success in the case of regular polysemes, suggests that this mapping from ambiguous words to unambiguous concepts is achieved in two ways: storage of individual senses (irregular polysemes) and constrained inference over core meanings (regular polysemes).</p>
<p>This dichotomy has implications for broader theories of language and language development. Accounts of how words are semantically composed into sentences (both in comprehension and in production) need to include mechanisms for combining both core meanings and individual senses. Developmental accounts of the lexicon need to explain how children learn individual senses while also constructing core meanings.</p>
<p>More broadly, our data constrain accounts of how metaphorical relationships in the lexicon (e.g., <italic>weighty idea, cold personality</italic>) might influence cognition, by showing that the common threads linking senses do not always pass through core meanings. However, our data leave open exactly what sort of conceptual structures contribute to the economical yet vivid expressive capacity of polysemy.</p>
