<p>Hart’s book <italic>Critical Discourse Analysis and Cognitive Science</italic> is just one of the long-needed additions to bridge the gap between critical discourse analysis (CDA) and cognitive science (CS). The interdisciplinary and multi-methodological character of both CDA and CS makes it possible for them to feed into each other. However, with the exception of Van Dijk’s socio-cognitive approach (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481312472972">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>, and earlier publications), few attempts have been made towards this direction until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481312472972">Hart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481312472972">Hart and Lukeš, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481312472972">O’Halloran, 2003</xref>). This book advances a broad but coherent cognitive framework for the analysis of manipulation and ideology in discourse on immigration and asylum within the UK press, on the basis of evolutionary psychology (EP) and cognitive linguistics (CL), with the intention to ‘promote a new perspective in CDA’ (p. 183). Although immigration discourse is a much-discussed domain in CDA, Hart’s corpus is a newly constructed one. By applying CS theories to these data, the book puts the CS theories to test with naturally occurring discourse and discloses their ideological effects.</p>
<p>The book is organized into three parts, consisting of eight chapters. The first part (‘The Scope of CDA’) contains the introduction and the first chapter. This part introduces the state of the art in CDA and points out its limitations, justifying the approach adopted in the book. It also presents the organization of the whole book. Notably, it is pointed out in Chapter 1 that mainstream CDA practices are mostly at the description stage, and there is a dire need for researchers to move towards the explanation and interpretation stage. The author then discusses the potentiality of EP and CL for filling these two ‘theoretical holes’ respectively.</p>
<p>Part II (Evolutionary Psychology, Chapters 2–5) offers an EP-based explanation of specific discursive strategies and their effectiveness. Chapter 2 deals with the human cognitive ability of representation in communication, especially detached representation (i.e. standing for something removed from the current situation) and metarepresentation (i.e. representations of representations), both of which are shown to be dependent on cooperation but are susceptible to manipulation. Chapter 3 explains how the human capacity of binary categorization of in-group and out-group can be exploited by using referential strategies to produce effective contemporary xenophobic discourse. Chapter 4 describes and exemplifies two more strategies for racist discourse, that is, predication strategies and proximization strategies. Predications such as adjectives and verbs can ascribe particular qualities or actions to people, and when used to represent negative attributes or actions such as the connotation of threat from the out-group, they may produce emotive effects in text-consumers. Proximization is a strategy to present the threat-connoting phenomena as spatially or temporally close to or approaching the text-consumers. The effectiveness of referential, predicational and proximization strategies relies on legitimization, which is the focus of Chapter 5. The purpose of legitimization strategies is to get text-consumers to accept the representations as true and accurate. The concept of <italic>legitimizing strategies</italic> refers to the use of linguistic expressions to imbue discourses with evidence, authority and truth, etc. For example, text producers may linguistically mark the evidence for the truth of their assertions by providing the basis of their assertions.</p>
<p>Part III (Cognitive Linguistics, Chapters 6–8) contextualizes CDA at the interpretation stage within a CL framework. Chapter 6 examines conceptualization and its significance for CDA. It argues that conceptualization is the online construction of mental representations during discourse which recruits cognitive models such as frames, image schemas and conceptual metaphors. The author challenges existing approaches which rely on conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) to analyse ideology-carrying metaphor in discourse, and demonstrates that conceptual blending theory is more advantageous in analysing metaphor at the interpretation stage. Chapter 7 provides its method for metaphor identification in discourse. The author shows how metaphors realize referential and predicational strategies by analysing metaphors for Britain and for immigration respectively. Chapter 8 investigates force dynamics, another construal operation alongside metaphor, and its explanatory power in CDA. Force-dynamics refers to a set of image schemas which underpin expressions of force and causation, including expressions of epistemic modality. In his concluding remarks, Hart recaptures the essential propositions throughout the book and poses several questions for further pursuit.</p>
<p>This book provides a platform for dialogues between CDA and CS. Its main contribution is that it proposes a systematic and coherent model which makes it possible for CDA practice to go beyond the descriptive stage to the explanation and interpretation stages by incorporating insights from EP and CL, two very important branches of CS. This can be seen as complementary to major CDA practices, which also seek explanation but rely more on either socio-cultural factors or stylistic aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750481312472972">Jeffries, 2010</xref>). First, at the explanation stage, Hart borrows EP findings to explain, attest and justify existing methods/tools in CDA. For example, he explains the referential strategy and the predicational strategy by using binary categorization and evolutionarily developed modules such as the cheater–detector module and the emotional module. Second, at the interpretation stage, unlike many critical metaphor theories which draw heavily on CMT and are more concerned with the static conceptual representation in long-term memory, his model employs conceptual blending theory and complementarily interprets the dynamic online meaning construction in short-term memory and its ideological consequences. His use of the notion ‘entrenchment’, which is the mechanism of how ideology gets naturalized, effectively shows the dialectical relations between offline and online cognition, thus his model refines Van Dijk’s socio-cognitive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481312472972">2008</xref>). Hart also draws on the concept of force-dynamics which is rarely used in CDA. These contributions of EP to CDA can be seen as evidence against those who do not see a place for EP in CDA. Moreover, Hart (pp. 45–48) specifically addresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481312472972">Chilton’s (2005)</xref> criticism of cognition-oriented approaches to CDA.</p>
<p>Overall, Hart’s book offers a promising direction for the cross-fertilization between CDA and CS. We may expect that metonymy, a way of construal no less fundamental than metaphor, should have a bigger role to play in analysing manipulative discourse. And cognitive grammar, another area of CL, also has great potential for CDA as admitted by the author himself (p. 191). And even more broadly, future work could seek explanation and interpretation of more tools for CDA from more branches of CS.</p>
