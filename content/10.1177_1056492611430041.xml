<p>Presumably it is not without reason that Hofstede’s Culture’s Consequences has left such a deep imprint on the organization sciences. A rough and ready guestimate provided by Google Scholar shows it to have been cited nearly 18,000 times. His subsequent Cultures and Organizations boasts well over 10,000 cites. How might we explain such popularity? Why is it that Hofstede succeeds where other writers on culture have failed to deliver the same sort of punch?</p>
<p>No doubt there are many plausible explanations, not least those that emphasize variations in scholarship, breath or depth, timing, readability, and commercial shrewdness on the part of the publisher. Yet I suspect there are some who would argue that success is occasionally down to the uncanny ability to see the simple in the complex and thus parse an invariably byzantine world into bite-size pieces.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple need not be the true. Anne Witte’s essay is insightful for precisely this reason. In revisiting a vociferous and colorful literature, she suggests that the simple is well past its sell-by date and that future students of culture may do well to leave behind any monist assumptions of culture given that organizations, and those inside them, are likely to draw from multiple different cultural references. As she herself explains,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Transnational corporations and the rise of virtual technology compromise the credibility of using within nation, institutional or psycho-social measures of culture because synergy and assimilation better reflect the reality of an embedded cultural world . . . With multi-cultural researchers viewing multi-cultural subjects for a multicultural readership, the variables of culture as well as research paradigms and epistemologies for culture have greatly multiplied, compromising the use of common points of cultural comparison, gathering cultural data according to pre-set categories, or using any fixed concept of culture as an explanatory device for human activity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Anne’s article can thus appropriately be framed as contributing to a forking of cultural scholarship, providing those tired of stereotypes with a way forward toward a more nuanced, more fox-like conception of culture and, by implications, organizations. That surely is a refreshing contribution.</p>
