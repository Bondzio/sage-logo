<abstract>
<p>Contemporary debate about compensation for past wrongs turns on the assumption that state reparation benefits the victims of atrocity by acknowledging harm and ameliorating victim suffering. Indeed, much recent theoretical and practical work has concurred to establish reparation to victims of state crimes as a cornerstone of human rights. However, this article argues that reparation can also function to placate victim demands for criminal justice and to regulate the range of political and historical meanings with which the crimes of the past are endowed. This is most evident in transitional political contexts in which gestures of reparation are usually concomitant with the inauguration of new political orders, and formal investigations of past atrocity are conditioned by the balancing of the political demands of new and old regimes. This article argues that in such contexts, state reparation can work to control social suffering with the consequence that it sometimes intensifies rather than alleviates it. To evidence this claim, the article investigates the refusal of reparations by the victims towards whom it is addressed, with reference to Argentina’s Madres de Plaza de Mayo. This analysis of their refusal demonstrates how victim groups make important challenges to some of the core assumptions in the field, reveals internal inconsistencies within the analytical architecture of the scholarly and professional discourse, and indicates the ways in which reparations carry political, and not just palliative, significance.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Current debate about the imperative to repair past wrongs turns on the assumption that state reparation works to benefit the victims of atrocity by acknowledging wrongful acts, recognising harms, and ameliorating victim suffering. Indeed, much theoretical and practical work has concurred to establish state reparation to victims of state crimes as a cornerstone of human rights. Most recently, reparation has been cast as a ‘right’ in itself, testimony to the moral certainty that characterises the contemporary debate and practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663911433670">2</xref></sup> However, I will argue in what follows that reparation can <italic>also</italic> function as a mechanism that attempts to placate victim demands for criminal justice and regulate the range of political and historical meanings with which the crimes of the past are endowed and through which they are interpreted and acted upon. This is most evidently the case in transitional contexts, in which gestures of state reparation are often conditioned by the inauguration of new political orders in which formal statements about past atrocity – what happened, who is responsible, and whether and how the book should be closed – are the subject of a precarious politics, of balancing the political demands of an outgoing authoritarian order against the moral demands on the nascent political regime: demands for truth, justice, accountability and reparation. These are the touchstones upon which transitional states now ground their authority, and as such they are not purely moral endeavours but thoroughly political practices.</p>
<p>I argue that in such contexts – Argentina, South Africa, Chile, amongst others – state reparation can work to administer and control social suffering and can sometimes intensify rather than ameliorate it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0964663911433670">3</xref>
</sup> To illustrate this claim, this paper investigates the <italic>refusal</italic> of reparations by the very victims towards whom it is addressed. One case is significant: that of the refusal of financial and memorial reparation by the <italic>Madres de Plaza de Mayo</italic>, Argentina’s ‘mothers of the disappeared’. This case is important not only because the <italic>Madres</italic> are internationally recognised as prominent human rights activists, and thus potential proponents of reparation, but because the existing literature on reparation within the field of transitional justice has paid a notable lack of attention to their refusal of reparations, in spite of its significance. In the literature they go either unreported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663911433670">Minow, 1998</xref>: 104–106), are granted cursory mention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663911433670">Hamber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911433670">Hayner, 2001</xref>: 178), or are subordinated to analysis of those in Argentina who accepted reparations rather than contested them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663911433670">Guembe, 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663911433670">4</xref>
</sup> This silence is also remarkable because the <italic>Madres</italic> are not alone in their contestation. Northern Ireland’s Eames Bradley Report recommended financial reparation to victims of the political conflict, generating fierce social protest, including from the victims to whom it was addressed. And in South Africa, victim groups contested the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s financial reparations by pursuing multinational corporations through US courts (Moon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663911433670">2008</xref>: chapter five). In these contexts, victim refusals of reparation are not a refusal of the gesture of repair per se, but are often a rejection of the range of political and historical meanings, and their coercive potential, to which state reparation is attached in transitional politics. This is due to the fact that the key challenge of transitional states lies in ‘control by opening and control by closing’ the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663911433670">Cohen, 1995</xref>: 47), in memory recovery <italic>and</italic> eradication in the maintenance of public order. It is precisely at the site of victim contestation that the public order dimension of reparation becomes visible.</p>
<p>In order to explore this assertion, this paper examines the settled ideas around reparation and the <italic>Madres’</italic> refusal of it in order to show how victim groups ‘speak back’ to and challenge some core assumptions in the field. This empirical engagement reveals both internal inconsistencies within the analytical architecture of the scholarly and professional discourse, and the political, and not just the palliative, performance of reparation.</p>
<sec id="section1-0964663911433670">
<title>Reparation: What is it Good For?</title>
<p>The term ‘reparation’ denotes a complex and dynamic combination of elements but is grounded in ‘the simple fairness of replacing what one has taken or destroyed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663911433670">Sharpe, 2007</xref>: 24). This principle has come to engage a cluster of related ideas with their origins in different aspects of social life such as religion (confession, atonement, forgiveness), justice (correction, remedy, restitution), the emotions (guilt, shame, remorse, apology) and the economy (compensation, damages). The etymology of the word gives us clues as to its social function: it is derived from ‘repair’, meaning to mend, fix or restore. Reparation aims to reduce inequity arising from the original injustice, and in the process, decrease the suffering of the offended. Both <italic>replacement</italic> and <italic>repair</italic> are its conditioning qualities.</p>
<p>Both human rights and transitional justice debates and practice have secured for reparation a new normative status and power, and along with it a set of categorical claims and assumptions about what reparation, broadly conceived, can achieve. In two of the most influential works in the field, Minow and Hayner highlight its alleged therapeutic benefits: ‘unlike retributive practices which may reinforce anger and a sense of victimhood, reparative approaches instead aim to help victims move beyond anger and a sense of powerlessness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663911433670">Minow, 1998</xref>: 92); reparations ‘can serve an important psychological role of acknowledging wrongs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911433670">Hayner, 2001</xref>: 171). ‘Acknowledgement’, ‘healing’ and ‘closure’ are powerful tropes animating the contemporary relationship of reparation to mental health. According to Zehr, a further function is that reparation makes a ‘moral statement to the community that they [the victims] were right’ (2003: 75). This is crucial, since state crime is routinely accompanied by state denial and any process of reparation must involve ‘setting the record straight’. Further, in declaring that victims were ‘right’, a wrong is affirmed and some measure of responsibility might be established in fulfilment of the obligation to repair the harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663911433670">Zehr, 2003</xref>: 79). The accepted wisdom about reparation can be summarised as follows: reparation (1) repairs harm (psychological, physical or economic), (2) vindicates victims, and (3) determines responsibility.</p>
<p>In the context of transitional justice debates, two practical and analytical schisms have become compelling. The first of these hives reparation off from, and sets it up in opposition to, retributive justice. This is an effect of the way in which political debate about justice in transition, such as in South Africa, has frequently been cast as a trade-off between retributive and restorative justice, where criminal trials of members of the former regime are practically impossible due to their persistent power, and reparation to victims serves as ‘compensation’ for the absence of criminal justice. In order to legitimise such justice ‘choices’, democratising states often characterise retributive justice as being akin to vengeance, a barbaric relic that serves to increase anger and perpetuate cycles of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663911433670">Moon, 2009</xref>). By contrast, restorative approaches have been promoted as best serving reconciliatory politics because they help to ‘heal’ past wounds and close the door on the past. As such, the two styles of retributive and restorative justice have come, in some transitional contexts, to be cast as distinct and separable, one from the other. This schism, however, is not ‘natural’, but contingent on the specific historical and political conditions in which it has arisen.</p>
<p>The second schism is constituted by the popular practical and analytical distinction between ‘material’ and ‘symbolic’ reparations. De Grieff’s touchstone text documents ‘complex’ reparations programmes which include ‘symbolic as well as material reparations’ (2006: 10); Minow writes of ‘economic and symbolic acts of reparation’ (1998: 91); and Sharpe of reparations as ‘either material or symbolic’ (2007: 27). This separation is widely constituted, maintained and naturalised in law, policy and analysis. ‘Material’ usually designates monetary reparation, while ‘symbolic’ refers to apologies, exhumations, memorial practices, or ‘communicative history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0964663911433670">Torpey, 2003</xref>: 6) that shapes public discourses about the past. The material/symbolic binary currently defines the field of reparations and is instrumental to how reparations are conceived, planned and administered. However, this distinction, symptomatic of the enduring dualisms grounded in Enlightenment thought, is rendered immediately nonsensical at the moment of <italic>reception</italic> of reparation, at which point the symbolic freight of the material gesture is rendered immediately visible. This connection between the material and symbolic is, as Raymond Williams (following Marx) has argued, ‘indissoluble’ (1977: 80).</p>
<p>I want to suggest that this dualism in the thought and practice of reparation has been sustainable in part due to the lack of proper attention to the ways in which victim groups contest reparation, and a general neglect of the <italic>meanings with which the intended recipients</italic> endow the practice of state reparation. I question the distinction between ‘material’ and ‘symbolic’ precisely because the refusals of material reparation in the Argentinean case are a refusal of the <italic>meanings</italic> – historical, social and political – to which they are attached. As such, I would urge the abandonment of the taxonomical and oppositional qualifications of ‘material’ and ‘symbolic’ regularly attendant upon the practice of reparation in order that we might properly analyse the social performance of reparations as a ‘whole and connected social material process’ by which we produce and reproduce social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663911433670">Williams, 1977</xref>: 140). This means that we also abandon ‘material’ and ‘symbolic’ not just as practical categories, but also as <italic>analytical</italic> categories. A significant value of allowing victims to ‘speak back’ to the analytical categories that govern thought, understanding and administration is in order to both contest <italic>and</italic> transform them, because the categories of thought also present a potential source of domination. It would be counter to the spirit of this engagement to show how victim refusals contest the analytical distinction, and then to persist, analytically, with the distinction itself. Rather, what I am aiming for here is in the spirit of immanent critique, in which contradictions within the analytical architecture are revealed in the moment of its <italic>practical application</italic>, demonstrating internal inconsistencies within the professional discourse that make it amenable to challenge. An examination of the case of the <italic>Madres</italic> and their refusal of reparation, both ‘material’ (in the form of financial compensation) and ‘symbolic’ (in the form of exhumations and memorial practices), reveals the indivisibility of these categories <italic>and</italic>makes visible the regulatory and coercive – or social control – dimensions of reparation.<sup>

<title>Terror, Trials and Reparation</title>
<p>The story about the <italic>Madres’</italic> refusal of reparation played out against the backdrop of the state’s attempts to investigate, document, prosecute, and, crucially, <italic>limit</italic> via amnesty laws and pardons, the prosecutions of those responsible for mass atrocities committed by the military junta during its short but brutal period in office from 1976 to 1983. Argentina presents one of the prototypical, longest, and most complex transitional justice processes in existence, and its attempts to reflect on past atrocity, which persist into the present, have been conditioned by chronic economic instability and a succession of attempted military coups. Without an understanding of these aspects, Argentina’s story about justice and reparation is unintelligible, although a proper account is beyond the ambit of this paper. This paper looks primarily at the two successive civilian regimes following the collapse of the junta in 1983, those of Raul Alfonsín and Carlos Menem, during which the state’s response to the junta’s crimes combined a complexity of measures, including trials and truth and reparation programmes – techniques which constituted control by opening and control by closing the past.</p>
<p>The 1976 military coup marked the start of the junta’s ‘Dirty War’ against its citizens, designed to destroy <italic>peronismo</italic>, Perón’s broadly leftist legacy. Argentina was simultaneously engaged in the Pan American ‘Operation Condor’, in which the militaries of a number of southern cone states, supported by the US, engaged extreme violence against civilian populations in an alleged attempt to eradicate communism. Argentina’s junta was a brutal regime whose strategies of governance were marked by forced disappearances, torture and the execution of trade unionists, students, social workers, journalists, intellectuals, and Marxist and Peronist guerrillas and their sympathisers. Thousands of opponents of the regime were killed, sometimes in mass executions, and buried in unmarked graves or incinerated. Many babies born in detention were forcibly removed from their mothers and adopted by military couples. The Navy Officer’s School of Mechanics (ESMA) in Buenos Aires operated as a secret detention centre from the early days of the junta, achieving special notoriety. Almost 5000 people were imprisoned there. Most were killed, sometimes by firing squad, or in ‘death flights’ over the <italic>Rio de la Plata</italic>, into which their bodies were thrown. The ESMA now stands as an important <italic>lieu de memoire</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663911433670">Nora, 1989</xref>) of that horror. Jorge Videla, leader of the junta from 1976 to 1981, was widely credited with being the architect of the Dirty War and author of the term ‘disappearance’, a sinister new noun which quickly gained currency across the Americas and is now firmly lodged within the legal lexicon of ‘gross violations of human rights’. This was a clever euphemism that simultaneously concealed the range of horrors to which the disappeared were subjected (abduction, detention, torture and execution), denied their very existence (where were the bodies, after all?), <italic>and</italic> put victims beyond the ambit of the law and its protection (legal subjects must be either ‘dead’ or ‘alive’). After Argentina’s Falklands defeat and just prior to its collapse, the junta issued a decree granting the police and the military immunity from prosecutions for their actions since 1976 and destroyed much evidence of its crimes.</p>
<p>The constitutive act of Alfonsín’s new government was to overturn the amnesty to make way for the trials of members of the juntas, including Videla. The trials, beginning in 1985, were the only such example in Latin America, and the first time since Nuremberg that senior military officers were prosecuted for mass killings. Nine senior commanders, including three former heads of state, were prosecuted and five convicted. Most, including Videla, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The trials provoked massive opposition from the army, forcing Alfonsín to mandate two new laws to curtail them. The ‘Full Stop Law’ and the ‘Due Obedience Law’, Alfonsín’s ‘amnesty laws’, put a halt to the prosecutions. He also set up the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) into the crimes of the junta, whose aim was to ‘chronicle events’ rather than to establish responsibility. It concentrated on identifying illegal detention camps and on documenting torture and disappearance, recommending the prosecution of those responsible. CONADEP put the number of victims of the regime at around 9000, yet human rights organizations estimated around 30,000. This struggle over numbers persists as both trials and exhumations of mass graves continue to mark Argentinean social and political life. CONADEP also recommended that laws be passed to provide the children and relatives of the disappeared with compensation in the form of financial assistance, study grants, social security and employment. One such law in October 1986 made pensions provisions for relatives of the disappeared.</p>
<p>During Argentina’s long reflection on the crimes of the junta, trials, pardons and reparations emerged in different forms over time out of a complex interplay between political and military power, economic conditions, and contestation by victim groups. A snapshot of this complexity is afforded by a brief glimpse into reparations under Menem, in office between 1989 and 1999. His rule was dogged by legal and political debates about Alfonsín’s amnesty laws, which remained intact, and, crucially, by the same economic instability and importunate threats from the military that had eventually ousted Alfonsín. This political and economic context informed his approach to the ‘problem of the past’. In contrast to Alfonsín’s opening gambit of trying the military (although in continuation of his later attempts to appease the military with his amnesty laws), Menem pardoned members of the junta who were still serving sentences, resulting in the release of, amongst others, Videla. He also pardoned elite officers who were not protected by the existing amnesty laws, preventing their trial. Menem justified these pardons under the rubric of ‘national reconciliation’, but simultaneously instituted a more thoroughgoing set of reparations laws than Alfonsín had.</p>

<title>Contesting Reparation: The <italic>Madres de Plaza de Mayo</italic>
</title>
<p>Woven into this story, the <italic>Madres</italic> played a significant part in Argentina’s struggle over justice, reparation, and the politics of the past. By the start of Alfonsín’s transitional regime, the <italic>Madres</italic> had secured for themselves a conspicuous presence in Argentina’s political landscape.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0964663911433670">6</xref>
</sup> Since their first public demonstration in the <italic>Plaza de Mayo</italic> in April 1977, the <italic>Madres</italic>, led by Hebe de Bonafini, persistently petitioned successive political regimes for information about the fate of their children and for the prosecution of those responsible for their disappearance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0964663911433670">7</xref>
</sup> They steadfastly refused financial and memorial reparation, which, they argued, aimed to buy their silence, arrest the truth recovery process, and avoid bringing perpetrators to trial. Truth, official acknowledgement, retributive justice and the reappearance of those disappeared and not properly accounted for were the only acceptable forms of repair, they claimed. It is in their refusal of financial and memorial reparation that their performance as instruments of social control – of the past, and of calls for justice – becomes most evident. In addition, the substance of their refusal reveals as problematic the theoretical and practical distinction between ‘material’ and ‘symbolic’ reparation. The essence of their refusal is captured by the various slogans of their long campaign: ‘judgment and punishment of all culprits’; ‘no exhumations, no posthumous homage, and no economic reparation’; ‘bring them back alive’; ‘put those who committed genocide behind bars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>), and can be summarised as follows.</p>
<p>The<italic> Madres</italic> objected to Alfonsín’s monetary compensation because it was predicated on a presumption of the death of the victim. Yet, many families had not given up hope of finding them alive. Accepting compensation meant relinquishing hopes for their reappearance, and, crucially, accepting that a full and proper accounting of each and every disappearance would not take place. ‘Bring them back alive’ radically contested the state’s attempt to get the <italic>Madres</italic> to accept the presumption of death and to close down their appeal for truth. The <italic>Madres</italic> also categorically refused ‘symbolic’ reparations in the form of official exhumations and memorials, provision for which were made by Alfonsín at the time that he instituted the Full Stop Law, which was designed to limit prosecutions. The two seemed inextricably linked. The <italic>Madres</italic> responded, ‘we are not going to allow … that they should make a monument … brick by brick the mothers will tear it apart, since our children do not want monuments’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663911433670">Roniger and Sznajder, 1999</xref>: 199). The refusal of exhumation and memorial seemed to be a refusal of their children’s deaths. However, Bonafini argued, ‘we don’t accept them as dead. We demand their re-appearance as living entities, which does not mean that we think they are alive. Our demand questions the system, and we will not accept their deaths until someone is made responsible’ (1990: 42). Like monetary compensation, memorials also worked to ‘presume death’, yet the circumstances of disappearance had neither been established, nor the bodies recovered, nor responsibility for the deaths investigated. Memorials, then, operated as a technique of the social control of the past, of both opening it (acknowledging and honouring the dead) and simultaneously closing it (by presuming death). There is a biopolitical aspect to the mother’s refusal. The <italic>Madres</italic> deliberately sustained the liminal (‘between life and death’) status of the disappeared in the face of the government’s attempt to confirm them as dead. The <italic>Madres’</italic>objection is a refusal of the government’s reordering of the past. For the mothers, the disappeared can only properly be returned to the social order through a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance, acknowledgement of responsibility, and punishment of those responsible. Their protest contests the power of the state to take life away with impunity and to subsequently control the political lives of dead bodies by placing them within the new official narrative about the past which seeks to settle claims to justice by finding and acknowledging the dead (through exhumations and lists of the junta’s victims), and attempt repair through memorialisation and public mourning. Both exhumations and monetary compensation carried a condition. When the government started to exhume mass graves in 1984, a number of the <italic>Madres</italic> received telegrams asking them to collect their children’s remains along with an indemnity payment. On collection, they were required to sign a certificate stating that ‘the child had fought with the police and was killed as a consequence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 140).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0964663911433670">8</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Madres</italic> responded by demonstrating at the site of exhumations to bring the proceedings to a halt. On her arrest and appearance in court after one such demonstration, Bonafini asked the judge, ‘why are you ordering the exhumation of remains to find out to whom they belonged instead of finding out who ordered their burial?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 149–150). Her question sheds light on the state’s privileging of <italic>certain types</italic> of truth – who died, how many, and how – which displaced, for the mothers, the most important truth: who killed them?</p>
<p>Second, the <italic>Madres</italic> refused reparation because it entailed an acceptance of Alfonsín’s narrative about the past – the theory of the ‘two devils’ – which conferred moral equality on state and guerrilla terror, and which underpinned the trial process by which both state security agents <italic>and</italic> opponents were to be held accountable for atrocities. This narrative emerged out of Alfonsín’s attempt to balance the continued power of the military against popular calls for justice and was part of the new regime’s attempt to enforce a sense of continuity over time – ‘diverse parties were culpable and we must find a way of living together now’ – and maintain public order. The <italic>Madres</italic> were suspicious of the ‘two devils’ argument since it provided justification for the junta’s Dirty War and simultaneously implied the guilt of their missing children. If they accepted financial reparation, they would, by implication, be accepting this version of the past. The <italic>Madres</italic>refused the ‘two devils’ version of culpability and sought to undermine it by seeking recourse to the legal norms that had been endorsed via Alfonsín’s recognition of the key human rights instruments, which, after all, underwrote the legitimacy of his regime: ‘we don’t judge our <italic>detained-disappeared</italic> children, nor do we ask for their freedom. We want to be told where they are, what they are accused of, and ask that they be judged according to legal norms with the legitimate right of defense if they have committed any crimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard 1994</xref>: 94–95, italics in original). The <italic>Madres</italic> persisted instead in drawing attention to the junta’s crimes – ‘put those who committed genocide behind bars’ – and unmasking what they saw as the true intent of the new government: reconciliation as pacification of the military.</p>
<p>Third, the <italic>Madres</italic> saw financial reparation as a means by which the state attempted to buy their silence and end their campaign for trials: ‘we reject any force that wants to bribe us … we insist that the murderers must be put in prison. This is our principal aim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663911433670">Bonafini, 1990</xref>: 42). Their refusal here highlights the political deployment of reparations laws, which tended, strategically, to accompany amnesties and pardons, thus seeming to pacify calls for trials. Alfonsín’s Full Stop Law was accompanied by memorial reparatory measures, and Menem’s lauded reparations laws were inaugurated simultaneously with his pardon of military elites and the release of Videla from prison.</p>
<p>Fourth, the <italic>Madres</italic> rejected financial reparations because they saw them as a wholly inadequate response to terror: ‘there is no money that can pay for torture, for death, for the forced disappearance … for the kidnapping of children … for state terrorism’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663911433670">Roniger and Sznajder, 1999</xref>: 199). This instinct is reflected in Simmel’s claim that because financial reparation sets up a system of equivalent exchange that transfers different lexicons of value, from pecuniary to human, it results in ‘the tendency to reduce the value of man to a monetary expression’, which ‘not only makes money the measure of man, but it also makes man the measure of the value of money’ (1978: 356).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0964663911433670">9</xref>
</sup> In illustration of this claim, Bonafini protested, ‘would you be able to bring a morsel to your mouth knowing that you bought it with the money they gave you because they killed your child … the life of our children has no price’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 142). Bonafini’s comment reveals something both alchemical and contaminatory in financial reparation, suggesting that it performs a strange transubstantiation in which money granted in recompense for the dead makes their bodies exchangeable for, or ‘turns them into’, other commodities such as food, constituting an especially strong defilement. The mothers also saw monetary compensation as an insult to human dignity and an abuse of poverty since it was an inevitable temptation to those who needed the money. For the <italic>Madres</italic>, dignity was asserted not in the granting and grateful receipt of financial reparation, but only in its refusal.</p>
<p>Finally, and crucially, the <italic>Madres</italic> saw the offer of monetary compensation as an extension of the crimes of the junta. This is due to the fact that <italic>the very first reparations laws were drawn up by the junta itself.</italic>Two laws on ‘presumption of death’ were instituted in 1979 in response to the <italic>Madres’</italic> persistent demonstrations against facilitating the payment of pensions to relatives of persons who had been disappeared for one year, and which accompanied another law stating that someone was to be legally determined as dead if they did not reappear within a 90-day period after being reported missing. These laws constituted a re-description of the disappeared as ‘presumed dead’, making them institutionally ‘controllable’, and attempting to prevent relatives from persisting in their claims for information about their whereabouts. The junta provided financial incentives for them to give up their search. For the <italic>Madres,</italic> accepting compensation was intrinsically bound up with accepting the junta’s narrative that a relative who had been disappeared was engaged in terrorist activities and had been killed, ‘legitimately’, as a consequence. These two laws were a clear attempt by the government to silence the voices of protest and to lay the issue of the disappeared to rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663911433670">Arditti, 1999</xref>: 40). For this reason, reparatory gestures made by subsequent regimes presented, to the <italic>Madres</italic>, <italic>continuity</italic> with the junta, rather than a radical departure from it. It is striking that these laws are conspicuously absent from the influential debates on reparation in transitional justice, which always narrate the start of Argentina’s reparations story with Alfonsín’s measures (de Grieff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663911433670">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911433670">Hayner, 2001</xref>). This has the effect of excluding consideration of the political uses of reparations and reinforces the regular moral claims that underpin reparation by associating them solely with the civilian, human rights respecting, regime.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This account of the <italic>Madres’</italic> refusal demonstrates two key things that are at stake in the attempt to repair harm: first, the particular <italic>forms</italic> that reparative gestures take, and second, the range of <italic>meanings</italic> that are attached to reparations. It also alerts us to the possibility that gestures of reparation, whilst attempting to acknowledge and repair harm, can <italic>also</italic> perform a social control function. This investigation has also sought to demonstrate that it is not sufficient to perpetuate the normative assumptions that regularly cluster around reparation as idea and practice. What is revealed in this empirical account of refusal allows us to scrutinise with acuity the assumptions that underpin reparations theory and practice: that reparation assuages psychological and emotional harm, that it vindicates and dignifies victims, and that it assists in determining responsibility for past crimes. This account requires that we attend more closely to the<italic> reception</italic> of reparation by those to whom it is addressed – to write the victims back into the story – because this tells us something valuable, and largely ignored, about the coercive potential of reparative attempts.</p>
<p>In addition, and importantly, this account of victim contestation demonstrates that reparation is not simply a coercive apparatus of the state but is an instrument of social control with which its subjects interact. It shows how reparation is simultaneously regulatory <italic>and</italic> productive in that it also, potentially, initiates a new lexicon of being: ‘a way to be a person, to experience oneself, to live in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663911433670">Hacking, 2006</xref>: 3). Through their refusal of reparation, the <italic>Madres</italic> transformed the meanings of victimhood, grief, and social suffering by converting them into public action. They made a deliberate decision to keep the wounds open and to refuse their suture: ‘let there be no healing of wounds … let them remain open. Because if the wounds still bleed, there will be no forgetting and our strength will continue to grow’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 152). They resist by demanding the impossible – the return of their children. This request at once reveals the impossibility of justice, because a full and proper account of the past was rendered impossible by the junta’s specific and deliberate techniques of terror: ‘we do not accept the exhumation of the corpses because not everyone will appear … many were thrown into the river, many burned’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 152). Those incinerated, or despatched into the <italic>Rio Plata</italic>, will never be recovered, and the circumstances of their deaths are almost impossible to establish. This raises questions about the possibility of any calculative summary of atrocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663911433670">Derrida, 2001</xref>). This does not mean that we must not try, but perhaps the mothers suggest something entirely counter-intuitive to what we take for granted now: that <italic>accounting</italic> for the past – in both senses, of counting and relating – is a prophylactic against repetition of atrocity in the future. Against this truism, we might instead learn this from their protest: <italic>repair can never be complete</italic>, and acknowledgement of this might operate more forcefully than accounting as a warning to the future.</p>
<p>Their refusal to ‘let go’ also contests the privileged status conferred on forgiveness in the literature and practice of transitional justice, in which victims who demonstrate a willingness to forgive are often regarded as virtuous and those who call for retribution are pathologised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663911433670">Moon, 2009</xref>). Such ‘resentment’ is not only an understandable response to atrocity but contains an important moral component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663911433670">Brudholm, 2008</xref>). This raises some questions about what kind of politics resentment instates, and what its contribution to ‘never again’ might be. The <italic>Madres’</italic> ‘intransigence’ constituted an alternative politics of memory, a way of keeping the past alive by refusing its settlement, because reparation constituted a form of forgetting. The <italic>Madres</italic> alert us to the difficulty of ‘incorporating’ the brute reality of what has taken place, they resist its comprehension, and along with it the temptation to consign horror to historical memory. This, Arendt argues, is a temptation which must be resisted because ‘memory can speak only when indignation and just anger, which impel us to action, have been silenced – and that needs time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663911433670">Arendt, 1968</xref>: 21), which in turn begs questions, not just about <italic>how</italic>, but <italic>when</italic> to repair the crimes of the past.<sup>

<p>Nestor Kirchner annulled Alfonsín’s amnesty laws in 2005, following which the <italic>Madres</italic> held their last demonstration. In April 2007, Argentina’s Supreme Court judged Menem’s pardons to be unconstitutional, and they too were overturned, restoring Videla’s convictions and returning him to jail for life in December 2010.</p>

<p>Social control normally refers to social responses to deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663911433670">Cohen, 1985</xref>: 1), and social suffering seems like an unusual candidate for application of the concept. That said, in so far as social control is concerned with the question of social order it can also be applied to institutional responses to social suffering such as reparations, particularly in cases where reparations are offered in tandem with less palatable responses to past crimes, such as amnesty, and appear to manage the appeals of victim groups. It is in this sense that it is possible to see reparation as a technique in the social control of social suffering.</p>

<p>They were initially lauded by Alfonsín for highlighting the crimes of the junta. However, the government became more hostile to the group after their persistent and trenchant criticism of its measures: the amnesty laws, the CONADEP (which they disliked because it was not empowered to prosecute and because its head, Ernesto Sabato, had shown sympathies with the junta), and their refusal of financial and memorial reparations.</p>

<p>The group split in 1984 and another group, the <italic>Madres-Linea Fundadora</italic> was established. The group was tired of Bonafini’s radicalism and sympathetic to Alfonsín’s aims. A characteristic of this split was class: a significant number of those departing from the original group were from the upper and middle classes, ‘adding an element of bitterness to their departure since the majority of the Mothers were from the working class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911433670">Guzman Bouvard, 1994</xref>: 163). The new group, fearful of a return to power by the military, favoured more ‘reconciliatory’ measures: acceptance of monetary compensation along with public and private initiatives to memorialise the disappeared. The <italic>Madres</italic> <italic>de Plaza de Mayo</italic>continued to focus on truth and justice, and the <italic>Madres-Línea Fundadora</italic> on memory and compensation. The <italic>Madres de Plaza de Mayo</italic> are the focus of this analysis.</p>

<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663911433670">Miller (2006</xref>) argues that modern justice protocols <italic>contain</italic> the ‘ancient’ retributive compulsion to ‘get even’, even although they are grounded in careful and inventive arithmetic attempts to assign valuation to body parts, whole human beings, and injuries such as pain and humiliation. On this account, monetary compensation is problematic <italic>not</italic> just because it crosses different lexicons of value but because it can be placed low down on a common scale of value. As such, the <italic>Madres’</italic> protest is that financial compensation is far too low a price to pay for past crimes, and that instead, the perpetrators should be made to suffer in recompense. As Bonafini stated, ‘what needs to be repaired by justice cannot be repaired by money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663911433670">2009</xref>).</p>
