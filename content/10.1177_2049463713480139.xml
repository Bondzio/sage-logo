<p>This issue of the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic> focuses on visceral pain, which ties in with the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) theme of visceral pain for this year. When Dr Austin Leach and I were planning this issue late one evening, we had concerns that we had in fact missed some viscera, but were reassured by a quick visit to Wikipedia that we had most topics covered. At this time Professor Paul Watson was busy organizing a visceral pain study day as part of the British Pain Society’s education programme. He suggested that we approach Professor Qasim Aziz to ask him to contribute an article on pain associated with functional bowel disorders – which we dutifully did. At that time we did not realize that Professor Aziz was in fact one of the two individuals responsible (known as Task Force Co-ordinators) for the IASP global visceral pain strategy.</p>
<p>Visceral pain can be associated with ailments, such as gallstones, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis and diverticulitis, and is the most common reason for visits to outpatient and inpatient gastrointestinal clinics. However, visceral pain also includes chronic chest pain, bladder pain, gynaecological pain and pelvic pain. The IASP website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iasp-pain.org/Content/NavigationMenu/GlobalYearAgainstPain/GlobalYearAgainstVisceralPain/default.htm">www.iasp-pain.org/Content/NavigationMenu/GlobalYearAgainstPain/GlobalYearAgainstVisceralPain/default.htm</ext-link>) has a number of excellent open-access resources concerning visceral pain including nine factsheets in a variety of languages and scripts as well as links to external resources.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the contributors of this issue. In addition to Professor Aziz’s review of pain associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, Dr Leach and a colleague, Dr Mike Fisher, have provided an overview of pain associated with myocardial ischaemia with a focus on neurobiology, and Dr Mike Goulden has written an overview of pain associated with pancreatitis.</p>
<p>Thanks are also due to Dr Beverly Collett, the current chair of the Chronic Pain Policy Coalition, who, it seems, has been on a one-woman campaign against pelvic pain for decades. She has provided a guest editorial that implores us to remember the role that pain management services play in reducing the biopsychosocial impact of visceral pain.</p>
