<abstract>
<p>The article examines the question of whether memory of the distant past can matter today by drawing on a case study of contemporary British memory and myths of the Norman Conquest. The two main sources of data are a corpus of newspaper articles in which the Conquest is referred to, and a quantitative survey of the population of the United Kingdom. In a preliminary discussion myths of the Norman Conquest are described, and differences between recent and distant memory of a significant event are considered. Then the question of intercultural relations and distant memory is examined, in particular whether British memory of the Norman Conquest has an impact on international and intra-national relations today as expressed in attitudes towards the French, and towards foreigners in Britain. It is concluded that memory of past iconic events does have an impact, and that characteristics of distant memory such as multiple remediation, multi-directionality and affective mobility are important in explaining the role and influence of memory of the distant past regarding intercultural relations today.</p>

<p>This article examines the question of whether memory of the distant past can matter today by reporting on a case study of British<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698011426358">1</xref></sup> memory of the Norman Conquest of England (1066). In order to gauge significance, I start by giving some information about how many people have heard of the event, whether people think it was important, and whether people know much about it. I also discuss the stories and myths surrounding the event. But what I’m interested in primarily is a further set of questions: Do people have an emotional link with the past event? Does this emotional attitude impact on their attitudes to present-day people and situations? With regard to these questions, my focus is on the potential impact of memory of the Norman Conquest on intercultural relations today, both international and intra-national. Before pursuing the issue of intercultural relations, I examine differences between memory of a recent event and memory of a distant event, abbreviated to ‘recent memory’ and ‘distant memory’. The definitions of ‘recent’ and ‘distant’ are of course not fixed. For ‘recent event’ from today’s perspective I have in mind the 20th century onwards. For ‘distant’ the question is more difficult. One possibility would be to say that everything that is not recent is distant; another to say that distant implies a considerable time back in the past. The case studied here is in the second category because the event, the Norman Conquest of England, occurred more than 900 years ago. The article shows how this distant memory is remediated in different genres and guises, used explicitly, or unconsciously alluded to, in contributing to past and present-day debates and questions of British politics and identity that involve intercultural relations.</p>
<p>My methodological approach is based on the recognition that it is not possible to distil some kind of ‘essence’ that would be the ‘memory’ or ‘mnemonic processes’ of a population. We can only learn about cultural remembrance through what medial representations show us. All memory is mediated, whether the mediation consists of an oral account, a text, a film or a survey, etc. Because different media and types of data source may present different aspects and perspectives, it is beneficial to study a range of media and genres, encircling and circumscribing the object of study. In our case this object is the ‘memory site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011426358">Erll, 2009</xref>) of the Norman Conquest with a focus on knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards the Conquest in Britain today.</p>
<p>This article draws on a study of memory of the Norman Conquest that uses various types of data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698011426358">2</xref></sup> A set of medieval chronicles written by English and Anglo-Norman chroniclers in the late 11th and early 12th centuries provides insight into recent memory of the event. Contemporary data concerning the Conquest that can inform on distant memory comprise two major sources. The first is a corpus of newspaper articles in which references are made to the Norman Conquest. The newspaper articles come from 10 British daily newspapers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698011426358">3</xref></sup> published between July 2005 and July 2008. Since journalists are sensitive to and draw on knowledge and attitudes in the community of readers, newspapers can be said to reflect community ideas as well as shaping them. A more direct approach to community members was obtained through the second main source of contemporary material, a quantitative survey undertaken in September 2010 of a representative sample of 2179 members of the UK population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750698011426358">4</xref></sup> The survey contained questions that aimed to find out information about respondents’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes toward the Norman Conquest. The two sources nicely complement each other, because the fleeting newspaper allusions provide a somewhat spontaneous qualitative output, and the survey provides a quantitative output based on explicit questions and answers. Further contemporary sources used are a small pilot study for the survey; various types of book (history books, children’s books, guidebooks); and a set of 10 television documentaries and films produced between 1991 and 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750698011426358">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1750698011426358">
<title>Significance and myths</title>
<p>The significance of the memory of a past event can be indicated by figures. In my newspaper corpus covering 10 newspapers and a three-year period, there were 807 articles that made a reference to the Norman Conquest. In the genre of newspaper articles generally allusions are only made to cultural or historical items that readers are fully familiar with. The frequency of allusions to the Norman Conquest supports the idea that it is a well-known event in the community. With regard to importance, in the survey a large number of people judged the event as important in British history: 79% said it was important, 7% said it was not important, and 14% said they didn’t know.</p>
<p>The judgement of importance does not necessarily mean that people have an in-depth knowledge of the event. Another question in the survey asks about a particular story related to the Conquest (Harold’s oath to William<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750698011426358">6</xref></sup>); respondents revealed lack of knowledge of this: only 24 percent of the population had heard of it. Newspaper references indicate that memory functions through recognition of certain key items: ‘Normans’, ‘Saxons’, ‘King Harold’, ‘William the Conqueror’, ‘Battle of Hastings’, ‘Norman Conquest’, ‘1066’, ‘Bayeux Tapestry’, ‘Domesday Book’. Knowledge of the basic story is reinforced through reiteration across time and in many forms and different genres, among which are newspapers, creating a durable memory site based on minimal knowledge for most people.</p>
<p>Following on from the issue of reiteration, another way of gauging significance is through the multiplicity, complexity and richness of uses and stories that have been told concerning a past event over time. There are multiple stories, legends and myths related to the Norman Conquest. I use the term ‘myth’ to signify a durable and widespread belief that historians would not consensually agree with in its entirety. A classic story that has caught the popular imagination is that King Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye at the Battle of Hastings. Medieval chronicles and the Bayeux Tapestry relate in fact a number of versions of Harold’s death, only two of which include the ‘arrow in the eye’. Another story that is shrouded in mystery is the story of Harold’s supposed trip to Normandy in 1064 and his supposed oath to support William as future King of England. Harold’s breaking of this oath is said to constitute the motivation for the Norman invasion. The Norman and English chronicles are so strangely conflicting in their narratives, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698011426358">Garnett (2009)</xref> believes the story to be an entire propagandistic fabrication by the Normans.</p>
<p>A very famous myth is what has been called the ‘myth of the Norman yoke’. At the core of the myth of the Norman yoke is a highly negative attitude towards the Norman conquerors as oppressors. Many strands of the myth developed over the centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries a strand developed in which the Normans are said to have put an end to an Anglo-Saxon golden age. In the 16th century English church reformers promoted the falsehood that prior to the Normans the ancient English church was free from Roman Catholic dominance. Further elements were added to the myth by political reformers in the 17th and 18th centuries who promoted the idea that the Normans had imposed a new tyrannical system of law and property, the feudal system. In the 19th century the myth of the Norman yoke no longer had much political weight, but a racialized version of Normans versus Saxons was taken up dramatically by novelists (Scott, Bulwer-Lytton and Kingsley) and historians (Thierry and Freeman). It was Scott who led the way with his novel <italic>Ivanhoe</italic> in which he contributes a further aspect to the myth: the notion that the Anglo-Saxon common people continued to struggle against the tyrannical Norman military aristocracy for a number of generations. In the 20th and 21st centuries the myth is still present, perhaps most strongly in the numerous film and television versions of the story of ‘Robin Hood’ in which Robin defends the poor Saxons against the cruel Norman sheriff of Nottingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011426358">Brownlie, in prep</xref>).</p>
<p>Two contemporary myths regarding the Norman conquerors were revealed through an examination of my newspaper corpus. The first is what I have called the myth of the French Normans. In a number of passages in newspaper articles the Norman conquerors are equated with the French today (18% of survey respondents acknowledge this association). Calling the Norman conquerors French is historically inaccurate because Normandy at the time of the Conquest was an autonomous territory, and although the Normans had adopted a French-based culture and language, they were fiercely proud of their particular identity including their Scandinavian origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698011426358">Thomas, 2003</xref>). The myth of the French Normans extends negative attitudes from the Norman conquerors as outsiders to encompass the contemporary French. The following newspaper passage shows this:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the eve of the 941st anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, the near-laughing stock of the tournament [England rugby team] did valiantly battle to drop-kick the host nation and favourites [France] out of the World Cup, and exact a little revenge for the Norman Conquest while they were at it. (<italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 15 October 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The second myth involving the Normans which is evidenced in the newspaper corpus is the myth of the British Normans (23% of survey respondents acknowledge this association). Here the Norman conquerors are called British, as in the following headline about the richest Briton in history – Alan the Red was in fact William the Conqueror’s cousin:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Alan the Red, the Brit who makes Bill Gates a Pauper</italic> (Maurice Chittenden, <italic>The Times</italic>, 7 October 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly to the French Normans, the myth of the British Normans involves an anachronism, a projection of the present back onto the past, because Britain as we know it today, didn’t exist in the 11th century. This myth embodies neutral attitudes towards the Conquest. It is also an inclusive myth because the British includes both the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans of the Conquest, as is seen in the use of ‘our’ in the following quote from a letter to the editor:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Battle of Hastings, the Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Britain were all knife-edge events which turned on the guile and bravery of <italic>our</italic> ancestors. John Macallister, Kidlington, Oxon (<italic>The Times</italic>, 26 July 2007) (my emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Further myths concern the early English. Genealogical and DNA research shows that equating today’s English with the pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxons is entirely mythical. Nevertheless, the myth does circulate as is evidenced in the existence of the association RAW, Restore Anglo-Saxon Witenagemots (Anglo-Saxon councils of wise men), whose desire is to return England to what it was before the Conquest. Voting rights in the association are accorded only to ‘thoroughbred Anglo-Saxons’ (A.N. Wilson, <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 12 March 2006).</p>
<p>The myths concerning Anglo-Saxons, Normans, French and British, as adduced from the newspaper corpus, can be brought together in the following ways. Either the Anglo-Saxons are considered British in opposition to the French Normans, or the Anglo-Saxons are grouped together with the Normans as British. In the latter case, the Normans can still be perceived as outsiders in some situations. In summary form this gives two schemas:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750698011426358">7</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons = British today = we = insiders</p>
<p>Normans = French today = they = outsiders</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons and Normans = British today = we = insiders</p>
<p>(Normans =) French today = they = outsiders</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These are certainly very simplistic schemas with regard to ‘the British’, and this will be discussed in the later section on intercultural relations. For the moment I am concerned with the question of attitudes. Newspaper data show that insiders are usually associated with neutral and positive attitudes, whereas outsiders are more usually associated with negative attitudes. In both of the above schemas the contemporary French are placed in a negative oppositional role; in practice the negative is quite often a matter of playful rivalry. Of course, there are exceptions to the categorization of attitudes that I have indicated, and there are also mixed attitudes, notably towards the French, but also towards the Anglo-Saxons. The most interesting issue displayed by the schemas is that the Normans can be perceived either as insiders (neutral or positive attitudes) or as outsiders (negative attitudes), or as both in differing circumstances. Schema 2 shows how attitudes towards the Normans seem to be somewhat schizophrenic. A case quite commonly found is conflicting attitudes with respect to the Conquest as historical event (negative attitude) and heritage traces (positive attitude). In terms of schema 2, the Normans may be regarded as invading outsiders with respect to the historical event, and accepted insiders with regard to heritage. There is also the potentially difficult situation of a person attempting to reconcile a natural pride in ancestry with the known misdeeds of their ancestors. In terms of schema 2, the positive pride in ancestry is expressed as considering the Normans as insiders, and the negative feelings are either neutralized or projected onto the French and/or a construct of the Normans as perpetual invaders and outsiders.</p>

<sec id="section2-1750698011426358">
<title>Characteristics of distant memory</title>
<p>Before coming back to the myth schemas, let us focus on some differences between recent memory and distant memory, with particular reference to the Norman Conquest (for a full discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011426358">Brownlie, in preparation</xref>). The first question is that of affect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011426358">Assmann (2006</xref>: 3) says that: ‘only emotionally cathected forms of communication bring structure, perspective, relevance, definition and horizon into memory’. Attitudes that express emotions are thus an essential part of memory.</p>
<p>Because recent memory of a traumatic event is based on a fairly immediate experience, the trauma is poignantly expressed. With time affective responses are blunted. Examples of this concern the expression of suffering of the English population at the time of the Conquest. Nothing in the newspaper corpus comes close to equalling the heart-felt pleas in the 11th and 12th century chronicles such as the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>the English were groaning under the Norman yoke, and suffering oppressions from the proud lords … The petty lords who were guarding the castles oppressed all the native inhabitants of high and low degree, and heaped shameful burdens on them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698011426358">Orderic Vitalis, 1969–73</xref>: Vol. II, 203)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698011426358">Schudson (1995</xref>: 348–51) concurs with the notion of loss of emotional intensity over time, but also says it is culturally variable: some peoples harbour ancient hurts. Where memory retains intensity, it may do so at the cost of simplification, stereotyping and sentimentality. An example of the latter might be in the film <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011426358"><italic>1066</italic> (2009)</xref> where pro-Saxonism is expressed in the touching story of a young child and music that pulls at the heart strings.</p>
<p>The usual diminishing of affect with time can explain why distant memory is less affectively polarized than recent memory. In distant memory there are many instances of neutral attitudes, whereas in recent memory of a significant event we may find only negative or positive attitudes. Recent memory cannot be indifferent to a traumatic event; there is an urgency to react, to give an opinion. The early chroniclers of the Norman Conquest, for example, give strong sentiments and judgements, either negative or positive, regarding the English, the Normans, and Harold and William. In contrast, although there are still negative and positive attitudes, the Norman Conquest is often referred to in the newspapers in a totally neutral manner, as a fact or as a conveniently known event and time period. In the survey 49 percent of respondents say they have a neutral attitude (neither positive nor negative) towards the Norman Conquest (with 26% reporting a positive attitude, 6% a negative attitude, and 18% ‘don’t know’). Neutralization may stem from a kind of healing of trauma over time through narrativization, and other group actions such as commemoration, and building monuments and museums.</p>
<p>Diminished polarization of distant memory does not tell the whole story, because not only is there a greater variety of attitudes in distant memory, but there is a greater number of combinations of attitude and target of the attitude. Distant memory seems to be both more conceptually and affectively mobile than recent memory. At the time of the start of the Norman Conquest one can imagine that all attitudes of the English were negative towards the brutal invasion. With respect to distant memory of the Norman Conquest the study reveals negative, positive, humorous and neutral attitudes towards the same or different aspects of the Conquest and the Normans; positive attitudes towards heritage; positive attitudes towards the Saxons; and negative attitudes towards the French and foreigners; as well as alternative but less common combinations. The memorial focus that is the most prominent for a community may change over time. On the other hand, there are also long-standing conceptualizations: myths are vectors of attitudes and targets, and one of their functions is to crystallize affective memory.</p>
<p>Affective mobility over time is related to hindsight. It is not necessarily possible in recent memory to appreciate positive outcomes of a negative event, because this requires hindsight. A good example of hindsight is discussed in Dan Snow’s third Norman Walks documentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011426358"><italic>Dan Snow’s Norman Walks</italic>, 2010</xref>): people living in the 11th century and early 12th century in Yorkshire would have a highly negative memory of the Normans because of the immense destruction inflicted on the north of England, but greater memorial hindsight can take into account the economic prosperity brought to the north by the implantation of monasteries from the later 12th century. The main positive outcomes of the Norman Conquest referred to in the newspapers and pilot survey are cultural enrichment and strengthening of the country, and, of course, there is the matter of positively viewed heritage sites and artefacts.</p>
<p>The passing of a long time means that there is greater tolerance towards variable representation of historical content and more possibilities for the development of myths. It means too that there has been the opportunity for much remediation, much recalling of the same historical event in different media and genres: oral stories, articles, history books, historical novels, illustrations, paintings, films, documentaries, internet representations, museum displays, monuments, commemorations, re-enactments etc., which consolidate the past event as a memory site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011426358">Erll, 2009</xref>). Distant memory is also much more mediated by prior discourse, events and representations than recent memory. An element of repetition is introduced because representations will draw on past discourse. Early English chronicles of the Norman Conquest used earlier sources, notably the Norman chroniclers William of Jumièges and William of Poitiers. This, of course, is very limited compared with the potential mediation of contemporary discourse drawing on centuries of prior representations. As sources are diffuse and multiple, they are difficult to trace for the knowledge and conceptions of lay memory of the Conquest today. Nevertheless, I was able to trace some original sources for newspaper passages, even including quotations such as the quotation about the thoroughness of the Domesday survey: ‘there was no single hide nor yard of land, nor indeed one ox nor one pig which was left out’, which comes from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011426358"><italic>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</italic> (1961)</xref>. The passing of time and the mediation by multiple representations also allows many possibilities for combinations of memorial representations and for transformations of original sources. The phrase ‘Norman yoke’, for example, was first coined by medieval chroniclers, but went on to become much more than a simple phrase, developing into the label for the myth mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In memory of the community a famous distant past event may become linked with a number of other famous events stretching across many centuries. Rather than only two events (such as the Algerian war and the Holocaust) being associated in any instance as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698011426358">Rothberg (2009)</xref>, we can speak here of truly multi-directional memory because a string of events will be associated, traversing temporal and national boundaries. This is seen in the newspaper corpus. In various mentions of the most well-known dates, events that have had the most impact, what everyone knows, or what should be taught at school, the Conquest is linked to a string of other famous past events, whether they are events in British, European, Franco-British or world history. As one journalist says: ‘Big Dates are how we organise the passing of time in our minds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011426358">Barnes, 2008</xref>). What the famous dates listed in newspaper articles tend to have in common is that the events involve conflict: a (threat of) invasion of Britain, a famous battle (usually a victory for Britain), a war, or a violent revolution, thus displaying the significance of trauma for memory. At a lower level of violence, sporting victories are remembered, and the gentle revolution in 1688. Here are two series of dates listed together in different articles in the newspapers:
<disp-quote>
<p>AD43, 1066, 1789, 1815, 1914–18, 1939–45 [Roman invasion, Norman Conquest, French Revolution, Battle of Waterloo, First World War, Second World War]</p>
<p>55BC, 1066, 1588, 1805, 1940 [(threats of) invasion: Julius Caesar, Norman Conquest, Spanish Armada, Napoleonic threat, Hitler’s threat]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sometimes the Conquest is linked with just one other date:
<disp-quote>
<p>1066, 1314 [Norman Conquest, the Battle of Bannockburn]</p>
<p>1066, 1688 [invasions by two Williams]</p>
<p>1066, 1966 [Norman Conquest, English world cup football victory, which has a similar date]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other lists the Norman Conquest is grouped with Anglo-French and Franco-British conflicts. In both the following cases, the context is a sports article (in <italic>The Times</italic>, and the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic>) that contains a humorous calculation of which nation has been victorious overall:
<disp-quote>
<p>1066, 1346 [Crécy], 1415 [Agincourt], 1805 [Trafalgar], 1963 [de Gaulle’s veto]</p>
<p>1066, 1415 [Agincourt], 1793 [Toulon], 1798 [Nile], 1815 [Waterloo]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lists of the sort given above show the importance in community memory of specific major people, events and dates, shining like beacons through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011426358">Cubitt, 2007</xref>: 215). Linked famous dates, events and people may encompass different affective valences for different items, and the choice of grouping in a specific case and context influences the interpretation and affective import of particular items. In one newspaper, for example, 1066 is cited alongside Shakespeare (as touchstones of British identity), which must surely give a positive glow to the former item. With regard to events, the major historical items come to be known by a wide public, and in this process other historical times, and precisely the period immediately preceding and following the big event may be overshadowed, if not generally ignored. Thus, although the linking of major events creates a kind of memorial continuity across time, the famous dates are isolated from their immediately surrounding history, and discontinuity is created.</p>
<p>In distant memory of an important event for a nation’s history and development, the event may become a symbol. The Norman Conquest has become the symbol for the last invasion and military conquest of Britain. Items associated with the Conquest take on a similar symbolic status: the date 1066 and the Battle of Hastings. The Conquest could not take on this role in recent memory, because a long span of time was necessary in order to compare the Conquest with historical situations and events of the following centuries, and thus to draw conclusions on its significance. As a famous symbolic event the Conquest also has the role of a temporal reference, and a foundation point. As we have seen, distant memory comprises a series of focal points, memory of famous events and dates across the centuries, and myths may grow up about such events. The series of iconic and symbolic events and myths become a core part of cultural knowledge of the community, such that distant memory plays an important role in its identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750698011426358">
<title>Intercultural relations</title>
<p>I have traced the distinctive characteristics of memory of a famous distant event. I would now like to address the question of the significance of distant memory for the present with regard to intercultural relations. Let us start with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011426358">Jan Assmann’s (1995</xref>: 126) definition of cultural memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cultural memory, a collective concept for all knowledge that directs behaviour and experience in the interactive framework of a society and one that obtains through generations in repeated societal practice and initiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this definition Assmann is talking about distant memory, and he states that this memory ‘directs behaviour and experience’ in the present. Assmann is more specifically referring to established traditions, but it can be considered that all distant memory can potentially have some influence on current perceptions and behaviour.</p>
<p>Memory can be a powerful force in intercultural relations. It can be a force that fires ethnic conflict. In the context of Israeli defensive and offensive military actions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698011426358">Dirk Moses (2010)</xref> has referred to the ‘terror of history’, the way memory ‘terrorizes’ a people and impacts on their behaviour. In the case of Israel, memory of past suffering and fear could explain hypervigilance, ethnocentric regression and paranoid reactions in the present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011426358">Hage (2003)</xref> endeavours to understand Palestinian suicide bombers, and finds that the most important element is the chronic violation and disadvantaging of Palestinians in the unusually suffocating nature of Israeli colonialism. He attributes this Israeli behaviour to the search for ‘zero vulnerability’, a political path that is shaped by the sense of insecurity that many Israeli Jews have acquired through their deep internalization, their memory of centuries of anti-Semitism and 50 odd years of Arab enmity with the result that for Israelis any hint of independent Palestinian political will is considered a threat.</p>
<p>There are many other situations around the world where memory has played an incitative or otherwise negative role in intercultural relations and conflicts. The memory may be of a distant event, a recent event, or a combination as in the Israeli Jewish case. Close to the context and concerns of this study are the communities of Commonwealth migrants to Britain. When the first Indians and Pakistanis arrived in Britain in the 1950s as a cheap labour force on the lowest rungs in the employment hierarchy, the view of people in Britain was profoundly influenced by beliefs and stereotypes acquired and disseminated during the past colonial experience, the underlying theme of which was the inferiority and servility of ‘native’ populations. By the early 1970s the immigrants had not assimilated; it became clear that they would cling to memory of their lands of origin as expressed in traditions including clothes, food, and religious beliefs and practices. Residential and social segregation have continued despite economic success in a number of cases. From the 1980s there have been periodic uprisings of British Asian communities sparked by unemployment, poverty, distrust of the police, racism including racial violence, and taunting by far-right groups such as the British National Party (BNP). In addition to these factors the years after 2000 brought Muslim extremist terrorist attacks on the world scene and in Britain: it was all too easy then to treat any young British Muslim man as a potential suspect. The government introduced a raft of restrictive measures of increased surveillance, raids and deportation, recalling measures adopted by the colonial state to discipline ‘native’ populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011426358">Ali et al., 2006</xref>). One could argue that various layers of memory of more recent postcolonial events have reinforced the original founding memory of the colonial intercultural encounter.</p>
<p>In the discussion above memory has been shown to play a strong and generally negative role with regard to intercultural relations. As for myths, they may be harmless, but in some cases myths contain prejudices and misunderstandings about others that feed into intolerance. A potential drawback of the two myth schemas of the Norman Conquest set out earlier is types of relation between peoples embodied in the myths – relations of subsumption, exclusion and opposition – which are not conducive to promoting healthy intra-national and international contacts. Let us start with the constructs of Saxonism and Britishness. Saxonism (an interest in and promotion of Anglo-Saxon culture), when taken to the extreme, may lead to racism: the radical pro-Anglo-Saxon association RAW seems to espouse racist premises. As for Britishness, this construct may not give full recognition to regional identities, and also tends to subsume regional differences under the dominant element of Englishness. It is clear that the national UK newspapers that comprise the corpus in this study promote the notion of Britishness, but at the same time their real concern as London papers is with one part of Britain. The result is that often ‘British’ becomes a synonym for ‘English’. Equally problematic is the tendency to mask the myriad and diverse cultural community and other sub-group specificities under the one term ‘British’ as if there is always a unified point of view.</p>
<p>The survey indeed indicates some regional and community variation in responses regarding the Norman Conquest. Here are some of the results for the following two questions: (1) How important do you think the Norman Conquest of England is in British history? (2) Is your attitude positive or negative towards the Norman Conquest of England in 1066? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1750698011426358">Table 1</xref> shows the percentage of each group that responded that the Norman Conquest is an important event, and the percentage of each group that reported a positive attitude towards the Conquest.</p>

<p>Care needs to be taken regarding the representativeness of statistics in that we are dealing with small numbers of respondents in some cases. The table indicates that greater importance is accorded to the Conquest by the English than by other groups. With regard to attitudes, a noticeably lower level of positive attitudes is found in the Scottish and Irish groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1750698011426358">9</xref></sup> These differences indicate variable conceptual and emotional engagements in different regional and community group memories. However, there are fairly high figures in all groups regarding importance of the event, which supports the notion that the Conquest figures in memory across Britain in different cultural and regional groups. The Norman Conquest was a traumatic event that took place initially in England, and subsequently the Normans had an impact in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. This wide impact of the Normans coupled with a certain blurring of the entities of England and Britain (England either being viewed as the core of Britain, gathering the other regions to it, or as imperialistic), mean that the Norman Conquest has come to signify a founding British event. However, its memory and positiveness towards it weaken in non-English parts of the Union.</p>
<p>Returning to the myth schemas, negative attitudes are attached to the foreign outsiders. Furthermore, the myth schemas do not recognize the role of the foreign in British history and culture, because either the foreign is excluded or it is subsumed immediately under Britishness. This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011426358">Bates’s (2004[1989]</xref>: 13) impression with particular reference to the Norman Conquest and history of the Middle Ages that the English downplay the contribution of foreign peoples and countries to English history and tend to perceive England as the ‘centre of the universe’. Bates considers that England and Britain need to look outside the British Isles for a major component of their heritage. From this perspective what is needed is greater consciousness of the process by which the irreducibly foreign brings cultural enrichment before eventually being assimilated or integrated into British society. The issue does not only concern attitudes towards history, but attitudes towards the foreign elements in British society today insofar as our schemas link the past and the present. Cognitive schemas that do not recognize the value and contribution of the foreign may inform behaviour that contributes to unequal power relations in contemporary society whereby foreigners and immigrants are maintained as disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The myth schemas and their implications seem to fit with a certain right-wing ideology, insofar as they can be interpreted as embodying distaste concerning foreigners (schema 1; see above) and the imposition of Britishness rather than an embracing of otherness (schema 2). The first part of Schema 2 can be interpreted as allowing a welcome attitude to others, and fits better with left-wing sentiments. Certainly in its overt discourse, the left-wing newspaper, the <italic>Guardian</italic>, promotes respect of the foreign and advocates multiculturalism. At times the Norman Conquest is interpreted and used very differently depending on political affiliations. With regard to immigration policy in Britain, for example, on the political left references in newspapers to the Conquest are used to point out that Britain has always been a land of immigrants, and has been enriched and constituted as such. On the political right it is cautioned that Britain has to be careful not to lose control of immigration, in the way that it lost control in 1066! However, it would seem that a certain Briticization of the Norman Conquest is part of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011426358">Fowler (1991</xref>: 124) calls the consensual background of beliefs and paradigms in society. This Briticization is common to all the newspapers because they universally consider the Conquest to be a part of British history and a British event. What occurs, therefore, in some of the <italic>Guardian</italic> articles (Ned Temko, 14 August 2005; 7 June 2007) is that the paper says one thing but in a subtle manner implies the opposite: the explicit foreground discussion concerns the importance of immigrants to Britain, but the Conquest is mentioned as a significant British date, and by implication is a purely British affair. Rivalry with the French seems also to constitute part of the consensual background in British society, and this paradigm is expressed explicitly in the <italic>Guardian</italic> as well as in other papers.</p>
<p>In her discussion of 19th-century Saxonism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011426358">Simmons (1990</xref>: 193, 199) considers that Saxonism came to embrace all the British including the Normans who had become British. The British imperialist mentality of the time stressed the superiority of the ‘Anglo-Saxon race’, on some accounts strengthened by its encounter with the assimilated Normans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698011426358">Nünning, 2003</xref>: 39). Simmons proposes that ‘new Normans’ and the negative attitudes attached to them were found elsewhere, notably in the contemporary French. The present study gives support to this idea. Moreover, from early on the Normans have been associated with the French in a negative light. Over the centuries there are numerous instances when the British bring up the Norman Conquest at stressful moments in Franco-British relations.</p>
<p>In the early nineteenth century, for example, Napoleon accused Britain of unprincipled extension of her commercial empire, and prepared for invasion of England. In 1803 Wordsworth composed a patriotic appeal in the sonnet ‘To the Men of Kent’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Vanguard of Liberty, ye Men of Kent,</p>
<p>Ye Children of a Soil that doth advance</p>
<p>Its haughty brow against the coast of France,</p>
<p>Now is the time to prove your hardiment!</p>
<p>To France be words of invitation sent!</p>
<p>They from their fields can see the countenance</p>
<p>Of your fierce war, may ken the glittering lance,</p>
<p>And hear you shouting forth your brave intent.</p>
<p>Left single, in bold parley, Ye of yore,</p>
<p>Did from <italic>the Norman</italic> win a gallant wreath;</p>
<p>Confirmed the charters that were yours before;-</p>
<p>No parleying now! In Britain is one breath;</p>
<p>We are all with you now from Shore to Shore:-</p>
<p>Ye Men of Kent, ’tis Victory or Death!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1750698011426358">10</xref></sup></p>
<attrib>(my emphasis)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The men of Kent were no doubt those most directly threatened by an invasion. The reference to the men of Kent’s relations to the Norman conquerors refers to the fact that Kent enjoyed a degree of independence from the Norman kings, retaining its own liberties and customs. William Lambarde recounts that these privileges were retained as a result of the Kentish hard bargaining with Duke William (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011426358">Barber, 2004</xref>: 9). An analogy is made therefore between the particular resistance of the men of Kent towards the Normans as it must now be towards the French.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750698011426358">Figure 1</xref> shows a more recent and entertaining embodiment of equating the Normans with the French in a negative light. It is a cartoon based on a pastiche of the Bayeux Tapestry by Nicholas Garland that was published in the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> in October 1984. The cartoon depicts a warming in the relationship between French President François Mitterand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a state visit of the French President to Britain. There had indeed been a move towards greater European and Franco-British cooperation: earlier in the year the budget dispute regarding Britain’s contribution to the European Community had been settled, and Mitterand and Thatcher were now in discussions regarding the Channel Tunnel.</p>

<p>The Bayeux Tapestry is often subjected to revisiting because of its distinctiveness and fame. This particular cartoon draws a parallel between William the Conqueror on horseback and President Mitterand, and between Harold Godwinson and Margaret Thatcher on foot as were the English at the Battle of Hastings. Legend has it that Harold was shot in the eye, but Maggie is shot in the heart by a cupid with an arrow bearing the words ‘Entente Cordiale’, a reference to the 1904 agreement between France and Britain regarding overseas territories. The tone is humorous but also critical. The Latin is quite funny, particularly the near-rhyming ‘Hic est Mitt’; Maggie is also amusing skipping around in a coat of mail. However, the message is clearly negative: the arrow of friendship (Cupid’s) can be fatal (Harold’s). The cartoonist thus displays the newspaper’s opposition to rapprochement with France and Europe.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011426358">Simmons (1990</xref>: 202) suggests further that another candidate for ‘Normans’ in recent times may be foreigners and immigrants resident in the United Kingdom today. The notion of superiority of the Anglo-Saxon/Teutons would continue today in right-wing political parties such as the British National Party (BNP). Contemporary foreigners as ‘Normans’ seems to be a difficult idea to support with concrete discursive examples. Nevertheless, an examination of the BNP 2010 election manifesto provides interesting insights and resonances. The manifesto expresses a great apprehension that long-term inhabitants of Britain will be (and are already being) invaded, colonized, dispossessed and disempowered by foreigners. We see here a parallel with the Norman invasion. Some of the ideas and language used in the manifesto are extraordinarily reminiscent of aspects of the Norman Conquest and early chronicles which recounted it. Here are some passages from the manifesto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">British National Party, 2010</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>It is our task to ensure that we do not become a dispossessed minority in our own homeland. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">2010</xref>: 19)</p>
<p>The white working class has been abandoned, replaced, and displaced by a new ethnic electoral power base. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">2010</xref>: 22)</p>
<p>We must safeguard the existence of the native peoples of these islands and ensure they are the dominant ethnic, cultural and political group. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">2010</xref>: 22)</p>
<p>[In comparison, as a result of the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon land-owners and ruling class were dispossessed of their land and power; many were killed or exiled by the Normans]</p>
<p>Britain has become a land where foreigners come first. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">2010</xref>: 36) [Compare the early 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury’s ‘England has become a dwelling-place of foreigners and a playground for lords of alien blood [the Normans]’ 1986: 415]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The particular target of fear and dislike of the BNP is Muslims and the prospective ‘Islamic colonisation of Britain’. Just as castles and cathedrals were the overt signs of Norman dominance in Britain, mosques and minarets are said to proclaim Muslim power:
<disp-quote>
<p>A BNP government would outlaw all overt signs of Islamic colonisation such as the burka, ritual slaughter, mosques and minarets (which are little more than symbols of <italic>territorial conquest</italic>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011426358">British National Party, 2010</xref>: 34; my emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>‘Freedom’ is another BNP theme, meaning upholding civil liberties, and independence from the European Union. The call for freedom and restoring rights recalls the Saxonist appeals to a lost golden age, and the calls for freedom in the Robin Hood films.</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011426358">Nigel Copsey (2004)</xref> writes the history of the BNP, he certainly doesn’t go back as far as the Norman Conquest; he goes back to 1930s fascism. But this cut-off point is simply a matter of convenience. A broader study could trace political history further back and discover a whole range of parallels and potential influences from the near and distant past on the ideology of the party. One can envisage the memory of various ideas and emotions converging across history to form the multi-directional memoryscape of the BNP. As for actual support of BNP ideas, Copsey says that racism, albeit articulated through socially accepted forms of intolerance, has provided the party with a reservoir of support; in the year 2000 the British Social Attitudes Survey found that a quarter of Britons admit to being either ‘very racist’ (2%) or ‘a little racist’ (23%), and two thirds think that there are too many immigrants in Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011426358">Copsey, 2004</xref>: 146). Could such attitudes be related to the fear of invasion and that distant memory of traumatic conquest and domination? Again, it seems likely that this ancient memory may be one small influence, even if not consciously known or acknowledged, which converges with a myriad of other influences from the past and present to impact on people’s attitudes today.</p>
<p>Two survey questions were designed to investigate the potential impact of a negative attitude towards the Norman Conquest on inter- and intra-national relations with regard to the United Kingdom today. Only respondents who had previously said that they had a negative attitude towards the Norman Conquest were directed to respond to these two questions in the survey. The first question asked to what extent respondents agreed with the following statement: ‘My negative attitude towards the Norman Conquest contributes to me having negative feelings towards the French today.’ Twenty-five percent of those who responded agreed with the statement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1750698011426358">11</xref></sup> The second question asked about the extent of agreement with the following: ‘My negative attitude towards the Norman Conquest contributes to me having negative feelings towards the presence of foreigners in the United Kingdom today.’ Nineteen percent of respondents agreed with this statement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1750698011426358">12</xref></sup> According to the survey figures, the influence of a negative attitude towards the Norman Conquest is a marginal phenomenon because the number of those who have a negative attitude towards the Conquest is low. Following the survey results only 1.642 percent of the adult UK population recognizes that their negative attitude to the Conquest contributes to a negative attitude towards the French today, and 1.251 percent of the UK population recognizes that their negative attitude to the Conquest contributes to their negative attitude to the presence of foreigners in the UK today.</p>
<p>However, an important issue needs to be taken into account. It is the issue of a questionnaire requiring explicit formulation of ideas in questions, and requiring answers by people who are consciously aware of the issues. Memory of distant historical events is a much more diffuse and nebulous realm than a questionnaire can capture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1750698011426358">13</xref></sup> I propose that it is the multi-directionality of distant memory that allows memory of the Conquest, without being explicitly known by individuals, to amalgamate with other memories of near invasion and threat of invasion (such as the Armada, Napoleon, the Second World War) and with memories of past wars and conflicts, notably with the French, and in particular, victories against potential invaders. Evidence for this kind of amalgamation is seen in lists and associations of dates given in the newspapers (see previous section). Overall, this group of memories expresses fear, suspicion or aggression towards and victory over the foreign. This amalgamated memory contributes to a general resistance towards the Other, which can be seen in the negative attitudes towards immigration and fairly high figures for racism given earlier from the year 2000 British Social Attitudes Survey. Although my survey figures are low, I suggest that they do provide some evidence of a negative attitude towards the distant past event under study having an impact on international and intra-national relations today. The combined impact of a group of other memories grafted onto the memory of the Conquest will be stronger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1750698011426358">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking up again our myths of the Norman Conquest, their drawbacks of exclusion and subsumption involving types of relation between people may well be because of conceptual simplification that leads to the espousal of stereotypes and black and white thinking. We have also mentioned that the myths are based on historical inaccuracies stemming from anachronism and historical simplification. One could take the attitude that it is normal, part of the characteristics of lay public and private representation and memory that they contain over-simplifications, stereotypes, anachronisms, minor inaccuracies and myths. Accordingly, because these are expected characteristics of genres such as informal conversations and newspapers, such genres should not be held to the same standards as historical treatises. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011426358">Burke (1989)</xref> does not agree with this approach. What Burke considers to be a key role of the historian is to signal discrepancies between written records and current myths. Historians and cultural researchers should point out the nature of myths that inform discourse so that people may become more wary of facile stereotypes and simplifications, and more attuned to cultural subtleties. However, it is unlikely that the kind of simplification and stereotypes signalled by Burke can be abandoned, because it is impossible for humans to be specialists in all areas of knowledge, and simplification will necessarily involve some degree of inaccuracy judged from the perspective of specialists. On the other hand, some stereotypical notions may be more constructive than others in terms of the type of relations between people that they embody and promote.</p>
<p>There are, for example, more constructive narratives than those based on exclusion and subsumption. We have already pointed out the ‘welcoming of others narrative’ that is present in our myths. This inclusive myth in which both Saxons and Normans are British points to the idea that many different peoples can happily become British, even if the start is rocky. Although it is a delicate matter to achieve the fine balance of inclusion in a broad group entity at the same time as respect for cultural differences within the group, an optimistic interpretation of the myth indicates that this is possible.</p>
<p>Another example of a constructive stereotypical narrative that involves the Conquest is found in the inscription on the monument for the Second World War soldiers missing in action at the British war cemetery in Bayeux, Normandy. The inscription in Latin and in English translation reads as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Nos a Gulielmo victi victoris patriam liberavimus</italic></p>
<p>[We who were conquered by William have liberated the homeland of the conqueror]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Once again we find the confusions of our myths: the British (soldiers) at the time of the Second World War are equated with the pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxons in the word ‘we’; and Normandy at the time of the Conquest is equated with modern-day France. The inscription thus embodies the oppositional narrative of ‘us’ and ‘them’ based on historical confusions. Yet rising above this is another stereotypical narrative that this time is conducive to international cooperation: old enemies can become friends and allies. This kind of message with specific reference to the Norman Conquest is found in friendly political speeches by French and British politicians and dignitaries, and neutral and positive attitudes towards the Conquest and the French are also expressed in newspapers. Memory of the Norman Conquest can therefore be mobilized in promoting positive and harmonious international relations.</p>
<p>The Bayeux cemetery inscription illustrates an issue mentioned earlier: the impact on affect of the memorial company an item keeps. Newspaper data show that when the date of the Battle of Hastings is grouped with other important historical dates affect often has negative elements (fear, aggression, etc.); but when important events are spelled out and listed together with the Conquest, some of them bear a definite positive valence. Examples of such events are: Magna Carta, the Great Reform Act and the abolition of slavery. In other words, the Norman Conquest is often amalgamated with a mixed bag of memory of violent events and events marking social progress. The ‘mixed bag’ has a neutralizing or positivizing effect as concerns affect. In the Bayeux inscription the combination of the Conquest with the Second World War liberation has a positivizing effect.</p>
<p>It is important to consider on a general level that we do not have to be prisoners of negative memory. Memory of ethnic friction and conflict may be powerful, because it is part of the memory that bonds a community and creates its identity. However, even what seem to be intractable conflicts that are fired by the memory of centuries of bitter relations can be resolved. It is possible to escape cycles of victimization and vengeance. Salient examples here are the establishment of peaceful Franco-British relations from the early 20th century, and the foundation of the European Union by former war enemies. The negative force of memory from conflict situations can be overcome by various means depending on the case: acknowledgement of the other’s narratives, recognition of one’s wrongs, reparation, punishment for crimes against humanity, construction of new reconciliatory narratives, recognition of some longer-term positive effects of a violent event, rituals of remembrance, and forgiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698011426358">Cairns and Roe, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to our particular area of interest, distant memory, it is characteristics of distant memory that allow the Bayeux cemetery inscription (and comparable representations) to be produced and to be effective. Proliferating narrative multiplicity and continual remediation allow a new and unexpected combination of ideas to be brought together in a specific context; multi-directionality brings together memory of events from quite different eras and places; affective mobility allows negative attitudes associated with the Conquest to be neutralized; and foundational cultural and symbolic significance of the memory of famous distant (and less distant) events makes the inscription striking and memorable.</p>
<p>Let us finish by giving some answers to the question that heads this article: Does memory of the distant past matter? With regard to a significant event in the long past history of a country, memory of such an event may be surprisingly alive. It is kept alive by multiple mentions, reiteration and re-use in different genres, media and contexts. Often re-use involves myths, conceptions about the past that are not entirely historically accurate, but that serve present purposes. The study shows that most people in Britain have heard of the Norman Conquest and think it is an important event, even if their knowledge is very basic. The Conquest is one item among commonly recognized historical events, and it is knowledge of a series of famous historical events from the nation’s past that plays an important role in constituting conceptions of national identity. The contemporary myths of the Norman Conquest adduced in the study involve notions of ethnicity and also affective stances (negative, neutral and positive attitudes). Affectivity is a vital element in intercultural relations. But memory and affectivity regarding a single famous event of the distant past are not isolated: multi-directional linking of memories is an important characteristic of distant memory. Memory and myths of the Norman Conquest are linked to other memories and myths, and affect is thus reinforced in a multi-directional cumulative form with a potential for impact on intercultural relations. Aggression and fear associated with a whole range of memories of (attempted) invasions and conflicts starting with the Norman Conquest may contribute to the inflammability of Franco-British relations today, and to negative attitudes towards foreigners in Britain. On the other hand, another of the characteristics of distant memory is its affective mobility. Whereas very early memory of the Norman Conquest was almost entirely negative from the point of view of the English, as a result of subsequent assimilation of the Normans and of affective mobility, distant memory reflects a greater affective range, and memory of the Conquest can also be mobilized in affectively neutral and positive contexts. It can contribute in this way to a positive outlook on international and intra-national relations with an emphasis on cooperation and cultural enrichment. In sum, from the BNP manifesto to the Second World War British war cemetery in Bayeux, the study shows that memory of the distant past matters today, in profound and sometimes surprising ways.</p>

<p>In this article I adopt the popular usage of ‘British’ and ‘Britain’ as being synonymous with the United Kingdom (UK).</p>

<p>The 10 newspapers represent different types of newspaper and varied political affiliation. <italic>Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, Guardian, Independent</italic>, and <italic>The Times</italic> are categorized as serious or quality press. <italic>Daily Express</italic> and <italic>Daily Mail</italic> are considered mid-market, and <italic>Daily Mirror, Daily Star</italic> and <italic>Sun</italic> are tabloids. With regard to political allegiance the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> is strongly conservative; the <italic>Financial Times</italic> is slightly to the right because of its emphasis on entrepreneurship; the <italic>Guardian</italic> is clearly left-of-centre; the <italic>Independent</italic> leans slightly to the left; <italic>The Times</italic> tends to be conservative; the <italic>Daily Express</italic> is right-of-centre; the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> is highly conservative; the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> is left-wing; and the <italic>Daily Star</italic> and the <italic>Sun</italic> are right-wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011426358">British Newspapers Online, n.d.</xref>). Online versions of newspapers were used.</p>

<p>The survey was administered by the professional survey company Yougov Plc. The survey figures cited in this article are from Yougov Plc. Total sample size was 2179 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 20 and 22 September 2010. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults (aged 18+).</p>

<p>There are many sources of memory of the Norman Conquest. The larger study has not been able to take full account of all of these, in particular novels. Styles of sources are also various, notably the humorous such as Sellar and Yeatman’s famous book <italic>1066 and All That</italic> (1930) and Mariott Edgar’s comic monologue ‘The Battle of Hastings’ (1933).</p>
</fn>

<p>Here is the survey question: ‘Before today, were you aware that some historians think that Harold travelled to Normandy prior to 1066 and swore an oath that he would support Duke William of Normandy as the next king of England?’</p>

<p>I use the term ‘schema’ with the double meaning signalled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698011426358">Fairclough (1989)</xref>. In the first instance the schemas are patterns adduced from discourse by the analyst using his or her ‘member’s resources’ (shared representations in long-term memory), and they are also hypothesized to be internalized cognitive templates drawn on unselfconsciously by participants in discourse and other activities in the community.</p>

<p>In an initial question at the start of the survey questionnaire respondents were asked to say which category best described their identity: English British, Scottish British, Welsh British, Irish British, Other British (e.g. Pakistani British, Afro-Caribbean British, Indian British) and Non-British. ‘Unweighted base’ refers to the actual number of respondents. The responding sample was then weighted to the profile of the sample definition (all UK adults), using Census data, to provide a representative reporting sample.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-1750698011426358">

<p>The differences between Scottish and Irish British as compared with English British figures are statistically significant for a 95 percent confidence level.</p>

<p>Another issue, which concerns the survey questions about the French and foreigners, is that of social desirability: currently in British society there is social pressure not to admit negative attitudes towards other groups of people.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011426358">Simmons’s (1990)</xref> idea that the French and foreigners have actually replaced the Normans in people’s imaginary could not be tested in a survey, because it is something that is unlikely to be consciously known.</p>
