<abstract>
<p>Cruciate ligament injuries are common and may lead to dysfunction if not rehabilitated. Understanding how to progress anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament loading, early after injury or reconstruction, helps clinicians prescribe rehabilitation exercises in a safe manner to enhance recovery. Commonly prescribed therapeutic exercises include both weight-bearing exercise and non-weight-bearing exercise. This review was written to summarize and provide an update on the available literature on cruciate ligament loading during commonly used therapeutic exercises. In general, weight-bearing exercise produces smaller loads on the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament compared with non-weight-bearing exercise. The anterior cruciate ligament is loaded less at higher knee angles (i.e. 50–100°). Squatting and lunging with a more forward trunk tilt and moving the resistance pad proximally on the leg during the seated knee extension unloads the anterior cruciate ligament. The posterior cruciate ligament is less loaded at lower knee angles (i.e. 0–50°), and may be progressed from level ground walking to a one-leg squat, lunges, wall squat, leg press, and the two-leg squat (from smallest to greatest). Exercise type and technique variation affect cruciate ligament loading, such that the clinician may prescribe therapeutic exercises to progress ligament loading safely, while ensuring optimal recovery of the musculoskeletal system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cruciate ligament injuries are common. After sustaining an injury to the cruciate ligaments, or after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, it is important to properly rehabilitate the tibiofemoral joint to ensure optimal recovery of the healing tissues, keep the joint healthy, and to prevent lower extremity muscle atrophy. Understanding cruciate ligament loading during commonly prescribed rehabilitation exercises helps the clinician maximize treatment efficacy and minimize the likelihood of injury.</p>
<p>The scientific literature on cruciate ligament loading has not been recently reviewed and summarized to give the clinician a current understanding of how ligament loading is quantified, or to give an updated understanding of loading across a wider range of exercises than previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451839">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912451839">13</xref></sup> Rehabilitation exercises commonly used include both weight-bearing exercises (WBE), also referred to as closed kinetic chain exercises, and non-weight-bearing exercises (NWBE), also referred to as open kinetic chain exercises. The specific exercises included in this review include squatting, lunging, stepping (e.g. stepping up and down stairs), leg press, seated knee extension and knee flexion, stair climbing, stationary bicycling, drop landing, and walking (samples of squatting and lunging exercises are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912451839">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912451839">2</xref>). These exercises were chosen because using these exercises as part of a cruciate ligament rehabilitation program after cruciate ligament injury or reconstruction has been shown to significantly improve short- and long-term knee function and enhance a successful return to sport or activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912451839">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912451839">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Techniques commonly used to measure cruciate ligament biomechanics</title>
<p>Both <italic>in-vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451839">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912451839">7</xref></sup> and experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912451839">13</xref></sup> biomechanical models have been developed to evaluate ACL strain or tensile force during WBE and NWBE, and both these approaches have advantages and limitations. The obvious advantage of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies is that they calculate ACL strain directly by using strain sensors within the ACL. The subjects in these <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were patients that had strain sensors implanted within the anteromedial bundle of their healthy ACL during arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged knee structures (partial meniscectomy; capsule, and patellofemoral joint debridement). Immediately after surgery, these patients were asked to perform a variety of NWBE and WBE, including lunging, squatting, leg press, step-up and step-down, stair climbing, bicycling, and seated knee extension and knee flexion. The strain within the anteromedial bundle of the ACL was measured and referenced to an instrumented Lachman Test with 150 N of resistance.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to measuring ACL strain <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as, the procedure is invasive, time consuming, costly, performed in a patient population under surgical conditions, and that the types of activities are limited. Moreover, the exercise technique employed while these patients performed selected WBE was generally not controlled. For example, there are many ways to perform a squat that could affect muscle forces and cruciate ligament loading, such as, using narrow stance or a wide stance, turning the feet in or out, having a near vertical trunk position or tilting the trunk forward 30°–45° relative to vertical, and during the squat descent moving the knees forward beyond the toes or keeping the knees from moving forward beyond the toes. Another limitation to <italic>in vivo</italic> studies is that both athletes and non-athletes are employed in performing WBE, generally only body weight or light external resistance is employed during the exercises, and usually only selected knee flexion angles are chosen for ACL strain data collection. Therefore, the ability to generalize the results of ACL strain <italic>in vivo</italic> from studies during WBE to the active athletic population, which comprise the majority of ACL injuries and who often trains with moderate to heavy external resistance over a large knee range of motion, is limited and should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
<p>Experimental biomechanical knee models, which also have advantages and limitations, have been previously developed and described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912451839">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912451839">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912451839">21</xref></sup> The advantage of using experimental models is that the estimated loads are better generalized to the active athletic population because variables are often better controlled. For example, moderate to heavy resistance could be used during exercise using the experimental model, such is more consistent to how athletes train, but only body weight or light resistance could be used with the <italic>in vivo</italic> model, because the subjects are all patients that are just coming out of knee surgery. The obvious limitation of experimental biomechanical knee models is that they do not measure ACL loading directly, but only estimate its value. However, if the same experimental model is used for all the exercises, it still provides a good relative comparison (assuming that the models are physiologically realistic). Another limitation in using experimental biomechanical knee models is that these models were primarily limited to sagittal plane motion because squatting, lunging, and similar exercises are performed primarily in the sagittal plane with only minimal transverse plane rotary motions and frontal plane valgus/varus motions. However, performing these types of exercises with excessive transverse plane rotary motions and frontal plane valgus/varus motions could affect cruciate ligament loading, and this should be the focus of future studies. Further, most experimental models are constructed with the assumption that the cruciate ligaments are the only restraints to tibiofemoral shear forces, and do not account for other soft or hard tissues (meniscus, tibial slope, etc.) that likely play a role.</p>
<p>Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and experimental models have drawbacks, but there is evidence to suggest their validity because several <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments found similar results to studies using experimental models examining ACL loading. Studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451839">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912451839">7</xref></sup> reported peak ACL loading for squatting and lunging of approximately 2.8% to 4% (about 100–150 N) at knee flexion angles between 0° and 30°, corresponding to the peak ACL forces calculated from experimental models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912451839">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912451839">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912451839">21</xref></sup> for the same exercises. This example demonstrates that the magnitude of predicted forces from experimental models are in general agreement with <italic>in vivo</italic> direct measurement, thus providing some validity to the measurements and suggesting that the two measures may be very cautiously compared between and within techniques. There is another drawback related to the two models, in that the ultimate tensile force is not readily determined using live subjects, representing a potential disagreement between at maximal force levels between <italic>in vivo</italic> and experimental modeling studies. Finally, because <italic>in vivo</italic> studies only include subjects that have otherwise undergone surgery, the majority of studies use experimental models and, therefore, the majority of the work presented within this article is based upon experimental models.</p>

<title>Commonly used graft mechanical properties</title>
<p>Both autograft, which is tissue harvested from the patient undergoing surgery, and allograft, which is tissue harvested from a cadaver, are commonly used to reconstruct the cruciate ligaments in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912451839">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912451839">23</xref></sup> In healthy adults, the ultimate strength of the native ACL is approximately 2000 N,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912451839">24</xref></sup> and the reconstructed ACL has similar ultimate strengths compared with the healthy ACL, although these values can change considerably depending on graft type, donor’s age, and donor characteristics (e.g, autograft versus allograft, patellar tendon versus hamstrings graft, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912451839">25</xref></sup> However, the healing graft and graft site may be injured with considerably less force compared with the ultimate strength of the graft, especially when it involves soft tissue to bone fixation, such as the hamstrings graft. The graft must mature, and as the maturation process continues, the ultimate tensile properties of the graft increase in strength. Unfortunately it is not known how much force to the graft site is too much and how soon force can be applied to the healing tissues after reconstruction. However, concerns regarding the loading properties of the cruciate ligaments highlight the importance of biomechanical testing of the cruciate ligaments.</p>

<title>ACL loading during selected rehabilitation exercises</title>
<p>Both WBE and NWBE have been employed and shown to be effective in enhancing ACL rehabilitation and return to sport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912451839">26</xref></sup> However, it is believed by some clinicians that, compared with NWBE, individuals that perform predominately WBE in their rehabilitation tend to have less knee pain, more stable knees, are generally more satisfied with the end result, and return to their sport sooner than expected. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411912451839">3</xref> present ACL strain, ACL tensile force, and anterior shear force (the force on the tibia in the anterior direction that loads the ACL) data from selected articles in scientific literature, and each of these will now be summarized.</p>

<title>ACL strain</title>
<p>The ACL strains reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Table 1</xref> are from several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451839">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912451839"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451839"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839">6</xref></sup> performed during a variety of NWBE and WBE. Key points from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Table 1</xref> are as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-0954411912451839" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>It should be emphasized that peak ACL strain occurs at knee angles of less than 30°. Therefore, if the rehabilitation goal is to minimize ACL loading, such as during the early phases after ACL reconstruction surgery, training both NWBE and WBE at higher knee angles (i.e. 50°–100°) is recommended, compared with training these exercises at lower knee angles (i.e. 0°–50°). In addition, it should be emphasized that ACL loading from both NWBE and WBE at knee angles less than 60° are of relatively small strain magnitudes (typically less than 3.7% from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Table 1</xref>), which is similar to the ACL strain observed with a 150 N Lachman test, which produced 3.7% strain at a 30° knee flexion angle.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Peak ACL strain is typically greatest at around 10°–15° knee flexion, and gradually decreases between 15°–50° knee angle, and between approximately 50°–90° knee angles there is minimal or no ACL strain. For example, ACL strains during the isometric seated leg extension using a 30 Nm torque as resistance were 4.4% at 15° knee angle, 2% at 30° knee angle, and no ACL strain at 60° and 90° knee angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839">6</xref></sup> Moreover, when tested at 30°, 50°, and 70° knee angles, squatting, lunging and step-up and step-down exercises had the greatest ACL strain at 30° knee angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839">6</xref></sup> ACL strain at full knee extension (0°) has not been reported during exercise, but is assumed to be minimal owing to the knee being in a very stable closed pack position.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Peak ACL strain was not significantly different between squatting with or without 136 N of external resistance, or between stair climbing at slower versus faster rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451839">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451839">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912451839">30</xref></sup> It can be concluded from these WBE data that increasing resistance during the squat, or increasing the rate of stepping during stair climbing, may not increase ACL strain. This may have occurred because adding resistance or stepping faster may affect muscle recruitment patterns, such as recruiting the hamstrings to a greater extent (perhaps owing to changes in technique, such as a greater forward trunk tilt). Muscle force from the hamstrings helps unload the ACL owing to their posterior directed force on the leg. This finding, during the WBE (such as squatting and lunging), is different compared with the NWBE seated knee extension, in which ACL strain increased from 2.8% without external resistance to 3.8% with adding only 45 N (10 lbs) of external resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839">5</xref></sup> One possible explanation for this is that technique variations typically do not occur during the seated knee extension exercise (and the hamstrings are not recruited to unload the ACL), but techniques variations do occur during WBE, such as the squat and lunge.</p>

<p>Peak ACL strain was generally greater in the NWBE seated knee extension compared with most WBE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839">5</xref></sup> For example, performing a leg press type exercise with 40% bodyweight resistance, stair climbing, and forward lunging, all produced less ACL strain compared with performing a seated knee extension with no external resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451839">5</xref></sup> Interestingly, performing a NWBE seated knee extension with no external resistance (quadriceps activation only), produced the same amount of ACL strain compared with performing a WBE one leg sit-to-stand or stair climbing, with the WBE being much more challenging in recruiting important hip and thigh musculature (e.g. quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteals) that help stabilize the knee and protect the ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451839">6</xref></sup> Therefore, WBEs minimize ACL strain to a greater extent compared with the NWBE seated knee extension, and WBEs are more functional multi-joint, multi-muscle exercises that are effective in developing important hip and thigh musculature, such as the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and adductors and abductors.</p>

<p>ACL: anterior cruciate ligament.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>First, like the ACL strain data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Table 1</xref>, peak ACL tensile force is of relatively low magnitude (typically under 150 N for WBE, between approximately 150–350 N for the NWBE seated knee extension) compared with loading of the posterior cruciate ligament,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref></sup> and occurred at lower knee angles, typically between 15°–35°. The highest ACL tensile forces between NWBE and WBE occurred during maximal-effort isokinetic seated knee extension exercises, in which ACL tensile force was approximately 40% greater at a slower 60°/s speed, compared with faster 180°/s speed.</p>
<p>Rapid deceleration activities, such as one-leg landing from a jump, or running and cutting movements, have been shown to generate very high ACL loading and are often implicated in ACL injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912451839">31</xref></sup> For example, during a running plyometric-type exercise involving a single-leg landing and rapidly coming to a stop, high deceleration forces are produced that result in approximately 1300 N of ACL tensile force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912451839">31</xref></sup> This high ACL loading demonstrates that high explosive deceleration-type plyometric exercises should not be performed until the later stages of ACL rehabilitation, after the ACL graft has healed, revascularized, and strengthened adequately. In contrast, a two-leg drop jump from a 60 cm platform only resulted in approximately 250 N of ACL tensile force,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912451839">31</xref></sup> which is similar to the ACL loading that occurred during the NWBE seated knee extension. Therefore, lower-intensity plyometric exercises, such as the two-leg drop jump, should precede higher intensity plyometric exercises, such as the single-leg drop jump. The rate of deceleration should also be considered when performing plyometric exercises, as a higher rate of deceleration will result in greater ACL loading.</p>
<p>Second, squatting typically resulted in minimal or no ACL tensile force, and one-leg squatting producing slightly greater ACL loading compared with two-leg squatting. The minimal or absence of ACL loading during the squat is, in part, owing to the increased hamstrings activity and force generated during squatting. For example, peak hamstring activity during the barbell squat was approximately 50% of a maximum voluntary isometric contraction, which helps unload the ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref></sup> Moreover, peak hamstring force reported during the one-leg squat has been reported to be approximately 200 N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref></sup> The increased hamstring activity and force from one- and two-leg squatting was, in part, owing to a forward trunk tilt of approximately 30°–40° at maximum knee flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref></sup> Progressively increasing the forward trunk tilt during the squat tends to increase hamstring activity and decrease quadricep activity, both which result in ACL unloading at knee angles of less than 60°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912451839">32</xref></sup> Also, squatting with the heels off the ground, which typically results in increased forward knee movement beyond the toes, resulted in over three times the ACL loading compared with squatting with the heels on the ground. Like the squat, the absence of ACL loading during the forward and side lunge is, in part, owing to the relatively high hamstring force, peaking at approximately 150 N at knee angles of less than 30°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wall squat exercises may be a better choice compared with the one-leg squat early after ACL reconstruction because of greater ACL forces generated during the one-leg squat compared with the wall squat. However, because peak ACL force during the one leg squat was only approximately 60 N, it is not likely that the one leg squat will produce forces that would be injurious to the healing ACL graft, and mild strain to the graft may enhance the healing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912451839">33</xref></sup> During both the wall squat and one-leg squat, as well as other WBE such as the leg press and lunge, employing larger knee angles (i.e. 50°–100°) before progressing to smaller knee angles (i.e. 0°–50°) may be desirable during the early stages of ACL rehabilitation because ACL forces primarily occur at smaller knee angles of less than 50°.</p>
<p>The knees moving forward beyond the toes during squatting and lunging may also increase ACL loading, especially if excessive (approximately 8–10 cm or more).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839">12</xref></sup> ACL loading was significantly greater in the one-leg squat, in which the knees moved forward beyond the toes 10 ± 2 cm, and in the lunge using a short step, in which the knees moved forward beyond the toes 9 ± 2 cm, compared with a lunge with a long step and a wall squat exercise in which the knees did not move forward beyond the toes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451839">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451839">12</xref></sup> Moreover, squatting with a more erect trunk position at the lowest position of the squat compared with squatting with a 30°–40° forward trunk tilt position tends to cause more forward movement of the knees beyond the toes, as well as greater quadricep activation (which increases ACL tensile force at lower knee angles) and less hamstring activation (which results in less unloading of the ACL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451839">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, as the knee goes forward beyond the toes, the tibia plateau slopes anteriorly, resulting in an increase in ACL loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912451839">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912451839">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Forward trunk tilt may also affect ACL loading during the squat and forward lunge exercises. Squatting and lunging with increased forward trunk tilt, compared with a more erect trunk position, has been shown to increase hamstrings, which may decrease ACL loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451839">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912451839">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912451839">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912451839">35</xref></sup> For example, Ohkoshi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912451839">32</xref></sup> reported no ACL loading at all knee angles tested (15°, 30°, 60°, and 90°) while maintaining a squat position with trunk tilted forward from 0°–90°, with 30° or more forward trunk tilt optimal for recruiting relatively high hamstrings activity and minimizing ACL loading.</p>
<p>Technique variations during the NWBE seated knee extension also can affect ACL tensile force. For example, given a constant external knee torque applied to the leg, ACL force decreases when the resistance pad is moved up the leg more proximal to the knee compared with being more distal to the knee closer to the ankle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912451839">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912451839">17</xref></sup> From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912451839">Figure 3</xref>, when a constant external knee torque is applied to the leg at 30° knee angle, the ACL tensile force is approximately twice as great when the resistance pad is positioned near the ankle (approximately 400 N) compared with when it is placed near the middle of the leg (approximately 200 N). Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912451839">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates that ACL loading decreases progressively from 15° knee angle (approximately 500 N when the resistance pad is near the ankle and approximately 325 N when the resistance pad is placed near the middle of the leg) to 60° knee angle (approximately 100 N when the resistance pad is near the ankle and approximately 0 N when the resistance pad is positioned near the middle of the leg), with no ACL loading at knee angles greater than 60°. Nisell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912451839">34</xref></sup> reported a similar finding of less ACL loading with a more proximally position resistance pad on the leg during isokinetic seated knee extension at 30°/s and 180°/s. It can be concluded from these data that, when the goal is to minimize ACL loading while using the seated knee extension exercise, this exercise should be performed at higher knee angles (50°–100°) and with the resistance pad position more proximal on the leg compared with a more distal position. Moreover, it should be emphasized that if the ACL is torn, there is no ligament to restrain anterior tibial translation on the femur. Therefore, performing exercises that would normally load the ACL may cause anterior tibial translation, which may result in altered and possibly injurious tibiofemoral joint loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912451839">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912451839">37</xref></sup> Wilk and Andrews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912451839">38</xref></sup> have reported that ACL-deficient knees during isokinetic exercises tibial translation can be reduced by utilizing a proximal pad and performing higher angular velocities (e.g. 180 °/s and 300 °/s) compared with slower speeds (e.g. 60 °/s).</p>

<title>Peak anterior shear force</title>
<p>Peak anterior shear force during WBE and NWBE are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411912451839">Table 3</xref>. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411912451839">Table 3</xref>, it is interesting that level ground walking resulted in greater anterior shear force (ACL loading) compared with both NWBE and WBE. Compared with WBE, anterior shear forces were greater in the NWBE seated knee extension. Peak anterior shear forces occurred at knee angles of 50° or less. Moreover, from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912451839">Table 2</xref> peak ACL tensile force during level walking was approximately 300 N and occurred near opposite foot toe-off (approximately 15°–20° knee flexion). Therefore, peak ACL loading during level walking is similar to peak ACL loading during NWBE seated isokinetic and isometric knee extension exercises, and these ACL loading magnitudes are several times greater than the ACL tensile forces reported for the WBE.</p>

<p>First, in contrast to the peak, ACL loading at lower knee angles between approximately 0°–50° shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451839">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912451839">2</xref>, peak PCL loading occurs at higher knee angles between approximately 50°–100° (typically around 80°–90° knee angles). Thus, to control PCL loading, the rehabilitation process is the complete opposite of that of the ACL program. Therefore, if the rehabilitation goal is to minimize PCL loading, such as during the early phases after PCL reconstruction surgery, training both NWBE and WBE at lower knee angles (e.g. 0°–50°) would be recommended compared with training these exercises as higher knee angles (e.g. 50°–100°).</p>
<p>Second, peak PCL tensile force was generally greater in the NWBE seated knee flexion compared with WBE. For example, performing the NWBE seated isometric knee flexion at 90° knee angle produced greater PCL tensile force (3330 N) compared with all WBE. The NWBE seated isokinetic knee flexion at 60 °/s, 120 °/s, and 180 °/s, and the two-leg squat, produced the next highest PCL tensile force, ranging between approximately 1900°2700 N. PCL tensile forces were approximately 1700°1900 N during the leg press, approximately 750°800 N during the wall squat, approximately 650°750 N during the forward and side lunges, approximately 400 N during the one-leg squat, and approximately 160 N during level ground walking.</p>
<p>Comparing technique variations within exercises, performing the forward lunge while taking a long step forward, produces a significantly greater PCL tensile force compared with performing the forward lunge while taking a short step forward (the short step lunge causes the knees to move forward over the toes approximately 8 cm). Moreover, performing the forward lunge produced a significantly greater PCL tensile force compared with performing the side lunge, and performing the forward and side lunge while taking a normal length step (and then pushing back to the upright starting position) produced a significantly greater PCL tensile force compared with performing the forward and side lunge while keeping both feet stationary (and simply lunging up and down). Therefore, there are different progressions both within an exercise and between exercises that can be employed during PCL rehabilitation, and as a general rule NWBE and WBE should first begin with no external resistance and progress to increasing amounts of external resistance. Given the PCL loading shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954411912451839">Table 4</xref>, one example of exercise progression for lower to higher PCL loading may include performing NWBE and WBE initially between 0°–50° knee flexion and progressing to 50°–100° knee flexion. Exercises that may be appropriate early in rehabilitation might include seated knee extensions between 0°–50° knee flexion, level ground walking, one-leg squats with no resistance, and forward and side lunges with no resistance. Resistance can slowly be added to these exercises, and the leg press, squat, and seated knee flexion exercises can be added later, initially without resistance and progressing to resistance.</p>
<p>It is not well understood what PCL force magnitudes become injurious to the healthy or reconstructed PCL. In healthy adults, the ultimate strength of the PCL is approximately 4000 N,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912451839">40</xref></sup> although these values depend on age and anatomical factors. Therefore, the PCL loads generated during both NWBE and WBE appear to be well within a safe limit for the healthy PCL. The reconstructed PCL has similar ultimate strengths compared with the healthy PCL. However, the healing graft site may be injured with considerably less force compared with the ultimate strength of the graft, although it is not well understood how much force to the healing graft site is too much and how soon force can be applied after reconstruction. Therefore, the peak PCL forces that occur during NWBE and WBE may be problematic early after PCL reconstruction when the graft site is still healing, especially between 50°–100° of knee angles. It may be prudent to employ smaller knee angles (e.g. 0°–50°) before progressing to larger knee angles (e.g. 50°–100°) during NWBE and WBE, because PCL forces increase as knee angle increases.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>This review allows the clinician to select specific therapeutic exercises, broken down by weight bearing status, knee range of motion, and technique variations, to progress cruciate ligament loading over the course of rehabilitation safely while ensuring optimal recovery of the musculoskeletal system. In general, WBE produces smaller loads on the ACL and PCL compared with NWBE. For the ACL, performing seated knee extensions with resistance produces significantly greater ACL loading compared with most WBE. Further, peak ACL loading during level walking is similar to peak ACL loading during NWBE seated isokinetic and isometric knee extension exercises, and these ACL loading magnitudes are several times greater than the ACL tensile forces reported for the WBE. For the PCL, the highest loading occurred in the two-leg squat, followed by the leg press, wall squat, forward and side lunges, one-leg squat, and level ground walking. WBE has the benefit of being much more functional and challenging in terms of hip and thigh muscle recruitment compared with NWBE. Therefore, early after injury or reconstruction of the cruciate ligament the clinician should prescribe WBE rather than NWBE, and progress to NWBE as tolerated and to facilitate isolated muscle functional groups – such as the quadriceps.</p>
<p>Peak ACL loading occurs at knee angles of between 10°–15°, and progressively decreases between 15°–60° knee angles. Beyond 50°–60° knee angles there is minimal or no ACL loading. In contrast, PCL loading occurs at higher knee angles (i.e. 50°–100°), with peak PCL loading typically occurring around 80°–90° knee angles. These arc ranges of motion should serve as guidelines to limit the therapeutic exercise technique early on in the rehabilitation protocol.</p>
<p>Exercise technique variation should also be considered when prescribing a rehabilitation protocol. For ACL rehabilitation, anterior knee movement of 8 cm or more beyond the toes may also increase ACL loading during squatting, lunging, leg press, and other WBE. Moreover, squatting with the heels off the ground, which typically results in increased anterior knee movement beyond the toes, resulted in over three times the ACL loading compared with squatting with the heels on the ground. Squatting and lunging with a more forward trunk tilt tends to unload the ACL to a greater extent compared with squatting and lunging with a more erect trunk position. Moving the resistance pad up the leg proximally towards the knee when performing the seated knee extension, rather than being positioned closer to the ankle, decreases ACL loading. Rapid deceleration activities, such as one-leg landing from a jump, or running and cutting movements, have been shown to generate very high ACL loading and are often implicated in ACL injuries, so cautious progression is required. These higher intensity plyometric type exercises should be performed only during the later stages of ACL rehabilitation. When prescribing therapeutic exercise for the PCL, the forward lunge with a long step forward produced greater PCL loading compared with forward lunge with a short step forward. The forward lunge produced greater PCL loading compared with the side lunge, and lunging by taking a forward or sideways step and pushing back to the starting position produced greater PCL loading compared with lunging up and down with both feet stationary. The exercise guidelines provided in this review may be used by the clinician to progress a cruciate ligament injured individual to maximize the potential benefits and minimize the chance for injury.</p>
