<abstract>
<p>What does it mean to be a human being? This question takes on particular significance when it is brought into conversation with the history and lives of people with disabilities. For centuries, disabled people have been subjected to attitudes and practices that have served as tools of their dehumanization. In response, disability theologies such as those of Jean Vanier and Thomas Reynolds have sought to reconstruct alternative ways of speaking about what it means to be a human being that begin with the lives of people with disabilities and the quality of vulnerability. Drawing on Nancy Eiesland’s interpretation of the wounded Christ of the resurrection, this article argues that if what makes us human is our vulnerability, this understanding is only truly liberating and transformative when it is accompanied by a commitment to resisting the injustices and sins that threaten the lives of the most vulnerable in the first place.</p>

<body>
<p>Much of the literature that has developed concepts of woundedness and vulnerability in disability theologies has done so in relation to theological notions of ‘liberation’ and ‘personhood.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140013484428">1</xref></sup> It is out of the concrete experience of social, economic, political, and ecclesial discourses and practices of oppression and dehumanization of people with disabilities by an able-bodied majority that such theologies have emerged. These are proposed as alternative ways of working towards the creation of more just contexts in which the full humanity of all people with disabilities is affirmed and valued. This article explores the important relationship between the concepts of the woundedness of Christ and the vulnerability of human beings if such just contexts are to be realized. The argument is developed in three parts. First, it will explore something of the history of disabled people’s lived experiences of oppression and dehumanization—the results of the predominant responses of non-disabled people to the presence of people with disabilities in their midst—so as to consider why alternative ways of thinking are needed. Secondly, it will explore, and to some extent survey, the notions of the <italic>wounded Christ</italic> and <italic>human vulnerability</italic> as theological categories as they have been developed within literature referred to here as ‘disability theologies.’ Particular attention will be paid to three key voices: Nancy Eiesland, Jean Vanier, and Thomas Reynolds. And finally, this article will propose that the praxes of liberation discovered in the wounded Christ and the concept of human vulnerability must be understood as inextricably linked to one another if we are to create social and ecclesial spaces in which people with disabilities can be full participants and are valued just as they are.</p>

<title>What Do We Mean by ‘Disability’?</title>
<p>Prior to this main discussion, it is important to make some observations about the concept of disability. The language of ‘disability’ or ‘impairment’ and the people who are classified under such labels are a relatively recent construction. What we mean by disability today is thus not a universal and timeless category. In the rules about priesthood in the Torah, descendants of Levi were not permitted to perform priestly functions if they had a ‘blemish.’ Jewish scholar, Judith Abrams argues that a ‘blemish’ was understood as a physical, visible form of impairment that could be viewed by others. To be sure, in the text of Leviticus, all of the conditions listed that might be counted as a ‘blemish’ are what would today be referred to as <italic>physical impairments</italic> rather than certain sensory impairments or learning disabilities (see Lev 21:16–24). She explains that the reason for this was that ‘the priest … mediates between heaven and earth, between holy and profane. To survive in such a dangerous position, the priest had to be fit for the company of angels: blemishless, pure of lineage, and untouched by the taint of death.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140013484428">2</xref></sup> What mattered, and what affected the priestly duty, were what could be <italic>seen</italic> so that, it can be assumed, a condition like Deafness or a learning disability, which cannot be seen, would not have necessarily prevented a descendant of Levi from performing priestly duties or being fit for angelic company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140013484428">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biblical scholar, Carole Fontaine, in a survey of Old Testament texts, suggests that when men in battle were unable to wage war and defend the state, they were said to become like ‘women’ (Jer 51:30); thus, the disabled soldier and women were understood to be alike, categorized together, both of equally low value to the state in a time of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140013484428">4</xref></sup> Neither was of use or value to the state or society in the face of battle, Fontaine argues, and so both experienced similar forms of marginalization for their inability to contribute to the state. But perhaps considered to be of even less value—and, therefore, deserving of further marginalization in some of these texts—were women who could not have children, for not only could these women not fight in wars, but they could not produce men to fight in wars either.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140013484428">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Islamic scholar, Mohammed Ghaly argues that, while there is no direct Arabic term that can be translated as ‘disability’ in English, some Arabic terms refer to people whom we would largely today label as disabled, but this also includes ‘the bald, those who are very short or very tall, those whose pregnancies were abnormally long or short and so forth.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140013484428">6</xref></sup> He suggests, further, that in some Islamic traditions and texts beardless men are sometimes categorized alongside people with, for example, mobility impairments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140013484428">7</xref></sup> And finally, if we turn to the New Testament, we see people with leprosy (e.g. Matt 8:2ff), people who were blind (e.g. John 9:2ff) and Deaf (e.g. Mark 7:31ff), and physically impaired (e.g. Luke 5.18ff), people who were thought to be demon-possessed (e.g. Luke 11.14ff) and a woman who lived with haemorrhages (e.g. Luke 8.43ff), all of whom were excluded from society and the temple for reasons attributed to their particular conditions that were thought to make them ritually impure. All these people are marginalized and are categorized together—those who are ritually impure—all of whom are also subsequently healed by Jesus and restored to the community.</p>
<p>As we survey these texts and traditions across different periods of history and cultures, we discover that there is no single understanding of what is meant today by a term like ‘disability.’ So how is a category like disability developed? Contemporary scholarship would argue that it is essentially a construction of cultures and societies, and these ancient religious texts and traditions help us to see how this is the case. Societies determine what is most valuable and important to them: the ability to produce children and fight in wars. Societies identify physical attributes that they consider to be normative: a man with a beard, a priest with a particular physical appearance. Those who do not conform to such ideals and norms are marginalized, considered to be ritually impure, socially, economically, and politically without merit, and unable to contribute fully to the common good as the idealized normative member of society does.</p>
<p>Disability in contemporary Western societies is similarly a social construct. Jean Vanier argues that ‘the values many modern societies hold are independence, individualism, and success for every citizen,’ while Nancy Eiesland explains that we also have a constructed physical ideal ‘upheld by sports-shoe commercials and magazine covers.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021140013484428">8</xref></sup> In contemporary Western contexts, when we talk about the ideal, normative human being, therefore, we are often referring to someone who is largely independent, employed, able to contribute to society economically without assistance to do so, and able to exercise agency and choice (the hallmarks of liberal democracy); every part of their body conforms to particular norms of able-bodiedness, while they appear to be young, fit, and beautiful. In many ways, there is nothing wrong with some of these qualities taken on their own, but when taken together as the measure of human value and worth, they become oppressive to those who deviate from such norms. We refer to those who conform to such an image as able-bodied. Those who do not conform to such a norm receive a label by which they can be referred, and through which they and everyone else can realize that they do not live up to society’s expectations of normativity: ‘disabled people.’ It is noteworthy that such notions of normativity are also part of contemporary legislative discourses. In the United Kingdom’s <italic>Equality Act 2010</italic>, disability is defined as an inability to carry out ‘normal day-to-day activities,’ while the World Health Organization literature defines an impairment as a ‘problem’ in how the body works.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021140013484428">9</xref></sup> This concept of the normal is thus enshrined in national and international policy frameworks. If this is how disability is constructed—as a form of deviation from the normal human being—then what has been society’s response to disabled people, variously understood, historically?</p>

<title>Dehumanization and Oppression of People with Disabilities</title>
<p>For much of European history, people who have been labelled as ‘disabled’ have been on the receiving end of a series of attitudes and practices that have served to suggest that to be disabled, not to conform to the particular society’s constructed norms, means in some way to be less than human, or, indeed, not human at all. Notwithstanding such dehumanization, in addition, disabled people have largely been marginalized and excluded from societies, often with the result that their bodies, minds, and spirits have been subjected to all kinds of despicable abuse and violence. This is often justified as being in the best interests of the disabled person as societies have sought to make them conform to their particular construction of able-bodied normativity. This, in general, was probably not quite the same as ours today.</p>
<p>Let us consider the effects of normalization in relation to one particular group, whom society has labelled as disabled, conscious that this is one example among many, namely, people who are Deaf and who use sign language as their first or preferred language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021140013484428">10</xref></sup> In the 18th century in Paris, a pioneer of Deaf education, Abbé Charles Michel de L’Epée, established a school for young children, who were profoundly Deaf, and he used a form of sign language as the principal method of educating these young children. As far as the evidence suggests, de L’Epée’s methods of using sign language as the language of education provided a space in which Deaf children flourished and developed in their learning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021140013484428">11</xref></sup> De L’Epée’s methods spread to some extent and proved to be successful in terms of educating Deaf children in other parts of Europe. But these methods were questioned and, in 1880, a European conference of educational professionals working with Deaf children met in Milan to discuss which methods really were best for Deaf children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021140013484428">12</xref></sup> They were either to teach Deaf children through sign language or to use the method of oralism, an approach that had been gaining momentum during the 19th century—that is, teaching Deaf children how to speak first, and only then proceeding with education in other areas.</p>
<p>Few Deaf people attended this conference, and it was dominated by the proponents of the oralist method so that, from the end of the 19th century right through the 20th century, not only were de L’Epée’s methods largely disbanded, but Deaf people were actively encouraged, even forced, not to use sign language for communication at all, let alone in education. This was for fear it would prevent Deaf people from learning speech and skills in lip-reading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021140013484428">13</xref></sup> Imagine having the capacity to communicate taken away like this, the ability to relate to human beings that is so basic to our flourishing. There is little doubt that there are advantages to a Deaf person learning speech and skills in lip-reading, but more recent research and evidence suggest that Deaf people are much more likely and able to develop these abilities if they have first learned sign language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021140013484428">14</xref></sup> Sign languages were banned in schools, and children were forced to learn speech and to lip-read because it was thought that the best response to the presence of Deafness in a person’s life was to try to make the Deaf person as much like a hearing person as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021140013484428">15</xref></sup> Despite the detrimental effects that this approach had on Deaf people’s education (more broadly due to the amount of time devoted to teaching speech), the key agenda and the outcome were not in providing the best education for Deaf people. Rather it ensured that they could be as ‘normal’ (that is, hearing!) as possible. That agenda of normalization was of paramount importance and was pursued no matter what the other costs might be for Deaf people.</p>
<p>In fieldwork that I conducted with Deaf people about 10 years ago, I was shocked and moved by the stories that they told me of the efforts that were made to stop them doing what came naturally to them, communicating visually. They had their hands tied behind their backs, knuckles painfully rapped with various implements by their teachers, and other similar such punishments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021140013484428">16</xref></sup> The legacy of the pain of these experiences, some half a century or more later, was profoundly disturbing. Perhaps most shocking of all was that some older Deaf people only had basic communication skills, unable to make full use of any language. This was not due to them having a learning disability, but was because they were never given an opportunity to learn any language during the crucial years of language acquisition (0–5 years old).</p>
<p>But the normalization agendas did not stop there. Harlan Lane describes some of the methods of one French ‘doctor,’ Jean-Marc Itard, who tried to ‘cure’ Deafness in some children in the 19th century:
<disp-quote>
<p>He started by applying electricity to the ears of some pupils, since an Italian surgeon had recently found that a frog’s leg would contract if touched by charged metal … He also placed leeches on the necks of some of the pupils in the hope that local bleeding would help somehow. Six students had their eardrums pierced, but the operation was painful and fruitless, and he desisted. Not soon enough for Christian Dietz who died following his treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021140013484428">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The desire to find a cure for Deaf people has had devastating, and, at times, fatal consequences for Deaf people. Perhaps this outcome often seemed preferable, because to remain in the Deaf condition was understood to be the worst possible state to be in, so that it was thought that perhaps no life at all was better than being alive and Deaf.</p>
<p>Theological traditions often have also been informed by, and, indeed, have served to reinforce, the normalization agenda. Take, for example, the Protestant Reformation proposition that ‘faith alone is necessary for salvation.’ John Swinton refers to an article by Birchenhall that speaks about the way that people with what is described as ‘mental handicaps’ have no opportunity of entering into a relationship with God. Swinton comments, regarding how faith is understood, that ‘the emphasis seems to be on knowing about God rather than being known by God. The concept of faith seems to relate primarily and perhaps exclusively to forms of relating that are based on the intellect.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021140013484428">18</xref></sup> What is assumed, therefore, in practice, however much we might wish to redefine what faith is, is that in order to be saved, a person will normally have language and the intellectual capacities to learn a set of beliefs and make choices and decisions about them; what is assumed is able-bodied normativity. Not only do disabled people experience exclusion in society (unless they can be normalized); the mechanism by which salvation is realized according to this tradition excludes, in practice, the person with dementia, mental illness, or profound learning disability from even the possibility of participation in the future kingdom of heaven. While it is important to recognize that not all normalization should be understood negatively (as we all need to conform to some norms in order to share a common space), let us not ignore how such a theology—that suggests that to live with a particular condition precludes that person from sharing in heaven—serves to reinforce the marginalization of people with disabilities, not only in churches, but also more widely in society.</p>
<p>Theological traditions have also reinforced ideas that people with disabilities are in some way sub-human. For much of Christian history, in Western and Eastern traditions, it has been thought that the part of us that most closely reflects the image of God in human beings is the capacity to reason, our intellect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021140013484428">19</xref></sup> To be human is to be in God’s image; that is what distinguishes the human from other parts of creation. This means that the person with an impaired mind through dementia, learning disability, or mental illness is in some way seen as less than human, perhaps not human at all, and a lesser representation of the <italic>imago dei</italic> (image of god). That may not be the intention of such a theology of the <italic>imago dei</italic>, but it is the consequence of it.</p>
<p>Thus far, this article has explored one set of examples, among many, of the kinds of experiences that have characterized the history of disabled people and out of which the disability rights movement of the 1980s emerged. It has been argued that this history is one that has been shaped by socially constructed discourses of normativity, which are based on qualities and characteristics that particular societies and contexts consider to be valuable and useful to them. It is against this backdrop and the ongoing legacy of the way disability has been constructed, and, subsequently, how disabled bodies have been viewed and treated, that new ways of thinking about disability have emerged. Such alternative approaches to disability have developed within theological discourses too, and it is at this point that we turn to the works of Nancy Eiesland, Jean Vanier, and Thomas Reynolds in order to explore the theological categories of woundedness and vulnerability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021140013484428">
<title>Nancy Eiesland: The Wounded Christ</title>
<p>The concept of woundedness features in the theology of Nancy Eiesland, and it is a term that she uses to speak of disability. She notes how in the body of the Christ of the resurrection in the gospel narratives, the wounds in Christ’s hands, side, and feet are not cured or removed but remain as a part of his risen body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021140013484428">20</xref></sup> Indeed, Jesus shows them to St Thomas, who doubts the authenticity of the disciples’ accounts of Jesus’ resurrection (John 20:27). Thus, for Eiesland, the risen, transformed Christ is also the wounded Christ. She comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>Paradoxically, in the very act commonly understood as the transcendence of physical life, God is revealed as tangible, bearing the representation of the body reshaped by injustice and sin into the fullness of the Godhead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021140013484428">21</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These wounds, embodied in the risen Christ, Eiesland interprets as ‘impairments,’ physical characteristics that can be said to deviate from socially and religiously constructed notions of normativity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021140013484428">22</xref></sup> In presenting these wounds, she argues, Jesus, ‘the resurrected Saviour, calls for his frightened companions to recognize in the marks of impairment their own connection with God, their own salvation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021140013484428">23</xref></sup> Such an understanding of the risen Christ as the ‘Disabled God’ constitutes, for Eiesland, her ‘liberatory theology of disability.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021140013484428">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Woundedness in the resurrected Christ has two meanings that are related to each other for Eiesland, both of which she understands to be liberatory: it is a way of speaking about impaired bodies positively, as the Christ of the resurrection is not normalized as a result of rising from the dead but remains in his impaired state; it is also a way of speaking about the scars that remain as a result of violence against the body, against the body of Christ, and against the bodies of people with disabilities. Both are transformative for Eiesland. In taking on impairment, woundedness, Christ affirms the impaired, wounded bodies of disabled people by taking disability into the life of God. However, his wounded resurrection body symbolizes for Eiesland resistance to the sins of violence against the body (sin is overcome in the resurrection), and, in this resistance to sin, liberation is possible, not in some future eschatological world, but in the here and now too. The wounded Christ is thus a source of liberation for disabled people, an example of resistance to sin that is to be modelled by people with disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021140013484428">
<title>Disability and Human Vulnerability</title>
<p>Vulnerability has developed as a theological category for speaking about the experience of living with disability, and for re-thinking, at a more basic level, a sense of what it means to be a human being. To be precise, much of the literature that has developed the concept of vulnerability has emerged from among theologians and practitioners, who have lived with and alongside people with profound learning disabilities. Perhaps the most significant contributor to this development has been Jean Vanier, and more recently, Thomas Reynolds. Reynolds argues that vulnerability should be properly understood as the human quality or characteristic that represents normativity in place of the image of the fit, able-bodied, economically independent, autonomous ideal that often constitutes normativity in Western societies. In making this case, he builds on the work of Jean Vanier.</p>
<p>People with profound learning disabilities Vanier describes as ‘weak and vulnerable,’ but it is these qualities that he understands as having ‘something important to bring to our world today’ in contrast to our constructions of normality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021140013484428">25</xref></sup> The conditions, or impairments, of people with profound learning disabilities reveal vulnerabilities that are plain for all to see. The qualities of vulnerability or weakness are qualities that are understood as contrary to the concept of the desirable human being that pervades our societies. Vanier proposes that able-bodied people often seek to ‘hide our vulnerability behind a strong, protective ego’ and that in living in community at L’Arche, he could either choose that or learn to ‘discover that our vulnerability is a source of communion and unity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021140013484428">26</xref></sup> Reynolds proposes that one of the reasons that people with profound learning disabilities have historically been institutionalized and hidden from view is because such vulnerability reminds able-bodied people of their own vulnerabilities; that all of us, as Mary Grey suggests, are mortal or, to use Eiesland’s term, are only ever ‘temporarily able-bodied.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021140013484428">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, Vanier beautifully illustrates how, in recognizing and accepting vulnerability in people with learning disabilities, and, in the able-bodied person allowing themselves to be vulnerable in communion with them, the able-bodied person not only discovers something of their own humanity, but also sees the humanity of people with disabilities, who are so often dehumanized. In his book, <italic>The Scandal of Service</italic>, Vanier describes the Holy Thursday act of washing feet, an act that is regularly practised in L’Arche communities—a practice that, he claims, began in L’Arche in Liverpool.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021140013484428">28</xref></sup> In these acts, the members of the community sit in a circle and the house leader begins by washing the feet of the person on their right. This act is repeated around the circle until everyone’s feet have been washed. He notes how it feels ‘natural and normal that assistants wash the feet of people with [disabilities].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021140013484428">29</xref></sup> They are on one level there to serve disabled members of the community. However, he notes that there is ‘a special beauty when a person with a [disability] washes an assistant’s feet.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021140013484428">30</xref></sup> Not only does such an act of touch for a person most people try to avoid affirm the lives of people with disabilities, but it also turns discourses of able-bodiedness and disability ‘on their head.’ Disabled and able-bodied together, serve one another, participate in this intimate act, become vulnerable to one another and, in so doing, discover a deeper level of communion.</p>
<p>For Reynolds, not only does being vulnerable to one another in this way help us to discover who we ourselves really are, but a way is opened up to uncovering what it actually means to be a human being. Reynolds explains this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>All people are linked indissolubly, sharing a fundamental condition: vulnerable personhood …. Human beings are not ready-made. Indeed, we are incomplete creatures that require the presence of others not merely to survive but to flourish … each of us, threatened by various contingencies need each other to take note of our own particular condition and become empowered as individuals …. The point is not to trivialize disability or discount the very real struggles created by biophysical impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021140013484428">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Reynolds, the idealized human, that has been set up as normative, needs to be replaced by a new concept of normativity: vulnerability. The paradox of this is that those whom society shuns for not conforming to able-bodied normativity cannot but help reveal precisely what it means to be human, that which we so often try to escape from or avoid. That is, that we are limited, contingent, and completely dependent upon one another if we are to live a life that will flourish. Reynolds, perhaps more than Vanier, rejects any notion that people with profound learning disabilities are ‘instructive tools’ for able-bodied people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021140013484428">32</xref></sup> The quality of vulnerability in people with profound learning disabilities does, however, for Reynolds, reveal more fully what it means to be a human being for everyone—able-bodied and disabled people.</p>
<p>For Reynolds, this means also working towards accepting difference and breaking down the dichotomies of able-bodied and disabled lives. He suggests that ‘entering into relationships of mutual vulnerability and gift giving is a way of belonging with others that cultivates the joy of being “at home” together.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021140013484428">33</xref></sup> It is not in seeking to be the best, to be autonomous and independent, in putting up barriers that protect us from getting hurt, that we are able to welcome difference, but in recognizing within ourselves what we share: our vulnerability. Our vulnerability is both that which we have in common with each other, for Reynolds, and also the means by which we learn to live together better. It leads us into relationships of love, that very quality through which the whole of the law and the prophets is fulfilled:
<disp-quote>
<p>In love another person is received as a gift, a presence to which I respond. In turn I share myself with that other person, revealing back to them their own value. Together we then form a body of reciprocal mutuality by which we each become more than ourselves alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021140013484428">34</xref></sup></p>

<p>Vulnerability, then, for Vanier and Reynolds, is a description of nothing less than the human condition itself. People with profound learning disabilities reveal this vulnerability in a such way that the ‘tyranny’ of able-bodied normativity has caused the rest of us to pretend that it does not exist in us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021140013484428">35</xref></sup> So vulnerability is a description of the state of living with impairment, with limitation, with contingency, that is particularly at the forefront of the experience of living with disability; but, in recognizing and affirming this aspect of living with disability and in recognizing it within themselves, all people, it is argued, can discover what it means to be human, how to live a life that flourishes, and how to live humanely together.</p>

<title>The Wounded Christ and Human Vulnerability</title>
<p>Thus far, two perspectives on the notion of woundedness and vulnerability have been outlined. Nancy Eiesland notes that woundedness and vulnerability, actual wounds, hurt, and harm are inflicted onto the bodies of people with disabilities. Thomas Reynolds notes that the etymology of the word ‘vulnerable’ is from the Latin, to harm or to hurt, and for centuries harm and hurt have been caused to people with disabilities by systems that have sought to normalize them or dehumanize them through violence to their bodies, mental abuse, and spiritual marginalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021140013484428">36</xref></sup> The wounded Christ of the resurrection represents solidarity with those whose bodies are similarly hurt and harmed, while also signifying resistance to the sin of violence against disabled bodies. Vanier and Reynolds use the language of vulnerability to speak about the concrete reality of living in a contingent and limited body. Disabled people are a constant reminder of human frailty and limitation, but in becoming vulnerable, becoming like the person with a profound learning disability and recognizing our need of one another, we discover more of what it means to be fully human.</p>
<p>Many liberation theologies have been subject to critique for their tendency to idealize lives of poverty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021140013484428">37</xref></sup> Vanier and Reynolds could perhaps be said to do the same regarding people with profound learning disabilities. There can be little doubt of the transformative power of the L’Arche communities on the lives of both able-bodied and disabled members who form those communities. However, I have also worked with people with profound learning disabilities, and it is not always a path of personal and mutual discovery in which we realize more fully who we are and what it means to be human. I have witnessed, for example, the frustration, the vulnerability, of a person who does not have any language when they cannot tell you that something is wrong or that they are in pain. In one such incident, one person spent an entire night, when I was on duty, trashing the house, attacking other people living there, leaving excrement on the floor and attempting to hurt herself. She was in pain, she was suffering with a diagnosed condition that caused her that pain, and this was how she expressed her pain. Her vulnerability meant she became a danger to herself and to others. She couldn’t talk it through or think rationally about it; all that she could do was lash out. This experience of being alongside someone with a profound learning disability in this state did not leave me feeling as though I had discovered what it means to be fully human and live a life that flourishes. Instead, I felt angry and frustrated with God, with the situation before me, and, in being pushed to my limits, discovering within myself qualities I did not like about myself. Being vulnerable and wounded is not always a good place to be. Historically it has exposed people with disabilities to violence and abuse from others, but it also exposes us to pain and frustration that sometimes we are all powerless to do anything about.</p>
<p>Being vulnerable and wounded is no constant rose garden of discovery of what it means to be human. It is often tough, it is often painful, it is often frustrating, and it often causes anger, for all concerned, disabled and able-bodied. It reveals in us qualities and capacities we ought not to like about ourselves. It reveals that being vulnerable is not always a safe place to be. Reynolds and Vanier are right, I think, that in vulnerability and in being open to another we discover more of what it means to be human. To be sure, it is the only way to be in relationship with others and to enter into communion with them. They are right also in wanting to find a language and framework in which the dichotomies of disabled and able-bodied are exposed as constructions of able-bodied normativity, and that in accepting our and others’ vulnerability, we can learn to live together in deeper communion with one another. But it is important to recognize alongside this, that being vulnerable can be a place of hurt and harm, inflicted by others at times, and at other times, simply a part of what it means to be in a vulnerable state.</p>
<p>To speak about vulnerability positively, as Vanier and Reynolds do, only makes sense when vulnerability is brought alongside Eiesland’s notion of the wounded Christ of the resurrection. Vulnerability is, indeed, a state in which we can truly enter into deep relationships with others, and living in communion with people with disabilities will help all human beings, disabled and able-bodied, to discover that better. But vulnerability is also a state of hurt and harm as we see in the crucified Christ, whose body is wounded by instruments of torture and violence, as we see in the violence and abuse towards people with disabilities in history and today, and as we see in the hurt that can be caused by the condition with which a person is seeking to live. The risen Christ, however, reminds us that the sins of violence and abuse can and must be overcome, and that hurt and harm of any kind will be no more. Christ’s wounds serve as a reminder of the past that must be transformed (but not forgotten as the wounds remain), but also of a present and a future in which violence against people with disabilities in body, mind, and spirit must be resisted. Being vulnerable to one another can only enhance our lives if it is accompanied by a commitment to justice and a resistance to any abuse of human vulnerability.</p>
<p>In being vulnerable together, we must also paradoxically be strong together and, in the company of the wounded risen Christ, resist the sins of hurt and harm to people with disabilities caused by human sin. We should seek to alleviate as much as possible the kinds of pain that we may be powerless to remove completely, and we should seek to live in hope that one day all suffering and pain will end. But Christ’s wounds also remind us all of the dangers of unthinkingly pursuing an agenda of disabled people’s conformation to able-bodied normativity. Christ’s resurrected body remains impaired, shows that wholeness and impairment are compatible. It affirms that communion with Christ in this world is possible for people with disabilities, and that disabled people, in their disabled condition, are not at all precluded from communion with Christ in any future eschatological world. Christ’s vulnerable, impaired body welcomes all of us, just as we are.</p>

<p>‘Deaf people’—using the upper case ‘D’—refers to people who are normally born Deaf or become Deaf before acquiring spoken language. Their first or preferred language is usually the sign language of the country in which they live. Deaf people should be distinguished from people with other hearing impairments who do not use sign language or identify with what is often called ‘Deaf culture.’</p>

<p>Woll argues that all children generally need to have acquired a full language by the age of five to be fluent in that language, while Kyle and Woll argue that Deaf children acquire sign languages at a comparable rate to hearing children acquiring spoken languages. Deaf children taught how to speak by the age of five generally learn language at a much slower rate (see Bencie Woll,‘Development of Signed and Spoken Languages,’ in <italic>Issues in Deaf Education</italic>, ed.
