<p>Paul’s commentary to Isa 40-66 is a welcome contribution to Isaiah scholarship, due especially to Paul’s close reading of the Hebrew text and to his deep insights into its interpretations. Paul has already published a commentary on Isa 40-48 in Hebrew (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2008). The present book makes Paul’s own scholarship on Isaiah, as well as that of select Mediaeval Jewish exegetes and grammarians, available in English.</p>
<p>The commentary opens with an introduction. It contains the same information as the introduction in the aforementioned Hebrew commentary and appears to be the author’s own English translation of his work. Paul discusses, among other matters, the authorship, dating and geographical setting of Isa 40-66. In this area, Paul’s views are as conservative as critical scholars are prepared to go. He identifies Isa 40-66 as the product of one anonymous author (‘Deutero-Isaiah’) active during the final years of the Babylonian exile and the beginning of the return of the exiles to Jerusalem. This author is responsible also for Isa 35 and possibly also for Isa 34. Paul further adheres staunchly to the Babylonian provenance of Isa 40-48. After emigrating to Judah, the prophet continued to deliver oracles which were now concerned with the situation in Judah (chs 49-66). The traditional scholarly division is thus ‘artificial’ (p. 11). Paul then provides a brief history of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, as well as cursory discussions of select topical issues (e.g. the Servant Songs, polemic against Babylonian beliefs, descriptions of Jerusalem). Paul then turns to the stylistic features of Isa 40-66, its structure, and its language. He continues with an overview of inner-biblical textual allusions in Isa 40-66, as well as more detailed discussions of the influence from Deuteronomy, the writings of Isaiah ben Amos, the book of Jeremiah, the Psalter, and Lamentations. Paul also looks at ancient Near Eastern influence on Isa 40-66, the Qumran Isaiah scrolls, the Ancient Versions, and finally Isa 40-66 in Jewish liturgy.</p>
<p>After the introduction, Paul offers an English translation of the Hebrew text of Isa 40-66. He then provides a detailed verse-by-verse commentary of the text, in the style of the Mediaeval Jewish commentators. The commentary on Isa 48-48 appears to be an English version of Paul’s Hebrew work, commenting in the same way on the same phrases. Paul interacts with both ancient and modern scholars, ancient Near Eastern material, and material from Qumran and the Ancient Versions. He explains unusual vocabulary, morphology, and syntax, and he often comments on the theological nuances of specific words. He also cites similar occurrences of a given expression or refers to the use of a certain preposition elsewhere in the Bible or in ancient Near Eastern texts as a way of shedding light upon its meaning. He also discusses at length how the different parts of Isa 40-66 interact with one another.</p>
<p>Many scholars will probably disagree with Paul’s dating and postulated shared authorship of Isa 40-66, and Paul does not really make a case for his views. Paul’s valuable contribution to scholarship lies in his attention to the text-critical and literary/stylistic aspects of the text.</p>
