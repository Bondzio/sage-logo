<title>Aim</title>
<p>This paper is a report of a study of the quality of information that is available on the World Wide Web around the topic of assisted dying by sampling information from a number of web pages about assisted dying with a view to evaluating the nature, content and rigour of the information they contain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987112471139">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The Internet is seen as one of the first places people will go for information about their health or health-related topics. However, whilst it would appear that, as a source of factual health-related information, the Internet has a degree of reliability and credibility, there is a dearth of information about how the information may contribute to opinion formation and attitudes around important health debates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987112471139">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study used content analysis of web-based material to evaluate the nature, content, currency and rigour of the information they contained against 27 criteria. Each website was independently assessed by two people, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. In addition the readability and reading age level of each site was evaluated objectively using ‘The Readability Test Tool’ website (Simpson, 2009). The web page data were collected on three separate days in November 2010.</p>

<title>Results/Findings</title>
<p>The majority of sites showed accuracy (76%, <italic>n</italic> = 43) with 7 (14%) being assessed as highly accurate. This was reflected in the completeness of the site evaluated. All sites were readable with 12 pages (24%) being rated at 3.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112471139" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As healthcare establishes itself within the technological age, the access that patients and service users have to healthcare data external to the traditional routes of information, i.e. doctors and nurses, is one that healthcare professionals are increasingly aware of. However, a number of political issues, focusing upon health but peripheral to specific disease processes are becoming a feature of modern healthcare. This paper takes one issue – that of assisted dying (AD), and evaluates the quality and nature of the information available to the general public via the Internet. Assisted dying was selected because the UK guidelines on the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112471139">Director of Public Prosecution, 2010</xref>) and the subsequent guidelines from professional bodies (see, for example, the guidelines produced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112471139">Royal College of Nursing, 2011</xref>) make it clear that healthcare professionals may render themselves liable to prosecution if they enter into dialogue on this topic with their patients. This leaves patients with no alternative but to seek this information for themselves. The Internet is seen as one of the first places people will go for information about their health or health-related topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112471139">Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112471139">Gray et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112471139"><title>Background</title>
<p>Despite the concerns that healthcare professionals have expressed surrounding the quality and accuracy of cyber-space information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112471139">Gagliardi and Jadad, 2002</xref>) few practitioners formally recommend, ‘approved sites’ to their patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112471139">Bernstam et al. (2005)</xref> noted that practitioners might be unwilling to recommend sites because of the ephemeral nature of the Internet whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112471139">Reent (1999)</xref> further suggested that even when healthcare professionals do recommend useful websites, such recommendations do not carry much weight with patients. Therefore it would appear as if individuals who exhibit cyber-space information seeking behaviour are doing so from a seriously uninformed position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112471139">Reent, 1999</xref>). This would suggest that the originators of such sites have an obligation to ensure that the information they are presenting is accurate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112471139">Haigh (2010)</xref> has noted that some information portals, notably Wikipedia, have a fair percentage of robust information sources, whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112471139">Magnus (2008)</xref> noted that, on sites where comments can be posted inaccuracies were detected and corrected within 48 hours. However, whilst it would appear that, as a source of factual health-related information, the Internet has a degree of reliability and credibility there is a dearth of information about how this content may contribute to opinion formation and attitudes around important health debates.</p>
<p>The increasing involvement of the general public in political health issues has grown in the last 5 years. In the US there has been public engagement on an unprecedented scale over the proposed healthcare reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112471139">Neilson, 2009</xref>); a similar situation has been reported in Australia also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112471139">Hall, 2010</xref>). In the UK, one of the longest running health-related debates is around the topic of assisted dying.</p>
<p>Bringing someone’s life to a premature end or helping someone end their life prematurely is illegal in the UK, indeed in most countries around the world. However, various legal challenges by individuals such as Diane Pretty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112471139">Padain, 2003</xref>) and Debbie Purdy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112471139">Purdy and Leedham, 2009</xref>) mean that the right of terminal patients to choose the time and manner of their own death is being scrutinised by UK parliamentary law makers. Lord Joffe has made a number of unsuccessful attempts to bring in legislation that would clarify the law and provide a framework and safeguard for the effective management of assisted dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112471139">House of Lords, 2005</xref>). In Scotland, the Member of the Scottish Parliament Margot Macdonald, herself a sufferer of Parkinson’s disease, has brought similar legislation before the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<p>Commentators have noted that the assisted dying debate is a polarised one (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112471139">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that healthcare related information seeking behaviour around contentious topics is on the increase in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987112471139">Tu and Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112471139"><title>The aims</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to sample information from a number of web pages about assisted dying with a view to evaluating the nature, content and rigour of the information they contained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987112471139"><title>Design</title>
<p>This study was a text-based study. It primarily used content analysis of web-based material to evaluate the nature, content, currency and rigour of the information they contained. The pages were assessed using a tool that was designed using evaluation variables identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112471139">Eysenbach et al. (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>Each site was evaluated against the 27 criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987112471139">Table 1</xref>). This tool was developed from a systematic review of 79 empirical studies which assessed the quality of web page information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112471139">Eysenbach et al., 2002</xref>) and used the following scoring system:
<list id="list1-1744987112471139" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3 = obvious presence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2 = partial presence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1 = minimal presence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>0 = absence</p></list-item>

<p>The score for each of the 27 variables was added up to give a final overall score. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated in order to appraise the internal consistency of the website evaluation scale. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.72.</p>
<p>Each website was independently assessed by two people, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. In addition the readability and reading age level of each site was evaluated objectively using the ‘The Readability Test Tool’ website (Simpson, 2009). This site uses software to assess the readability of web pages. It provides a number of readability indices including the Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease, Flesch Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Score, SMOG Index, Coleman Liau Index, and the Automated Readability Index. For the purposes of this analysis only two of these indices were used – Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease, Flesch Kincaid Grade Level – these two being the most widely used. The Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease test is based upon a 0–100 scale. A high score means the text is easier to read. Low scores suggest the text is complicated to understand. The Flesch Kincaid Grade Level provides a rough measure of how many years of schooling it would take someone to understand the web page content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112471139"><title>Sample</title>
<p>We evaluated the first 50 sites obtained from Google using the search term ‘assisted dying’. The focus of this study was to examine the information that any member of the general public would have access to if they typed in the same search term so there were no express inclusion criteria. The only exclusion criteria were duplicate pages and pages that clearly were not relevant. It should be noted that only one of the 50 pages examined fell into the latter category, being a blog that used assisted dying in the title but was predominantly about law change, the death penalty and UK immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112471139">Tebbitt, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112471139"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>The web page data were collected on three separate days in November 2010. The title, URL and content of each web page was recorded together with the stance of the web page, pro-assisted dying (pro-AD), neutral, anti-assisted dying (anti-AD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987112471139"><title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112471139">Haigh and Jones (2005)</xref> have noted that, contrary to popular opinion, Internet content is not copyright free and the ethics of accessing online subject matter need consideration. Bruckman (2002) has suggested, however, that evaluation of online content is ethically appropriate provided such content is not password protected or that such evaluation is not specially prohibited by the site policy. That was not the case in any of the websites indentified in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987112471139"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Every web page was evaluated using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112471139">Eysenbach et al.’s tool (2002)</xref>. There were 27 evaluation criteria and each criterion could accrue a total of 3 marks (3 = obvious presence / 2 = partial presence / 1 = minimal presence / 0 = absence). Thus the maximum score a site could achieve was 81. A number of descriptive and non-parametric statistical tests were applied to the data to explore frequencies, cross tabulations and correlations, using PASW (Predictive Analytics SoftWare) Statistics software.</p>
<p>Two people independently assessed each site, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. In addition the readability and reading age level of each site was evaluated objectively using ‘The Readability Test Tool’ website (Simpson, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987112471139" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The first 50 web pages, obtained from entering the search term ‘assisted dying’ in the Google search engine were evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987112471139">Figure 1</xref> shows the categories of the sites and provides an overview of the stance of the site content.

</fig></p>
<p>40% (<italic>n</italic> = 20) of the pages took an anti-assisted dying (anti-AD) stance and 34% of the pages (<italic>n</italic> = 17) were pro-assisted dying (pro-AD). The format of the pages included newspapers and TV reports (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 26%), sites for specific pressure groups (for: <italic>n</italic> = 4, 8%; against: <italic>n</italic> = 8, 16%), Christian website (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 14%). There were 2 (4%) government documents and only 3 (6%) ‘scholarly papers’, that is, papers that had been subjected to a peer review process prior to publication. The reading levels and grades of each category of website can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112471139">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Sites with a high mean Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease included the government documents and the scholarly papers although the wide range recorded and the small sample sizes for those categories could explain this. Categories with larger sample size and lower mean score were of medium complexity. Most sites had grade levels of between 6 and 8, which translated to a reading age of 11–13 years old.</p>
<p>The majority of sites showed accuracy (<italic>n</italic> = 43, 76%) with 7 (14%) being assessed as highly accurate. This was reflected in the completeness of the site evaluated. All sites were readable with 12 pages (24%) being rated at 3. Sites were assessed for bias. In this instance bias was not necessarily seen as a ‘bad’ thing since the assisted dying debate is highly polarised. Instead the clarity of the bias of the site was assessed and 50% of the sites examined (<italic>n</italic> = 25) obtained the highest rating for clarity of stance.</p>
<p>When assessed subjectively the readability of the web pages showed a reasonably symmetrical non-normal distribution (Skewness 0.00; Kurtosis −0.885). The objective assessment using ‘The Readability Tool’ showed a positive, right-sided distribution that was more peaked with shorter flatter tails (Skewness 1.66; Kurtosis 3.63). This may be due to the wider potential range offered by ‘The Readability Tool’ (47.6–121.2) when compared to the subject readability score (0–3).</p>
<p>In terms of the quality and robustness of the content of the pages, 74% of the sample showed varying degrees of a clear hierarchy of evidence, although only 1 page graded the maximum for this variable. Only 32% of pages clearly identified both supporting evidence (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and a clear indication of the source of such evidence (<italic>n</italic> = 16). In a mere 14% of cases (<italic>n</italic> = 7) was there evidence of acknowledgement of evidence hierarchy. Only 30% of the pages (<italic>n</italic> = 15) provided offline references for further reading whilst 46% (<italic>n</italic> = 23) provided online references or links to other pages. In 72% (<italic>n</italic> = 36) of the sites evaluated the credentials of the site author were unknown and furthermore 60% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) of the sites gave no information regarding the author affiliation.</p>
<p>A number of interesting and statistically significant correlations were found when we explored the relationships of 6 variables. Correlations indicate the strength and linear relationship between two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112471139">Pallant, 2007</xref>) There was a strong, positive statistically significant correlation between the score for accuracy of information and the completeness of a website (we took Eysenbach’s definition of completeness, which included concepts such as balance regardless of overall stance and inclusion of all key elements) (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.750, <italic>n</italic> = 50, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). There was also a medium, statistically significant positive correlation between the accuracy of a website and the offline references it cited (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.314, <italic>n</italic> = 50, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027). A number of correlations associated with presentation of the sites and accuracy of content were shown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987112471139">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Although many of the sites had the date of their creation displayed, usually at the bottom of the page, only 9 sites had the date of last update recorded also.</p>
<p>A lot of the sites, especially those from the anti-AD position, were opinion-based sites with little or any research-based material. This is not necessarily a negative issue since the sites were broadly aimed at the provision of information to the general public rather than updating healthcare professionals in current research. However, the higher graded sites combined accessible information giving with either suggested reading or hypertext links to other useful websites or reports. This can be seen as a ‘value added’ element to the better sites. The best example of this was the website from the pressure group ‘Dignity in Dying’. This site scored the highest on the grading criteria and combines patient stories with clear explanation of the argument in support of assisted dying and some acknowledgement of the opposing viewpoint. From the anti-AD perspective the highest graded site was a Christian site. It did not have an explicit assisted dying focus but was an essay upon the sanctity of life, supported by external quotations from other supporters. The lowest graded sites tended to be exclusively opinion based with no external support and often inaccurate or misleading content.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1744987112471139" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has provided some insights into the scope and quality of Internet information available to the general public on a specific political, health-related topic. There was a slight bias towards one end of the argument, the anti-assisted dying position; however, the highest quality sites tended to be from the pro-assisted dying position. The best websites made their bias obvious, had evidenced-based content and also made the affiliations of the authors clear to the readers. Such sites were seen as accessible to a wide range of abilities.</p>
<p>All of the religious sites examined within this study were Christian sites; none of the other religions appeared exercised about this topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112471139">Burdette et al. (2005)</xref> noted that moderate to conservative Protestant and Catholics were more likely to oppose assisted dying than Jews and those whose faith is non-affiliated. They further suggested that Protestants harboured the highest opposition to assisted dying and it is notable that the entire majority of the religious websites, or websites which purported to adhere to religious teachings, were Anglican/Protestant. There was one website from a Catholic Newspaper but no Jewish or Muslim sites found.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to this study. The search term ‘assisted dying’ bring up 395,000 hits on the Google search engine. However, this study only looked at the first 50 pages, a sample of 0.01%. Nonetheless, Google uses a link analysis algorithm called Page Rank, which looks at over 2 million variables and 2 billion search terms. Pages identified as important receive higher Page Ranks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112471139">Brin and Page, 1998</xref>); in this study the highest graded content was found in the first 15 sites visited. Furthermore, Digital Point, an online Webmaster forum, suggests that most individuals rarely venture beyond the first page of their search results (1999). Thus, although not necessarily representative of the entire content the sample in this study does reflect the immediate information that would be available.</p>
<p>It should also be acknowledged that the search term itself – ‘assisted dying’ – is only one of the many terms that could be used when searching for information regarding an autonomous and premature end to life. Terms such as physician assisted dying, euthanasia, assisted suicide, practitioner assisted suicide are all variables of the search term used here. However, we found that these terms often appeared in the pages identified.</p>
<p>The quality of the content and the rigour of the information found in a review of the sites were generally poor. There was an unexpectedly high representation from personal blogs and the national press, which tend to provide either highly polarised opinion or used emotive case studies to make a particular point. For any individual seeking balanced or even robust evidenced-based biased information there was little to go on.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1744987112471139" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a discrepancy between web-based information that is aimed at ‘scholars’ and that aimed at the general public. This does have implications for those service users who wish to make health-related decisions based upon reliable information. Despite the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112471139">Reent (1999)</xref> it may be incumbent upon healthcare professionals to take the trouble to identify a variety of sites that they are confident will supply or supplement key information in a way that is accessible to service users.</p>
