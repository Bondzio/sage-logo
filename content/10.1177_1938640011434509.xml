<p>“The most frequently encountered type of malunion though is persistent syndesmotic diastasis.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Following an ankle fracture, the fibula typically shortens and moves into a position of external rotation. This then permits the talus to shift laterally resulting in both instability and valgus tilt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434509">1</xref></sup> This principle of talar shift was initially conceptualized by Ramsey and Hamilton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434509">2</xref></sup> in 1976. Their investigations showed that as little as 1 mm of talar shift conferred a 42% reduction in tibiotalar congruence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434509">2</xref></sup> Consequently, this has been the primary criteria used to both determine the need for surgery and to judge the quality of fixation of ankle fractures.</p>
<p>Ankle malunion following open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) is not uncommon. Some specific problems that may arise include varus/valgus deformities and those in the anteroposterior plane too. The most frequently encountered type of malunion though is persistent syndesmotic diastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434509">3</xref></sup> Here, both external rotation and shortening of the fibula have been identified as prominent features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434509">4</xref></sup> Failure to correct these factors may result in symptoms of pain, swelling, stiffness (loss of dorsiflexion), and an inability to sustain load. Furthermore, it may culminate in secondary osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434509">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434509">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report a technique to correct persistent talar shift following ankle fracture fixation whereby a z-osteotomy of the fibula is performed in order to achieve adequate lengthening and internal rotation of the fibula.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938640011434509" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We report 4 patients with persistent talar shift following ORIF of an ankle fracture. Index procedures consisted of lag screw fixation and one-third tubular plate for the fibula fracture and 2 cannulated screws for the medial malleolar fracture. All procedures were performed without complication but on outpatient follow-up, persistent syndesmotic diastasis was evident on radiographic examination. This was also associated with pain and stiffness in all cases. All ankles were therefore salvaged using a z-osteotomy of the fibula to achieve both lengthening and internal rotation of the fibula thereby correcting the talar shift and restoring the ankle mortise. The procedure was carried out a mean of 16 (range 14-20) weeks after internal fixation of the index fracture.</p>
<sec id="section2-1938640011434509">
<title>Operation Technique</title>
<p>The patient was positioned supine with a sand bag placed under the ipsilateral hip to internally rotate the leg. A pneumatic thigh tourniquet was then applied. A 15-cm longitudinal incision was made over the subcutaneous border of the fibula and the level of the syndesmosis was identified using image intensification. Four centimeters above the syndesmosis, a z-osteotomy was performed in the frontal plane permitting a gliding length of 4 to 5 mm. The osteotomy was then distracted using a Hintermann distractor to restore fibula length. On average, 1 mm of the sliding length of the osteotomy was in contact. The distal fragment was internally rotated concomitantly to correct the external rotation deformity. Both distraction and rotation were increased until the talar tilt and subluxation were reduced fluoroscopically. A lateral fibula dynamic compression plate was then applied to maintain the reduction. Lag screws were not used due to both the lack of obliquity at the fracture site not permitting their insertion and the lack of bony overlap not facilitating compression of the fracture ends. The syndesmosis was tested intraoperatively by grasping the distal fibula with reduction clamps and pulling it laterally under fluoroscopic examination. This enabled assessment of syndesmotic stability under direct vision. Since this was present in all cases, the syndesmosis was stabilized ubiquitously. This was achieved with 2 screws purchasing 3 cortices each. A debridement of the syndesmosis was not performed. Of note, the medial side was not explored in any of the cases since there were neither signs of a medial bony or ligamentous injury nor was there an intraoperative indication to do so since satisfactory mortise alignment was achieved in all cases.</p>
<p>Wound closure was in layers with vicryl used for subcutaneous tissue and nylon used for skin. A below-knee backslab was applied postoperatively and the limb was elevated for 48 hours. Following this, a below-knee cast was applied. After 2 weeks, the cast was changed and the sutures were removed. The cast remained in situ for 8 to 10 weeks during which time patients were on a strict non-weight-bearing protocol. Syndesmosis screws were removed in all cases 10 weeks following their insertion. On removal of the cast both clinical and radiological evaluation indicated satisfactory union in all cases.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>At the latest clinic review, all 4 ankles exhibited satisfactory clinical and radiological union. Clinically, all patients had pain-free, stable ankles with a full range of unrestricted movement. Satisfactory callus formation was also seen in all cases. All patients have now returned to full mobility and are satisfied with their outcome.</p>
<p>One particular patient, a 23-year-old nonsmoking male with no medical comorbidities, presented to the emergency department following a low-energy twisting injury to his right ankle. On examination, the ankle did not exhibit any wounds or any neurovascular deficit. X-rays illustrated a Weber C fracture of the fibula with talar shift. This underwent ORIF 3 days later using one syndesmosis screw and a one-third tubular plate. Immediate postoperative X-rays revealed a satisfactory position of the ankle mortise and the patient was kept strictly non-weight-bearing for a total of 8 weeks. However, prior to allowing the patient to weight-bear, a further radiograph illustrated some minor syndesmotic diastasis. Since this was minimal, a trial of partial weight-bearing was commenced; however, this was not tolerated because of pain and the persistent feeling that the ankle may give way. A further radiograph then showed more extensive diastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011434509">Figure 1</xref>) and therefore lengthening z-osteotomy was carried out 4 weeks later. This procedure was performed without complication and 10 weeks later the patient was weight-bearing satisfactorily with no pain or instability. Radiographs at this point also revealed satisfactory position of the ankle mortise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640011434509">Figure 2</xref>). The patient was subsequently discharged and at the latest follow-up 6 months postoperatively, he has returned to full function and has a pain-free ankle joint. Weight-bearing radiographs taken at this point can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011434509">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Movement at the ankle joint occurs in the sagittal plane and comprises dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Given the fact that the anterior aspect of the talus is wider than its posterior portion it is necessary for the fibula to move during gait to maintain joint congruence. Accordingly, during dorsiflexion, both the talus and fibula undergo 5° to 6° of external rotation and during the stance and push-off phases of gait, the fibula is pulled distally. With fracture of the ankle though, the aforementioned biomechanical principles are disrupted. Fracture of the fibula is conventionally associated with both shortening and external rotation thus permitting lateral shift of the talus. Even 1 mm displacement of the talus is associated with abnormal load distribution in the talofibular and tibiotalar joints. This results in increased articular contact pressure, which consequently predisposes to symptoms such as swelling, stiffness (loss of dorsiflexion), and the inability to sustain load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434509">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434509">4</xref></sup> It is therefore imperative that anatomical reduction is achieved during the fixation of ankle fractures.</p>
<p>Despite the concept of “talar shift” being known to all orthopaedic surgeons treating ankle fractures, there remain a proportion of patients in whom it remains even after fixation of their index fracture. Fibula lengthening osteotomy has been advocated for such cases; however, the precise operative strategy employed is still under considerable debate. The procedure has been successful in returning patients to their preinjury level of activity and has therefore been recommended for those cases even where mild osteoarthritic changes are evident. When such degenerative changes progress to an advanced stage, however, ankle arthrodesis or replacement should be considered. Several authors have cited fibula osteotomy as the primary operative technique used to correct persistent talar shift following ankle ORIF; however, subtle variances do exist. Sinha et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434509">1</xref></sup> performed a transverse infrasyndesmotic fibula osteotomy in conjunction with using tricortical iliac bone graft to correct malunion post ORIF. Seven patients were followed-up for a mean of 11 months. Both satisfactory bony union and correction of persistent talar shift were achieved in all cases. Chao et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434509">4</xref></sup> followed-up 12 patients with malunited ankle fractures for 34 months. A long oblique osteotomy at the level of the initial fibula fracture was made to provide adequate lengthening. In addition to this, a further medial incision was used to clear any soft tissue interposition preventing anatomical reduction. To maintain reduction prior to plate application, the authors then temporarily inserted a Steinman pin. Where the osteotomy was made above the syndesmosis, a trans-syndesmosis screw was also inserted. Follow-up revealed both satisfactory radiological and clinical outcome in the majority of patients.</p>
<p>Weber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011434509">5</xref></sup> evaluated the outcome of both transverse and z-osteotomy performed for persistent malunion. Z-osteotomy was carried out in 3 patients who were followed-up for 4.3 years. In this group, a one-third tubular plate was used but was found to be insufficient in one case which consequently failed. Further lag screw fixation was therefore required. No difference between transverse and z-osteotomy was noted; however, the transverse subtype also necessitated in the application of bone graft.</p>
<p>In conjunction with performing a lengthening z-osteotomy of the fibula to correct persistent talar shift, the authors also inserted syndesmosis screws ubiquitously. This was done because of subtle radiological features that corresponded to syndesmotic disruption. It is this that may have contributed to persistent malunion. Three radiographic measurements may be assessed on anteroposterior and mortise radiographs to assess for syndesmotic injury. On the anteroposterior view, a tibiofibular clear space of greater than 5 mm is considered abnormal. This parameter corresponds to the horizontal distance between the lateral border of the posterior (tibial) malleolus and the medial border of the fibula. Tibiofibular overlap can also be measured on a standard anteroposterior radiograph and when less than 10 mm is considered to be abnormal. This is defined as the horizontal distance between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the anterior tibial prominence. Finally, on a mortise radiograph the medial clear space should be assessed. This corresponds to the distance between the lateral aspect of the medial malleolus and the medial border of the talar dome and should measure a maximum of 4 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434509">6</xref></sup> This parameter is a reliable indicator of the integrity of the deltoid ligament, which is the primary medial stabilizer of the ankle joint. The deltoid ligament comprises superficial and deep portions with the former predominantly resisting eversion of the hindfoot and the latter preventing lateral displacement and external rotation of the talus. Therefore, in cases where the deep deltoid has been ruptured, there may also be widening of the medial clear space indicating ankle instablity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434509">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011434509">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>When one or more of the aforementioned radiological parameters are abnormal, a syndesmotic injury should be suspected. However, partial syndesmotic injuries and those that do not cause diastasis may not be recognized by conventional plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging should therefore be considered for complete evaluation of the ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434509">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have described our experience with the technique of suprasyndesmotic lengthening z-osteotomy to correct malunited ankle fractures. In all cases, a dynamic compression plate and syndesmosis screws were used, and we believe that these 2 adjuncts to conventional fixation were pivotal in the satisfactory outcome seen in all cases. Furthermore, it does not require the use of any bone graft, which in itself is an advantage given the morbidity associated with graft harvesting.</p>
