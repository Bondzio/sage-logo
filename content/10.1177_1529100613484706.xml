<body>
<p>For many years, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consisted of a poorly understood constellation of symptoms from which there was little hope for meaningful recovery. Today’s reality, however, is very different from the circumstances of decades past, offering great promise to individuals with PTSD. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1529100613484706">Foa, Gillihan, and Bryant (2013)</xref> in this issue of <italic>Psychological Science in the Public Interest</italic>, making this promise a reality requires concerted effort and commitment to bridging significant gaps in research and practice and is a major current priority of the Veterans Health Administration.</p>
<p>Scientific progress in the understanding and treatment of PTSD in recent years has spawned the development and validation of specialized trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD, including prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Both PE and CPT have been shown to be efficacious in a number of clinical trials, with comparable outcomes and sustained gains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1529100613484706">Resick, Williams, Monson, Gradus, &amp; Suvak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1529100613484706">Schnurr et al., 2007</xref>). Although earlier research examining PE and CPT have focused on civilian survivors of sexual trauma, increasing research in recent years has demonstrated the effectiveness of these treatments with veterans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1529100613484706">Goodson, Lefkowitz, Helstrom, &amp; Gawrysiak, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1529100613484706">Monson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1529100613484706">Schnurr et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, PE and CPT are recommended at the highest level (Grade A) in the VA/Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline for PTSD. PE and CPT are also recommended in many other clinical practice guidelines in this nation and abroad.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite major advances in science and the validation of specialized psychotherapies for PTSD, these treatments have been shown to be very infrequently delivered in both private and public sectors, with as few as 10% of both general and specialty PTSD mental health providers offering such treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1529100613484706">Freiheit, Vye, Swan, &amp; Cady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1529100613484706">Rosen et al., 2004</xref>). As Foa and colleagues reveal, chief among the barriers to the delivery of evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPs) for PTSD and other conditions are lack of competency-based training in these approaches for mental health providers and local organizational and cultural barriers to implementation.</p>
<p>In an effort to fully realize the potential of EBPs for PTSD for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and for veterans of previous cohorts, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the health care arm of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), has implemented national initiatives to disseminate and implement PE and CPT throughout the VA health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1529100613484706">Karlin et al., 2010</xref>); in addition, national policy now requires that all veterans with PTSD have access to CPT or PE. As part of the PE and CPT dissemination initiatives, VHA has implemented national, competency-based training programs to provide training to VHA mental health staff in PE and CPT. The two-part training model for these programs includes participation in an experientially oriented training workshop followed by weekly telephone-based consultation with an expert in the therapy who serves as a training consultant in the program. The consultation phase lasts approximately 6 months and involves ongoing feedback on the implementation of the therapy with veterans. As of March 1, 2013, VHA provided training in PE and/or CPT to more than 4,700 staff.</p>
<p>Building on the success of its PE and CPT dissemination initiatives, VHA has developed and implemented national initiatives to disseminate EBPs for a number of additional mental and behavioral health conditions, including (but not limited to) depression, serious mental illness, substance use disorders, insomnia, chronic pain, and relationship distress. Across all of its EBP training programs, VHA has provided training to more than 6,400 staff, with many of these staff receiving training in more than one EBP.</p>
<p>A key dissemination question raised by Foa et al. is whether therapists can learn to deliver EBPs successfully. Therapist training outcomes associated with VHA’s national training in EBPs provide input on this important question. Across numerous training programs, the intensive training in EBPs in VHA has led to significant increases in therapist competencies and self-efficacy to deliver the therapies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1529100613484706">Karlin et al., 2012</xref>; Karlin, Trockel, Taylor, Gimeno, &amp; Manber, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1529100613484706">Walser, Karlin, Trockel, Mazina, &amp; Taylor, 2013</xref>). Moreover, as VHA has been working to develop its own internal and self-sustaining system of EBP training, program evaluation findings have shown that many therapists can become excellent trainers of trauma-focused psychotherapies and other EBPs. In fact, clinician ratings of internal VHA trainers are at the same high level as those provided for nationally recognized EBP trainers and even treatment developers themselves, such as Dr. Foa.</p>
<p>Significantly, as noted by Foa et al., there have been many who have questioned whether EBPs shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could be effective in the real-world with individuals with comorbidities and complex presentations. Program evaluation data from VHA’s EBP training programs have consistently shown that the implementation of EBPs by newly trained therapists has resulted in positive patient outcomes, often including very significant reductions in symptoms that are on par with RCT results, as well as other improvements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1529100613484706">Chard, Ricksecker, Healy, Karlin, &amp; Resick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1529100613484706">Eftekhari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1529100613484706">Karlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1529100613484706">Karlin, Trockel, et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1529100613484706">Karlin, Walser, et al., in press</xref>). Beyond clinical gains yielded by EBPs implemented in real-world settings, there is emerging research revealing that the delivery of EBPs for PTSD, such as CPT and PE, is associated with significant service and cost offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1529100613484706">Meyers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1529100613484706">Tuerk et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important outcome and indicator of impact, however, are the frequent individual experiences of veterans who have reclaimed their lives as a result of completing a course of PE or other EBP, including veterans suffering from PTSD or other mental illnesses for 20–30 years or longer. In addition to these stories are the personal experiences of a number of staff who have expressed feeling that their work is more rewarding and energizing as they see many veterans actively move forward in their lives.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of EBP delivery, Foa and colleagues identify the potential of and increasing research support for EBP delivery via telemedicine—a current clinical reality in VHA. Based on the success of its EBP training and dissemination efforts, VHA has worked to further expand the reach of EBPs by nationally implementing them through clinical video teleconferencing. This initiative, initially focusing on the delivery of PE and CPT telemental health services, is designed to promote access to these therapies for veterans residing in rural areas and to augment EBP capacity at individual facilities.</p>
<p>Advancements in the understanding and treatment of PTSD and other mental illnesses provide unprecedented opportunities for promoting recovery. Effective mechanisms for disseminating EBPs, such as those underway in VHA, are critical to achieving this promise.</p>
