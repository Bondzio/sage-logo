<abstract>
<p>The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight/obesity and their associated morbidities are well established, yet rates of diagnosis and screening for related conditions by clinicians are low. Expert Committee recommendations were released in 2007 to facilitate management of pediatric overweight/obesity. From well-child visits to a Massachusetts multisite group practice, we randomly selected 1 visit per child in 2006 (n = 56 374) and in 2008 (n = 69 681) and used electronic health record data to identify children with incident overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile) and ascertained whether clinicians assigned relevant ICD-9 (<italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic>) codes and ordered laboratory tests recommended for children ≥10 years old. In the year following the release of recommendations, a large majority of children 2 to 17 years old with a BMI ≥85th percentile lack diagnosis codes for overweight/obesity and recommended laboratory orders for assessment of obesity-related comorbidities for children 10 years and older, suggesting the need to augment current approaches to increase uptake of guidelines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity and its associated short- and long-term consequences are well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812471712">1</xref></sup> In light of the significant public health burden posed by childhood obesity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Medical Association, and the Health Resource and Service Administration released Expert Committee Recom-mendations on the Assessment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity in 2007, revising guidelines originally issued in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812471712">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812471712">3</xref></sup> The recommendations suggest universal assessment for overweight and obesity using BMI, at least yearly, and screening for related medical conditions, including glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and abnormal liver function, with appropriate laboratory testing among children at least 10 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812471712">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the important role of diagnosis as a first step in clinical interventions to curb the obesity epidemic, the majority of obese and overweight children are undiagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812471712">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812471712"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812471712"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812471712"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812471712">8</xref></sup> One national survey of pediatricians in 2006 showed that almost all participants consistently measured height and weight at well-child care visits, yet 48% did not routinely use BMI, and a majority (72%) reported unfamiliarity with BMI recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812471712">9</xref></sup> Rates of screening for weight-related health conditions are also low despite a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions among obese children, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hepatic steatosis, and elevated liver enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812471712">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812471712">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812471712">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812471712">11</xref></sup> A 2008 cross-sectional survey of 5 community-based, hospital-affiliated general pediatric and family medicine practices in New York found that a minority of the 96 clinicians surveyed reported practice consistent with the Expert Committee Recommendations for diagnosing overweight (24.7%) and obese (34.4%) children using BMI or for ordering screening labs (20.8%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812471712">12</xref></sup> Other studies have demonstrated higher rates of education, counseling, screening and referral among children with documented identification of a weight problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812471712">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812471712">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812471712">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812471712">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>These and other previous studies have analyzed subjective data from physicians regarding their own practice patterns. Studies reporting more objective measures of practice have assessed cross-sectional or overall temporal trends in diagnosis and screening among prevalent cases of overweight and obesity rather than focusing on incident cases following potentially important events such as release of recommendations by national groups. Objective measures of management among incident cases may more accurately reflect uptake of recommendations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which the release of the Expert Committee Recom-mendations increased rates of diagnosis of incident overweight/obesity and screening for related medical conditions. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to determine the likelihood of receiving relevant diagnoses and orders for screening labs among eligible children with incident overweight/obesity before and after the 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812471712">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Study participants were 2- to 17-year-old children seen for well-child care visits in 2006 and 2008 at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a multisite group practice in eastern Massachusetts. Throughout the study period, all sites used an EHR system that captured demographic and growth data. At each well-child visit, medical assistants measured length or height and weight based on the written standardized protocol of the health centers, which are consistent with the standard of care in pediatric primary care. These measures were entered into the EHR and visible to clinicians without automatic presentation of BMI. Clinicians could, however, trigger rapid calculation of BMI with the use of specific commands within the EHR. We used height and weight measures to calculate BMI and weight-for-length percentiles using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812471712">14</xref></sup> and used standard definitions of overweight as a BMI ≥85th to &lt;95th percentile and obesity as BMI ≥95th percentile.</p>
<p>Among 78 828 children in 2006 and 105 531 children in 2008, we randomly selected 1 well-child visit per child seen in 2006 (n = 72 315) and 1 well-child visit per child seen in 2008 (n = 93 995). To limit our analyses to children with incident overweight/obesity in 2006 or 2008, we excluded 15 941 (22%) children in 2006 and 24 314 (26%) children in 2008 with BMI ≥85th percentile in the 2 years before the index visit or weight for length ≥85th percentile if the child was 15 to &lt;24 months of age. Among the remaining 56 374 children in 2006 and 69 681 children in 2008 who were not overweight or obese in the previous 2 years, 8369 (14.9%) children in 2006 and 7225 (10.4%) children in 2008 had incident BMI ≥85th percentile.</p>
<p>Among children with incident overweight/obesity, we used the EHR data to assess whether clinicians (1) assigned an overweight/obesity diagnosis using <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (ICD-9) codes, including obesity, not otherwise specified (278.00), morbid obesity (278.01), overweight (278.02), weight gain, abnormal (783.1), and dysmetabolic syndrome (277.7); or (2) ordered any screening laboratory orders for obesity-related conditions among children ≥10 years old, including lipid profile studies, random or fasting glucose tests, hemoglobin A1C, insulin, or liver function studies and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, at any point from the visit date to the end of the study year.</p>
<p>Additionally, we collected data from the EHR on date of birth, gender, and race/ethnicity. Parental, patient, or clinician report of the child’s race/ethnicity was documented as white, black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or other. Because of the small sample size, we included American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian in the “other” race/ethnicity category. Race/ethnicity was missing for more children with BMI ≥85th percentile in 2006 than in 2008 (32.6% vs 25.9%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). However, children with missing race/ethnicity data did not differ from children not missing race/ethnicity data in terms of proportion having any overweight/obesity diagnosis code (7.2% vs 7.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .77) or at least 1 recommended laboratory test order (12.3% vs 12.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .78).</p>
<p>Access to full-text EHR notes from well-child visits was available for a subset of children with incident BMI ≥85th percentile. To evaluate the frequency with which providers documented overweight or obesity in the free-text EHR record yet did not document a corresponding ICD-9 code, we conducted a manual review of complete EHR notes from a convenience sample of 80 children in 2006 and 80 children in 2008 randomly selected from among children with BMI ≥85th percentile who did not have an overweight/obesity ICD-9 code. The sample size was chosen to represent more than 1% of the total number of children in this study with incident overweight/obesity who had no ICD-9 diagnosis code. From this sample of charts, we identified visits in which the provider documented weight issues, recommendations for change in diet or physical activity, or referral to a nutritionist or pediatric obesity specialist without other obvious indication. This study protocol was approved by the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Human Studies Committee.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Initial analysis involved descriptive statistics of the overall study population as well as the subset of children with incident BMI ≥85th percentile. We calculated the percentage of patients with incident overweight and incident obesity in each study year. Among children with incident overweight and obesity, we used multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between study year and child characteristics with having a diagnosis of overweight/obesity by ICD-9 code and at least 1 screening laboratory test order for obesity-related conditions among ≥10-year-olds. Adjusted multivariable models included study year, gender, race/ethnicity, age group (2-5, 6-11, and 12-17 years old), and BMI percentile category (85th to &lt;95th and ≥95th percentile) or BMI <italic>z</italic>-score. We also ran multivariable models stratified by each covariate category. We imputed missing race/ethnicity values using multiple imputation procedures. We imputed 10 values for each missing observation to create 10 “completed” data sets. After imputation, we combined multivariable modeling estimates using the MI ANALYZE procedure. We conducted all analyses using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<p>Among children with incident overweight/obesity, 556 (6.6% of 8369) received a relevant diagnosis code in 2006 and 574 (7.9% of 7225) in 2008. Among children ≥10 years old with incident overweight/obesity, 536 (12.8% of 4174) had ≥1 screening laboratory test ordered in 2006 and 415 (12.1% of 3437) in 2008. Cholesterol was the most commonly ordered laboratory test (28% of total weight-related laboratory orders in 2006 and 25% in 2008) followed by blood glucose (16% in 2006 and 15% in 2008) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (14% in 2006 and 13% in 2008). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812471712">Figure 1</xref>, we show the percentages of incident overweight/obese children with ICD-9 codes and laboratory test orders in 2006 and 2008 grouped by patient characteristics. In unadjusted analyses, rates of diagnoses were substantially lower among younger children aged 2 to 5 years old compared with older age groups and among overweight compared with obese children. We observed higher rates of diagnosis coding in 2008 than in 2006 among white (7.1% vs 5.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .001), overweight (3.0% vs 1.9%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), obese (20.9% vs 15.4%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and older children (8.9% vs 7.1%, <italic>P</italic> = .01 for 6- to 11-year-olds and 11.0% vs 9.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .03 for 12- to 17-year-olds). We did not observe a change in laboratory test ordering between 2006 and 2008.</p>

<p>From our manual review of well-child visit EHR notes, we identified 16 (20%) of 80 children in 2006 and 26 (32.5%) of 80 children in 2008 with documentation of overweight or obesity in the free text medical record. Extrapolation to our study population suggests that inclusion of these non-ICD-9 coded “diagnoses” would increase the proportion of children with overweight/obesity diagnoses from 6.6% (556 children) to 25.3% (2119 children) in 2006 and from 7.9% (574 children) to 37.9% (2726 children) in 2008.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study of more than 56 000 children seen for well-child visits before and more than 69 000 children seen after the 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations on the Assessment and Management of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity, we found that only a small proportion of children with incident overweight or obesity have documented diagnoses and screening labs for obesity-related conditions. We observed lower rates of diagnoses and screening laboratory tests among overweight (versus obese) children and among 2- to 5-year-olds compared with older children. There was a small improvement in the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis from 2006 to 2008, but rates remained far below the recommended 100%. We did not observe an increase in the frequency of screening laboratory test orders.</p>
<p>Prior studies that evaluated diagnosis and screening for obesity-related conditions among overweight and obese children have been limited by subjective data from physician self-reports of practice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812471712">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812471712">13</xref></sup> relatively small sample sizes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812471712">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812471712">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812471712">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812471712">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812471712">13</xref></sup> and restriction of the sample population to a single academic hospital practice or health care system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812471712">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812471712">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812471712">10</xref></sup> Novel features of our study include the assessment of outcomes both before and after release of the 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations, exclusion of prevalent cases, and a large sample from a community-based, outpatient pediatric multisite practice. The higher frequency of diagnosis and screening we observed among girls, nonwhite, and older children has been previously noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812471712">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812471712">10</xref></sup> and may be influenced by physician awareness of higher obesity prevalence among these groups. The lowest rates of overweight/obesity diagnoses were among 2- to 5-year-olds, which may reflect a discomfort among clinicians with labeling preschool children with weight problems. Our rates of diagnosis were lower than those presented in prior studies, likely because we excluded children with BMI (or weight/length) ≥85th percentile in the 2 years prior to the index visit in order to identify incident cases of overweight and obesity.</p>
<p>We observed only a small improvement in the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis in the year after versus before the release of the recommendations. Because we evaluated only a single year before and after the Expert Committee Recommendations, it is possible that we underestimated the likelihood that a diagnosis would be assigned. This would be true if, for example, clinicians waited for multiple assessments before diagnosing weight problems or obtaining screening laboratory tests. We observed a higher frequency of diagnosis following the recommendations among white children and a similar, although not significant, trend among the other race/ethnicity groups.</p>
<p>Our findings add to the growing evidence that the mere release of guidelines is not sufficient to promote substantial and timely change in practice. Despite the release of the initial Expert Committee Recommendations on childhood obesity management over a decade ago, the majority (72%) of pediatricians in a 2006 national survey of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) members reported unfamiliarity with the AAP guidelines for overweight screening by early and ongoing tracking of BMI, and only half reported monitoring BMI in children older than 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812471712">9</xref></sup> A recent qualitative study involving 35 pediatricians in eastern Massachusetts (including 20 from practices in the current study) found that nearly all were unfamiliar with the specific content of the 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations and that great variability existed in compliance with the guidelines, especially with regard to screening lab orders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812471712">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A 2007 study conducted focus groups with 38 North Carolina clinical providers in private practice, academic medical centers, and a community health center regarding BMI screening and implementation of obesity recommendations. The clinicians expressed concerns regarding awareness of guidelines, access to BMI charts and accurate growth data, and limitations in time and skepticism about the validity of recommendations and effectiveness of interventions. Meanwhile, providers reported that office-based systems, EHR supports, and educational programs addressing the benefits and effectiveness of recommendations may serve to address some of these barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812471712">16</xref></sup> Future research should focus on methods to use these and other tools in promoting better compliance with evidence-based practice recommendations in overweight and obesity screening and management.</p>
<p>The need for implementation of practice guidelines for the assessment and management of childhood overweight/obesity is clear, given the high variability in practice patterns among clinicians. Evidence shows low reliability of abnormal weight identification in the absence of standardized measures (such as BMI) and variability in practice associated with personal characteristics, including clinician gender, years in practice, personal weight status, and race/ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812471712">17</xref></sup> Standardization of practice might help to reduce practice variation and enhance identification and management of children with early weight deviations and younger children with weight issues—groups that are likely more amenable to intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812471712">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several limitations should be noted when interpreting the results of this study. First, the changes seen may reflect increased attention to the issue of overweight and obesity rather than changes in practice that were specifically a result of the release of recommendations. Second, this study is limited by a short period of follow-up (only 1 year) after release of Expert Committee recommendations but does offer insight into early trends. Third, race/ethnicity data were missing for approximately 30% of children with incident overweight/obesity in this study. Although we did not observe differences in rates of diagnoses and screening laboratory test orders among those with and without race/ethnicity data, we performed multiple imputations to address missing data, with stable results. Next, our choice to limit the sample to incident cases of overweight and obese children is important in order to more accurately reflect practice, given the cross-sectional nature of the study; yet it does restrict the sample toward children with lower BMIs. Finally, because all children in this study had health insurance coverage, these results may not be generalizable to patients who are uninsured.</p>
<p>Using the EHR as our data source may yield an incomplete picture of what is actually taking place during the well-child care visit. ICD-9 coding of weight problems is not reimbursed during well-child care visits and may underestimate actual diagnoses. We conducted a manual review of a convenience sample of complete EHR well-child visit notes to identify cases where no diagnosis code was entered, but the clinician made mention of weight management in the note. Although a convenience sample is perhaps limited in its representativeness of the full study sample, this chart review demonstrated that billing codes substantially underestimate clinical assessment, a finding consistent with prior studies revealing the limitations of billing codes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812471712">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812471712">19</xref></sup> However, only a minority of children with overweight/obesity had any documentation of a weight problem in the visit note. It is possible that documenting the diagnosis of overweight/obesity is an important step toward interventions for children with weight problems, such as population management approaches involving direct-to-patient outreach for improved care, although direct evidence for this assertion is currently a gap in the literature.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite recently released guidelines, most children with an incident BMI ≥85th percentile lack appropriate diagnosis codes and recommended laboratory test orders. In the year following release of the recommendations, the frequency of diagnosis coding was slightly higher, but the frequency of screening laboratory test orders did not change. Our findings suggest that expert recommendations and guidelines are insufficient to promote timely change in clinician practice around obesity management. Further research is needed to identify approaches to augment uptake of expert recommendations for management of overweight and obesity in children.</p>
