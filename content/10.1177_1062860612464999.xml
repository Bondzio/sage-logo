<abstract>
<p>With looming financial penalties for institutions with high readmission rates, hospital administrators are under pressure to implement strategies to reduce readmissions despite limited evidence of effective strategies. The objectives of this study were to understand the process of developing readmission reduction strategies and to identify and categorize the range of strategies being implemented. The authors designed a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with 12 hospital administrators at 6 different hospitals. The following 6 categories of strategies were identified: (<italic>a</italic>) tracking readmissions, (<italic>b</italic>) using prediction tools, (<italic>c</italic>) implementing disease-specific or generic readmission reduction programs, (<italic>d</italic>) adopting electronic health record-based strategies to improve transitions, (<italic>e</italic>) recruiting frontline staff for program leadership, and (<italic>f</italic>) coordinating with primary care providers. The results highlight the myriad approaches to readmission reduction and the complexity of developing effective strategies.</p>

<p>Reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions has become a national priority. Nearly 20% of Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and 34% within 90 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612464999">1</xref></sup> These readmissions cost an estimated $17.4 billion annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612464999">1</xref></sup> Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, hospitals and health systems with high 30-day readmission rates for 3 high-impact conditions—heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction—will be penalized financially starting October 1, 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612464999">2</xref></sup> This payment rule comprises one of a number of federal initiatives aimed at reducing unnecessary readmissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612464999">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The growing national focus on reducing readmission rates has caused many hospital and health system administrators to allocate significant resources toward readmission reduction strategies. However, evidence-based strategies to identify patients at high risk for readmissions and to reduce readmissions are limited. One recent review found that many of the published models designed to predict who is at highest risk for readmission perform poorly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612464999">4</xref></sup> Another review found that although there are a number of studies published on readmission reduction programs, most are single-institution, multifaceted quality improvement interventions without rigorous evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612464999">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pressure to act without clear guidance on what to do creates significant challenges for hospital administrators who are seeking to adopt strategies to reduce readmissions. Although some studies and reports describe and categorize readmission reduction strategies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612464999">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612464999"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612464999"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612464999">9</xref></sup> to the authors’ knowledge, no study has used qualitative methods to examine the process of developing and implementing organizational strategies to reduce readmissions employed by hospital administrators. In particular, the authors sought to identify and categorize the range of strategies that are being used among hospital administrative leaders as a first step in developing better methods to measure and evaluate the design and implementation of these approaches.</p>
<p>Qualitative methods have been used extensively in quality of care research, especially for the examination of quality of acute myocardial infarction care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612464999">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612464999"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612464999"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612464999"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612464999">14</xref></sup> Qualitative interviews enable detailed exploration of institutional characteristics, organizational processes, and specific strategies pertaining to readmission reduction. Thus, the authors designed a qualitative study consisting of semistructured interviews with hospital administrators with the goal of better understanding the range of approaches being used to reduce readmission rates, the challenges they currently face, and strategies they view as particularly successful. This approach allowed them to gain a more comprehensive picture of readmission prevention from an administrative perspective. It gave insight into the perceived strengths and weaknesses of hospital and institutional readmission reduction strategies as well as specific readmission prevention programs. In this way, the authors begin the process of defining the problem of readmission as it currently exists for hospital administrators.</p>

<title>Study Design and Sample</title>
<p>The authors designed a qualitative study using a purposive sample of hospitals with diverse characteristics and different 30-day readmission rates to identify a range of strategies and achieve thematic saturation. They generated a list of regional hospitals within the greater Philadelphia area from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Hospital Compare Web site, ranked by 30-day readmission rates. From this list a sample of hospitals was selected that differed in readmission rate, size, academic affiliation, and urban location. The authors contacted each hospital selected seeking to interview 2 administrators with different perspectives in order to obtain a more complete account of readmission reduction strategies. They continued to identify and contact additional hospitals for participation until saturation was reached, defined by no new emerging themes and no new information on identified themes. Of the 7 hospitals identified for inclusion in the study, 6 agreed to participate. Administrators at the seventh hospital did not return phone calls or e-mails within the study period. The study was exempt from human subjects review by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>From April 2011 to November 2011, the authors selected hospitals for in-depth, semistructured interviews. They first identified the chief medical officer (CMO), a quality officer, or the head of hospital medicine as the primary interviewee. Secondary interviewees were recommended by the primary interviewee. All the interviews were conducted by one of the study authors (AF), who had prior experience in qualitative methods, health services research, and quality improvement. A standard guide, which was developed by the research team after a review of the literature, was used for each interview (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612464999">Table 1</xref>). It was designed to elicit details about each hospital’s plans to prevent inappropriate readmissions from the interviewee’s perspective. This included eliciting the context for the development of the plans by asking how highly their institutions prioritized readmission reduction and the perceived causes for readmissions. Questions were open ended in order to encourage responses pertaining to readmission that were not predetermined. Each interview lasted approximately 30 minutes, was audiotaped, and then professionally transcribed.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Each transcript was entered into QSR NVivo 9.0 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) to facilitate coding and analysis. Two members of the team reviewed, coded, and analyzed the transcripts using modified grounded theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612464999">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612464999">16</xref></sup> An a priori list of codes derived from the research question (eg, readmission plan features, plan accountability, system characteristics) was used; codes also were created from ideas that emerged as the line-by-line reviews of the transcripts were conducted (eg, role of primary care vs specialty care). The research team met to review the coding structure and the coding output. Any discrepancies in coding were resolved by consensus. As key components of plans to reduce readmission emerged, they were discussed by the research team at periodic meetings and were vetted against known factors in the literature.</p>

<title>Reducing Readmissions Is a High Priority for Hospitals</title>
<p>Almost all the hospital administrators in the sample described readmission reduction as one of the top 5 priorities for their institutions, with a particular focus on reducing 30-day readmissions as future financial penalties will be tied to this benchmark. Although all cited impending federal penalties as a large factor driving their decision to prioritize readmission reduction, many administrators reported that addressing high readmission rates had been a rising part of their agendas for the past several years as part of a larger strategy to deliver high-quality care.</p>
<p>All administrators expressed concern about the possible financial ramifications of the increasing focus on readmissions. Some were concerned with the consequences of future penalties for high readmission rates, whereas others worried about the financial losses associated with fewer overall admissions. Administrators also were concerned about having the resources to start and sustain readmission reduction interventions, especially as resources have become increasingly limited over time. Furthermore, given the lack of strong data supporting readmission reduction systems, administrators wondered whether many readmissions were preventable at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612464999">
<title>Perceived Causes of Readmission</title>
<p>Administrators attributed higher rates of readmission to a number of factors that informed their readmission prevention strategies. Administrators at different institutions often identified similar factors, though they varied greatly in their perceived ability to impact these various factors. Factors contributing to readmission could be divided into 4 categories or levels: disease-level, population-level, institution-level, and system-level factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612464999">Table 3</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Disease-level causes of readmission were the most commonly cited factors contributing to a hospital’s rate of readmission. Hospital administrators noted that certain conditions placed patients at high risk for readmission (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612464999">Table 3</xref>). Thus, some hospitals organized their readmission prevention strategies around disease states, creating plans specific to each condition. Targeting disease-specific factors was perceived as an effective way to combat readmissions overall.</p>
<p>Administrators also identified population-level problems that contribute to readmission rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612464999">Table 3</xref>), noting that their hospitals serve a census of complex patient profiles with multiple comorbid conditions and difficult psychosocial situations. Their patients may be uninsured or live in areas underserved by primary care providers (PCPs), and thus may be unable to adequately follow up with a PCP after discharge. Others may face challenges related to poverty, mental health, substance abuse, or cultural and personal practices that interfere with their ability to care for themselves after discharge.</p>
<p>Although the hospital administrators in the sample agreed that readmissions caused by population-level factors are not completely preventable, they differed greatly in the extent to which they felt they could affect the population-level factors that contribute to hospital readmission. Furthermore, administrators noted that patients are living longer with more complex conditions. Administrators described readmissions related to these cases as not only unpreventable but also potentially necessary for patient care to optimize health.</p>
<p>The administrators in the sample also described institution-level factors that contribute to readmissions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612464999">Table 3</xref>). The administrators agreed that challenges at this level could be addressed by improving hospital policies, and the majority of prevention plan components were aimed at reducing the impact of these factors.</p>
<p>Finally, administrators identified system-level problems that affect readmission rates at their hospitals, especially poor coordination and communication among hospital providers and PCPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612464999">Table 3</xref>). Administrators found that their patients often were not able to make an appointment to see a PCP soon enough after discharge. Some of the population-level barriers that were identified to timely primary care follow-up were that patients may be uninsured, be insured by Medicaid, or come from underserved areas. Hospital administrators frequently felt that PCPs did not want to take on high-risk patients. Furthermore, because PCPs are often outside the hospital system, they were at times unaware of the outcomes of their patient’s hospitalization. Likewise, hospitals often did not receive communication from PCPs on recently discharged patients’ progress and risk. Again, hospital administrators differed greatly in their views on the hospital’s ability to influence these factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1062860612464999">
<title>Strategies for Reducing Readmissions</title>
<p>In response to these perceived causes of readmissions, the leaders interviewed have adopted a range of strategies to reduce readmissions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1062860612464999">Table 4</xref>). These 6 broad strategies include benchmarking, using prediction tools, designing interventions that target gaps in care transitions, using electronic health records (EHRs) to improve care transitions, recruiting frontline leaders to champion readmission reduction initiatives, and coordinating with PCPs. These 6 strategies are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<title>Track readmissions and use benchmarks</title>
<p>Leaders at several hospitals indicated that a key component of their strategy to reduce readmissions was to access clinical and administrative data in order to benchmark current performance. Most of the hospitals in the sample tracked readmissions, although the facilities differed widely in the oversight of data collection, amount and type of data gathered, the length of data collection, frequency of report generation, methods of sharing this information, and uses of these data. EHRs and electronic data collection systems appeared vital to the process of data collection, but the capabilities of these systems varied among the hospitals. Each hospital developed a different approach to tracking. For example, one hospital created an electronically generated daily report that was shared with all units, enabling each team to track its own patients and identify readmitted patients. Another hospital generated monthly metrics that were shared with hospital administration and leaders at a team meeting, while a third tracked disease-specific readmission rates by year. A fourth hospital administrator reported that his team had just begun to track readmissions data and had yet to see results. Rather than following overall readmission rates, some hospitals tracked factors they thought were related to readmission rates (eg, adequate physician communication) through postdischarge patient surveys.</p>
<p>One of the most significant challenges to tracking readmissions was the lack of communication with area hospitals. Several administrators noted that because local hospitals did not communicate with each other about readmissions, a patient could be discharged from one facility and readmitted to another without being tracked as a readmission.</p>
<p>The ability to collect data in order to benchmark progress and potentially target high-risk patients was seen as vital by all administrators, and often the successful implementation of a data collection system was a central part of readmission prevention plans. However, there was no consensus as to which data were most useful, how the data should be collected, and how the data should be used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1062860612464999">
<title>Use prediction tools to identify high-risk patients</title>
<p>Administrators often commented on the potential value of formal prediction tools to conduct risk assessments and to identify patients most likely to be readmitted. One hospital conducted a systematic review of the records of patients who were readmitted in order to identify causes of readmission, and then attempted to use these data to generate prediction rules. Another hospital adapted a paper-based risk-assessment tool from a national initiative. Several components from this tool were later integrated into the EHR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1062860612464999">
<title>Adopt disease-specific or generic intervention programs based on patient population and institutional factors</title>
<p>The individual components of readmission reduction plans differed by institution, though some had shared features. Some programs were disease specific, focused on high-impact conditions such as heart failure, while others targeted specific processes, such as improving transitions or reducing readmissions for all patients. Programs included a heart failure telemonitoring program, a postdischarge clinic staffed by hospitalists, and the assignment of case managers, pharmacists, and transition coaches to facilitate safer transitions. These strategies were developed to target patients at high risk for readmission and address gaps in the existing transition of care plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1062860612464999">
<title>Leverage EHRs to improve care transitions</title>
<p>At some institutions, EHRs were used to improve transitions of care. For example, after residents at one hospital became frustrated with frequent readmissions, they led improvements to the EHR that included the electronic communication of discharge summaries to PCPs. At another institution, EHRs were used to improve the format and content of the discharge summary by including information about medication reconciliation, diet, and activities.</p>
<p>Several administrators noted frustrations incorporating their EHR system into the plans to prevent readmission. For example, although EHRs improved communication among physicians within a hospital system, physicians outside of the system could not access the electronic data. Thus, it was especially difficult to communicate with PCPs, a problem identified by many administrators. In one hospital, the EHR was specifically designed to easily send records to PCPs. This helped integrate primary care into the patient’s medical team, prevent miscommunication, and aid in creating high-quality transitional care. Administrators also struggled with usable interfaces for physicians and easy-to-read summaries for patients, and many emphasized the importance of providing more readable communications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1062860612464999">
<title>Identify responsibility at multiple levels for reduction plans</title>
<p>The senior leadership at several of the institutions championed the readmission reduction plans. For example, at one institution the corporate VP, supported by the CEO of the health system, led all of the initiatives, which helped make preventing readmissions a top priority throughout the institution.</p>
<p>However, hospitals varied in their ability to recruit frontline staff to join new initiatives. At one institution, the senior leadership led the readmission reduction effort but created buy-in from stakeholders by forming a committee led by the CMO, chief nursing officer, and key frontline physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and home care staff. The goal of the committee was to redesign the discharge process for heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction patients. The committee also had to approve all new readmission projects started by other frontline staff, which helped assure alignment of new initiatives.</p>
<p>At most institutions, it was difficult to recruit frontline leaders for initiatives, especially physicians. Hospitalists who concentrate their time on a single unit and are focused on process improvement were frequently identified as prime movers in designing readmission plans. To adequately staff new transitions initiatives, one institution created a new position specifically to improve transitions and reduce readmissions. At another institution, readmission prevention “champions” were recruited and given a stipend to lead frontline interventions.</p>
<p>One hospital administrator described an initiative aimed at elevating the priority of care transitions for providers and creating buy-in. The hospital created videos of patients who had been readmitted in which the patients described the problems they had faced and the physical and emotional consequences of being inadequately prepared for discharge. These videos were then shown to physicians and care providers in order to increase vigilance in discharge practices by emphasizing that readmissions and transitional care have consequences for patients as well as for the hospital system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1062860612464999">
<title>Coordinate with PCPs and ensure follow-up</title>
<p>Timely follow-up with a PCP was cited repeatedly as part of the plan to reduce readmissions. Hospitals rely on quick follow-up with PCPs to monitor newly discharged patients. However, patients frequently are unable to schedule follow-up appointments quickly enough, in part because of the limited capacity of PCPs; hospitals often struggle with issues of communication and continuity in care during this critical transition. Although administrators consistently identified the lack of coordination as a problem, they differed in their approaches to solving it.</p>
<p>Some administrators favored closer communication and coordination with primary care practices. Several administrators stated that their staff would schedule short-term follow-up for their patients. A few administrators noted that many PCPs were concerned with the high no-show rates for post–hospital discharges. One administrator advocated that all patients should have a scheduled follow-up appointment prior to discharge and that patients, with assistance from hospital staff, should make their own follow-up appointments prior to discharge. This administrator believed that if patients scheduled their own follow-up appointments, then they should be available to attend the appointment, thereby reducing no-show rates. Overall, several administrators stated that it was difficult to ensure that patients received consistent care after discharge, which likely contributed to preventable readmissions. Administrators described the need to reach out to private practice physicians in order to provide better care for these vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>Although building relationships with community PCPs was favored by some hospital systems, hospitals with a larger number of PCPs championed the concept of a “medical home” and preferred that care be kept within the hospital’s health system after discharge if possible. In these cases, a shared EHR facilitated smooth communication between primary care and specialist providers through mutual access. This approach, they asserted, also solved the problem of patients who lived in underserved areas being able to obtain timely appointments with PCPs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The interviews illustrate that the development and implementation of readmission reduction strategies is a complex process. The authors found that readmission reduction was a rising priority in the sample of hospitals and identified perceived risk factors for readmission by administrators, organizational strategies for readmission reduction, and challenges to successful implementation of readmission reduction strategies.</p>
<p>The authors found that perceived risk factors for readmission were not just about patient characteristics such as disease-level factors, but extended to population-level, institution-level, and system-level factors. Yet most published research on readmissions focuses on individual patient factors. A recent systematic review of formal readmission risk models suggests that these models frequently perform poorly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612464999">4</xref></sup> One possible reason is because they focus on patient characteristics and do not adequately account for system-level and institutional-level factors, such as poor communication between hospitals and out-of-system PCPs, limited internal benchmarking capabilities, and low-quality medication reconciliation processes. Such structural factors interact with patient factors to generate a patient’s risk for readmission, and thus models that do not account for system and institutional factors may have limited accuracy. More research is needed to understand the role of these factors in high readmission rates.</p>
<p>The authors identified 6 broad categories of strategies employed by administrators: (<italic>a</italic>) tracking readmissions and performance, (<italic>b</italic>) using prediction tools to identify high-risk patients, (<italic>c</italic>) implementing disease-specific or generic readmission reduction programs, (<italic>d</italic>) adopting EHR-based strategies to improve transitions, (<italic>e</italic>) recruiting frontline staff for program leadership, and (<italic>f</italic>) coordinating with PCPs. This framework supplements the taxonomy presented by Hansen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612464999">5</xref></sup> which divided 12 interventions into 3 temporal categories: “Predischarge Intervention,” “Postdischarge Intervention,” and “Intervention Bridging the Transition.” The studies included in the review generally focused on specific changes to care transition processes. The authors found that hospital organizational strategies addressing readmissions extended beyond this taxonomy. For example, tracking readmissions, using prediction tools, and recruiting frontline staff are all organizational strategies used at multiple institutions, yet there is little evidence to guide administrators on how to successfully implement these strategies. A more complete taxonomy would include these organization-level strategies that do not fit into the temporal-based taxonomy that is currently in use.</p>
<p>The major limitations to this study are related to the size of the sample. This sample of 6 hospitals in the same geographic area may have limited the ability to identify all the categories of organizational strategies and to capture the full depth of each category that was identified. For example, no strategies were identified that involved alternative payment and delivery models or partnering with skilled nursing facilities and community-based organizations. No rural hospitals were included in the sample. Speaking with only 2 administrators at each hospital and not including frontline workers (eg, nurses, social workers, case managers) may have prevented the authors from gathering a complete picture of readmission reduction strategies within each institution. However, a level of thematic saturation was achieved in the data that were collected, providing some assurance that, for the sampling frame used, the major strategies being employed by hospitals attempting to reduce readmissions were identified.</p>
<p>In summary, this research demonstrates that reducing readmissions has become a top priority at these hospitals and that administrators have allocated significant resources to readmission reduction strategies even during a time of increasingly scarce resources. There have been a number of editorials questioning the validity, appropriateness, and potential unintended consequences of focusing on readmission reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612464999">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612464999"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612464999"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612464999">20</xref></sup> This research illustrates the complexity of developing readmission reduction strategies and the numerous challenges faced by hospital administrators.</p>
<p>This research also highlights the myriad approaches for addressing readmission reduction in the face of little empirical evidence of what does and does not work. The categories of organizational strategies to reduce readmissions that were identified could help inform future comparative effectiveness research aimed at identifying empirically sound organizational approaches to reducing readmissions.</p>
