<p>The second edition of <italic>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Board Review: Pearls of Wisdom</italic> offers significant improvements over the first edition (published in 2006), including 18 new chapters and many more illustrations. It does, however, remain true to its original form, with the 90-chapter text presenting rapid-fire questions and answers covering the entire field of plastic surgery, from the history of the specialty to current, complex reconstructive procedures.</p>
<p>Written by recognized experts in subspecialty areas of plastic surgery, each chapter covers a specific topic or surgical procedure. One correct answer (in the opinion of the author of the chapter) is given for each question. No attempt is made to provide extraneous facts or background, but most of the chapters have well-organized, pertinent references.</p>
<p>The preface promises that by reviewing each topic at a time, “[the reader] can easily identify areas of strength and weakness and focus on either one as [he or she] sees fit.” I found this to be very accurate, as I quickly progressed through chapters covering areas of the subspecialty that I see in my practice on a regular basis, but read more slowly the clinical sections containing new content, basic science I needed to review, or areas of plastic surgery I rarely encounter. The book’s “hollow bullet” format allows the reader to complete the question in any way he or she would like: for example, place an “x” if the answer is known or a “?” if one needs to look it up in a text. I found that covering the answers with a ruler or paper while reading the question was a great way to test basic knowledge.</p>
<p>Not intended to be a textbook of plastic surgery, <italic>Pearls</italic> should be used as a study guide to bring the reader back to basic comprehensive texts in plastic surgery or to those written with subspecialty interests in mind. If nothing else is read in the book, the first chapter (“Strategies for Studying,” written by Julia Corcoran, MD, MHPE) is a “must read.” The sections in this chapter teach the reader how to take an inventory of knowledge, make a “plan of attack” for studying, and set goals for learning. It also teaches study techniques and outlines strategies for answering multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Having spent decades writing and editing MCQ, I appreciate Dr Corcoran’s advice to “answer the question first” and not get confused by the distractors. Questions in high-stakes exams are written clearly to have only one correct answer, although the distractors may come close to being correct. If a test-taker can read the question and answer it without looking at the choices, he or she can move on without needing the full minute allowed for each question. The value of this study guide is to train the reader to answer the question with only one answer, a technique that then can be applied to any MCQ. In the final chapter, Drs Matthew A. Thomas and Samuel J. Lin present carefully selected “high-yield” questions and answers that can be read easily during moments of respite in long days and shared with colleagues in a quick-quizzing format. This chapter is heavily referenced with key textbooks and important peer-reviewed articles. Although more illustrations were added since the first edition, I still believe more of them would be helpful. Simple line drawings would be useful, in lieu of complicated artwork and photographs.</p>
<p>Is <italic>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Board Review: Pearls of Wisdom</italic> truly a review designed for the reader to gain certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS)? My quick answer would be, “That depends.” It depends on the basic fund of knowledge the reader has gathered in residency and whether the depth of that knowledge has been increased through mastery of basic plastic surgery principles and techniques as learned in textbooks, conferences, journals, and clinics and operating rooms. It depends on the individual’s approach to the book, because simply memorizing the short answer without understanding the principles behind it will do little good when one is sitting at the computer in the test center. Most of all, it depends on how one views the certification exams.</p>
<p>In plastic surgery, cognitive knowledge is measured by the Written Examination of the Board and by the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) examination. Each is an MCQ exam testing different aspects of knowledge—the first given for initial certification and the second testing knowledge of practitioners in practice for 10 or more years. Although definitely helpful to the practicing surgeon preparing for MOC, this book could easily be supplemented by the MOC Study Guide, produced by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</p>
<p>Measurement of cognitive knowledge is important but is only the first step in the certification process. The all-important Oral Examination is designed to test application of that knowledge in clinical situations and is definitely not constructed as a cognitive examination. The candidate is asked to construct a treatment plan after being presented with a variety of clinical situations, have alternatives to the initial plan, recognize and treat complications, and generally demonstrate to experienced examiners that he or she is a safe, effective, and ethical practitioner. Learning the rapid-fire answers to the questions presented in this book will have only limited application in the Oral Examination because they are not likely to be asked.</p>
<p>Considering the above, perhaps the reader should view the book as an excellent way to judge knowledge of plastic surgery facts and not rely on it as the best preparation for ABPS examinations. The title is “catchy” and no doubt intended to capture the readership of those preparing for board examinations, but the textbook must be read with an understanding of its purpose; again, as stated in the preface, it is a “study guide for plastic surgery residents, fellows, and first-year attendings.”</p>
