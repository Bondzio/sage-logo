<p>Although considered a peripheral concern for the majority of sociologists, the analysis of music and its dissemination into social groupings provides a more than adequate window through which to view the relations between cultural development, economic structures, and technological change. Chris Rojek demonstrates this admirably through an eminently sociological approach to understanding the formation and maintenance of pop music in the contemporary world. What is specifically important about this book, however, is depth of the analysis, as it spans the process of music production from the early oral traditions all the way to the now common practices of file-sharing and internet radio.</p>
<p>Rojek’s primary argument focuses on the notion of “pop culture,” a term which goes beyond the traditional approaches to popular music, as it seeks to incorporate the range of experience from artist production to the evolving technologies of performance, reproduction, and dissemination. This is demonstrated through his concept of “cultural de-differentiation”; a process whereby the traditional genre boundaries dissolve into less concise demarcations, and the avenues of dissemination move toward an aggregation of previously disparate forms (such as the marketing of ring-tones or internet streaming). This process, Rojek argues, leads to the generation of cultural monadism among individuals, who shift their cultural consumption patterns through a distillation of broad cultural forms, producing a private form of gestural currency and cultural savvy which is simultaneously rationalized and uniquely individual. This transitioning between various cultural fronts allows for a passive consumption which lends itself to the translation of political, economic, and cultural issues into the establishment of gestural culture, or the expression of commitment and solidarity as a form of representation as opposed to a basis for action. One can hear echos of the Frankfurt School in this work, but such a comparison could be considered inappropriate given the nature of Rojek’s analysis.</p>
<p>Despite what seems like a relatively simple topic, Rojek’s book is both complex and engaging. Additionally, the book also provides a concise look at the empirical developments and perspectives in the study of popular music. Therefore, this book is best recommended as a companion to undergraduate courses on popular music (or even contemporary Western culture). Furthermore, scholars who focus on culture, music, and the intersections between technology and society should find that Rojek’s book is a worthwhile read on a fascinating subject.</p>
