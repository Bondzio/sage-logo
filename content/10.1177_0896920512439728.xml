<abstract>
<p>In this article, we demonstrate the critical value of Loïc Wacquant’s reworking of Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of the bureaucratic field for the study of nonprofit social services. In particular, we suggest that this approach offers a richer understanding of the neoliberalization of nonprofit social service agencies. To illustrate this point, we draw upon interviews with nonprofit social service providers in Winnipeg, Manitoba, examining the field competition between welfare and neoliberal orientations to social service practice, as nonprofit agency managers seek to adapt to the shifting conditions of the bureaucratic field. Building upon Wacquant’s analysis, we argue that the welfare dispositions presented in our interviews are inadequate to protect the social services from neoliberal restructuring. Instead, we present the reflexive practices articulated by Indigenous social service agencies as a model for a counter-transposition that could offer a more powerful challenge to the neoliberalization of the bureaucratic field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following the work of Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512439728">Bourdieu (1994)</xref> and Loïc Wacquant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">2010</xref>), nonprofit social services can be situated within the bureaucratic field – ‘a splintered space of forces vying over the definition and distribution of public goods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2010</xref>: 200). It is within this social space that nonprofit actors seek resources such as funding or access to clients, fill service gaps left vacant by the rollback of welfare provisions, and embody practices that will allow them to appear competent before funders and other resource gatekeepers. Thus, the conditions of the bureaucratic field structure and shape contemporary social service practice. In this article, we demonstrate the critical value of Wacquant’s reworking of Bourdieu’s concept of the bureaucratic field for the study of nonprofit social services. In particular, we draw upon this framework to examine the competition between welfare- and neoliberal-oriented managerial dispositions possessed by nonprofit social service agents. We argue that welfare practices offer an inadequate challenge to the neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field. Instead, based on the critical reflexivity exhibited by Indigenous social service providers in our sample, we seek to promote increased social service resistance to the neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field, calling for the mobilization of counter-transpositions that challenge structural inequalities.</p>

<title>Nonprofit Social Services, the Bureaucratic Field, and Neoliberalism</title>
<p>Nonprofit social services are an area of paid and voluntary employment in which many actors are inspired by, or at least profess, a desire to contribute to the public good through the amelioration of pressing social problems. Based on this ideal, one might expect the practices that animate nonprofit social services to operate in accordance with a nonprofit ‘spirit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512439728">Bush, 1992</xref>), through which actors are altruistically oriented toward those whom they seek to help. Along these lines, nonprofit workers would be guided by ‘the spirit of cooperation and participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512439728">Bush, 1992</xref>: 392; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512439728">Brainard and Siplon, 2004</xref>) and a ‘charismatic energy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920512439728">O’Neill, 1989</xref>: 182), both of which may be motivated by a spiritual or secular commitment to a cause. But, although a cooperative ethos is not entirely absent from nonprofit social services, it increasingly rests alongside competitive business-like practices, as more and more nonprofit agencies are required or encouraged to take an entrepreneurial approach to service delivery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512439728">Baines, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512439728">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512439728">Ciancanelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920512439728">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920512439728">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920512439728">Frumkin and Andre-Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920512439728">Skloot, 2000</xref>) and to work in collaboration with the for-profit sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512439728">Brinckerhoff, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There was, of course, no golden age of nonprofit social services. The previous welfare era of service delivery did not always meet its cooperative and care-based ideals. Indeed, some have suggested that this era was marred by paternalism and disciplinary controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920512439728">Cohen, 1985</xref>), too focused on individual rather than social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920512439728">Scott et al., 2006</xref>), and facilitated the expert-driven governance of everyday life through therapeutic techniques and other strategies of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920512439728">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920512439728">Rose, 1993</xref>). However, the current era of neoliberalism – a period typically defined in terms of state withdrawal from service provision, deregulation, increased privatization, and the liberation of markets – presents new dangers, since it takes the entrepreneurial individual situated within a competitive market as its basic unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920512439728">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>). In terms of nonprofit social services, this viewpoint discourages activities that target unjust social conditions rather than risky and irresponsible individuals.</p>
<p>The neoliberal era has also witnessed the promotion of social entrepreneurialism in the ‘third sector’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512439728">Brinkerhoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920512439728">Emerson and Twersky, 1996</xref>), whereby entrepreneurial principles are harnessed to the task of addressing social problems. Such principles include organizational and managerial strategies designed to help nonprofit and voluntary agencies generate income and meet the needs of their clients with greater efficiency. Critics argue that social entrepreneurialism threatens to impact both donations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920512439728">Zimmerman and Dart, 1998</xref>) and the tax status of nonprofits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920512439728">Weisbrod, 2004</xref>), as people come to view such agencies as commercial entities responsible for sustaining their own services through income generating activities. It is also a concern that the democratic contribution of nonprofit agencies will be limited if they focus too much energy on revenue rather than public education, civic engagement, and advocacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920512439728">Cooney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920512439728">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920512439728">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920512439728">Eikenberry and Kluver, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920512439728">Eikenberry (2009)</xref>, for example, notes the dangers of the marketization of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in terms of lessening their contribution to deliberative democracy and the collective resolution of pressing social problems.</p>
<p>Increasingly government funders, but also nonprofit funding bodies or foundations like the United Way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920512439728">Roelofs, 2007</xref>), expect service provision agencies to model the ‘best practices’ of business. Indeed, the focus on best practises is characteristic of the ‘new public management’ approach, which emphasizes organizational strategies crafted toward maximizing worker efficiency and competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512439728">Briskman and Muetzelfeldt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920512439728">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920512439728">Evans and Shields, 2002</xref>). Under the logic of the new public management model, it is also held that a social service agency must be accountable to its funders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512439728">Arnove and Pinede, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920512439728">Roelofs, 2007</xref>), providing clear ‘deliverables’ on ‘invested’ dollars. There is some debate in the literature on the consequences, as well as effectiveness, of current practices of accountability and outcome measurement in the nonprofit social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512439728">Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512439728">Carman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512439728">Ciancanelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920512439728">Hoefer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920512439728">Speckbacher, 2003</xref>), and much depends on the type of accountability measures implemented – whether they are of a rule-based variety that imposes pre-set standards of financial and outcome assessment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920512439728">Ebrahim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920512439728">Morrison and Saliplante, 2007</xref>), directed toward verifying the agency has met its promised commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512439728">Benjamin, 2008</xref>), or based more on the assumptions or goals of funding agencies than nonprofit mission statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920512439728">Cutt and Murray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920512439728">Ebrahim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0896920512439728">Tassie et al., 1996</xref>). And while nonprofit service providers have found ways to negotiate such expectations to allow greater flexibility in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512439728">Benjamin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920512439728">Ebrahim, 2003</xref>), this too often means that official value is not attributed to service provider activities that go above or beyond the objectives set out for a particular accountability program – a problem that in part stems from the fact that funding is increasingly targeted toward specific programs and not offered for general nonprofit agency activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512439728">Ciancanelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920512439728">Eakin and Graham, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While these and other changes to social service practices have been noted in the literature, largely absent is a theoretical framework for situating these changes within a broader structural context. While researchers and social service professionals are painfully aware that a new set of business-oriented management practices have been creeping into nonprofit social service delivery, and suspect this is a result of a still-expanding neoliberal order, the conceptual connection between the neoliberal era and changing social service practices has been under-theorized. To contribute to an understanding of the neoliberal restructuring of nonprofit social services and its relationship to a broader set of structural developments, we situate nonprofit social services within what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512439728">Bourdieu (1994)</xref> refers to as the ‘bureaucratic field’.</p>
<p>According to Bourdieu, a field is ‘a network, or a configuration, of objective relations between positions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512439728">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>: 97). Within such networks competition occurs for the symbolic power to determine the valuational standards of the field. In the bureaucratic field, this competition occurs along two primary axes. Across one axis, the ‘higher state nobility’ – the political elite who are committed to implementing neoliberal policies – do battle with the ‘lower state nobility’ comprised of agents who implement and carry out these governing policies as well as other traditional governmental tasks. Across the other axis, the ‘left hand’ and the ‘right hand’ of the state struggle with one another. Whereas the ‘left hand’ refers to those government departments and government-sponsored social service agencies that offer social protection and support (e.g. public education, health, housing, and employment), the ‘right hand’ consists of institutional actors assigned with the task of disciplining subjects to the economic rigors of the neoliberal market.</p>
<p>Loïc Wacquant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">2010</xref>) extends Bourdieu’s work on the bureaucratic field by locating police, courts, and prisons on the right hand of the state. Although this is a seemingly minor addition, it has great significance for comprehending neoliberal statecraft. In particular, one gains a sense of how an expanding carceral network casts its shadow upon the left hand of the state, which is itself undergoing a set of transformations – namely, the contraction of traditional welfare services alongside the spread of disciplinary, punitive, and surveillant workfare policies designed to compel marginalized individuals to accept low-wage and insecure employment. Thus entwined, the right and left hands of the state impose a ‘double regulation’ and ‘carceral-assistential mesh’ that is the peculiar product of the neoliberal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">Wacquant 2009</xref>: xviii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">2010</xref>: 210). As Wacquant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">2009</xref>: 103, emphasis in the original) notes, ‘like its “prisonfare” counterpart, the workfare revolution is a <italic>specifically political project</italic> aimed at remaking not only the market but also, and above all, the state itself’. Thus, under this conceptualization, the state is not simply a waning institution diminished by the transformed power relations of neoliberal globalization. Although a laissez-faire shrinking of the state may occur at the top of the social order, offering increased market freedoms to the elite, at the bottom the state expands and intensifies its means of control through imprisonment and workfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonprofit social services are situated within the bureaucratic field because their activities are funded or facilitated by the state. They are creatures of the state in that their primary impetus is to cover off, supplement, or complement programs and responsibilities that might otherwise be perceived to be the sole prerogative of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2009</xref>). Thus, changes such as the rise of social entrepreneurialism and the new public management can be understood in relation to the neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field. This is because nonprofit service providers are necessarily attuned to the conditions of this field, since their survival depends on their ability to embody and emulate its rules and procedures, and thus they attach themselves to new procedures designed to meet the disciplinary demands of the neoliberalizing bureaucratic field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0896920512439728">
<title>The Neoliberal Restructuring of Social Services within the Bureaucratic Field</title>
<p>Before examining the specific effects of neoliberal restructuring on nonprofit social service practices, some discussion of neoliberalism is necessary. Neoliberalism as a concept is often treated in either narrow economic terms or broad statements whereby it seems to cover nearly everything and anything. Wacquant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">2010</xref>: 213), in contrast, seeks to give this concept a degree of sociological specificity:<disp-quote>
<p>Neoliberalism is a <italic>transnational political project</italic> aiming to remake the nexus of market, state, and citizenship from above. This project is carried by a new global ruling class in the making, composed of heads and senior executives of transnational firms, high-ranking politicians, state managers and top officials of multinational organizations (the OECD, WTO, IMF, World Bank, and the European Union), and cultural-technical experts in their employ (chief among them economists, lawyers, and communications professionals with germane training and mental categories in the different countries).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This cadre of actors operates in the bureaucratic field where they promote four key institutional logics:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920512439728" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(1) Economic deregulation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(2) Welfare state devolution, retraction, and recomposition;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(3) An expansive, intrusive, and proactive penal apparatus; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(4) The cultural trope of individual responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2010</xref>: 213).</p></list-item></list>
<p>These four characteristics are evident in the changes witnessed in the social service sector of the bureaucratic field. To begin, economic deregulation is promoted not solely in terms of lessening state oversight of corporate activities, but also as a model for organizing all forms of human activity, including the provision of public goods such as social services. In this respect, the promotion of ‘business-like’ management practices and the ‘new public management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512439728">Bush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512439728">Baines, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512439728">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920512439728">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920512439728">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920512439728">Salamon, 1993</xref>) can be understood as responses to a deregulatory environment in which all actors, collective and individual, are expected to be efficient, responsible, flexible, and cost-effective and deliver measurable outcomes in order to win further funding on a free and open market.</p>
<p>Second, the devolution of the welfare state has resulted in the increased offloading of vital public services to the nonprofit and community sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920512439728">Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920512439728">Hall and Reed, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920512439728">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920512439728">Salamon, 1993</xref>). This creates opportunities in the social service sector, where agencies can seek to secure agency survival (at least temporarily) by offering at a lower cost services formerly delivered by the state. However, service providers are seldom able to operate offloaded services in an autonomous manner, since the funding relationship developed through offloading is framed as a partnership with government, and partners are expected to work in a cooperative manner, meeting their shared objectives.</p>
<p>Third, the expansion of carceral networks means that social services are increasingly viewed in relation to criminal justice objectives. Increasingly, services seemingly disconnected from crime and punishment, such as welfare, housing, employment, and child and family services, are reconfigured toward disciplinary strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920512439728">Schram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2009</xref>) and ‘deputized’ to fulfill latent criminal justice functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920512439728">Woolford and Thomas, 2011</xref>). In Manitoba, provincial ministries, such as Education and Healthy Living, Youth and Seniors, have been re-worked as part of broad crime control strategy that begins early in a child’s life, assessing his or her risks of future criminal activity. Risk evaluations continue through their interactions with the education system, as well as employment, welfare, and housing services, as the agencies working in these areas are enlisted to the project of policing the marginalized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920512439728">Woolford and Curran, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the trope of individual responsibility frames the ideal outputs of social serving agencies, since ‘clients’ are more and more encouraged to learn to become self-providers, managers of risk, and entrepreneurial agents equipped for survival in a precarious neoliberal market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2009</xref>). Individualized programming, and individualizing outcome measurement and accountability criteria set through the ‘partnership’ between nonprofit social service providers and government, mean that the capacity of service users to assume the responsibilities of neoliberal citizenship are of utmost concern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920512439728">
<title>Habitus and Dispositions within the Bureaucratic Field</title>
<p>With these emerging field conditions, transformations within nonprofit social service practices must be understood as more than trends or fashions in the practices of management; instead, they are adaptations in habitus shaped to a specific, and changing, field of social practice. Habitus refers to one’s ‘feel for the game’, or, in other words, a set of ‘dispositions acquired through experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512439728">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 9) that allow one to react to situations that arise within a field of practice without the need to actively plot one’s moves. The dispositions of habitus therefore operate akin to a toolset that practitioners can automatically draw upon to seek success within their appointed terrain. One’s habitus is a product of one’s class background, which, in Bourdieu’s lexicon, is comprised of the capital, or power, one possesses in terms of one’s economic (e.g. wealth), cultural (e.g. knowledge), social (e.g. networks), and symbolic (e.g. prestige or honor) position in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512439728">Bourdieu, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512439728">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>). Depending upon which types of power are most valued in the field, actors can better embody a ‘feel for the game’ if they are rich in that form of capital. For example, if we think of nonprofit social services as part of the bureaucratic field, actors within this sector should be able to demonstrate their competence or distinction within the field by drawing on the resources of their individual habitus, whether in terms of economic resources, knowledge, networks, or prestige and status.</p>
<p>The field is not a static space, and its valuational standards are the subject of competition. Competition can involve contests to determine what stakes and practices are to be valued within the field, such as when legal professionals compete over the sanctification of a particular interpretation of the legal code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512439728">Bourdieu, 1987</xref>). In such struggles, therefore, the very stakes of the game can be at issue, at times producing instability within the typically regular and regularizing confines of the field. Moreover, the habitus, despite being a set of ‘durable, transposable, dispositions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512439728">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 53), nonetheless allows individuals to adapt to changing and contradictory circumstances. Adaptation occurs through the accentuation of dispositions that were previously less valued and therefore held dormant, the redirection of previously valued dispositions toward a new set of stakes, or the transposition of dispositions, which refers to the capacity of agents to transfer a broad range of practices attuned to another field of activity into a new field.</p>
<p>When studying the conditions of the bureaucratic field in the era of neoliberal restructuring, it is important to analyze the habitus of agents, since this is the store of dispositions that allow individuals to participate in and adjust to the restructuring of a field. It has been argued above that the social services sector of the bureaucratic field is undergoing a shift from a therapeutic, welfare model toward an increasingly business-oriented model that reflects the entrepreneurial and managerial sensibilities a neoliberal ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512439728">Baines, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512439728">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920512439728">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920512439728">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920512439728">Salamon, 1993</xref>). With this transition, individuals experience a renewed struggle to define the stakes of their field. These changes have consequences for the dispositions of habitus, as stakeholders draw on their dispositional resources to maintain or challenge the new boundaries of the field.</p>
<p>In this study, statements drawn from our interviews with nonprofit service providers in Winnipeg are used to illustrate the ways in which such dispositional adjustments are evident when nonprofit managers describe their practices in relation to the competition to define the stakes of the bureaucratic field. In short, we explore how certain dispositions allow practitioners to internalize, adapt to, or resist this dynamic field of practice. Our emphasis is on what we refer to as welfare and neoliberal dispositions, and the ways in which these dispositions are translated into nonprofit practices. In contrast, in our usage, ‘reflexivity’ is achieved when an actor moves beyond automatically exhibiting a feel for the game and instead reflects on existing social conditions and orients her or his practices in a more consciously strategic manner (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512439728">Adkins, 2003</xref>). Through our analysis, we advance the work done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920512439728">Wacquant (2009)</xref> by offering a closer look at the continuing field struggle faced by social serving agency managers, their adapted dispositions, and strategies for resistance in the face of neoliberal restructuring. But before we do so, a note on the methodology of this study is required.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Our data come from 25 one- to two-hour semi-structured interviews conducted in the summer of 2009 with inner-city nonprofit service providers in Winnipeg, Manitoba. These interviews were selected using a purposive sampling strategy through which we sought participants from a number of service areas: offender reintegration, youth services, shelter and housing, immigration and refugee services, employment services, addiction and rehabilitation, women and families, food, and clothing. The agencies at which participants worked ranged in size from small (staff of 5 or fewer) to large (staff of 50 or more). All of the agencies have been in existence for five years or more, and possessed budgets that ranged in size from $50,000 to $2 million). Most of these agencies were secular/humanist in their approach to social services, although two of them expressed a specifically spiritual mission. In these respects, we selected a cross-section of participants from the key service areas in Winnipeg’s inner city (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920512439728">Comack and Silver, 2006</xref>). We also drew upon 25 related interviews with inner-city youth service providers, which were not conducted with this project in mind, but covered similar issues of concern: namely, inner-city agency practices in the face of changing social and political demands. Both sets of interviews can be described as ‘lifeworld’ interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920512439728">Kvale and Brinkman, 2009</xref>) in that they sought to probe how respondents make sense of their social world; in particular, we asked respondents to reflect upon and discuss how they interpret and deal with issues such as service user and agency responsibilities, funding competition, board and agency management, program evaluation, and relationships with key stakeholders, including service users.</p>
<p>Interviews were transcribed and coded by hand, by both authors, according to a set of neoliberal themes (i.e. entrepreneurialism, risk-management, accountability, responsibility, and outcome measures), welfare themes (i.e. social justice, human needs, community empowerment, therapeutic helping, and advocacy), or reflexive practices (e.g. strategies designed to disrupt or counter dominant trends in the nonprofit field).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512439728">1</xref></sup> These themes were generated through our literature review of critical studies of social service practice, as well as informed by our reading of Bourdieu, Wacquant, and other related work on neoliberalism (e.g. governmentality studies). The analytical method employed in this article is a discourse analysis in which discourse is understood to reflect the habitus and social position of the person who produces it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512439728">Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999</xref>). This is an approach that is compatible with strategies derived from critical discourse analysis (CDA), although our project only borrows partially from the CDA literature, since its analytical thrust is primarily derived from the work of Bourdieu and Wacquant. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512439728">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999)</xref>, for example, have argued that Bourdieu’s work offers a theoretical framework that can guide critical discourse analysis, allowing researchers to understand discourses within a larger set of social practices organized around the concept of the field. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512439728">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999)</xref> suggest that Bourdieu’s framework can also benefit from the attention critical discourse analysis scholars pay to intertextuality and interdiscursivity, which would better enable researchers to critically examine relations between fields and the transposition of discourses across fields. It is this latter insight from CDA that we drew most heavily upon in our analysis, so that we were alert to cross-field blendings, borrowings, adaptations, and transpositions that characterized interviewee statements, in addition to the dispositions evident in their discourses.</p>
<p>Also, given the complexity of the discourses represented in our interviews, coding variances were an ongoing concern. These variances were resolved through discussion to arrive, whenever possible, at a shared interpretation; however, it was also recognized, in keeping with the CDA literature, that statements made by respondents would not necessarily fit into only one discrete category. Therefore, an open coding category was included among our pre-selected coding categories to capture statements that overlapped or did not clearly fit our coding themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512439728">Ainsworth and Hardy, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Nonprofit Dispositions in Winnipeg</title>
<p>In Manitoba, social service agencies operate under competing neoliberalisms. At the Federal level, the ruling Conservative Party does not veer too far from the classic neoliberalism of Hayak and Friedman. In general, the Conservative government is committed to market deregulation and a social policy platform that is almost uniformly individualistic and guided by an ideological belief in the necessity of a responsible citizenry that embraces autonomy and active employment. In addition, the federal government has sought to toughen Canadian criminal justice policy through vehicles such as the Safe Streets and Communities Act, put forward in September 2011, which, among other things, introduces mandatory minimum sentences for a range of offences (e.g. drug and weapons offences). In contrast, Manitoba’s New Democratic Party (NDP), as a social democratic governing party, has imported British Third Way discourses as a means to smuggle in neoliberal policy objectives that allow for the offloading of services, individual responsibilization, and risk management. Like left-leaning governments in much of the world, the Manitoba NDP carries these tasks out by aligning them with ostensibly progressive concerns, such as by reframing service offloading as a form of community-building (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920512439728">Woolford and Thomas, 2011</xref>). However, with respect to their support for criminal justice policy, they have not felt it necessary to be anything but explicit in their support for the federal government’s tough on crime policies.</p>
<p>Both levels of government either funded, or were perceived as potential sources of funding, for the nonprofit social service agencies at which we interviewed directors and managers. Moreover, when funding these agencies, both governments have required specific forms of program evaluation, accountability, and new public management practices that demonstrate a commitment to efficiency and best practices. Nonetheless, even in the face of state-imposed neoliberalizing pressures, some agency managers have preserved dispositions adapted to a previous era of welfare-oriented funding.</p>
<sec id="section7-0896920512439728">
<title>Welfare Dispositions</title>
<p>Under the welfare habitus, dispositions were ideally adapted to addressing service user needs and the immediate social conditions that led to disadvantage, often through an individual therapeutic or case management approach to healing. A competent welfare-era agency executive director, therefore, facilitates interventions that help to meet these goals. These dispositions were apparent in our interviews, illustrating the persistence of a welfare orientation in the nonprofit field (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920512439728">McDonough, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, many directors spoke to their desire to meet the pressing needs of service users before addressing any other agency objectives. In such cases, respondents told of the importance of helping those who come through their doors, be it with clothing, food, or shelter, regardless of whether or not this help met program-specific criteria. In this manner, despite pressures to be more business-like, whereby the relationship between the service provider and user is often mediated by demands for risk management, data collection, and measurable outcomes, service providing agencies in Winnipeg at times still abide by an ethic of care that attempts to address clear and present suffering. For example, one shelter director criticized another shelter for playing into state efforts to frame sheltering in terms of community safety:<disp-quote>
<p>See that’s … well we wouldn’t … now that’s what they’re saying, ‘we’re helping to make your community safer, we’ll take care of these people’. Well that’s just not the language you’ll hear here, it’s not part of our history. It’s really about … well these people would die if we weren’t here. They would die if we don’t shelter them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The respondent makes it quite clear that his agency is unwilling to rebrand their services as a means for dealing with risky and unruly street populations. The concern is with attending to the basic survival needs of fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Addressing needs, however, often combines with another characteristic of the welfare habitus – the desire to treat or heal the sufferer according to a therapeutic model of service delivery. This contrasts with a growing tendency within the nonprofit field to shift discussion of service user needs toward an examination of personal risk factors and the imperative to make service users more responsible for their own care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512439728">Burchell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920512439728">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920512439728">Gray, 2009</xref>). Instead, more consistent with the welfare approach, needs are viewed as symptoms of personal or social conditions that require intervention. A service provider working with homeless and ‘at-risk’ youth noted:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve looked and thought about this and in some ways what we realize is that we can’t just offer programs, we have to offer individual social work so we have to say to that person, we’re going to work with you from where you are, we’re going to work in a holistic model, whatever your needs are we’re going to work with you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, an offender reintegration service provider stated:<disp-quote>
<p>We get to know our clients really well, they know us really well, there’s a level of trust. That first three or four months that we’re working with them it’s building that trust. For some of these clients they’ve got no trusting relationships. Not with partners, not with parents, not with friends. So often they migrate to friends that are fair-weather friends, when they’ve got drugs or when they’ve got money. So it’s really helping them develop a whole different way of living in the world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In both statements, knowledge of the ‘client’ is necessary for diagnosis; in particular, knowledge helps the agency uncover and target patterns that contribute to the client’s suffering so he or she might be habituated to a new pattern. Treatment is directed toward enabling the client to realize self-defined needs, rather than solely toward managing risk.</p>
<p>But this welfare approach does not necessarily entail a complete disregard for the social conditions that create service user needs. A director from a community economic development agency told us:<disp-quote>
<p>Our mission really is to reduce poverty; to reduce it by trying to provide individuals, groups, communities to build their capacity to move forward, and sometimes it’s really about helping them identify and build on the capacities they’ve already got.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The respondent promotes a local solution to the social problem of poverty. She seeks to address an issue noted by many of our respondents – the difficulty of mounting a challenge to the structural causes of inner-city vulnerability. Indeed, several of the nonprofit service providers we interviewed were by no means so neoliberalized that they solely promoted individual solutions to social problems; but they did articulate a clear sense that they felt limited in their ability to address the structural conditions that cause social suffering. Often this limitation was less the result of an inability to recognize broader structural injustices and more the result of insufficient time and resources to address larger problems. One director working in the area of offender reintegration and criminal justice noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes it might get a little out of whack, but the immediate needs of the clients probably tug most and get the greatest priority, and with the leftover time we address some of the larger issues. But I suspect some of the larger issues, like the gang question, sometimes get away from us. Things that we could raise, which are probably issues that we could be raising, that we just don’t have the time or resources to do. Our first priority would be to respond to the immediate needs of the clients.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In part, then, the immense need that is the fallout from the neoliberal policies that have made social services more scarce, has resulted in demands on the time of social service agencies that are so great that social advocacy, even when desired, is difficult to muster.</p>
<p>Neoliberalizing pressures have not resulted in an automatic shift toward the embodiment of neoliberal dispositions. Instead, these service providers have sought opportunities to use the space created by neoliberal governmental practices of program offloading in an attempt to continue access to funding and to fashion local havens in which welfare practices can flourish and prevail. But, given the coordinated efforts of the right and left hands of the state within the bureaucratic field, there is reason to doubt that such havens can be preserved for long in the face of neoliberal restructuring. The expansive logic of neoliberalism, and the disciplinary efforts mustered by the state to enforce it, require more than just defensive space to preserve the social services sector as a realm of comfort and care. Indeed, most of the same respondents who sought to protect welfare practices, also slipped into neoliberal-speak during our interviews, showing the pervasiveness of this way of thinking within the bureaucratic field. The neoliberal dispositions discussed below were the dominant pattern in our interviews, and suggested that it is increasingly difficult for nonprofit social service managers to escape the neoliberal sociodicy – that is, the taken-for-granted assumption that things could not be otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512439728">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0896920512439728">
<title>Neoliberal Dispositions</title>
<p>The neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field does not require an entirely new set of dispositions for the actors positioned within this space. Neoliberals are not strict ideologues in the sense that neoliberalism has shown a remarkable capacity to borrow and redeploy the discourses, programs, techniques, and policies of other competing theories, bending them to fit a neoliberal agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512439728">Brenner and Theodore, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920512439728">Hartman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920512439728">Ong, 2006</xref>). Although some new actors enter this field bringing transposed dispositions obtained from another field of activity, such as the economic field, the longtime players in the bureaucratic field instead often adapt and accentuate already held dispositions so that they better reflect newly desired business goals, management strategies, and service delivery patterns. Indeed, in this environment, finding board of directors members who can transpose specific skill sets becomes a priority. One nonprofit director was quite explicit on this point:<disp-quote>
<p>To recruit board members, it’s really nice if you come from that particular community, but I always want to have a lawyer, I always want to have a back-up lawyer. I always want to have a CA [Certified Accountant]. I want a back-up CA. I have an MBA, I want at least one other MBA on the board. I want people with a business mind for me. We have the marketing like I said, and right now we’re looking for HR.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, it is not only their skill sets that make such board members attractive. These people also bring with them an aura of competence that come from their positions within the legal and economic fields, and their presence on boards communicates to state funders that these are, indeed, serious, business-like agencies.</p>
<p>But, through such organizational designs, the nonprofit spirit is not necessarily jettisoned; sometimes, it is simply corrupted by or enlisted to an emerging neoliberal context. The trends discussed below are also not necessarily new to the neoliberal era; nonprofits have long struggled with the need to be entrepreneurial, accountable to stakeholders, measure outcomes, and manage organizational and societal risks. However, under neoliberalism, greater emphasis is placed on these activities, and the service user is re-imagined as an individual consumer who must be encouraged to become more responsible for his or her behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920512439728">Miller and Rose, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920512439728">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920512439728">Wacquant, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For some of our respondents, a business approach was not optional. As one put it, ‘You have to run it like a business. You have to.’ The necessity of the business model encompasses two related concerns: (a) the need for agencies to take an entrepreneurial approach to service delivery in order to ensure economic viability, and (b) the demand for agency accountability.</p>
<p>With respect to entrepreneurialism, the ability of an agency to creatively market and sell its services is often perceived to be vital to ensuring the continued delivery of those services. For one particularly enterprising executive director who works with the homeless, the entrepreneurial model was preferable to reliance on government funding.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What I have found is, it’s probably easier for me to find a million dollars in the corporate world, than it is to find a million dollars from government…. we’re kind of entrepreneurial that way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such thinking left other executive directors feeling the need to seek further training in the skills of fundraising. As one director of a youth-serving agency suggested,<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a whole science to it, I think. I haven’t taken the courses but some of the board members have, on how to approach the fundraising and the dos and don’ts and the regulations – it’s something we’re learning now that we’re getting deeper into it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, for those service providers who do not already possess the skills required to emulate the practices of the entrepreneurial actor, there is pressure to develop them.</p>
<p>For funding bodies, the marketing creativity of the entrepreneur is ideally combined with the transparent and productive governance of one’s agency. With respect to the latter, in the following quotations, directors of homeless and youth-serving agencies lend their support to increased accountabilty:<disp-quote>
<p>I slightly prefer the … business model – here are our inputs and outputs and here are the results so we know we’re successful because we can measure this. I agree with funders – I like United Way encouraging people to think that way – I agree with that.</p>
<p>Some people haven’t been happy about moving to this, but I come from a research background so I’m very comfortable with it and what the next step for us is, ok, now we need to use the data not just ship it out to other people as reporting. Now we need to look at this and examine it and have it inform us, as well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While these service providers saw the advantages of accountability in terms of gathering better information about services, the emphasis on accountability has the potential to spark the marketization of the relationship between funding body and nonprofit agency. Simply put, accountability measures, at the agencies we examined, were often directed toward ensuring that value for funder dollars spent was achieved. In this sense, they tend to drive an ethics of accountability that is responsive largely to technical criteria and state-defined targets rather than an ethic of care concerned with very specific service user needs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512439728">Beck, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the logic of accountability appears to have some bearing on the ability of an agency to criticize public policy and advocate for social change, since the logic of accountability is closely tied to that of ‘partnership’ between funders and the funded.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am very careful about what I say to the media … you have to be careful of what you say. I have to be respectful of who funds me, but I also have a very good relationship with our funders. So if I have something I need to say about what’s happening, I’ll go to the funders and say I don’t understand this, why? So I don’t feel like I’m not heard but I know that sometimes it can be quite sensationalized through the media, so I’m very careful with that. I have a lot of people that count on me to keep the funding going and they have families, so I’m very respectful of that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, the executive director of a youth-serving agency highlights the degree to which she avoids embarrassing or shaming the funder. But such accountability limits the critical potential of the nonprofit habitus.</p>
<p>Increased accountability is foisted upon service providers in a context where former public services activities are being offloaded to the nonprofit field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920512439728">Hall and Reed, 1998</xref>). While this can help a nonprofit agency increase or sustain its service offerings, it can also have worrisome consequences. A youth service worker expressed this sentiment in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>Basically what we’ve done is decentralized government services and asked non-profit organizations to deliver those services and be accountable to their funders, which I think is fine, but it’s been done in a way that, so now it’s not the government who is responsible anymore it’s nonprofits. But we’re not given enough funds to make sure that our employees have benefits, that they’re paid a fair wage, that they have stable employment. So essentially it’s like were outsourcing to India, you know, like outsourcing to [nonprofits] is like outsourcing to India so that it’s cheaper to actually run the same types of services.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The successful nonprofit manager, then, is someone who can present government with proposals by which public services can be offloaded to community agencies, assembling more and more government contracts to allow the nonprofit agency to sustain its operations. But this enables the government to distance itself from feeling direct responsibility to those in need of services, and places this responsibility in the hands of more poorly resourced actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920512439728">Miller and Rose, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>A further adaptation to the neoliberal restructuring of the nonprofit field comes through an emphasis on service user risk assessments and management rather than needs. As mentioned earlier, the neoliberal policy shift has sponsored a move from an emphasis on therapeutic healing through social service to one concentrated on limiting and minimizing assorted risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920512439728">Garland, 1997</xref>). This is most apparent in nonprofit services directed toward youth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So we’re looking at risk, high-risk behaviours, and so I get further info from the parent. And if I don’t get a hold of the parents, I don’t get information, or I can get it from the school, or I can get it from CFS [Child and Family Services].</p>
<p>So we are looking at issues like poverty, type of family, criminal involvement in the family, gang involvement, where do they live, is it a single family, are they active in the community, do they have supports, their economic status, that kind of thing…. So we use that assessment when we reach out to the family to get all that information.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through this dispositional shift, service users become data sources, and the gathering of these data is one of the primary responsibilities of the service provider and serves to produce the knowledge needed to categorize and discipline the subject. Through this process, those whose levels of risk leave them open to effective management are viewed as ‘clients’ whose behavior may be changed by encouraging individual responsibility.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>About the personal responsibility … It’s about how do you behave in here, and moving away from the more military model that we’ve been governed by for god knows how many centuries and the external locus of control now to the internal which is to youngsters ‘how would you like it to be in here for you, how do you feel most safe, and when you commit an act are you aware of the impact you’re having on other people’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement from a youth-serving agency director is reflective of many of our interviews in the manner that the service provider describes his practice as involving efforts to get the service user to internalize pro-social values and work upon himself or herself. Service providers thus embody the task of making their charges more responsible, shifting their behavior so that it better fits the precarious neoliberal business market.</p>
<p>In sum, the spread of neoliberal dispositions involves a combination of factors. In some instances, an actor transposes from outside the nonprofit sector the market dispositions of the economic field of practice in order to profit within a restructured nonprofit field. In other cases, the welfare nonprofit habitus is adapted or redirected to meet the requirements of the neoliberal business model, such as when therapeutic approaches to need are re-worked around notions of risk. These transposed and adapted dispositions function alongside welfare dispositions that remain in circulation, with both sometimes articulated within the course of the same interview. Nonetheless, the two dispositions show themselves to be in locked in a field struggle for defining the practice of nonprofit service, a struggle within which, to all appearances, the logic of neoliberalism is winning. Complicating the picture even further, however, is the fact that some service providers achieve moments of reflexivity in assessing the structural conditions in which they operate and strategizing more ambitious oppositional maneuvers. Whereas welfare dispositions seek to secure a safe place for the traditional caring practices of the left hand of the state, and neoliberal dispositions contribute to the reproduction of a social service field increasingly disciplined to the tasks of finding funding, evaluation, and risk management, reflexive practices criticize how the field is itself complicit in dominant power relations in a manner that does not simply call for a return to the welfare era. It is within these practices that we see a sliver of hope for combating the neoliberalization of the social service sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0896920512439728">
<title>Reflexive Practices</title>
<p>The habitus is comprised of pre-reflective dispositions that help guide the actor through the field. However, actors can move beyond a simple feel for the game to possess a reflexive understanding of field conditions, allowing for strategic rather than pre-reflective interventions into the struggles for domination within the field. Such reflexivity is said to arise when a subject’s habitus does not coincide with his or her field position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512439728">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>), but it can also occur through intra-habitus tensions that arise in the interactive setting of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920512439728">Mouzelis, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One level of recognition comes through an understanding of the neoliberal language game. Some respondents showed that they possessed a critical sense of the rhetoric that characterizes the contemporary nonprofit field, and sought to disrupt or redirect this language to allow their agency to pursue different goals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Pretty much everything that we talk about is viewed in a really holistic way, so like if your family doesn’t have enough to eat that’s a safety issue. If you don’t have secure housing, that’s a safety issue. Your kids don’t have enough clothing for the wintertime, that’s a safety issue. If you don’t know your neighbors, that’s a big safety issue. And so it’s very holistic. It’s the same way that we see health. All of those issues are also related to poverty and stem from poverty.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In statements such as this one from a women’s resource worker, terms like risk, safety, and accountability – each of which is a neoliberal buzzword with cachet in current policy making circles – are reinterpreted to fit what are perceived to be local and immediate needs. In this manner, a reflexive understanding of the language of the restructured field allows the service provider to try to shift the boundaries of terminological meaning and to forge space within the field’s language game to pursue welfare objectives. However, the resistance evidenced here is more tactical than strategic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920512439728">de Certeau, 1984</xref>), since it does little to challenge the terms of the neoliberalized nonprofit field; rather, it tends to reinforce these discourses and their attendant practices. In this sense, attempts to simply redirect or redeploy components of the neoliberal language game are an insufficient strategy for countering the neoliberal domination of the bureaucratic field.</p>
<p>A deeper level of reflexivity, most evident among Indigenous nonprofit agencies, views the field, whether welfare or business, as rife with problematic colonial, liberal and neoliberal presuppositions. For groups who approach the field from this perspective, their practices within the field demand a vigilant reflexivity that works to decolonize the practice and turn it toward Indigenous ends. This reflexivity is bolstered by oppositional discourses and practices transposed from Indigenous lifeworlds into the bureaucratic field. Such efforts at oppositional transposition (or counter transposition) often begin with an awareness of how Indigenous economies differ from those promulgated under liberal and neoliberal capitalism.</p>

<p>So some of this is about the lens through which things are viewed and it’s also about the Eurocentric lens. In theory, if you don’t fall within the Eurocentric lens, through which Aboriginal people are Other, we’re always the true Other here, then we’re always going to be at-risk, because we’re always trying to translate or trying to survive within this foreign way of living, which is capitalism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The restrictions brought upon Indigenous peoples by colonialism and capitalism place Indigenous service providers in a difficult position. Because social services are entrenched within this system and have been complicit in attempts to assimilate Indigenous peoples to its rules, Indigenous service providers remain wary toward the very field of which they are a part. Thus, their engagement with the bureaucratic field begins from a position of reflexive skepticism about the very terms and conditions of this field, and they seek to share this skepticism with the people whom they intend to help, instilling in their service users a reflexivity that allows them to survive in a colonized world while maintaining a grasp on their indigeneity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the things we do, we do our own life skills training, but it’s not life skills based on … some crazy standard about what life is supposed to be like, some thing that is not applicable to us. We talk about … code switching. It’s part of our life skills curriculum. Code switching means that you identify and acknowledge and have comfort in crossing over between western culture and Indigenous culture and you don’t need to abandon your own being to make that cross, that code switch, to switch for a time where it’s appropriate to switch, and then switch back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such code-switching strategies are meant to keep service users aware of the power structures of the bureaucratic field, and to learn to play its game so that access to resources can be maintained. But adaptive practices of code-switching do not override the sense that nonprofit services are themselves part of a self-reproducing field that is dependent upon the suffering of Indigenous persons to maintain funding, positions, and purpose. The neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field is therefore not the primary critical concern for Indigenous service providers. The bureaucratic field, even under its welfare manifestation, has always been too limited by its colonial and capitalist setting to truly serve the needs of Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Nonprofit service] is all about trying to not look at individuals as if they’re defective in any way, but in systems of oppression that have come here, that have been here since the time of European contact, that is what is holding up this economy, what’s holding up the practice – even embedded in this notion that somehow western European people are still trying to help us become them. That’s really embedded into all of the services and programs that are out there. We are an industry, so we’re trying to reclaim our own right to have control over our own selves, and our own families. Until that happens, I would submit that nothing is going to change until the colonial relationships are understood and deconstructed. Nobody’s really engaged in that process from a settler point of view, from what I can see, in a meaningful way… All of that economy that is on top of Aboriginal people as perpetual clients. As perpetual victims, eh? So within that, we do training programs, we work with youth but we don’t work with them [as] clients. These people are not our clients. They’re our relatives. These are our families that we’re working with.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indigenous reflexivity in the bureaucratic field, therefore, demands not a return to a welfare orientation, but rather a deeper transformation of the field and the political, economic, and societal relations that sustain it. The respondent in the quotation above provides an analysis of the structure of the bureaucratic field that links nonprofit practices to the practices of coercive assimilation that have long animated Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations in Canada. But what we want to emphasize in this article is how his critique of the bureaucratic field and his strategic engagement with the rules and regulations of this field, is sustained by a counter-transposition that brings into nonprofit social service practices a reflexivity derived from his experiences as an Indigenous person and his engagement with critical Indigenous discourses. We will pursue this matter further in our conclusion.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The example of Indigenous reflexivity exposes how both welfare and neoliberal dispositions are complicit in reproducing a nonprofit sector that affirms rather than challenges a social order still marred by colonial, economic, and gendered forms of domination. This reflexivity thereby offers an important lesson for other participants in the bureaucratic field. For those agents locked in the nonprofit game, despite their dispositional memories of welfare practices, and despite their occasional embodiment of the nonprofit spirit, neoliberal restructuring has inculcated new habits and practices that make oppositional struggle within the field difficult to launch and more difficult to sustain. Whereas Indigenous service providers are able to perform a counter-transposition, bringing critical insight drawn from a collective experience of colonialism within Indigenous communities into the nonprofit field, non-Indigenous service providers often seem too far removed from radical change-seeking social movement leanings to effect their own counter-transposition. They are left trying to work within the terms of the bureaucratic field, and too often subtly (or explicitly) influenced by its neoliberalization.</p>
<p>This article contributes to such an analysis by using Wacquant’s conceptualization of a neoliberalized bureaucratic field to examine the field struggle to define the stakes of nonprofit social service practice. Through this framework we have identified some of the ways in which the dominance of neoliberal practices inhibits commitment to social change. However, we fear that the nonprofit sector is so dominated by neoliberal logics, that it must also reinvigorate and open space for oppositional voices within its field. In this respect, Alberto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920512439728">Melucci’s (1989)</xref> conceptualization of New Social Movements as arenas for the generation of oppositional cultural codes may be of some use when thinking through the problem of neoliberal domination within the nonprofit field. For Melucci, a new social movement is a nomadic entity that seeks to place itself beyond the reach of the institutionalizing and instrumentalizing forces of modern society. In so doing, it can become a seedbed for different ways of seeing, acting, and being in the world. But while Melucci is satisfied to leave these movements as ‘nomads of the present’ and therefore outside of the formal world of institutions and government, we would like to see them in interaction with the nonprofit sector so that nonprofit actors can find reflexivity within these marginal movement spaces and transpose them into the nonprofit field. What is too often lost in the day-to-day demands of providing needed services within the bureaucratic field is the time and space for reflexive critique of the conditions that limit possibilities of care and social justice for those who use social services. This loss is magnified in neoliberal times, as the managerial demands of accountability, measurement, best practices, and so forth, become further restraints on the activities of nonprofit service providers. Under such circumstances, nonprofit dispositions become circumscribed by the dull compulsion of agency management (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920512439728">Lipsky, 2010</xref>), and further removed from a reflexivity that might challenge the very conditions that sustain the field.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of building networks with the world of business and transposing further elements of the economic field into the nonprofit sector, or adapting existing welfare practices to the neoliberal order, nonprofit social service agencies need to network with activists and agents less encumbered by state funding, forming micro-publics in which alternative visions of social service can form. Fraser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920512439728">1997</xref>: 81) terms these micro-publics ‘subaltern counterpublics’, which ‘are parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests and needs’. She further notes that ‘On the one hand, they function as spaces of withdrawal and regroupment; on the other hand, they also function as bases and training grounds for agitational activities directed toward wider publics. It is precisely in the dialectic between these two functions that their emancipatory potential lies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920512439728">Fraser, 1997</xref>: 82). Through a combination of reflexivity, counterpublic discussion, and counter transposition, nonprofit agencies might subsequently strategize new forms of advocacy, activism and political engagement that more directly resist the neoliberal restructuring of the bureaucratic field.</p>

<p>In total, there were approximately 1633 minutes of interviews transcribed, resulting in 375 pages of single-spaced transcripts. These transcripts were reviewed and coded by both authors. We began with 20 pre-set coding categories. Several of these were combined as their overlaps became more apparent, while one new category emerged – our reflexive category was not one we went into the data expecting to find. Finally, we are not able to put a specific number on the hours we have spent in the field, since both authors have participated in inner city research projects that have required interaction with multiple inner city social service agencies, and the lead author also has several years experiencing volunteering in the field.</p></fn>
