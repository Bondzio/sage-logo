<p>Brain injuries are a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Currently a great deal of controversy exists concerning the mechanism of these injuries and concussion in particular. The following review discusses the anatomical mechanisms which are known to cause brain injuries and the variables currently used to predict their incidence. This review examines how current engineering techniques and measurements are being used to research brain injury mechanisms. The text examines the past and current measurement techniques and their benefits and drawbacks when it comes to predicting brain injuries and understanding brain injury research. Finally, future methods of quantifying brain injury are discussed with concluding remarks concerning the efficacy of current measurement techniques to predict brain injuries.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408612446573" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major traumatic brain injuries contribute to a high degree of mortality and morbidity in society. The costs of these injuries are high, both in terms of lost productivity and care facilities for those no longer able to care for themselves. In the United States, there are approximately 1.7 million cases of traumatic brain injuries every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1460408612446573">Sosin et al., 1996</xref>). The knock-on effects of sick days and rehabilitation as a result of these injuries can create costs in excess of 10 billion dollars a year. The elderly and children are the most likely to experience a traumatic brain injury, with falls being the most common cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1460408612446573">Styrke et al., 2007</xref>). Of all injuries, brain trauma has the singular distinction of having the highest morbidity and mortality. As a result, a great deal of research has been undertaken to help prevent these injuries from occurring with much attention being paid to them due to their serious effects on the nervous system and their impact on the quality of life of the injured person.</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanism of injury in brain trauma is important for the development of prevention technologies and for establishing rules in sport to prevent the impacts which are likely to produce those injuries. Human variability and the inability to measure these mechanisms of injury directly has led to the investigation of brain injury through animal, physical and numerical modeling in an attempt to understand the underlying mechanics of the injury. Several researchers have written review articles concerning brain injury mechanisms, notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408612446573">King et al. (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612446573">Hardy et al. (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1460408612446573">Viano et al. (1989)</xref>. From this work it is possible to summarize the primary mechanisms of injury for the brain as: (i) contusions resulting from skull deformation and brain motion; (ii) intracranial pressure gradients produced from impacts; (iii) rotation causing skull/brain relative motion and (iv) combined linear and rotational acceleration from impact. While these mechanisms have been discussed extensively in the literature, the link between mechanism of injury and a measurable variable allowing quantification of how these mechanisms contribute to brain tissue tolerance has not been properly elucidated.</p>
<p>The following sections will describe research into the mechanism of brain injury. The review includes an overview of the mechanisms of injury which create brain contusions, followed by an examination of the effects of intracranial pressure on brain damage. This review will lead into the effects of linear and rotational acceleration on skull and brain relative motions and how finite element modeling has led to a new approach in to injury research. Finally, this section will review the underlying mechanism of brain injuries in general and injurious levels of brain deformation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408612446573"><title>Contusions resulting from skull deformation and brain motion</title>
<p>Direct brain contusion was demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1460408612446573">Viano et al. (1989)</xref> to result either from local skull deformation or movements of the skull against the rough and irregular interior skull surfaces. Historically, contusions have been associated with the inbending of bone at the impact site, intracranial pressure and skull/brain relative motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612446573">Courville, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). Impact contusions are normally a product of a localized mechanical response either at the loading site (coup) or areas distal to that loading site (contrecoup) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612446573">Bandak and Eppinger, 1994</xref>). The skull deformation theory for brain contusion is related specifically to the coup site, as the contrecoup site injury has been thought to be produced through intracranial pressures and relative skull/brain movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Lissner, 1944</xref>). A direct impact to the skull produces local stress areas, causing a slight inbending of the skull bones that ‘slap’ the brain tissue directly underneath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). The amount of this deformation of tissue underneath the impacted skull may be sufficient to create injurious strains to brain tissue as well as to cerebral blood vessels. The area of damage to the underlying brain may also spread laterally from the impact site. The rebound from this elastic deformation of the skull as it returns to its original position can cause the dura to separate from the skull which may result in epidural hematomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanism of injury and the influencing factors contributing to the presence of intracerebral hematoma (ICH) are similar to those for brain contusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612446573">Gennarelli and Thibault, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1980</xref>). From this research, it has been suggested that there is a continuum of motion-induced brain injury; where contusions occur at lower magnitudes of skull/brain motion and ICH at higher magnitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1971</xref>, 1972). In fact, impacts on animals have shown that, unlike contusions, only high linear or rotational accelerations and rapid rates of onset are responsible for this type of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612446573">Gennarelli, 1983</xref>). Intracerebral hematomas normally occur in three different locations: (i) the extradural space (epidural hematoma); (ii) the subdural space (subdural hematoma) and (iii) within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1980</xref>). Subdural (SDH) and epidural hematoma (EDH) are created by relative skull/brain motion which causes shear strains on the parasagittal bridging veins tethering the free floating brain to the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612446573">Kleiven, 2003</xref>). If the veins rupture, a hematoma accumulates within the cranial cavity, creating a potentially fatal rise in pressure on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612446573">Bradshaw et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612446573">Kleiven, 2003</xref>). Due to the directional material characteristics of these vessels, the impact vector can also be influential in the creation of a SDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612446573">Kleiven, 2003</xref>). Hematoma can also be found within the brain tissue itself post-impact. Small tears and hemorrhages are often found at interfaces between the grey and white matter in the direction of the force that was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). In support of this theory, researchers used non-impact linear and rotational accelerations on monkeys to investigate brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1971</xref>). They found that when undergoing linear or rotational translations, SDHs could be created in the absence of any physical impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1971</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3-1460408612446573"><title>Intracranial pressure gradients produced from impact</title>
<p>Intracranial pressure is the pressure inside the skull and is measured in Pascals. Research using animal and cadaver models has shown brain deformation from an impact to be associated with raised intracranial pressures, a product of linear translations (acceleration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1460408612446573">Haddad et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1460408612446573">Thomas et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1460408612446573">Unterharnscheidt and Higgins, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1460408612446573">Unterharnscheidt and Sellier, 1966</xref>), and strains which have been correlated to rotational acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612446573">Hodgson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612446573">Kleiven, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). The theory of pressure gradients resulting from impacts is thought to be one of the primary factors in the development of focal brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Gennarelli, 1974</xref>). The inertia of the brain pushing up against the impact site as it lags behind the faster moving skull creates an area of high pressure and at the distal site, this translation of the brain within the skull creates a corresponding area of negative pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). The resulting pressure gradient creates shear stresses that result in local deformation of brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1460408612446573">Thomas et al., 1967</xref>). This is especially important with respect to brain stem damage from impact, as the relative resistance of brain motion in this area causes a concentration of potentially damaging stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Lissner, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612446573">Hodgson et al., 1983</xref>). In one of the first investigations of pressure gradients using dogs, Gurdjian and Lissner showed that post-impact, areas of high pressure formed at the coup site and low pressure areas occurred at the contrecoup site (1944). From this, they suggested that a gradient of pressure between the two sites produced injurious dynamic stresses in the brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Lissner, 1944</xref>). Furthering this research, intracranial pressure (ICP) was linked to acceleration magnitudes and durations to head injury by inducing concussive impacts on dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1953</xref>). In a physical model approach to the investigation of pressure gradients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1460408612446573">Thomas et al. (1967)</xref> made use of gel-filled skulls. Using sensors to detect the brain dynamics during impact, acceleration and pressure were found to be positively correlated. They showed that pressure gradients did exist and that both acceleration and compression were influential in this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1460408612446573">Thomas et al., 1967</xref>). Supporting the theory of pressure being linked to acceleration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1460408612446573">Kopecky and Ripperger (1969)</xref> used a fluid-filled cylinder impact model to investigate pressure gradients. They found that positive and negative pressure is a function of acceleration. In further investigations into this phenomenon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1460408612446573">Kenner and Goldsmith (1972)</xref> used a distilled water-filled sphere to investigate pressure waves from an impact. They found a compression wave at the site of impact and a tensile wave at the location opposite to impact confirming the existence of a pressure gradient.</p>
<p>Positive pressure theory accounts for coup injuries when the head is impacted and contrecoup injuries received when falling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1460408612446573">Lindenburg (1960)</xref> helped develop this theory; his pathological findings suggested a thinning of cerebro spinal fluid between the brain and dura at the contrecoup site, which would indicate an increase in pressure at that location during a fall. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612446573">Edberg et al. (1963)</xref> used a gel-based physical model to simulate skull impacts and found positive pressures at the impact site and negative pressures at the contrecoup site. Further analysis of pressure during falling, revealed that the pressures are reversed as the brain lags the motion of the skull (negative pressure at impact site, positive pressure at opposite site), which was later confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612446573">Dawson et al. (1980)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1460408612446573">Yanagida et al. (1989)</xref>.</p>
<p>While positive pressure has been suggested to be influential in this mechanism of injury, the effect of negative pressure in the creation of contusions has also been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612446573">Hardy et al., 1994</xref>). Areas of negative pressure are thought to cause bubbles to appear in the brain tissue and cause damage when they collapse due to local area stresses and strains. Negative pressure has also been linked with cavitation theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612446573">Gross (1958)</xref> was the first proponent of the cavitation theory of brain injury. Using glass flasks half filled with fluid as human head surrogates he showed that by accelerating the flasks downwards cavitation in the fluid was produced. When a similar experiment was conducted with a completely full and sealed flask a pressure gradient was formed from the impacted end of the tube to the non-impacted end, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612446573">Gross (1958)</xref> applied in a theory to explain the commonly seen coup and contrecoup injury sites. If the tube received a hard enough blow the tensile force would exceed the tensile strength of the fluid, which would then tear apart and produce temporary cavities. These cavities would form in areas of negative pressure normally found in areas opposite to the impact site and their collapse could potentially be violent enough to cause brain injury. Cavitation was also thought to create local vacuum cavities in the brain, and once these cavities collapse the neural tissue would receive damaging strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612446573">Denny-Brown and Russell, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612446573">Gross, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1460408612446573">Lubock and Goldsmith, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>The theory of negative pressure causing brain contusion has not been widely accepted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1460408612446573">Suh et al. (1972)</xref> found that when impacting a fluid-filled spherical shell, negative pressure regions were not located at the contrecoup site. Other researchers found that negative pressure did not contribute to injury when impacting animal models such as rabbits and Macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1460408612446573">Stalhammar, 1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408612446573">1975b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1460408612446573">Stalhammar and Olsson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1460408612446573">Nuscholtz et al., 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1460408612446573">Nuscholtz et al. (1984)</xref> concluded from their research that cavitation was not a mechanism of injury for contusion, but that head and neck position during impact was of greater importance. More recently finite element modeling of impacts has shown a low correlation between negative pressure and brain injury in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612446573">Miller et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The research countering the negative pressure and cavitation theory to coup and contrecoup injuries led to a re-evaluation of commonly held theories on the mechanism of injury for contusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurjian, 1975</xref>). Building upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612446573">Courville’s (1950)</xref> review of contusion, Gurdjian and Gurdjian impacted dogs and monkeys to show that surface contrecoup contusions most probably result from relative movements of the brain against bony prominences on the interior of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612446573">Gurdjian, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). They also stated that if cavitation theory was correct, the contusions would be present in the occipital poles of the hemispheres for frontal impacts, which is not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). In their review of acute head injury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian (1980)</xref> identified that cavitation was easier to create experimentally than by using human material. They felt this was due to the high relative amounts of energy needed to induce negative pressure injury in animals with brains that are 4 or 5 times smaller than the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1980</xref>). Another problem is that experimentally, researchers use silicone gel and/or water to simulate the brain masses in their models, which have different viscosities than brain tissue and would thus react differently under loading scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612446573">Holbourn, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1980</xref>). This large body of research has led to the conclusion that cavitation theory is an unlikely contributor to the development of contrecoup injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1980</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612446573"><title>Rotation causing skull/brain relative motions</title>
<p>The theory that the rotation of the head and not linear translation causes brain injury was first championed by Holbourn in 1943. Two primary concepts as to how rotations cause injury to the brain exist: (i) the inability of the brain to rotate within the skull causes injurious focal point shear stresses and strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612446573">Bradshaw and Morfey, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612446573">Hardy et al., 1994</xref>) and (ii) diffuse shearing of brain tissue, normally located at zones of change in density due to differing inertial properties, causes focal and diffuse injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Gennarelli, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1460408612446573">Yoganandan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The restriction to brain motion from an impact is greatest at the anterior fossa which may explain why the majority of brain injuries are located there regardless of the impact site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Gennarelli, 1974</xref>). Other brain tissues can also create injurious local strain in resistance to rotation such as the falx and tentorium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408612446573">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Using a brain model that defined brain matter as homogeneous and incompressible, Holbourn investigated this theory. Under the assumption that only shear stresses and strains were injurious, he found that rotation was a far greater influence to injury than linear translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612446573">Holbourn, 1943</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al. (1968)</xref> supported this theory through direct impacts to monkeys; they concluded that injurious strains developed in the brain resulted from differences in the material properties of the tissues and the transmission of forces through them. This theory was further investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1460408612446573">Unterharnsheidt and Higgins (1969)</xref> who induced non-impact pure angular accelerations in squirrel monkeys.

<p>Further studies on monkeys and pure rotation were undertaken using a special device to induce controlled non-impact linear and angular accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612446573">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612446573">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612446573">1983</xref>).

Subdural hematoma was created by shorter duration, higher magnitude angular accelerations and DAI was produced by longer duration, lower magnitude coronal rotations. Investigation into mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) showed that non-contact linear acceleration did not produce concussion, but that non-contact rotations can cause concussive injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612446573">1972</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al.

As such, researchers concluded that nearly all types of human head injury could be created by angular acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research involving diffuse injuries created by blunt trauma carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Gennarelli (1974)</xref> reported that damaging strains through inertial loading decrease in magnitude from the surface of the brain to the centre of the brain. At low levels of rotational inertial loading, the damage caused by shear strain does not extend into the cortex. The level of damage to the brain tissues appeared to depend upon the material and structural properties of these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1460408612446573">Ommaya, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Hirsch, 1971</xref>). Finally, in their review of the mechanisms of concussion and diffuse injury, they concluded that the results of an impact depend largely upon the manner in which the mechanical properties of the multi-component, anisotropic, inhomogeneous brain tissue behave, as well as the effect of the location of bony prominences, duralpartitions, vascular anatomy and sources of tissue interfaces with different densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Gennarelli, 1974</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1460408612446573"><title>Combined linear and rotational acceleration theories</title>
<p>While it has been shown that intracranial pressure-induced strains are largely dependent upon linear accelerations resulting from impact and that tensile strains from brain motion are dependent on rotational acceleration, there will never be a case outside of a laboratory setting where they will occur in isolation. This has led to theories suggesting that brain injuries occur through a combination of elastic deformation of the skull, positive and negative pressures and inertial brain lag from linear and rotational acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1975</xref>). This premise is supported by researchers arguing that if injury was solely dependent upon rotation, the acceleration levels would need to be impossibly high to induce injury. Assuming a combination of rotation and intracranial pressures as the source of the injuries is more plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1460408612446573">Ommaya et al., 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1460408612446573">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1460408612446573">Ommaya and Hirsch, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1460408612446573">Ono et al., 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent work using physical and numerical modeling supports the early work conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al. (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612446573">Adams et al. (1983)</xref>. Analyses using finite element modeling have supported the early animal and cadaver research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1460408612446573">Zhou et al. (1995)</xref> employed an FEM of the human head to show that coup and contrecoup injuries are pressure induced, while brain stem injuries appear to be produced by shear strain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612446573">Bandak and Eppinger (1994)</xref> used their FEM of the human brain to show that both rotational and linear accelerations can cause strain damage to the brain. These numerical modeling approaches have the added benefit of more accurately representing the human tissue responses to an impact. However, these mechanisms of injury lack a definitive parameter with which to measure injury tolerances, the following section will discuss attempts to establish injury thresholds using engineering parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408612446573"><title>Dependent variables linking mechanism to injury</title>
<p>The mechanisms of brain trauma previously described have one variable in common, a certain amount of measurable deformation stresses the brain tissue past the point of recovery resulting in permanent deformation and injury. The amount of loading quantified using deformation based dependent variables of the brain tissue would indicate the threshold the brain tissue has to injury. Identifying these tolerances to injury would allow for improvements in protective devices and the design of structures. It could also aid in the creation of better rules for sport to eliminate risky situations likely to cause a specific type of loading to the head and brain. However, as there are many mechanisms of injury it is difficult to identify a singular level of tolerance for brain injury.</p>
<p>When injury thresholds are being created many different factors must be accounted for and those have created difficulty in the establishment of universal values for brain injury. To establish an injury criterion, the input, output and all system variables must be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1460408612446573">O’Donoghue, 1999</xref>). In the creation of an impact induced brain deformation the characteristics of that applied force are the input variables. These variables are inbound velocity, mass, location and vector. The mechanical output from these variables is deformation of the brain tissue and the rate of this strain and stress. Other factors which are known to influence the input and output are the geometry of the head, constitutive properties as well as age, sex, health and intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1460408612446573">Horgan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These variables make the creation of a specific tolerance curve for brain injury difficult. Some researchers have made some simplifications to these assumptions to help establish tolerance curves for specific types of injuries. Research in this area has focused on linear acceleration as a measure of injury as it has been linked with the creation of potentially injurious pressure gradients in the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1460408612446573">Thomas et al., 1966</xref>). However, the low correlation linear acceleration alone had with brain injury has led to integration of the acceleration time curve to account for other aspects of the injurious pulse. More recently finite element modeling has created an opportunity to measure the outcome of simulated impacts in brain tissue deformation characteristics such as stress and strain.</p>
<p>The following section will discuss these parameters and how they relate to measuring mechanisms of brain injury. The discussion will begin with engineering based measurements such as linear and angular acceleration. Attempts to interpret the effect of linear and angular acceleration loading curve shapes using integrations will be discussed and their limitations, which will lead to the currently proposed solutions involving finite element modeling and brain threshold research.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1460408612446573"><title>Linear acceleration</title>
<p>Linear acceleration has been linked to brain motion causing intracranial pressure differences within the cranium due to relative brain skull motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1460408612446573">Thomas et al., 1966</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al. (1961)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al.’s (1966)</xref> early work measuring intracranial pressure changes during impacts on animals was amongst the first attempts to find a correlative parameter predicting brain damage. They discovered that pressure changes could be a possible mechanism of injury as they cause damaging shear stresses to brain tissue. This pressure is a result of deformation of the skull and its acceleration after an impact, and therefore if the kinematics of the event were monitored, risk of injury could be evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1961</xref>). The correlation of linear acceleration with intracranial pressure and therefore levels of injury was further confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1460408612446573">Nuscholtz et al. (1987)</xref> with blunt impact experiments on adult Macaque monkeys.</p>
<p>The use of linear acceleration as an injury metric has been successful to date, resulting in the reduction in focal injuries such as skull fracture and TBI in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1460408612446573">Hoshizaki and Brien, 2004</xref>). While there has been a reduction in focal injuries, the prevalence of diffuse injury such as concussion has yet to be resolved. This phenomenon may be the result of helmet designers and standards organizations ignoring the rotational kinematics associated with impact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408612446573"><title>Rotational acceleration</title>
<p>The influence of rotational acceleration on the creation of head injury lies in the principle that the three-dimensional kinematics of the head after an impact influences the deformation characteristics of brain tissue and thus injury. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612446573">Holbourn (1943)</xref> was one of the first proponents of the rotational theory of brain injury stating that any change in the head velocity from an impact can be analyzed in vectors of linear and rotational acceleration. He argued that linear acceleration could not cause compressive injury due to the incompressible nature of the brain and that rotational acceleration was the sole cause of brain damage. This conclusion was based upon the fundamental assumption that brain tissue is largely damaged through shear strains to neuronal tissues and as such all injuries could be assessed through the rotational kinematics of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612446573">Holbourn, 1943</xref>).</p>
<p>Experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al. (1981)</xref> underscored the importance of rotational acceleration in the production of injury. Using a device that could apply only rotational acceleration to the heads of monkeys, they created a wide range of injuries, from concussion and intracerebral hematoma to death, in the absence of linear accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612446573">Adams et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1981</xref>). The same rotational acceleration inducing device was used to examine the effect of direction on brain injury in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1983</xref>). The researchers confirmed previous experimental results showing that the wide range of brain injury, from concussion to DAI and death could be produced by purely rotational accelerations. It was found through this study that the direction of the rotation is also influential on the resulting injury, not just its severity but the type of brain lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612446573">Gennarelli et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>More recent work using finite element modeling of the human head to assess the influence of kinematics on brain deformation has been undertaken. Forero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612446573">Rueda et al. (2010)</xref> analyzed injurious events to equestrian jockeys and found that rotational acceleration was highly correlated with stress and strain in the brain while linear acceleration had a lower correlation. In an evaluation of head injury criteria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1460408612446573">Kleiven (2006)</xref> also found that angular acceleration had a high correlation with peak strains in his head injury model.</p>
<p>Rotational acceleration has only recently begun to be considered as an important descriptor of head impact events. While it has been shown to be influential in the creation of brain injury in the absence of linear acceleration it is unlikely that an event producing linear or angular acceleration in isolation could ever occur. It has also been shown that injuries are facilitated by the combined loading of both linear and angular accelerations. It is for this reason that a description of an injurious event requires that complete three-dimensional kinematics be represented in order to evaluate the resulting brain tissue response.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1460408612446573"><title>Gadd severity index and head injury criterion</title>
<p>While peak linear acceleration was found to be correlated with pressure and skull fracture the influence of the acceleration time curve was also found to be influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1966</xref>). Using animal and cadaver impact data an acceleration – time tolerance curve was developed. This curve is commonly known as the Wayne state tolerance curve (WSTC). What this curve exemplified was that high accelerations could be tolerated for short durations while lower accelerations could be tolerated for longer durations.

The weighting factor was included to give greater influence to high levels of response to injury whilst lower levels would have less influence on the creation of an injury. This integral was viewed as an improvement upon using peak values for prediction as it incorporated differing curve shapes and eliminated the importance of different sections of the pulse as the whole event was incorporated in the solution. A value of 1000 was used as a proposed injury threshold based on data from Wayne State, the FAA and NASA. Very long duration pulses (50 ms) were considered inconsequential in this equation as head impacts are normally less than 15 ms.</p>

<p>A tolerance value of 1000 was also suggested for the HIC for injury. The time limits in use can vary but the recommended limits are 36 ms (NHTSA) and 15 ms (ISO).</p>
<p>These integrations have some limitations and assumptions. The limitations associated with the HIC and GSI show how difficult it is to measure the mechanisms of head injury and link them to an injury metric. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1460408612446573">Nahum and Smith (1976)</xref> used impacts to cadavers to correlate the severity of brain injury to GSI or HIC.

Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1460408612446573">Newman (1980)</xref> identified that correlation of linear acceleration time curves measured at the centre of gravity of an anthropometric test dummy and its time dependence on injury was in fact unfounded. The limitations of GSI and HIC for longer time durations were brought into perspective as well as the methods of the original cadaver tests.

From this a HIC of 1000 corresponded to 16% risk of brain injury, and a value of 1500 indicated a risk greater than 50%. From this data they suggested that the HIC be limited to 15 ms for best use in the motor industry.</p>

where the HIP is the head impact power and the frame of reference is that for the head, <italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic>a<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>a<sub>z</sub></italic> are the linear acceleration components along the three axes and <italic>α<sub>x</sub></italic>, α<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> and α<sub><italic>z</italic></sub> are the angular acceleration components. The values for the human head are those of the 50% hybrid III dummy head form. The reconstructions indicated that there was a 50% chance of mTBI at 12.8 kW. Using the above equation they were able to incorporate directional sensitivities but the values for the coefficients were not known.</p>
<p>Upon further analysis of their results from the impacts, it was found that impact velocity had no correlation with the creation of mTBI. From the assessment using the integrative techniques it was found that those calculations incorporating both linear and rotational acceleration had the highest correlation to injury (GAMBIT and HIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2000a</xref>).</p>
<p>While the concept of the HIP was sound, the data upon which it was based had limitations. The position of the cameras, frame rates and zoom settings contributed to significant error for the initial laboratory reconstruction parameters. Newman himself calculated these errors to be in excess of 20%. The exact impact vector producing the injury to the brain is difficult to ascertain and approximations were used for the contact area for the hybrid III reconstructions. These assumptions can lead to significant error as it has been shown through research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1460408612446573">Walsh and Hoshizaki (2010)</xref> that small variations in impact vector can lead to significantly different head form dynamic responses.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1460408612446573"><title>Limitations to currently used injury metrics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612446573">Goldsmith (1981)</xref> discussed the limitations of the use of a single value to describe the entirety of all the mechanisms of brain injury. He believed that it is unlikely that one parameter could describe the tolerance limits for head injury for all populations. This is especially true for comparisons across the young to the very old, where it has been documented that the material characteristics of brain tissue can change dramatically. Goldsmith agreed with Newman’s concept that rigid body mechanics was not a suitable choice for a system of deformable components such as the head and brain, especially under a loading scenario. Goldsmith also identified the fact that it would be erroneous to use an integration based solely upon peak resultant linear acceleration when rotational acceleration has been identified as a likely contributor to the mechanism of brain injury. This hypothesis has been supported by researchers establishing that linear and rotational motions influence different brain deformation parameters such as intracranial pressure (linearly dependent) and shear stress (rotationally dependent). Due to the low correlations of peak linear and angular accelerations with injury type it has been suggested that injurious brain tissue deformations are probably a product of all aspects of the linear and angular acceleration time histories. If this theory is correct, the nature of these time histories would influence not only the severity but also the location of injurious brain deformations.</p>
<p>The brain material characteristics and how they respond in an impact scenario also influences the location and severity of brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1460408612446573">Prange et al., 2002</xref>). This relationship is not represented by current peak value based injury metrics. It has been documented that each brain material (grey matter, white matter) has different characteristics and anisotropic natures. As a result of these differences it is likely that each material would be affected differently by the three-dimensional linear and angular motions resulting from an impact. This theory would indicate that there may not be a ‘continuum’ of brain injury, but that rather certain brain injuries would be highly influenced by linear motions and others by rotational motions, in both focal and diffuse injury creation.</p>
<p>As a result, it may be concluded that more information would be required if a suitable injury metric was to be established to quantify the mechanism of injury. The first step may be to research the brain deformation response to impact from three-dimensional linear and angular acceleration loads. This type of injury research could account for some of the limitations associated with using peak values and integrations. Through the use of finite element modeling the combined effects of linear and rotational acceleration can be represented by brain deformation. It is that deformation which can be represented using a dependent variable which could be used as an injury metric. This would in part address the need to differentiate between mechanical and physiological damage to the central nervous system (CNS) as well as determining what the brain deformation tolerance levels are as opposed to measuring peak acceleration values. While finite element modeling offers this complex analysis of brain deformation to impact, there are many dependent variables which can be used to describe the nature of these deformations for the purpose of establishing a threshold.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1460408612446573"><title>Injury threshold research</title>
<p>Threshold injury research attempts to link the mechanism of injury to an engineering variable which could be utilized to predict the resulting injury. Currently thresholds have been proposed using kinematics based variables as well as variables describing brain deformation from FE analyses. Kinematics based reconstructions attempt to describe a head injury incident with the resultant linear and rotational accelerations. In finite element analysis brain deformation characteristics describe the injury. These brain deformations can then be compared to existing anatomical thresholds for risk of injury analyses. However, establishing tissue tolerances are difficult as different types of brain tissue are hypothesized to have different thresholds for injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1460408612446573">Morrison et al., 2003</xref>). This is a result of human tissue characteristics varying from individual to individual; however, the following section covers some of what is currently understood about the parameters surrounding tolerance limits of central nervous system tissue for the purpose of research into human brain injury.</p>
<p>As a result of the difficulties in applying threshold values attained from animal and cadaver experiments to living humans, the current method used to correlate mechanical stress thresholds to mechanisms of injury is to use real world brain injury scenarios (Kleiven, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Both Kleiven (2007) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al. (2004)</xref> reconstructed filmed NFL football impacts using physical models inside a laboratory and used the resulting linear and angular accelerations as input for an FEA of the head to discover the regions of strain to the brain (Kleiven, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003)</xref> used a similar method, but the data set included motorcycle accidents as well as the NFL football reconstructions. The tolerances from the NFL reconstructions must be taken as rough thresholds as the parameters surrounding the reconstructions led to nearly 25% error in the resulting head impact kinematics due to camera perspective errors and incorrect impact vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec14-1460408612446573"><title>Kinematic tolerance values</title>
<p>Before the advent of finite element modeling to show tissue deformation, thresholds for injury were based upon the linear and rotational acceleration responses of the head form to impact. For reconstructions of the NFL football impacts, linear and rotational acceleration values of 66, 82 and 106 g and 4600, 5900 and 7900 rad/s<sup>2</sup> were reported for a 25%, 50% and 80% chance of mTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003)</xref> found that mTBI was incurred at roughly 3000 to 4000 rad/s<sup>2</sup> and that subdural hematoma could occur at 130 g. This disagrees with some cadaver impacts, which indicate a threshold of 4500 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for SDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612446573">Lowenhielm, 1974a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1460408612446573">1974b</xref>). Relative points of comparison in the literature could be drawn from animal studies, which were scaled to human head geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1460408612446573">Ommaya et al., 1967</xref>). From primate mTBI data, values of 80 g were considered below threshold for concussion while values above 90 g and 1800 rad/s<sup>2</sup> resulted in concussion and up to 16,000 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for DAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612446573">Margulies and Thibault, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1460408612446573">Ommaya et al., 1967</xref>). Impact tests on volunteers found that a human could withstand values between 2700 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for normal volunteers and around 16,000 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for boxers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612446573">Ewing, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1460408612446573">Pincemaille et al., 1989</xref>). The boxing data is much higher than previous data as a result of the use of sensors attached to the helmet; this results in the measurement of helmet motion which is greater than that of the head. Other data from instrumented helmets found 81, 103 and 82–146 g for thresholds of mTBI for collegiate football players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612446573">Brolinson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612446573">Duma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1460408612446573">Schnebel et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, numerical models were employed to simulate Australian football impacts and found linear and rotational acceleration thresholds of 103 g and 8020 rad/s<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612446573">Fréchède and McIntosh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The low correlation that linear and angular acceleration has to brain injury type has made the use of thresholds based on head kinematics a questionable practice (Kleiven, 2007). This has led to the development of FEM of the human brain to show how an impact quantified in the linear and angular acceleration responses causes brain deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408612446573">King et al., 2003</xref>). With this area of research, scientists have moved away from defining tolerances by kinematics and shifted to measuring brain strain, stress and shear responses to impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408612446573">King et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408612446573">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408612446573">2</xref> show the suggested thresholds to date based on accident reconstructions.

<sec id="sec15-1460408612446573"><title>Tolerance limits for brain injury developed through reconstructions and finite element modeling</title>
<p>Finite element modeling allows for the use of a wealth of parameters with which to describe the results of an impact to the head. Anatomical tissue testing allows for the comparison of simulation results with mechanical tolerances measured in units of strain. Work has been done by researchers doing reconstructive work on real life impacts and some correlations have been made to other variables such as maximum principal strain, Von Mises stress, Intracranial pressure and others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003a)</xref> used their FE head model to explore possible brain injury thresholds using data from motorcycle accidents, American football head injuries and pedestrian head impacts (64 total head injuries). The FE model consisted of the face, cranium, scalp, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), falx and tentorium, and was validated through cadaver impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1460408612446573">Nahum et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1460408612446573">Trosseille et al., 1992</xref>). The motorcycle head impacts were replicated at a drop test facility by modifying the impact parameters until helmet damage could be replicated. The American football head injuries were reconstructed using video recordings of players relative positions, velocities of impact, impact location and simulated using Hybrid III dummy systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1460408612446573">Pellman et al., 2003</xref>). The non-helmeted pedestrian impacts were simulated using an analytical model predicting their kinematics before impacting car windscreens, developed from data acquired at the scene of the accident. The authors investigated the intracerebral pressure response, Von Mises stress and global strain energy of the CSF in comparison to location and type of neurological lesion. The results indicated that the Von Mises stress tolerance limit for a 50% chance of moderate or severe brain injury would be 18 to 38 kPa and subdural hematoma was 5.5 J for global strain energy in the CSF. Overall, the authors found that Von Mises stress was the best indicator for brain injury.</p>
<p>In another study on brain injury tolerances, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003b)</xref> used a novel Bimass headform coupled with a FE model of the human head to reconstruct motorcycle accidents. The physical head surrogate used for reconstruction was a modified Hybrid III headform, with a mass to represent the brain attached to the skull with a damped spring system, to simulate brain skull motion. Thirteen motorcycle accidents were reconstructed in two ways: (i) on a drop tower from the data describing the accident with the new Bimass headform and (ii) the output from a standard Hybrid III three-dimensional time history was used to power the FE model developed at Université Louis Pasteur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner, 2003a</xref>). The Bimass physical model indicated a threshold for concussion at a brain rotational acceleration of 3–4 krad/s<sup>2</sup> and a skull/brain relative translational acceleration of 130 g for subdural hematoma. The FE model indicated a threshold for concussion for a Von Mises stress of approximately 20 kPa, and subdural hematoma thresholds of 4 J for strain energy in the CSF layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner, 2003b</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al. (2004)</xref> used the highly complex and extensively validated Wayne State Brain Injury Model to evaluate mTBI impacts incurred during American football games. The FE model consisted of the scalp, skull, dura, falx tentorium, pia, venous sinuses, CSF, lateral and third ventricles, cerebrum (gray and white matter), cerebellum, brain stem and parasagittal bridging veins, and was validated against cadaver data. Twenty-four helmet to helmet impacts were reconstructed using on-field video data to identify the impact velocity and site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2005</xref>). The impacts were then recreated using helmeted Hybrid III headforms on a guided wire drop rig with similar impact locations and velocities. The authors note that the estimated error of the entire process was around 11.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2005</xref>). The intracranial pressure response of the model showed coup and contrecoup patterns, but the location of peak pressures did not correlate well with sites of concussive brain injury. However, the resulting magnitude of pressure did reflect the severity of impact. Pressure response was found to be highly influenced by translational acceleration and shear strains highly affected by rotational acceleration. The threshold injury analysis showed that shear stress levels for 25%, 50% and 80% chance of mTBI were 6.0, 7.8 and 10 kPa, respectively. The strain thresholds incurred from the reconstruction were 0.14, 0.19 and 0.24 for 25%, 50% and 80% chance of mTBI, respectively. For kinematic correlations, the model indicated that a translational acceleration at the center of gravity of 66, 82 and 106 g and rotational accelerations of 4600, 5900 and 7900 rad/s<sup>2</sup> would lead to a 25%, 50% and 80% chance of mTBI, respectively. For the head injury integrations, a HIC value of 151, 240 and 369 corresponded to the 25%, 50% and 80% chance of mTBI, respectively. The authors noted that their values were lower than many found in the literature, probably a result of the primarily lateral and frontal-lateral reconstructions, known to have a lower tolerance to impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1460408612446573">Gurdjian et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612446573">Kleiven, 2003</xref>). This is an area which needs further research as more brain injury data becomes available.</p>
<p>In 2005, Franklyn et al. used simulated car crash scenarios with known AIS outcomes to test the validity of two FEMs of the human head. The FE models used were the simulated injury monitor (SIMon) and the more refined and complete model developed at Wayne State University (WSUHIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1460408612446573">Zhou et al., 1995</xref>). Real world car crash scenarios were reconstructed in the laboratory with similar impact mechanics as the actual event. All crush dimensions of the cars were recorded by SAE J224 Collision Deformation Classification profile and the change in velocity calculated by CRASH3. Four cases were chosen for reconstruction based upon the relative simplicity of the reconstructive process. One AIS 0, 4 and 5 case was reconstructed and one multiple AIS case was simulated. The reconstruction involved impacting cars into structures with Hybrid III crash test dummies in the appropriate car seat with a Hybrid III headform equipped with a 3-2-2-2 accelerometer array for full 3D capture of the resulting kinematics. The linear and angular accelerations from the reconstructions were then applied through the centre of gravity of each FE head model and comparisons were made to the medical AIS reports. The results of both FE models indicated that they were not able to reliably predict the resulting injuries found in the medical reports. In some cases they were able to predict one type of injury, but not another for the same reconstruction. These difficulties areas are probably a result of variations in the FE model parameters and the reconstructive process. While the models may be partially validated, the validation is very specific and the model may lose some validity when the brain is stressed in such extreme ways. The material characteristics of the model and the parameters describing the material responses are also approximate. The reconstructive process in car crash scenarios is very difficult. There are a number of variables which must be controlled to get an accurate dynamic response for the impact. As a result it is unlikely that the reconstruction produced a linear and rotational acceleration response that could be used as input for such a validation. As such, while the research conducted showed an interesting methodology there were too many variables that were not controlled, demonstrated by the lack of predictive abilities by both FE models.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1460408612446573">Kleiven (2006)</xref> used a validated FE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1460408612446573">Kleiven and Hardy, 2002</xref>) to evaluate the sensitivity of kinematic head injury criteria to different impact vectors. A secondary purpose of the research was to investigate the effect of the kinematic-dependent variables on intracranial strains associated with brain injury. Nine acceleration pulses were applied, pure translational and pure rotational, to the centre of gravity of the head in the posterior/anterior, superior/inferior and lateral vectors. The angular acceleration pulses were sinusoidal with an amplitude of 10–11.6 krad/s<sup>2</sup> with a duration of 5 ms, and a peak angular velocity of 25–29 krad/s (within the range of DAI suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612446573">Marguiles and Thibault, 1992</xref>), which gives a head impact power (HIP) of 4.3 kW. The translational pulses were sinusoidal with an amplitude of 794 m/s<sup>2</sup> (80 g), and a duration of 5 ms, which results in a HIC of 52 and HIP of 4.3 kW. Maximum principal strain was chosen as the predictor for CNS injuries based on its association with DAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612446573">Marguiles and Thibault, 1992</xref>). The results indicated that HIC was unable to predict purely rotational impulses, while HIP and peak change in velocity require scaling to account for changes in direction. Purely rotational impulses and peak change in rotational velocity show best correlation with strain in the FE model. Finally, the authors found that for purely translational impulses, HIC and HIP showed the best correlation with the strain levels in the FE model.</p>
<p>Kleiven (2007) evaluated 58 National Football League head impact cases using a FE model of the human head in an attempt to identify the best brain injury predictor. The data for the 58 cases was the same as was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003b)</xref>, and the data collection method as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al. (2005)</xref>. The author used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1460408612446573">Kleiven and Hardy (2002)</xref> model, and the output from the reconstruction in linear and angular acceleration was used to power the model. Eight tissue level injury predictors were evaluated for correlation to brain injury for six different regions, from the cerebrum to the whole brain. Ten kinematics-based predictors were also investigated for correlation to injury as well as tissue level dependent variables such as strain and pressure. The results of the FE simulation indicated a 50% probability of concussion for maximum principal strain with a value of 0.21 in the corpus callosum and 0.26 in the grey matter. These values are somewhat at odds with previous research which has indicated these strain magnitudes to be associated with contusions and DAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612446573">Bain and Meaney, 2000</xref>). For strain rate, a 50% probability of concussion was found at a value of 48.5 s<sup>−1</sup>. The product of strain and strain rate also showed a correlation with injury with a 50% probability value of 10.1 s<sup>−1</sup>, which is lower than previous reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1460408612446573">Viano and Lovsund, 1999</xref>). The cumulative strain damage measure predicted a 47% chance of concussion in the white matter when 55% of the brain had endured a strain of 0.1, which is close to previous values reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1460408612446573">Takhounts et al. (2003)</xref>. A 50% chance of concussion was found to be 8.4 kPa for Von Mises stress, which is in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al. (2004)</xref> but lower than that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003b)</xref>, likely due to the inclusion of TBI injuries in their reconstructions. Strain energy density indicated a 50% chance of concussion threshold at 2.1 kJ/m<sup>3</sup>. The magnitude of maximum and minimum pressure indicated a 50% chance of concussion in the grey matter for 65.8 kPa, which is in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al. (2004)</xref> (90 kPa) but considerably lower than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1460408612446573">Ward and Nahum (1979)</xref> (183 kPa). For negative pressure a 50% chance of injury was found for a negative pressure of 55.1 kPa in the white matter. The authors felt that this may not be a suitable indicator for injury as negative pressure theories are based upon cavitation, which has been discounted in recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408612446573">Gurdjian and Gurdjian, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612446573">Hardy et al., 1994</xref>). When analyzing the kinematic head data, translational acceleration had the highest correlation with pressure and rotational acceleration with strain. A high correlation to mTBI was found for the HIC, and when used in conjunction with peak change in rotational velocity, showed the best correlation with injury. The author supplied a series of conclusions: (i) the maximum pressure in the grey matter showed the highest significance in statistical correlation with concussion; (ii) for reconstructions, a known injury pattern in the brain correlated well with contours of maximum principal strain, while pressure did not; (iii) rotational kinematics are the most influential factor for intracranial deformations; (iv) translational kinematics are the most influential factor for intracranial pressures; (v) correlation was found between resultant rotational acceleration and resultant peak change in velocity with maximum strain in the brain and (vi) a linear combination of HIC and peak change in rotational velocity showed the highest correlation with maximum principal strain. In conclusion, the author notes that the description of the NFL impacts is not sufficient to adequately reconstruct the head injury cases, as the reported brain injuries did not have medical images with which to correlate any injury.</p>
<p>More recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1460408612446573">Takhounts et al. (2008)</xref> modified their SIMon finite element head model in an attempt to improve its accuracy for use in car crash scenarios. The model was morphed to match a generalized head geometry and the number of elements and the refinement of the mesh was increased. Using this model they analyzed a series of dynamics responses from concussive impacts recorded by the head impact telemetry system (HITS) during American football league games. The resulting dynamic responses measured by the hits system varied from 19 to 135 g for linear and 668 to 9922 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for angular acceleration. The brain deformation metrics used were maximum principal stress and strain. The maximum principal stress was found to have low correlation to injury, which was consistent with the incompressible characteristics of the model. The maximum principal strain varied from 0.076 to 0.921, well in excess of any currently postulated concussive threshold (Kleiven, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The majority of the values were about 50% strain, which would indicate a traumatic brain injury according to most anatomical threshold research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1460408612446573">Lee and Hault, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1460408612446573">Monson et al., 2003</xref>). In their discussion, the authors discuss this discrepancy and attribute the results to the model being relatively ‘soft’ in material characteristics. While this may be true, errors in the input parameters also exist. The HITS system has its sensors attached to the inside of the helmet and calculates its’ linear and angular accelerations from algorithms based upon the accelerometers relative locations. This system overlooks several aspects of impact mechanics, first the helmet is not rigid which changes the relative location of the accelerometers to each other, the accelerometers move in relation to the head, and the sampling speed of these accelerometers are low for impacts (1 kHz). This system also has not been validated for angular acceleration, or if it has it has not been published for peer review. The limitations in the resulting dynamic response data produced by these helmet based reconstructionscontribute to errors in brain tissue modeling.</p>

<p>Kleiven (2007), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1460408612446573">Willinger and Baumgartner (2003a)</xref> are the primary researchers currently investigating brain thresholds by reconstructing brain injury accidents. These researchers have collectively established certain brain tolerance criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1460408612446573">Table 3</xref>), but the lack of complete agreement for any level of injury, may imply a brain injury continuum instead of an exact threshold value. In addition, the authors of this research all use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1460408612446573">Pellman et al.’s (2003)</xref> research into concussive football impacts. This reconstructive data was at best in error 11.3% from video camera analyses and the simulations showed errors of 17% for linear and 25% for resultant angular acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612446573">Newman et al., 2005</xref>). Other researchers have attempted to use a telemetry system to collect reconstructive data, which lacks validation for rotational kinematics. As a result it is doubtful the impact vector was reproduced accurately with these reconstructions, which could lead to large variations in linear and angular acceleration. Also, impact mass has not been adequately established, which is influenced by the contractile state of the players’ muscles involved in the injury scenario. All these things contribute to the difficulty of the reconstruction and call the validity of the output into question.

<p>Kleiven (2007) comments on this discrepancy and acknowledges the limitations of this form of reconstruction in the attempt to establish injury threshold criteria for the brain. However, Kleiven and others have identified that this limitation may be in part overcome if endpoint medical images of the injured area were available for all injury scenarios to allow for comparison and backwards validation of the reconstructive parameters used (Kleiven, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately in all these studies, there was no validation of the reconstructive procedures or the sample size was too small. Further research into this area, preferably with medical scans and accurate reconstructions would be ideal for the establishment of a continuum of brain injury, or specific brain injury thresholds.</p>
<p>Anatomical tissue research has demonstrated that brain structures are viscoelastic and anisotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1460408612446573">Prange et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore it would be reasonable to expect the different regions of brain tissue and anatomic parts of the brain to behave differently under different loading curve types. It could also be suggested that these different brain regions would have different thresholds to injury. This research is a probable explanation of the inaccuracies of using simple linear and rotational acceleration measurements as injury metrics as they do not take into account the response of the brain tissue to such loads. Brain deformation metrics are seen by researchers as dependent variables which would be more correlative to injury, however the correct variable to use for any particular type of injury has yet to be established. The influence of the linear and angular acceleration curve characteristics on brain tissue deformation metrics is also yet to be ascertained. With more accurate FEMs of the human brain these questions may be addressed.</p>
<p>In summary, researchers to date have attempted to link engineering parameters to brain injury with limited success. What currently exist as thresholds are rough guidelines based upon research which had known and accepted limitations within their methodologies. Kleiven (2007) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408612446573">King et al. (2003)</xref> both identify that the reconstructions were flawed and that using medical imaging would aid in eliminating some of the issues surrounding their injury threshold research. Medical imaging would allow for the positive identification of regions of injury for comparison to finite element modeling solutions. This would permit regions of deformation in the model to be compared to the region of injury in the medical images, allowing for a direct measurement of dependent variables in that volume. However, a reconstructive process must be established which accounts for the variabilities in mass, velocity and impact location. A reconstructive process which supplies a window of response could be used in conjunction with modeling to account for continuums of possible reconstructive possibilities and modeling responses. While this method might aid in traumatic brain injury research, it may have limited value in predicting concussive brain injuries as concussions are not well defined by current medical imaging techniques.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1460408612446573" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Mechanisms of injury for the head and brain are undoubtedly linked to some amount of injurious deformation of tissue. Using methods described using finite element and animal models, brain injury mechanisms have been described in many ways by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612446573">Hardy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1460408612446573">Viano et al., 1989</xref>). While each mechanism is supplied as a separate entity, upon further examination they have commonalities. It could be deduced that all brain injuries are linked in some form to either translational or rotational skull/brain motions and could be quantified by measuring brain deformation (Kleiven, 2007). It would seem that all mechanisms investigated are the result of either impact induced or impulsive brain deformation. The loading characteristics, when described using three-dimensional kinematics, can then be quantified through measurement of corresponding engineering variables. Recently through the use of finite element modeling it has become possible to measure brain deformation by simulating head impacts with many output variables such as intracranial pressure and brain strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1460408612446573">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). This allows for a more complete description of the resulting brain deformation from mechanical loading and possibly an avenue to discover a dependent variable which is correlated to injury. These variables and tolerances have been suggested but further work with larger datasets is required. Once this research has been conducted with improvements to reconstruction protocols, tolerance levels linked to mechanism of injury could be proposed. These tolerance levels for injury could then be used to improve the design of protective equipment and inform standards committees to help improve standards governing protective technology.</p>
