<p>To ask an economist to write a book review for a business-sociology journal is suspicious. All the more so when it is an excellent book about the failings of the economics field in general. That suspicion increases when the dire consequences of these failings are made apparent, as they are in John Quiggin’s book based on his contributions to the Crooked Timber blog, <italic>Zombie Economics, How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us</italic>.</p>
<p>The immense tragedy of recent economic events notwithstanding, the book will provide schadenfreude to sociologists, psychologists, or managerial scholars who have been pointing out the obvious failings of homo-economicus for some time. The book documents the empirically unsupported beliefs in rational markets of the economic orthodoxy in both the financial and macro-economic subdisciplines. The irony of the lack of rationality from the primary proponents of rationality is not lost on Quiggin, who is a talented economist himself, though his main goal is to nudge the field to a more useful line of inquiry. A note of caution to triumphalists: the book is not a general indictment of neoclassical economics and the insights one gains from paying attention to monetary incentives. Rather, Quiggin demonstrates how applications of the most <italic>extreme</italic> forms of economic thinking pervaded the mainstream and the resulting fallout.</p>
<p>First, Quiggin explains how ill-supported economic theories led to the pervasive adoption of liberal economic policies, with dire consequences for macro-economic stability over time and eventually leading to “the Great Recession.” Specifically, the book devotes a chapter to explaining and debunking each of the following ideas (in order of interest to <italic>ASQ</italic> readers): the efficient market hypothesis, privatization (private firms can always do things better than the government), the Great Moderation (long-lasting macro-economic stability), Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (a fundamentally anti-Keynesian idea that is foundational in micro-foundational models of macro-economic phenomena), and trickle-down economics (policies benefiting the wealthy will eventually make all better off). Each chapter is helpfully broken into five main sections that explore the timeline of the ideas: “Birth,” “Life,” “Death,” “Reanimation,” and “After the Zombies.” Quiggin then focuses on the way forward, both intellectually and in terms of policy.</p>
<p>Although it is not an exhaustive scholarly exercise—the book is written for a popular audience—the book is nevertheless convincing and methodical in explaining why the above ideas are inconsistent with reality and simultaneously identifying their central proponents. Those not intimately aware of the central ideas, methods, and intellectual history of mainstream financial and macro-economics of the last half century will be handsomely rewarded by reading this book. For example, the efficient market hypothesis, which implies that “financial markets are the best possible guides to the value of economic assets and therefore to decisions about investment and production” (p. 35) sits at the heart of the justifications for market liberalism. For this reason, its falsification is a threatening event for many stakeholders. If markets are efficient, then regulation is not. Quiggin discusses the intellectual history of the efficient markets hypothesis and assesses the evidence in its support: general support for the weak form, in which it is difficult to systematically beat the market; weak or no support for the strong form, in which the market is always correctly summarizing underlying value. The strong form implies among other things that there cannot be bubbles. But despite much historical and experimental evidence to the contrary, the strong-form hypothesis inspired the dismantling of the post-depression regulatory framework beginning in the 1980s and became common wisdom among economists by the 1990s. The spectacular failures of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, various emerging economies’ financial crises in the 1990s, and the dot-com bull market failed to break the spell. As is known by all, in 2008, the financial crises triggered by rampant over-lending erased 10 percent of the world’s annual income ($4 trillion) and would have brought down the world financial system if not for aggressive, unprecedented, and expensive government intervention. These events reduce the foundations of market liberalism, at the very least in its most orthodox form, to shambles. Yet the ideas continue to enjoy support in academic and lay circles. These are “zombie” ideas.</p>
<p>Quiggin’s goal is to redirect economic thinking, and I believe that he has irrefutably justified such redirection. To a lay reader, the book also provides an excellent primer on why the proponents of liberal economics are wrong on the merits of theory. Quiggin also provides many suggestions for a way forward for the field. I encourage everyone to read this book. It is enlightening.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to <italic>ASQ</italic> readers, Quiggin documents the persistence of these zombie ideas with a sad wonder and incredulousness; the irony of the zombie phenomenon in a field promoting rational man is simultaneously astounding and exasperating. For example, the idea that the Great Moderation exists would appear false on its face in view of recent events. Yet Quiggin notes that two of this idea’s proponents, in the <italic>American Economic Review,</italic> called the recent crises—which, in Quiggin’s words, “destroyed whole national economies, bankrupted millions, doubled the U.S. employment rate, and threatened to bring down the entire financial system—a “transitory volatility blip.” Unfortunately, the explanations for the zombie phenomenon are atheoretical. Perhaps this is because providing such explanations is beyond Quiggin’s purpose, or because he, together with the field of economics, generally lacks a theory to explain it. A clever sociologist might enlighten and profit from applying his or her toolkit to this case.</p>
<p>When I put on my economist’s hat, I admire my field’s ability to publicly hang its soiled laundry in public. I encourage my colleagues in sociology, psychology, and management to read this book and leverage it to lead to a more integrated social science and, perhaps, a more socially aware economic science.</p>
