<abstract>
<p>Drawing on the social identity theory of leadership and optimal distinctiveness theory, this research examined differences in perceived attitude similarity to in- and outgroup leaders among Liberals and Conservatives before and after the 2008 U.S. presidential election. We predicted Liberals and Conservatives alike would perceive their ingroup leaders (Obama or McCain) to be attitudinally similar to themselves before the election. After the election, however, Conservatives were expected to distance themselves from McCain and to accentuate similarity to Obama. Using a longitudinal design, analysis of American National Election Survey (<italic>N =</italic> 742) data showed that Liberals and Conservatives viewed themselves to be similar to their respective ingroup leader and dissimilar to the outgroup leader. Consistent with expectations, Conservatives significantly accentuated perceived similarity with Obama following his electoral victory, and significantly distanced themselves from McCain following his loss. Liberals’ similarity with either candidate did not change from pre- to postelection. Implications for social identity in inter- and intragroup leadership contexts are discussed.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that people prefer and are attracted to similar others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212437212">Byrne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212437212">Condon &amp; Crano, 1988</xref>). We tend to perceive similar others more favorably, and are more influenced by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2010</xref>). Affinity toward leaders, both political and organizational, is no exception to this principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212437212">Crano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212437212">Engle &amp; Lord, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212437212">Quist &amp; Crano, 2003</xref>). Although the positive attitude similarity–attraction relationship has proven one of the most robust in social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212437212">Berscheid &amp; Walster, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212437212">Crano &amp; Prislin, 2006</xref>), there has been surprisingly little research on leader–follower similarity given its implications for organizational and political leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212437212">Deluga, 1998</xref>). Research examining this relationship indicates that followers favor and vote for leaders they perceive as attitudinally similar to themselves. However, many studies do not investigate leader–follower similarity after a success or failure, nor do they take into account how winning or losing affects intergroup leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212437212">Hogg, van Knippenberg, &amp; Rast, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Using data from the 2008–2009 American National Election Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212437212">DeBell, Krosnick, Lupia, &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>), we explored voters’ perceived similarity to in- and outgroup leaders before and after an electoral success or failure. Our theoretical framework draws on the social identity theory of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212437212">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212437212">Hogg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2003</xref>), and optimal distinctiveness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212437212">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212437212">Leonardelli, Pickett, &amp; Brewer, 2010</xref>). From these perspectives, perceptions of leader similarity ought to be determined by whether followers are motivated to be distinct from or assimilate to a shared superordinate group. We expected that before the 2008 presidential election, Liberals and Conservatives would view their respective ingroup leader (Obama or McCain) as more attitudinally similar to themselves than the outgroup leader. Following McCain’s loss Conservatives were expected to change their similarity perceptions, now viewing McCain as being attitudinally distant from themselves, while enhancing perceived closeness between Obama and themselves.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430212437212">
<title>Social identity theory</title>
<p>Underemphasized in leadership research is the notion that leadership is a group process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212437212">Chemers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430212437212">van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003</xref>). The social identity theory of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212437212">Hogg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2003</xref>) holds that when group membership is salient, leader prototypicality becomes increasingly important. As a result, the emphasis is not on the leader’s individuality, but the leader’s group representativeness and similarity. Through depersonalization—a perceptual process by which an individual is no longer seen as a distinct, unique individual but rather as an embodiment of the in- or outgroup prototype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212437212">Abrams &amp; Hogg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2006</xref>)—people’s perceptions of attitude similarity to other group members are based on appraisals of the group prototypicality, not their interpersonal similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212437212">Hogg, Hardie, &amp; Reynolds, 1995</xref>). Depersonalization also accentuates intragroup similarities (i.e., assimilation) and intergroup differences (i.e., differentiation). Therefore, ingroup–outgroup status affect perceptions of similarity such that one perceives fellow ingroup members as being similar and outgroup members as being dissimilar to oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212437212">Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane, Hogg, &amp; Turner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>There is robust empirical support for this idea and its application to a wide range of leadership phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212437212">Ellemers, de Gilder, &amp; Haslam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212437212">Hogg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212437212">van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, De Cremer, &amp; Hogg, 2004</xref>). Particularly relevant to the current study is research on intergroup leadership. In an intergroup leadership context, ingroup leaders are perceived as more similar and evaluated more favorably than outgroup leaders; and outgroup leaders are perceived as less prototypical or nonprototypical compared to ingroup leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212437212">Cheng, Fielding, Hogg, &amp; Terry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212437212">Duck &amp; Fielding, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212437212">Hohman, Hogg, &amp; Bligh, 2010</xref>; for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212437212">Hogg et al., in press</xref>). That is, ingroup leaders are perceived as being more similar to “us,” and are more trusted, liked, and supported. Conversely, outgroup leaders are perceived as dissimilar to “us” and therefore are distrusted, disliked, and not supported.</p>
<p>Social identity researchers also have examined how perceptions of the overarching group and its leader are affected differently when intersubgroup followers nominate or elect a superordinate group leader. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212437212">Duck and Fielding (1999)</xref> found that simply nominating leaders in an intergroup context made subgroup identities salient. Furthermore, when intersubgroup competition was made salient, group members expected in- and outgroup leaders to favor their own subgroup but treat their respective outgroup unfairly. Conversely, when making an external threat salient, both ingroup and outgroup leaders were more likely to be perceived as similar to and favored by intersubgroup followers. They reasoned that an external threat (e.g., economic crisis, foreign war) leads members to “define their interdependence and identity at the level of the common ingroup, to work for superordinate goals, and to downplay subgroup boundaries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212437212">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212437212">Kramer &amp; Brewer, 1984</xref>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212437212">1999</xref>, p. 216)—reasoning which is also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212437212">2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212437212">Leonardelli et al., 2010)</xref> optimal distinctiveness theory.</p>

<title>Optimal distinctiveness theory</title>
<p>According to optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT), individuals strive for a balance between group inclusion, assimilation, and differentiating themselves from others. The relative strength of assimilation or differentiation motives depends on several contextual factors, including one’s ability to derive a positive social identity. With threats to subgroup distinctiveness, people will strive to maximize intergroup distinctions while assimilating to their subgroup (vs. the superordinate group), which also provides a positive social identity. When one’s positive social identity is threatened, such as after suffering a defeat, people will assimilate to the superordinate group to achieve optimal distinctiveness and a positive social identity rather than their subgroup, assuming group boundaries are permeable. These two situations are reminiscent of a pre- and postpresidential election, where prior to the election Liberals and Conservatives strive to differentiate themselves from one another. After the election, one group has lost and must now assimilate to the superordinate (American) group to garner a positive social identity.</p>
<p>Although research highlights the challenges facing intergroup leadership and the role of social identity dynamics in leadership, scholars have paid little attention to how perceptions of attitudinal similarity shift for in- and outgroup leaders following success or failure. Germane, however, is research demonstrating that leaders representative of their group receive strong support after a success or failure, whereas less representative leaders are not afforded such leeway: followers distance themselves psychologically from a nonrepresentative group leader following failure but not after success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212437212">Giessner &amp; van Knippenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212437212">Giessner, van Knippenberg, &amp; Sleebos, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These lines of research have not examined the effect of leader success or failure on evaluations of leaders in an intergroup context, nor have they addressed how perceptions of the leader change after success and failure. Taken together, research suggests that in an intersubgroup context (e.g., a presidential election), group members will perceive ingroup, as opposed to outgroup leaders as more similar to themselves. After the election, however, the social context may be changed, such that subgroups are recategorized into a superordinate, common ingroup (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212437212">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212437212">Crisp &amp; Hewstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212437212">Dovidio, Gaertner, &amp; Lamoreaux, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the winner of the U.S. presidential election, and now leader of all Americans, is perceived as an ingroup leader (at least briefly), thus increasing followers’ perceptions of leader–follower similarity. Simultaneously, the losing leader is cast as outgroup and perceived as dissimilar to ingroup members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368430212437212">
<title>Current study</title>
<p>The research reported here examines the process of psychological distancing of in- and outgroup members following a political victory or defeat. This is relevant to the majority of political elections, especially presidential elections, in which people belong to opposing parties before the election but must come together afterward to provide shared support for the elected leader, whether or not the leader is from one’s own group. Although some research has examined the psychological effects of leader successes and failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212437212">Giessner &amp; van Knippenberg, 2008</xref>), many questions remain. For example, as perceived similarity increases influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212437212">Hogg, 2010</xref>), being perceived as similar to one’s followers is immensely important for leaders. Do perceptions of leader–follower similarity change following a leader’s electoral success or failure? What effect does success or failure have on leadership perceptions and endorsements in intergroup contexts? These two questions are addressed in the current study.</p>
<p>A nationally representative survey was analyzed to document changes in perceptions of similarity to U.S. presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, among self-described Liberal and Conservative voters before and after the 2008 presidential election. Drawing on the social identity theory of leadership, we hypothesized that people would be motivated to perceive their ingroup leader as attitudinally similar to themselves. This hypothesis is consistent with previous research demonstrating that people perceive themselves as more similar to ingroup than outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212437212">Hogg et al., 1995</xref>). It should follow that Liberal participants should accentuate their similarity to ingroup leader and Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, making him significantly more influential than Republican candidate John McCain. Conversely, Conservatives viewing the ingroup Republican candidate as being similar to themselves are likely to trust McCain more, which would increase liking and thus McCain’s capacity to influence their thoughts and behaviors.</p>
<p>Another objective of the present research was to examine the moderating role of leader success or failure on perceived similarity. That is, should one’s perception of leader similarity change <italic>after</italic> the leader’s electoral success or defeat? We predicted that followers would distance themselves attitudinally from the losing candidate and associate more closely with the election winner. This hypothesis is based on the presumption that prior to the election, a competitive (Liberals vs. Conservatives) intergroup context prevails; however, after the election the context shifts to an <italic>intra</italic>group frame of reference (i.e., “We are all Americans”). This conceptualization is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212437212">2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212437212">Leonardelli et al.’s (2010)</xref> optimal distinctiveness research: prior to an election, groups gain a positive social identity by emphasizing their distinctiveness from the outgroup. However, to achieve a positive social identity following McCain’s loss, Conservatives would be expected to assimilate to the superordinate group (Americans). This would result in their distancing themselves from the former ingroup leader McCain, and accentuating their similarity to the newly elected ingroup leader Obama. Conversely, Liberal voters would not feel pressure to distance themselves from the losing candidate, nor to accentuate their similarity with the winner.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1368430212437212">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>The analyses employed archival data from the 2008–2009 American National Election Studies Panel study (ANES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212437212">DeBell, Krosnick, Lupia, &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>), a longitudinal 21-month panel survey with a representative sample of the American electorate. Respondents were recruited by telephone and the survey was administered online. Because the current study sought to examine the effects of perceived leader similarity immediately before and after a political win or loss, only the October 2008 (preelection) and November 2008 (postelection) responses were used (i.e., Waves 10 and 11).</p>
<p>Participants were U.S. citizens aged 18 or older as of Election Day in November 2008. A total of 3,049 participants were asked questions in at least one round of the ANES panel dataset. A subset of these possible participants was randomized to receive questions regarding policy issues (<italic>N</italic> = 1353). This yielded 1,266 participants who completed the same political attitude measures at both Round 10 (Time 1) and 11 (Time 2), necessary for a repeated-measures design. Among these participants, they described themselves as politically <italic>Liberal</italic> (23.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 294<italic>), Conservative</italic> (35.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 448), or <italic>neither Liberal nor Conservative</italic> (41.3% <italic>n</italic> = 523). For the purpose of this study, the final sample (<italic>N</italic> = 782) used in the analyses included Liberal (39.6%) and Conservative (60.4%) respondents only, of whom 45.4% were males, with an average age of 50.94 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.86). Political ideology (Liberalism vs. Conservatism) was chosen as an indicator of political leader support rather than political party (Democrat vs. Republican) to replicate previous research, which has shown that the former serves as a more accurate predictor of U.S. voting behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212437212">Hohman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1368430212437212">
<title>Procedure and measures</title>
<p>Reports of participants’ own attitudes and perceived attitude similarity to both leaders were collected in October 2008, immediately preceding the presidential election, and in November 2008, immediately following the election, after the election results had been announced.</p>
<sec id="section7-1368430212437212">
<title>Political ideology</title>
<p>Participants at Time 1 indicated whether they would describe themselves as: (a) <italic>Liberal</italic> (b) <italic>Conservative</italic> or (c) <italic>neither Liberal nor Conservative</italic>. Only participants who indicated either being Liberal or Conservative were used. Participants who described themselves as being Liberal were assumed to view Barack Obama as an ingroup leader; those describing themselves as Conservative were assumed to view John McCain as their ingroup leader.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430212437212">
<title>Attitudes on policy issues</title>
<p>Participants responded to sets of eight items regarding various policy issues measured at both time points. They were asked to indicate their own opinion on each item, what they thought Barack Obama would feel about each item, and what they thought John McCain would feel about each item. After reporting their personal views, computer randomization ensured that half of the participants received the Obama questions first and the other half the McCain questions first. Participants were asked, “<italic>Do</italic> (you, Barack Obama, John McCain) <italic>favor, oppose, or neither favor nor oppose</italic>” (a) “An amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning marriage between two people who are the same sex?” (b) “Raising federal income taxes for people who make more than $200,000 per year?” (c) “The U.S. government paying for all of the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens who are living on very little income?” (d) “The U.S. government paying for all necessary medical care for all Americans?” (e) “The government being able to put this person in prison for months without ever bringing the person to court and charging him or her with a crime?” (f) “The U.S. government being required to get a court order before it can listen in on phone calls made by American citizens who are suspected of being terrorists?” (g) “Allowing illegal immigrants [defined as citizens of other countries who have come to live in the United States without the permission of the U.S. government] to work in the United States for up to three years, after which they would have to go back to their home country?”; (h) “The U.S. government making it possible for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1368430212437212">
<title>Perceived leader similarity</title>
<p>Perceived similarity indices were computed to represent the extent to which participants believed each leader’s opinions on policy issues were similar to their own. For instance, a participant who was in “favor” of a particular issue and also indicated that the candidate (e.g., Obama) would “favor” the same issue was conceptualized as being similar to Obama on that attitude object and was coded as 1. Likewise, an item score of 1 indicated that the respondent’s “oppose” response matched the perceived response of the candidate. Similarity also was inferred if both the personal response and the perceived response of the candidate were found to be “neither favor nor oppose.” Conversely, nonmatching responses were coded as 0. Four summed composite scores were computed to represent the number of issues (0 to 8) on which respondents perceived similarity between (a) self and Obama at T1 (α = .69), (b) self and McCain at T1 (α = .61), (c) self and Obama at T2 (α = .57), and (d) self and McCain at T2 (α = .50). The less than ideal reliability coefficients reflect the use of composites formed from binary items, the diverse range of issues assessed, and that each candidate’s views were not expected to correspond perfectly with each respondent’s personal views. Higher scores reflected higher perceived similarity between the respondent and the leader. Scores could range from 0 to 8.</p>

<p>Because the success or failure of a leader is proposed to influence the perceived similarity over time in the present research, Obama’s election victory in the 2008 presidential race was operationalized as leader success, McCain’s defeat as leader failure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Analyses of descriptive data indicate that the average number of policy issues on which respondents viewed themselves to be similar to Obama and McCain ranged from 3.20 to 3.84 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430212437212">Table 1</xref>). As shown, consistent with expectations, Liberal political ideology positively correlated with perceived similarity to Obama, and Conservative ideology positively correlated with perceived similarity to McCain. The perceived similarity composites also showed robust test–retest reliability.</p>

<p>To examine omnibus differences between Liberal and Conservative perceptions of similarity toward their respective in- and outgroup leaders before and after the election, we conducted a 2 (political ideology: Liberal or Conservative) × 2 (time: T1 preelection, T2 postelection) repeated measures MANOVA. As defined previously, Obama was the political leader for Liberals, and McCain the political leader for Conservatives. Perceived attitudinal similarity to both Obama and McCain, assessed at both time points, served as the dependent measures. Multivariate main effects emerged for political ideology, Wilks’ λ = .52, <italic>F</italic>(2, 739) = 347.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and time, Wilks’ λ = .99, <italic>F</italic>(2, 739) = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The multivariate interaction of political ideology and time also was statistically significant, Wilks’ λ = .97, <italic>F</italic>(2, 739) = 9.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. To explore these significant omnibus results, univariate repeated measures analyses were undertaken on perceived similarity to Obama and on perceived similarity to McCain.</p>
<p>Perceived similarity to Obama was examined first. A significant main effect for political ideology indicated that Liberals (<italic>M</italic> = 5.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.49) reported significantly greater similarity to Obama than did Conservatives (<italic>M</italic> = 2.82, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52), <italic>F</italic>(1, 740) = 487.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The main effect for time was not statistically significant <italic>F</italic>(1, 740) = .29, <italic>ns</italic>: perceived similarity to Obama remained unchanged from pre- (<italic>M</italic> = 3.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.17) to postelection (<italic>M</italic> = 3.84, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.97). However, the interaction of political ideology and time was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 740) = 6.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212437212">Figure 1</xref>). Examination of simple main effects revealed that Liberals did not change their perceptions of similarity to Obama from pre- to postelection, paired <italic>t</italic>(293) = 1.35, <italic>ns</italic>, but Conservatives did—after the election, their perceived similarity to Obama increased significantly, paired <italic>t</italic>(447) = 2.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>Perceived similarity to McCain was examined next. A significant main effect for political ideology indicated that Conservatives (<italic>M</italic> = 4.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.59) reported significantly greater similarity to McCain than did Liberals, (<italic>M</italic> = 2.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27), <italic>F</italic>(1, 740) = 320.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drawing on the social identity theory of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212437212">Hogg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2003</xref>) and optimal distinctiveness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer, 1991</xref>), we examined the relationship between perceived attitudinal similarity between self and in- and outgroup leaders among Liberals and Conservatives before and after the 2008 presidential election. Using a nationally representative sample, people perceived relevant ingroup leaders as similar to themselves, and outgroup leaders as highly dissimilar. Before the election, Liberals viewed their ingroup leader, Obama, as being attitudinally similar to themselves across a range of policy issues, while McCain was perceived to be attitudinally dissimilar. Conversely, Conservatives viewed ingroup leader McCain as being attitudinally similar to themselves, while Obama was perceived as attitudinally dissimilar.</p>
<p>Perceived similarity changed markedly from pre- to postelection. Conservatives perceived McCain as less similar to themselves following his loss, and perceived Obama as more similar to themselves following his win. Liberals did not change their perceptions of similarity with either candidate after the election. One factor in explaining these results is the transition from a preelection intergroup context to a postelection intragroup context. Before the election, the intergroup competition between Liberals and Conservatives was highly salient. Faced with the monumental responsibility of electing the United States’ first female vice president or the first Black president, voters were urged to identify on which side of the fence they sat. In fact, during preelection phase, electoral maps became particularly popular for viewers: NBC even went as far as turning New York’s Rockefeller Center ice rink into “Election Plaza”—a giant map of the USA where on Election Day NBC colored Obama states blue and McCain states red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212437212">Huff, 2008</xref>). An important consequence of high uncertainty is increased identification with one’s salient political ingroup and perceived similarity toward the ingroup leader.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Obama’s electoral victory (and McCain’s loss), an <italic>intra</italic>group context was established. The electoral race was over, and respondents were motivated to identify with the superordinate group—Americans—to achieve a positive social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212437212">Leonardelli et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, Conservatives perceived higher attitudinal similarity to the superordinate ingroup leader, President Obama, and higher dissimilarity with the defeated candidate, McCain. These results are consistent with and extend previous social identity theory of leadership research in intergroup situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212437212">Duck &amp; Fielding, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212437212">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212437212">Hohman et al., 2010</xref>), as well as research on recategorization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212437212">Crisp, Stone, &amp; Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430212437212">Stone &amp; Crisp, 2007</xref>). Their results also demonstrate the applicability of the social identity theory of leadership to “real life” events and applied settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212437212">Haslam, Reicher, &amp; Platow, 2012</xref>, for extensive discussion).</p>
<sec id="section13-1368430212437212">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Liberals did not report higher postelection perceptions of similarity toward Obama, or significantly lower postelection perceptions of similarity toward McCain, as predicted. This limitation could stem from Liberals’ leader similarity reports reaching a ceiling for Obama; Liberals’ perceptions of similarity with McCain became largely irrelevant after McCain’s loss, and hence there was little pressure for change in these views. These different forces would result in the pattern of findings disclosed in the analyses. Conservatives, on the other hand, were faced with a clear disconfirmation of expectations (or hopes). Disconfirmations of this sort usually result in cognitive readjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212437212">Festinger, 1957</xref>), and these readjustments were evident in the patterns of their changing similarity perceptions.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the current study is the archival nature of the data that was analyzed to draw our conclusions. As secondary analyses, we were restricted to a finite set of questions, which did not include measures of prototypicality, social identification, or explicit measures of perceived inter/intragroup contexts. Further investigation in this domain should include these questions to solidify our knowledge of these perceived similarity processes, and help rule out alternative explanations in addition to those suggested here. Future research on this topic would benefit from exploring the impact of a leader’s rhetoric in motivating followers to assimilate to or distance from their superordinate group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212437212">Rast, Gaffney, &amp; Hogg, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430212437212">Seyranian &amp; Bligh, 2008</xref>), the moderating role of self-uncertainty in perceptions of leader support and effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212437212">Hohman et al., 2010</xref>), the importance of perceived similarity in an intergroup leadership context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212437212">Hogg et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212437212">Pittinsky &amp; Simon, 2007</xref>), as well as additional use of longitudinal and/or secondary data analyses to examine the social identity theory of leadership in more applied settings (for an empirical overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430212437212">van Knippenberg, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results extend previous claims demonstrating the delicate balance of recategorizing one’s group identity among followers whose leader must govern internally divided parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212437212">Duck &amp; Fielding, 1999</xref>). Consistent with what we know of followers’ goals to maintain a distinctive yet cohesive group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212437212">Brewer, 1991</xref>), our findings are intuitively appealing, and provide three important contributions to current theory and research. First, these results support the main claim of the social identity analysis of leadership; namely, that leadership is an important identity function. Second, the research examined an intergroup leadership context in an applied field setting in which two groups demonstrated strong identification with two distinct leaders. While the leadership literature is vast, rarely is leadership considered in an intergroup context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212437212">Hogg et al., in press</xref>). Third, the research examined how leadership perceptions and support changed over time. Our findings highlight the challenge leaders face when constructing or modifying a group’s identity, especially in a competitive situation following a success or failure. Following Obama’s inauguration as president, he became the group leader of all Americans; conferred the responsibility of identity entrepreneurship, Americans looked to him to dictate the attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors appropriate for the superordinate group identity. Conversely, following his loss, McCain was denied capacity to shape the group’s identity and became largely irrelevant and noninfluential. It should come as no surprise that these are precisely the political concerns that leaders of any organization face, further demonstrating the central role played by perceived similarity in intergroup leadership, and instigating deeper investigation of leader and followership as a fundamentally group process.</p>
