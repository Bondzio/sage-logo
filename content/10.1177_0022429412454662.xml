<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the degree withdrawal patterns of undergraduate music education majors, with a specific focus on the individual experiences of students withdrawing from the major. Data from recently withdrawn students (<italic>N</italic> = 14) were assembled using a qualitative methodology that included semistructured interviews, questionnaires, researcher journals, and meetings with experienced researchers. The data were analyzed and coded, generating a number of categories for discussion and analysis. Students’ experiences during college were diverse, with concerns focused on the applied music component of the degree surfacing as important to many students. The reasons given for withdrawal from the music education program also were diverse, including dismissal from the applied music studio, erosion of personal confidence as a musician, realizations about their feelings toward music versus their feelings about teaching in general as it related to their personal career goals, and personal life issues. Following withdrawal from the music education curriculum, all interviewed students reported that they remained actively involved in music in some way. Implications of these results are discussed in relation to individual experiences and the function of those experiences within the context of current models of student persistence.</p>

<p>Individuals involved with the preparation of future music educators have been concerned with undergraduate student persistence for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412454662">Asmus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412454662">Bergee, 1992</xref>). These concerns have been heightened by data suggesting potential shortages in the teacher population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429412454662">MENC: The National Association for Music Education, 2001</xref>) as well as data citing attrition rates among practicing teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412454662">Hancock, 2008</xref>). The experiences of both preservice and in-service music teachers have been examined in attempts to better understand a number of variables relating to persistence and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412454662">Bergee, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412454662">Bergee, Coffman, Demorest, Humphreys, &amp; Thornton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412454662">Kelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412454662">Madsen &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022429412454662">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022429412454662">Russell, 2012</xref>); however, very little attention has been paid to these variables among students who have withdrawn from the undergraduate music education degree track.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years, university student persistence has been one of the most highly researched areas of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022429412454662">Tinto, 2006</xref>). Early explorations attempting to predict student persistence focused predominantly on the individual student traits of gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and psychological variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429412454662">Pantages &amp; Creedon, 1978</xref>). As research progressed, researchers moved away from student-centered examinations of student persistence and began examining the relationship between the student and the institution as being predictive of persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412454662">Astin, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412454662">1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412454662">Bean, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022429412454662">Spady, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022429412454662">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022429412454662">Tinto, 1975</xref>). A number of models to predict student persistence arose from these examinations, with the theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022429412454662">Tinto (1975)</xref> gaining the most attention because it presented a detailed structure through which other researchers could examine specific behaviors effecting persistence and attrition.</p>
<p>Research involving predictive models of student persistence gained momentum, with early investigations focused on entire student populations; however, the need for explorations of student retention within specific populations arose, leading a number of researchers to focus explicitly on subgroupings by race, first-time-in-college status, ethnicity, religion, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412454662">Astin &amp; Oseguera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412454662">Grimes &amp; Antworth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022429412454662">Tinto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022429412454662">Vignoles &amp; Powdthavee, 2009</xref>). Differing types of institutions (i.e., community colleges, private universities, public universities) also were focused on, as were educational units within institutions and specific areas of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412454662">Kroc, Howard, Hull, &amp; Woodward, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429412454662">Leppel, 2001</xref>). Some specific majors, mostly in the sciences, received considerable examination because of concerns about a shortfall in the workforce in these particular areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412454662">Buerhaus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412454662">Jackson, Gardner, &amp; Sullivan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412454662">Jeffreys, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022429412454662">McAdoo, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As research focusing on the relationship between student persistence and specific groups, majors, and areas of involvement expanded, the area of music served as the subject of a variety of studies. In an attempt to identify predictors of college success and graduation, characteristics of 304 undergraduate music education majors were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412454662">George, 1969</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412454662">George (1969)</xref> isolated a number of variables, including multiple standardized tests, high school grade point average (GPA), college GPA, and a number of demographic data points. Results indicated that high school GPA and scores on tests of musical achievement served as the best predictors of college success.</p>
<p>In a longitudinal study of music education majors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412454662">Dudd (1978)</xref> examined 134 students across a 19-year period. Dudd sought to isolate variables that could serve as predictors of final college GPA, graduation from college, and continued service in the profession of music education following graduation. In all, 130 preenrollment variables were examined. Results indicated that the best predictors of student persistence were music-related variables, whereas the most accurate predictors of overall GPA were nonmusic academic variables. Using these criteria, student persistence could be predicted successfully 74% of the time, and continued service in the profession of music education could be predicted at a rate of 64%.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412454662">Brown and Alley (1983)</xref> examined 201 first-term freshmen and transfer students majoring in music education to analyze specific traits that may have predicted persistence and attrition. The overall attrition rate for the students in this study was 44% (89 of 201), with the attrition rate for freshmen (50%) being higher than that of transfer students (34%). Among the variables analyzed, Brown and Alley found college GPA to be the most powerful predictor of student persistence. This finding, in which college GPA accounted for nearly half of the variance between groups, is consistent with previous research. Of potentially greater interest was the music-specific correlation between freshman music jury grade and student persistence. This variable was second only to college GPA in predicting student persistence.</p>
<p>Academic variables also constituted the focus of a later examination in an attempt to find factors unique to student withdrawal from the music education degree plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412454662">Corley, 2003</xref>). Citing the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412454662">Brown and Alley (1983)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412454662">Corley (2003)</xref> approached this issue by breaking the academic area into three distinct learning environments: applied lessons, ensembles, and nonperformance courses. In addition to collecting grade data, the researcher constructed a questionnaire to measure student perceptions of these learning environments. Results indicated no significant predictors of participants’ intentions to withdraw from the music education programs.</p>
<p>Quantitative methods of inquiry have been the primary lens through which researchers have chosen to examine student persistence and attrition, as evidenced by the previously cited research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022429412454662">Tinto (1997)</xref> addressed this trend, calling on researchers to conduct more research of a qualitative nature to explore “how involvement is shaped within the context of differing institutions of higher education by student educational experiences” (p. 600). Many subgroups have been examined qualitatively to gain a better understanding of the impact of individual student experiences; however, researchers have begun only recently to explore music education students’ experiences with this methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412454662">Conway, Eros, Pellegrino, &amp; West, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022429412454662">Tinto’s (1997)</xref> claim that “until individual experiences are investigated we will fail to have a thorough understanding of how student experience actually affects student persistence” (p. 600) encourages a need for further examination of this subject.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of students who had withdrawn recently from the music education major. Specific questions addressed were the following: (a) Were there any commonalities among interviewed students’ experiences before, during, or after their time as a music education major? (b) What factors influenced attrition from the music education degree? and (c) What degree path was taken after departing the music education degree?</p>
<sec id="section1-0022429412454662" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was qualitative in nature and used a case study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412454662">Merriam, 1998</xref>). I chose this method on the basis of an articulated need for more descriptive data focused on the retention and attrition of undergraduates in general, with a special need for this level of examination of undergraduate music education students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412454662">Conway et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022429412454662">Tinto, 1997</xref>). The intent of this study was not to provide a generalizable conclusion but to generate contextual examples that may serve as the basis for further discussions and research on the topic.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022429412454662">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>I located participants (<italic>N</italic> = 14) using data furnished by the registrar’s office at the sample university. The data set contained students who entered the music education major in the fall of 2006 through the spring of 2009 and included enrollment status, graduation status, degrees awarded, major, age, and contact information. To participate, the students had to have (a) been classified as a newly admitted university student during the 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009 academic year, (b) been classified as a music education major during some period of college enrollment, and (c) formally withdrawn from the music education program at the time of the study. I contacted a total of 25 students fitting these criteria, and 14 signed institutional review board–approved informed consent agreements to participate in the study. The participant group was representative of the music unit being examined and included students who had been enrolled in general (<italic>n</italic> = 1), choral (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and instrumental (<italic>n =</italic> 9) music education tracks.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022429412454662">
<title>Description of the University, the Music Unit, and the Music Education Program</title>
<p>The sample institution was a public 4-year comprehensive doctoral research university located in the southeastern United States. The music unit was identified by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429412454662">National Association of Schools of Music (2010)</xref> as being in their largest enrollment category (400+). The institution offered multiple music degrees at multiple levels, bachelor through doctorate, with the graduate population composing approximately one third of the total music unit population. The most populous degree program within the music unit was the undergraduate music education degree, which included a general music education track, a choral music education track, and an instrumental music education track.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022429412454662">
<title>Data Collection and Triangulation</title>
<p>Reliability in qualitative inquiry is strengthened via triangulation of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412454662">Merriam, 1998</xref>). The four data collection methods used in this study to achieve triangulation were semistructured interviews, research journal notes, student questionnaires, and collaborative meetings between myself and other expert researchers knowledgeable in the area of music education and research.</p>
<p>Using a combination of the guidelines described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412454662">Seidman (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429412454662">Rubin and Rubin (1995)</xref>, I developed a semistructured interview protocol with the intention of directing interview participants through discussion of their experiences in music and music education. Following the construction of the interview protocol, I isolated seven areas of inquiry to adequately assess the research questions. These areas were (a) precollege music experiences, (b) precollege educational or teaching experiences, (c) student transition from high school to college, (d) college music experiences, (e) experiences in music education courses, (f) transition away from music education major, and (g) academic path after departure from music education major. I conducted every interview in person and recorded each one with an Edirol R-09 digital recorder. Individual interview lengths ranged between 24 min and 96 min, with an average length of 56 min. Each interview was transcribed verbatim for the purpose of analysis.</p>
<p>All interviews were conducted across a period of 9 weeks. Throughout the interview stage, I maintained a detailed research journal. This journal included observations of students before, during, and after the interview; notes from meetings with an expert researcher familiar with the project; and personal reflections on potential trends emerging throughout the process. As the research progressed, my journal served as a reference point for expansion of the original semistructured interview guidelines, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412454662">Merriam (1998)</xref>. A total of 21 single-spaced pages of journal data were collected.</p>
<p>After all interviews were completed, each participant responded to a follow-up questionnaire. The questionnaire included multiple open-ended questions regarding the seven areas of inquiry isolated above. An identical form was e-mailed to each student, with no alterations made on the basis of interview results. This particular method of inquiry was unique in its ability to allow participants the opportunity to share potentially embarrassing details of their educational journey outside the personal confines of the interview room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429412454662">Morse &amp; Field, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022429412454662">
<title>Data Coding</title>
<p>All interviews, journal notes, and questionnaires produced a total of 179 single-spaced pages of written material. I coded the written data to identify influential variables. Two music education experts familiar with the project served as peer reviewers, with each expert receiving coded data for examination. During this process, each expert was asked to provide feedback supporting or refuting the codification of the data. All conflicts or uncertainties in the data were resolved through reexamination and discussion of the transcribed data.</p>

<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>In an effort to streamline the reporting of data collected from the seven areas of inquiry, the findings for this study were organized into four sections: (a) commonalities among interviewed students’ precollege experiences in music and teaching, (b) commonalities among interviewed students’ transitions from high school to college, (c) student experiences within the music education major and factors influencing student withdrawal, and (d) academic path following withdrawal from music education. Discussion of the findings is included within each section. To protect student privacy, all names used in this section are pseudonyms.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022429412454662">
<title>Commonalities Among Precollege Experiences With Music and Teaching</title>
<p>The ages at which the students began studying music ranged from 3 years old to the junior year of high school, with the most frequently cited starting point being sixth grade. The school music teacher surfaced as being an incredibly important figure in the students’ lives. Daniel spoke very openly about how much he hoped “to emulate his high school band director in every way.” Michael, who withdrew from the music education program after his freshman year, recalled, “My father (a band director) was my biggest influence in music, hands-down, my whole life.”</p>
<p>Participants responded in similar ways when discussing positive precollege music experiences. All 14 students discussed the performance of music as being an enjoyable component in their precollege musical lives. Each student noted the enjoyment of ensemble performances, and some discussed enjoyable experiences in solo and private-lesson settings. An area that also resulted in similar responses from the entire participant group was the discussion of opportunities to lead or teach others before entering college. All 14 participants taught in some capacity prior to college, with teaching roles including school music ensemble leaders, tutoring children in their community, serving as a teaching assistant for nonmusic courses, and teaching at church. Eighty-six percent of the participants held teaching roles within their school music program. Michael spoke of these experiences fondly:<disp-quote>
<p>I was the only freshman officer that they had, in a long time, I guess. So, I just kind of took on that role, so it got to the point where there were a couple of seniors that could keep everything going, and then I would make sure that the instruments got checked back in storage or keep track of the library music and stuff like that. And that just kind of grew throughout my time there, and eventually throughout my junior and senior year when I was drum major and ended up taking over one of the side offices and I would run instrument repair and I would control the inventory and make sure all the library music was put in place, I’d do some of the scheduling and stuff like that just to make sure everything was in place, and I really like having that leadership role.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In reflecting on these teaching experiences, the majority of interviewed students claimed to have identified themselves as teachers prior to coming to college.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022429412454662">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The analysis of withdrawn students’ experiences in music and education prior to college indicated that few differences existed between the students examined and populations examined in research focused on the persistence of music education majors, regardless of whether they remained in their programs. The importance of the school music teacher on the choice to pursue music education has been found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412454662">Bergee, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412454662">Bergee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412454662">Kelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412454662">Madsen &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022429412454662">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>). Similarities also exist between the persisting student populations examined in these prior studies and the withdrawn students in this investigation relating to time involved in music, enjoyment of ensemble participation, and the age at which participants decided to major in music education.</p>
<p>The positive impact of precollege teaching experiences has been found in studies examining characteristics of current and prospective music education majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412454662">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022429412454662">Thornton &amp; Bergee, 2008</xref>). The finding that all of the students in this examination had participated in positive teaching experiences while still in high school, with most claiming to have identified themselves as teachers, is especially noteworthy when viewed through the lens of these prior investigations of student identity. These findings may be frustrating to those individuals charged with recruiting and training students, as some traits thought to be consistent among persisting music education students also may be consistent among withdrawn students. Further research examining precollege traits among a larger population of withdrawn students is needed to better understand this issue.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022429412454662">
<title>Commonalities Among Transitions From High School to College</title>
<p>There were discrepancies among the students regarding when they decided to become music education majors as well as when and how the decision of where to attend college was made. Daniel decided to major in music education “during eighth or ninth grade” and applied only to the subject university, recalling, “My band directors graduated from here, and . . . I figured the best way to emulate them was to go through what they went through.” In contrast, Ava considered a variety of majors, including music performance, business, and acting, and also applied to many different institutions, stating that she ultimately chose the subject university because of “what you can take away with a degree from here.”</p>
<p>A notable consistency surfaced when the students discussed the social adjustments made during the transition from high school to college. When asked to reflect on their first semester of college, almost all recalled having an easy time adjusting to the college environment, with most citing their participation in college music ensembles as an important component of their positive socialization during this time period. Michael spoke very candidly on this subject:<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that was really important for me was when we started marching band. From that point forward, I had at least 60 people right out of the gate, seeing every day for 2 weeks, and I really don’t know what I would have done without that. I would have started going to classes knowing nobody.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Madison reflected similarly on her experience joining an a cappella group during her first semester:<disp-quote>
<p>I auditioned for (College A Cappella Group) and there were four slots, two for girls . . . and I just got in. And it was really cool; it made me feel like I had a family from the first, from when I got in. It was really awesome.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Examples of positive, musically driven social experiences during the first semester of college surfaced throughout the students’ interviews and questionnaires.</p>
<sec id="section10-0022429412454662">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The finding that many students reported their transition into college as having been easy is of interest when viewed through the lens of the theoretical models of persistence provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022429412454662">Tinto (1975)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412454662">Astin (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412454662">1975</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412454662">Bean (1980)</xref>. In each of these models, the ability of the individual to integrate into his or her college environment was a key factor in college persistence. The fact that students recalled this process as having been easy, as well as the additional finding that involvement in the music education program promoted the integration of the students into their college environment, raises questions as to the effect of social integration on the persistence of undergraduate music education majors. Does the social integration encountered in music ensembles function differently than other kinds of social integration? Are students majoring in music education affected by this kind of integration differently than their peers outside of the field? Does the social integration function as more of an academic integration? Further research is necessary to determine the effects of the variable of social integration on persistence among music education majors. If the variable of social integration were found to be a nonfactor, the music education major likely would not fit into standard models of student persistence.</p>

<title>Student Experiences Within the Music Education Major and Factors Influencing Withdrawal</title>
<p>Negative applied music experiences permeated the stories of more than half of the students. In examining the negative applied music experiences discussed, an overview of the individuals responsible for teaching those lessons was important. In all, 13 of the 14 participants spent all or most of their time studying applied music with graduate assistants. Among these 13 students, 10 individual graduate assistants were discussed. These applied music graduate assistants were cited more often than any other individual as having a negative impact on the students’ experiences in college music. In descriptions of their individual applied music graduate assistants, Emma said, “He wasn’t very helpful”; Daniel said, “She yelled at me”; and Tony felt that “she wasn’t trying to improve stuff that needed to be improved.” Conversely, the primary applied professor was cited more than any other individual as having a positive impact on the students’ experiences in college music. Even with 13 of the 14 students engaging the primary applied professor only in studio classes and informal settings, reflections of these individuals were glowing. In speaking of these professors, Emma recalled, “He saw I had passion for it”; Daniel said, “He took me on in a personal level and he was motivating me”; and Tony stated, “He is amazing, nobody can compare to him.”</p>
<p>Negative experiences in both applied and ensemble settings led to a decrease in self-confidence for the students. Emma’s experience provides a powerful example of this shift:<disp-quote>
<p>In high school band I was band captain and section leader, so I led all the sectionals for everything, I taught them all about marching in marching band, and band captain, I led the band in warm-ups and stuff like that. And I led all of the leadership meetings we had and organized everything in that. I was also a teacher assistant in high school for 2 years. Then in college, I was the worst (primary instrument) player in studio for so long. I don’t think that it was so much that I was the bottom fish or that I wasn’t being recognized like I was; it was the fact that I worked so hard and I did practice for hours every day and it didn’t get me anywhere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was the combination of negative lesson experiences and decreased self-confidence that eventually led to Emma’s withdrawal from the music education program. Similarly, Michael experienced debilitating performance anxiety during lessons and studio performances, and Joshua realized he “would be unable to commit to the amount of practice time expected in his studio.” Alex had extremely negative experiences with his applied graduate assistant while also hearing stories that led him to believe his studio environment was “inconsistent in terms of evaluation and enforcement of standards.”</p>
<p>It is clear that in this group of students, the applied music component of the music education curriculum played a critical role in student withdrawal; however, some students simply discovered that music education was not for them. Jacob came to the realization that he simply “did not want to be a band director,” Chris discovered that being a choir director was “not something that I really wanted to do,” and Isabella did not like “the way education is set up here in America.” All three of these students changed their major to another area of music, highlighting the fact that the educational component of the degree or career path was the variable most influential in the decision.</p>
<p>Personal life difficulties contributed to two students’ withdrawal from the music education program. Will experienced the death of a girlfriend during the same time period that both of his parents, previously divorced, filed for bankruptcy. He recalled that his life “spun out of control” during this time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412454662">Li and Killian (1999)</xref> interviewed 622 students and found that 34% cited “personal reasons” as the primary factor behind withdrawal from college. Will, who did withdraw from the subject university completely, is representative of this variable of student persistence, lending support to previous research on the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412454662">Astin, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412454662">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412454662">Elliot, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412454662">Tinto, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Ava also experienced a series of personal tragedies that led to her withdrawal from the music education program. After losing three close family members, she withdrew from the majority of her classes during the spring semester of her junior year. Ava did not leave the subject university, returning in the fall semester to continue her studies. Unfortunately for Ava, the sequential nature of the courses required to complete the undergraduate music education degree required her to complete the courses she had dropped the previous spring before continuing in the program. As a result of this sequence, Ava would have added at least 1 more year to her college education. She found this option to be unacceptable, stating, “My mind wasn’t wrapped around staying here for another three years.” Ultimately, she decided to get a bachelor of arts in music with the possibility of entering the teaching profession through a state-recognized alternative teacher certification program.</p>
<sec id="section12-0022429412454662">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Among the areas discussed within the music education major, the subject of applied lessons may be the most compelling. At the subject university, the majority of music education majors began their applied study with a graduate assistant. The majority of the participants in this investigation found these experiences to be quite negative, with only a few reflecting positively on the experience. These findings support the need for a more detailed understanding of the experiences students encounter in this setting. Do students studying with graduate assistants feel they are less valuable? Are there any similarities or patterns among students of particular instrument or voice types concerning experiences in applied music? Do students’ negative experiences surface as a result of poor preparation and/or an inflated level of confidence prior to entering college? Is the impact of applied music on student withdrawal limited to a particular type of institution and/or a particular type of student? Research focusing on these issues would be beneficial to students, instructors, and administrators within the music education community.</p>
<p>A separate issue raised in this study relates to the existence of alternative certification in music education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412454662">Asmus (2003)</xref> described the advantages and disadvantages of alternative certification in music education, citing the circumvention of issues relating to curricula as a primary advantage of this option. Ava, who lost three close family members in a short time span during her junior year, may be an example of this particular advantage of alternative certification in a real-world setting. Conversely, Emily’s desire to pursue alternative certification following her involuntary withdrawal resulting from a failed applied music jury may be representative of a case in which the alternative certification option could be detrimental to the field of music education. These two very different cases highlight the need for more discussion on the potential pros and cons of alternative certification in music education.</p>

<title>Academic Path Following Withdrawal From Music Education</title>
<p>The paths students took after exiting the music education curriculum were varied. The degree programs students chose to transfer into included music, music performance, music therapy, engineering, business, criminology, anthropology, classical archaeology, and humanities. Intrapersonal experiences after departing the music education curriculum also were varied. Nine students experienced relief, whereas five did not. Eight students regretted the decision at a later point, and six did not. Eight participants expressed having considered returning to the music education program at some point, whereas six did not. The wide range of intrapersonal reactions may be representative of the wide range of reasons and rationales cited for withdrawing from the music education program.</p>
<p>At the time of this study, participants had been withdrawn from the music education program for a minimum of one semester and a maximum of 2 years. One commonality shared by all participants following withdrawal from the music education program was a continued involvement in music. All 14 students reported being actively involved in music making at the time of the study. In discussing this, Jacob exclaimed, “My music is never going to leave!” Tony said, “It is still a big part of my life.” Will stated, “I am still doing a little bit of composing.” Most participants expressed plans to continue making music for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<sec id="section14-0022429412454662">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The finding that participants moved to a variety of disciplines indicates a wide variety of interests among the withdrawn participants. Continued research examining students’ experiences following withdrawal from the music education degree could be beneficial in a number of ways. Do students who transfer from music education to another major within the music unit complete degrees at a different rate than students who begin in those majors? Do students who transfer to nonmusic-related majors experience success in those majors? Are the positive experiences students have within musical settings maintained after withdrawal?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Individuals responsible for the preparation of future music educators often find themselves counseling students who are withdrawing from the music education degree track. These students come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, with the emotions involved in the withdrawal process ranging from bitter to angry to enthusiastic. This qualitative exploration provides more questions than answers, which I hope will encourage both discussion and further examination of the topic. Every individual involved in music teacher preparation is affected by the withdrawal of students from their degree plan, and it may be in these withdrawn students’ stories and experiences that one finds positive alterations to educational processes. Reflection about these students’ stories and experiences also may lead to discussions of the idea that not all attrition is negative and not all persistence is positive.</p>
