<p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> The study aims to establish institutional antifungal prophylactic regimen in liver transplant recipients by classifying independent risk factors of post-transplant fungal infections and identifying the optimal antifungal therapy. <bold>Methods</bold>: This is an IRB-approved retrospective single center study, examining liver transplant patients from December 2008 to June 2012 at the Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. Baseline patient characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, underlying diseases, and types of liver donor will be assessed using the Student’s t-test. Precipitating factors of post-liver transplant fungal infections will be evaluated by collecting donor and recipient’s CMV status, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, history of fungal infections, re-transplantation, post-transplant dialysis, breakthrough fungal infections post-operatively, other bacterial co-infections, concomitant antibiotics, level of immunosuppression, fungal infection mortality rate, etc. In addition, the study will evaluate antifungal prophylaxis regimen to establish an optimized institutional antifungal prophylaxis guideline pertaining to the liver transplantation population. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 19.0) statistical program. Linear regression with multivariate analysis will be used to assess the independent risk factors of post liver transplant fungal infections. A two-tailed p-value of smaller than 0.05 is considered to be significant. <bold>Results</bold>: This study showed that no fungal infection in the prophylactic group vs. one invasive aspergillus infection in the non-prophylactic group. Risk factors which warranted antifungal prophylaxis included elevation of the MELD score and pre-transplant serum creatinine, greater volume of intraoperative blood transfusion, requirement for pre- and post-transplant dialysis, as well as return-to-OR. In addition, primarily in the author’s institution, both fluconazole 200 mg once daily or micafungin 100 mg daily for an average of 5 days were employed to prevent post-liver transplant fungal infections. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Based on this institutional study, antifungal prophylaxis was used routinely in patients with multiple risk factors, which is consistent with the recommendations in the literature. Future endeavors may include multicenter prospective enrollment with a larger patient population or multi-center participation. In the interim, liver transplant recipients with risk factors such as hemodialysis requirement, intraoperative blood transfusion, high MELD score, high pre-operative serum creatinine, and requirement to return to OR may benefit from antifungal prophylaxis with either fluconazole 200 mg daily or micafungin 100 mg daily for an average period of 5 days to prevent post-liver transplant fungal infections.</p>

<p>
<bold>Background:</bold> Empiric dosing of Daptomycin (DAP) to achieve a Cumulative Fraction of Response (CFR) of &gt; 90% based on the MIC distribution of US MRSA isolates at various levels of renal function has not been examined. Consequently, the optimal empiric dosing regimen for DAP in serious infections remains unclear. <bold>Methods:</bold> Previously published pharmacokinetic data (AAC, 2004 Aug., n = 282) and MIC data of 4513 MRSA isolates for DAP (IDSA 2010, Poster #246) were used in this analysis. Doses up to 12 mg/kg were evaluated for Probability of Target Attainment (PTA) with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS, n = 5000) for different levels of renal function at the MIC ranges of 0.125 to 2 mg/L. CFR was calculated for each regimen targeting an AUC/MIC necessary to achieve a killing of 2 log<sub>10</sub> CFU. The minimum amount of drug and the respective dosing interval necessary to produce a CFR &gt; 90% was then evaluated for safety using MCS and a two compartment model with constant intravenous input and first order output. <bold>Results:</bold> DAP regimens expected to achieve the CFR &gt; 90% at the renal function of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 ml/min are 10mg/kg q48h, 5mg/kg q24h, 6mg/kg q24h, 7mg/kg q24h, 8mg/kg q24h and 9mg/kg q24h, respectively. The MCS also showed that - based on the CFRs achieved by the manufacturer recommended dose and dosing intervals - it is likely that empiric dosing will result in sub-optimal PTAs for patients with creatinine clearance outside of the range of 30 – 60 ml/min. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> We conclude that for the treatment of serious MRSA infections to achieve the killing of 2 log<sub>10</sub> CFU, the revised dosing method would provide better empiric population PTA compared to manufacturer recommendations.</p>

<title>Nyack Hospital, Nyack, NY 10960, USA</title>
<p>
<bold>Background:</bold> Dosing Daptomycin (DAP) based on total body weight is expected to result in higher drug exposure in the obese patient compared to patients with normal body weight. Prior analysis using population pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) suggested the use of lean body weight for dosing of DAP in the obese, but provided no analysis for the population of morbidly obese. The objective of our study was to assess for the basis of using alternative body weight estimations for dosing of DAP in the morbidly obese. <bold>Methods:</bold> Published DAP pharmacokinetic data of matched morbidly obese patients with subjects of normal body weight (NBW) was used in this analysis. Dosing of DAP based on total (TBW), ideal (IBW), adjusted (ABW), lean (LBW), and fat free (FFW) weight of 4 and 6 mg/kg doses were evaluated with MCS (n = 10000) to assess for the magnitude of drug exposure. The dosing methods that resulted in the magnitude and dispersion of area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-Inf</sub>) most similar to that of the matched normal body weight patients was then compared with the exposure achieved by the patients in the trial of bacteremia and endocarditis (B-IE). <bold>Results:</bold> Dosing based on ABW best approximates the exposure at the dose of 4 mg/kg in the morbidly obese when compared to the matched subjects. Simulated median AUC<sub>0-Inf</sub> values of dosing DAP based on IBW, LBW, and FFW were 16.1, 18.6, and 10% smaller, respectively, in the morbidly obese compared to the patients with normal body weight. Simulated exposure provided by DAP 6 mg/kg based on ABW with correction factors of 0.4 in the morbidly obese provide slightly more robust median <underline>+</underline> SD AUC<sub>0-Inf</sub> of 595.69 <underline>+</underline> 167.62 mg.h/L when compared to the population of the B-IE clinical trial. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> We conclude that dosing of DAP based on IBW, LBW, and FFW would result in sub-optimal exposure based on the simulated AUC<sub>0-Inf</sub> values in the morbidly obese. Since the pharmacodynamic index most likely predictive of outcomes is the ratio of AUC/MIC, dosing of DAP based on IBW, LBW or FFW should be avoided in this population. Instead, dosing based on ABW can be considered in the morbidly obese.</p>

<bold>Purpose: </bold>Electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) has the potential to reduce medication errors and improve efficiency compared to traditional handwritten prescribing, but may introduce new opportunities for errors. Available literature shows that prescription errors can originate by both the prescriber and the computer systems. Most studies assess electronic prescribing errors identified when orders are received by pharmacy. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify common errors of electronic prescribing sent through an electronic medical record system by prescribers. <bold>Methods: </bold>This is a retrospective chart review of e-prescriptions using an outpatient EMR. Beginning November 20, 2012, each patient visit conducted by the four outpatient primary care providers (PCP) will be sequentially reviewed to identify unique electronic prescriptions (e-prescriptions) that meet enrollment criteria. Unique e-prescriptions are defined as any new or revised prescription sent electronically to a pharmacy. The target will be 50 e-prescriptions per PCP. If there are less than 50 prescriptions sent on November 20, 2012 from one prescriber, patient visits from the day before will be reviewed for e-prescriptions, and so on, until the target of 50 unique e-prescriptions is reached for each PCP. This process will be repeated for the other three prescribers. The data collected for each e-prescription will be name of medication, dosage form, dose, directions, and quantity. Each component of the e-prescription will be examined for accuracy and consistency. <bold>Results: </bold>Pending. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pending.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose</bold>: Current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but are not specific about which anticoagulant or dosing regimen to use. At Montefiore Medical Center, three times daily unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5,000 units subcutaneously is frequently being used over a previous twice daily regimen. The objective of this study is to determine if the more aggressive three times daily dosing regimen is associated with a decreased incidence of symptomatic VTE (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis) without a concomitant increase in bleeding complications. <bold>Methods</bold>: This study is a retrospective chart review that has been approved by the Montefiore Institutional Review Board. Patients who were 18 years of age and underwent CABG surgery between 2006 to 2011 at Montefiore Medical Center will be identified through the institution’s electronic medical record system. Excluded from the review are patients who have a documented allergy to heparin, were not candidates for pharmacological VTE prophylaxis due to high risk of bleed, underwent cardiac valve repair or received an organ transplant, surgically implanted assist devices or full anticoagulation post-operatively for atrial fibrillation. Data to be collected will include the thromboprophylactic regimen received, symptomatic VTE events that occurred during the inpatient stay or within a 30-day readmission, and bleeding. Throughout the study, a multitude of measures will be taken to protect and ensure patient privacy. After receipt of the initial study population, on which patients will only be identified through medical record number, a subsequent data set will be produced that assigns each patient a new unique identifier. All data will be kept on a password-locked computer in a secure location within Montefiore hospital.</p>

<p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> Various classes of drugs, including antibiotics, have been shown to interact with warfarin to cause an increase in the international normalized ratio (INR). The clinical relevance of warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults is not well studied. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of select antibiotics on the INR in elderly patients on stable warfarin therapy. The primary objective was to calculate the percent change of INR due to the warfarin-antibiotic interaction and the secondary objectives were to determine the occurrence of supratherapeutic INRs &gt; 3.5 and bleeding events. <bold>Methods</bold>: This was a retrospective, single center, chart review study in acute and long-term care patients conducted at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC). Data were collected from January 2010 through November 2012. Included were adults 65 years and older on uninterrupted warfarin therapy with a stable, non-supratherapeutic pre-antibiotic INR. The patient must have been started on one or more of the following antimicrobial agents: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and fluconazole and a post-antibiotic INR was required to be obtained within a week of initiation of antibiotics. Exclusion criteria were recent start of warfarin, change in warfarin dose after the pre-antibiotic recorded INR, and interrupted warfarin therapy in the prior 5 days before antibiotic initiation. Patient demographics and laboratory information including hospital admission diagnosis, comorbidities, coagulation markers, and concurrent medications were obtained from computerized medical records and the pharmacy application (Siemens®), and bleeding events were reviewed through the KJMC Adverse Drug Event database. <bold>Results</bold>: The percent change of INR due to the warfarin-antibiotic interaction as well as occurrence of supratherapeutic INRs &gt; 3.5 and bleeding events will be presented. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: It is anticipated that this project will clarify the magnitude of INR increase from the warfarin-antibiotic interaction. This will provide practitioners additional data to determine whether pre-emptive warfarin dose adjustments are necessary when initiating a specific antibiotic.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose:</bold> Heart failure (HF) is a common diagnosis among Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) patients and is associated with a 30-day KJMC readmission rate of 28.3%. Heart failure is one of the core measures by The Joint Commission (TJC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) and it is required for accreditation and reimbursement. Readmission may result in increased morbidity for patients and reduced Medicare reimbursement. Discharge instructions and reinforcement of HF-related education can improve patients’ understanding of their disease and health-related outcomes. This study will assess whether the addition of pharmacist-based discharge counseling may reduce heart failure and overall readmission rates. <bold>Methods</bold>: In a prospective, single-centered, cohort study of HF patients in the acute setting identified through review of active diagnoses of patients admitted from home, included subjects will be educated by designated pharmacists utilizing standardized handouts regarding medication management, dietary sodium, the importance of physical activity, and when to contact their HF provider based on symptomatology. Patients will be excluded if they have cognitive impairment, are non-English speaking, are not discharged to home, are readmitted for elective procedures, or refuse to participate in the study. Subjects will be contacted within 7 days of discharge to identify any complications. Readmission at 30-days post-initial discharge will be assessed through review of KJMC records and investigator-completed phone calls to assess admission to another institution. The 30-day overall and HF-related readmission rates will be compared to the baseline rates prior to initiation of the study using the Student t-test. Institutional review board approval was received, and informed consent was not required. <bold>Results</bold>: The difference in overall and HF-related readmission rates with and without pharmacist-provided education will be calculated and presented. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: It is anticipated that this project will clarify whether pharmacist-provided education positively impacts overall and HF-related readmission rates.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose</bold>: Acute liver failure (ALF) secondary to acute liver injury (ALI) is associated with high mortality rate and frequent need for transplantation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen (APAP) when given within 24 hours. In non-APAP ALI, NAC may improve hemodynamics, tissue oxygen delivery, and modify disease progression. We sought to evaluate a clinical protocol of NAC administration and its therapeutic benefits in ALI. Clinical outcomes of these patients with APAP induced ALI compared to patients with non-APAP induced ALI will be evaluated. <bold>Methods</bold>: Medical records of adult patients who received continuous NAC infusion between August 1, 2010 and July 31, 2012 for ALI were retrospectively reviewed for baseline demographic characteristics including etiology of ALI, MELD scores on days 1 and 7, duration of therapy, total dose administered, and concomitant medications. Clinical outcomes after 7 days of therapy including changes in liver function tests, INR, serum creatinine, survival at discharge and 30-days, and transplant-free survival were collected. Cost utilization analysis of treatment with NAC was determined based on patients’ length of hospital stay and drug acquisition cost. Due to the retrospective nature and design of the study, institutional review board and informed consent was not necessary to obtain. <bold>Summary of Results</bold>: 46 patients in the APAP and 100 in the non-APAP groups received continuous IV NAC infusion for ALI for a mean duration of 25.9 and 29.9 hours, respectively with 48 (32.9%) of patients receiving &gt;24 hours of therapy and 9 (6.2%) receiving &gt;72 hours. Patients with ALI secondary to non-APAP etiologies were older, had more renal impairment, higher MELD scores, and longer LOS. IV NAC was well tolerated with no interruption of therapy due to adverse events and APAP and non-APAP ALI proved comparable in regards to reduction in AST and ALT. there was no difference in INR, serum creatinine, and MELD score observed in both groups. Survival was 97.8% and 82.0% at discharge, 96.2% and 70.0% at 7 days, and 92.9% and 65.4% at 30 days in the APAP and non-APAP groups, respectively with transplant-free survival valuing at 97.8% and 77.0% in the APAP and non-APAP groups, respectively. Only 1 in the APAP and 23 in the non-APAP groups required liver transplants. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: IV NAC is indicated to prevent APAP-induced ALI with some data supporting its use in non-APAP etiologies. Although similar trends in measurable clinical values were seen with the use of IV NAC in both groups of our study, the lack of rigorous clinical methodology prevents us from drawing substantial conclusions. Further research must be done to describe the role of IV NAC in non-APAP ALI.</p>

<p>Pharmacologic management of pediatric thromboembolic disease represents a significant challenge in infants and children. The dynamic hemostatic system of the pediatric population renders interactions with antithrombotic agents that differ from adults. Current anticoagulation practice guidelines set forth by the American College of Chest Physicians are based on limited pediatric data and extrapolations from adult dosing recommendations. The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore (CHAM) is a 130 bed hospital serving children and adolescents. The lack of institution-specific guidelines for the use of these high-risk agents at CHAM necessitates the assessment of current medication use practices. The goal of this medication-use evaluation is to determine how well the prescribing and monitoring of enoxaparin and warfarin in pediatric patients at CHAM adheres to current practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. A retrospective chart review will be conducted to gather data on patients treated with enoxaparin and/or warfarin and monitored for anti-factor Xa levels and/or international normalized ratio (INR). Patient charts from a six month period will be reviewed. Data to be collected include demographics (i.e. weight, height, age, and gender), pertinent medical history, indication for enoxaparin and/or warfarin, dosing regimen (including dose and frequency), anticoagulation and other pertinent laboratory values, and patient counseling documentation. Patients 18 years of age and older will be excluded from the study. Patients prescribed enoxaparin with eGFR less than 30 mL/min will be evaluated separately. The results of this evaluation may elucidate potential medication safety process improvement strategies, including ways to improve overall prescribing and monitoring practices. Potential areas to increase pharmacist involvement include optimizing initial dosing regimens and dosing adjustments as recommended by the practice guidelines, providing education to medical practitioners and nursing staff, and providing patient counseling. This study has been approved by the Montefiore Institutional Review Board. There are no physical, psychological, or social risks anticipated with this research. Only investigators involved in this review will have privileges to review data collected, and it will be stored without patient identifiers for the purpose of confidentiality.</p>

<p>
<bold>Objectives</bold>: Selection of an appropriate antimicrobial dosing regimen based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles can lead to improved clinical outcomes. In light of the increasing antimicrobial resistance in North America, pharmacodynamic analysis were undertaken to establish optimal empiric coverage for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> isolates collected in hospitals from geographically distinct locations in the greater New York City area. <bold>Methods</bold>: We used population pharmacokinetic models of anti – pseudomonal agents to establish Probabilities of Target Attainment in this analysis. 5000 subject Monte Carlo simulations were performed for the mean <underline>+</underline> SD creatinine clearance values of 60 + 30 ml/min and the MIC range of 0.25 to 128 µg/ml at double dilution intervals. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) for non-duplicate <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> isolates (n = 1104) collected from four hospitals in the greater New York City area were determined by Vitek 2 automated system. Bactericidal cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for standard doses of cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin and tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tobramicin, gentamycin and amikacin were calculated. Alternative approach - or extended infusion and high-dose - regimens were also modeled to improve CFRs of select agents. <bold>Results</bold>: The total of 29 antibiotic dosing strategies were evaluated, and only 2 achieved a CFR &gt; 90%. CFRs for commonly used doses were: cefepime 2 g q12h, 80%; imipenem 0.5g q6h, 68%; meropenem 1 g q8h, 79%; piperacillin and tazobactam 4.5 g q6h, 62%; ciprofloxacin 0.4 g q12h, 45%; tobramycin 5 mg/kg, 74%; gentamicin 5 mg/kg, 44%; and amikacin 15 mg/kg, 71%. Prolonging the infusion time resulted in improved CFRs for all beta – lactam dosing regimens. Overall, the CFR &gt; 90% were achieved by the 4 h infusion of meropenem 2 g q8h, and by the 3 h infusion of cefepime 2 g q8h regimens. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Based on our analysis the use of conventional dosing regimens of all anti-pseudomonal agents studied appears to provide sub-optimal coverage for the treatment of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infections in many parts of the Greater New York City area. Selection of high dose meropenem or cefepime regimens using prolonged infusion strategies may be necessary to achieve desired clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose:</bold> Dabigatran etexilate was added to the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) formulary on September 26, 2011. Its initiation was limited to cardiology and neurology services and for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Prescribing was not restricted in patients for whom this was a home medication continued on admission. The primary objective of this study is to determine if prescribing of dabigatran in the subsequent year adhered to our hospital-specific formulary restrictions. Secondary objectives include assessing if dabigatran was dosed appropriately per patient-specific characteristics and evaluating safety experience. <bold>Methods</bold>: This is a retrospective, single-centered chart review study. All patients admitted to KJMC between September 26, 2011 and September 30, 2012 who received a dose of dabigatran and/or experienced an adverse drug event to dabigatran will be included in this study. A report of all electronic orders for dabigatran in the study period will be generated and screened for all patients administered ≥1 dose of dabigatran. Exclusion criteria include Rutland Nursing Home residents on dabigatran and any patient who was prescribed dabigatran but did not receive a dose. Indication for therapy, date of first dose, and number of days of therapy will be confirmed using the patient’s medical record, electrocardiogram records, and radiology reports. Admission and discharge medication reconciliation records will be used to determine if the patient was taking the medication prior to admission and if they were discharged on dabigatran therapy. Adverse drug events will be identified from official ADE reports, the medical record, and documentation in the internal electronic pharmacy system. The prescribing service will be identified by prescriber name, presence of cardiology or neurology consults within the chart, and/or progress notes within the patient chart. <bold>Results</bold>: Dabigatran orders for all patients who were administered ≥1 dose of dabigatran will be reviewed for adherence to formulary restrictions, appropriate dosing and safety. Results will be presented. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: It is anticipated that this study will determine if current formulary restrictions for dabigatran use at KJMC require modification to meet the needs of our patients and providers.</p>

<p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> Current dosing recommendations suggest that prescribers perform dose increases of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors every 2-6 weeks in order to avoid intolerable side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss) and alterations in cardiac function (e.g., PR and QTc prolongation, bradycardia). However, these side effects were observed in trials that used rapid and forced titration intervals, which may not be representative of patients treated within a “real-world setting.” Additionally, these recommendations lengthen the time to maximal effect of the drugs and have the potential to increase patient hospital length of stay. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in safety and/or tolerability events between patients undergoing rapid dose titration (&lt; 2 weeks) compared to traditional dose titration (2 - 6 weeks) of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in an inpatient setting. <bold>Methods</bold>: This is a retrospective review of patients presenting to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center or Rutland Nursing Home over the past 3 years who were initiated on an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (i.e., donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine). Using the time from drug initiation to dose increase, patients were placed in one of two groups: rapid dose titration (&lt; 2 weeks) and traditional dose titration (2 - 6 weeks). Addition of adjunctive medications, length of hospitalization, final dose requirements of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, documentation of gastrointestinal and/or cardiac side effects were also obtained from hospital databases. Patients who received acetylcholinesterase inhibitor dose adjustments within one week of study onset, were newly initiated within the last month on medications that may impact cardiac or gastrointestinal function, were seriously ill, or had documented gastrointestinal or cardiovascular adverse effects were excluded from the study. The rate of gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects will be compared between the two groups and evaluated using a Student’s t-test. <bold>Results</bold>: Pending. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Pending.</p>

<p>
<bold>Background</bold>: Telavancin (TLV) is a first in its class bactericidal lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with excellent susceptibility profile against <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic>. The aim of our study was to describe the Cumulative Fraction of Response (CFR) achieved by TLV package insert (PI) recommendations and alternative dosing regimens against a population of MRSA isolates in US Medical Centers. <bold>Methods</bold>: Pharmacokinetic data in patients with renal dysfunction (ECCMID 2004, Poster #1028, n = 29) and MIC data of 2500 MRSA isolates for TLV (AAC 2010, June) was used in this analysis. Probability of Target Attainment (PTA) at different levels of renal function was established with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS, n = 5000) for MIC ranges of 0.125 to 2 mg/L. Then, CFR was calculated targeting a <italic>f</italic>AUC/MIC ratio of at least 50 for PI recommendations. Additionally, lower doses of 5 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg were evaluated at 24 and 48 hours intervals to assess their population probability of target attainment for recently documented MRSA MIC distribution. <bold>Results</bold>: PI recommended TLV dosing regimens are expected to achieve the CFR of &gt; 95% at all renal function categories from 20 – 120 ml/min. The MCS also showed that CFRs similar to that achieved by PI recommendations can be reached when using lower daily doses of TLV: 7.5 mg/kg q48h for creatinine clearance of 20 – 40 ml/min, 5 mg/kg q24h for 41 – 80 ml/min, and 7.5 mg/kg q24h for 81 – 120 ml/min. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: We conclude that for the treatment of MRSA infections to achieve the bactericidal effect of 3 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in CFU, the approved dosing regimens provide excellent coverage. Moreover, current activity of TLV against MRSA in the US would allow the use of lower daily doses without compromising the chance of clinical success.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose</bold>: Vancomycin (VAN) remains a mainstay for the treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive organisms. The purpose of this study was to assess if pharmacist managed therapy can produce timely therapeutic levels at least as effectively as physician managed dosing of VAN. <bold>Methods</bold>: A total of 100 patients per group were evaluated for baseline characteristics. Demographic, laboratory and VAN monitoring data were collected. Percentage of patients with initial, second, and third levels within subtherapeutic (&lt;10 mg/L), therapeutic (10 to 20 mg/L) and supratherapeutic (&gt;20 mg/L) ranges were compared. Secondary end points included comparing initial mean ± SD VAN concentrations, levels between 8 and 22 mg/L, percentage of patients never reaching concentrations of ≥10 mg/L, and time to reach the therapeutic range. <bold>Results</bold>: There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups evaluated, except for baseline renal function. VAN levels within the therapeutic range for initial, second and third measurements were 77%, 71%, 74% for pharmacist managed therapy and 37%, 58%, 55% for the comparator. Initial mean ± SD VAN levels were 13.4 ± 3.6 mg/L and 8.8 ± 3.9 mg/L (p &lt;0.05), while levels between 8 and 22 mg/L were 88% and 63%, for the intervention and comparator groups, respectively. An additional 40% of patients never reached 10 mg/L in the physician group compared to the intervention group. Median ± SD number of days to reach therapeutic range was 1.9 ± 0.9 days for the intervention group versus 2.5 ± 2.7 days for the comparator group (p &lt;0.05). <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Pharmacist managed VAN therapy resulted in both a greater percentage of therapeutic levels and a shorter time to reach therapeutic range. Consequently, the pharmacist managed VAN therapy appears to be at least as or more effective in achieving pre-specified laboratory endpoints when compared to physician dosing of VAN at our institution.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of antipsychotic medications in dementia-related psychosis is labeled with a black boxed warning due to an increased risk of death. However, antipsychotics are still routinely used in the elderly for other appropriate psychiatric indications. There is a need to examine health data from this patient population to determine if any differences in safety exist between commonly used atypical antipsychotics. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of lurasidone in the elderly population at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center. <bold>Methods</bold>: This was a retrospective, single-centered, chart review. An electronically-generated report indicated patients that have had any order(s) placed for lurasidone from November 2011 to November 2012. Upon attainment of this report, each patient profile was evaluated for inclusion (65-85 years old, standing diagnosis of schizophrenia, any active order for lurasidone or risperidone during a KJMC admission) to this study, with a targeted sample size of 40 patients. Once the number of patients included in the lurasidone group was achieved, they were paralleled with patients that received risperidone. Patients were excluded if they were receiving concurrent treatment with any other maintenance antipsychotic agent(s), had history of liver disease/failure, history of cancer/malignancy, history of a diagnosis of dementia/Alzheimer’s disease, uncontrolled DM or HTN (uncontrolled despite taking at least 3 medications), or baseline EKG abnormalities. Each patient’s health-related information was extensively reviewed. Data collected include: CBC with differential, renal panel, lipid panel, liver panel, EKG, A1C, BP, HR, and the patient’s weight(s). By reviewing these parameters as well as completing a chart review, we aimed to objectively identify adverse drug events or drug reactions that could have compromised patient safety. These potential antipsychotic-related events or reactions included any cardiovascular events (QTc prolongation), death due to any cause, falls (orthostasis/hypotension), excess sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, and acute dystonic reactions), and any metabolic changes/abnormalities. We also checked to see if patients were started on medications (e.g. anticholinergics, statins, benzodiazepines, antihypertensives, antihyperglycemics) or had medication dosages changed to treat other side effects of antipsychotic medications. The rates of adverse drug events were then compared between the two groups in order to assess differences in safety and tolerability. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the Student’s t-test and chi-square test. <bold>Results</bold>: Pending. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Pending</p>

<p>
<bold>Objective</bold>: Although there are several studies regarding the use of polymyxin B for multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, there are only a few studies that have looked at the efficacy of polymyxin B in treating MDR urinary tract infections (MDRI-UTIs). The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of intravenous polymyxin B for treatment of MDR-UTIs. Additionally, since polymyxin B has a reported nephrotoxicity rate of as low as 25% to as high as 90%, we sought to determine safety of polymyxin B by assessing each patient using the RIFLE criteria (risk, injury, failure, loss and end-stage renal disease). <bold>Methods</bold>: A retrospective chart review of patients receiving polymyxin B for treatment of UTIs from November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2012 was performed. Data were collected from electronic medical records, pharmacy computerized systems, and a microbiology record system. Patients meeting the following inclusion criteria were assessed for both efficacy and nephrotoxicity of polymyxin B: urine cultures available both before and after treatment, presence of MDR organism(s) in urine culture, and treatment with polymyxin B for at least 72 hours. Efficacy was defined by microbiological cure and safety was defined by RIFLE criteria. Patients were excluded from the study analysis if they received polymyxin B before first urine culture was taken or urine culture showed an organism resistant to polymyxin B. Expedited institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained and informed consent was not required. <bold>Results</bold>: The percentage of patients with microbiological cure after treatment with polymyxin B will be reported. Additionally, we will also report the incidence of nephrotoxicity in patients treated with polymyxin B. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: It is expected that this study will further demonstrate effectiveness of polymyxin B for treatment of MDR-UTIs. This will provide additional data for practitioners considering use of polymyxin B in treatment of MDR-UTIs.</p>

<p>
<bold>Objective</bold>: Since the first reported cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the early 1980s and the limited choices of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, the understanding of this disease and tailoring of treatment has grown exponentially. As a result, HIV-positive patients are living longer and the increased incidence of comorbidities and their management demands attention. Several studies demonstrate collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) and pharmacist interventions have led to positive patient outcomes in clinics focusing on diabetes, hypertension and lipids. Although CDTM specifically has not been studied in HIV clinics, the effects of pharmacists’ intervention on patient outcomes in this area has shown to significantly improve CD4 lymphocyte counts, viral loads and drug-related toxicities. However, studies evaluating the role of an HIV pharmacist in managing ARV concurrently with chronic disease states as part of a primary care outpatient team are lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frequency and types of interventions made by a pharmacist as part of an interdisciplinary healthcare team in a hospital-affiliated outpatient HIV primary care clinic. <bold>Methods</bold>: This is a retrospective data analysis to analyze the types and frequency of clinical interventions made by a pharmacist as part of an interdisciplinary healthcare team in an urban, hospital-affiliated HIV primary care clinic. Adult patients <underline>&gt;</underline> 21 years of age, diagnosed with HIV, whose healthcare is provided by The Brooklyn Hospital Center’s Program for AIDS Treatment and Health (PATH) Center outpatient clinic are included in this study. In compliance with the New York State Board of Pharmacy outcome metrics for pharmacy managed CDTM programs, interventions regarding medication indication, effectiveness, safety, adherence and cost avoidance will be assessed. These outcomes will be quantified through retrospective review of medication management notes documented in a secure, online database called MedKeeper entered from January 2011 to December 2012. One pharmacist will review each medication management note and categorize the type of each intervention that occurred during the clinic visit. The number of interventions will be tallied without the use of patient identifiers. Data will be reported by month and analyzed using descriptive statistics. <bold>Results</bold>: To date, two years of the described CDTM pharmacist-led intervention data have been reviewed. Results will be presented at the conference pending further data analysis. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: It is anticipated that this project will demonstrate a role for an ambulatory care clinical pharmacist in outpatient HIV primary care clinics.</p>

<p>
<bold>Background</bold>: Clinical observation revealed inconsistent ED decision-to-needle tPa times due to differing processes including pharmacist mixing in the central pharmacy, ED RN mixing at the bedside, and holding the tPa vial for stroke neurologist to mix upon arrival at the bedside. <bold>Purpose</bold>: Implement a consistent process for tPa calculation and mixing. Reduce decision-to-needle times, increasing the opportunity for successful patient outcome. <bold>Method</bold>: Conduct retrospective chart review to establish baseline tPa decision-to-needle times in the ED. Review current process of calculating, mixing, and administering tPa. Identify areas for process streamlining and reducing potential for error by calculating and mixing tPa at the bedside. Established goal of zero minute decision-to-needle time. Clinical Pharmacist added to Code Stroke pager team in May 2010. Initial Clinical Pharmacist role consisted of dose calculation and verification with ED nurse at bedside. Expanded Clinical Pharmacist role to include mixing tPa at beside in conjunction with nurse, while maintaining compliance with <italic>USP 797 Guidelines</italic>*. Implement process of bedside conference between Clinical Pharmacist and ED RN to identify eligible candidates, allowing the Clinical Pharmacist to prepare tPa in preparation of anticipated administration.

<p>
<bold>Background</bold>: Hyponatremia is an established predictor of increased mortality in patients with heart failure and liver cirrhosis. Tolvaptan is an oral vasopressin antagonist indicated for managements of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Tolvaptan should be initiated and re-initiated in a hospitalized setting, according to manufacturer labeling. This review evaluates clinical and safety endpoints of tolvaptan pharmacotherapy since its addition to Montefiore Medical Center’s drug formulary. <bold>Methods</bold>: This review was a quality improvement project for the Pharmacy Department and exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. Medical records of hospitalized patients who received tolvaptan during their hospital admission between January 2010 and January 2013 were reviewed. Patient demographic information including age, gender, past medical history and admission diagnosis were collected. To evaluate tolvaptan’s clinical and safety outcomes, we collected information on baseline serum sodium, concomitant diuretic therapy, etiology of hyponatremia, fluid balance, tolvaptan dosage and duration of use, change in serum sodium from baseline, and any noted side effects of therapy. All data were recorded without patient identifiers and maintained confidentially. <bold>Results</bold>: A total of 29 patients with a mean age of 63 years received tolvaptan. All patients were hyponatremic during their hospital admissions with a majority (69%) of patients having a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Nine of the 29 patients had a primary diagnosis of cirrhosis. Baseline serum sodium was 121±4 mEq/L prior to initiation of tolvaptan therapy. Serum sodium from baseline to the end of tolvaptan therapy increased in 23 patients. Six patients had no change or a decrease in serum sodium after tolvaptan therapy. Among the 23 patients with an increase in serum sodium, a mean increase of 8 mEq/L (range = 1-16 mEq/L) was observed. Twenty-two patients achieved serum sodium of ≥130 mEq/L post tolvaptan therapy. No major side effects were observed during the course of tolvaptan treatment. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Tolvaptan appears to be safe and effective in increasing serum sodium in a majority of patients when limited to the treatment of hyponatremia in heart failure and liver cirrhosis. Further studies are needed to examine the cost-effectiveness of this agent in hospitalized patients.</p>

<p>
<bold>Purpose</bold>: Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in the United States. Approximately 500, 000 people die each year from smoking. Joint Commission developed the tobacco measure set which requires screening of patient’s smoking status, counseling and prescribing of tobacco cessation medications in hospital and at discharge, and follow up of patient’s smoking status within 30 days post discharge. A recent assessment by the Department of Health evaluating the tobacco cessation practices in our institution shows that we revealed a practice gap. To close this gap, we plan to implement a Pharmacist Led Tobacco Cessation Program. <bold>Methods</bold>: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Pharmacist Led Tobacco Cessation Program and improvement in compliance with the Joint Commission Tobacco Measure Set. The Pharmacist Led Tobacco Cessation Program will be piloted on 3 units at our institution, including the stroke, cardiology, and oncology units from July 2012 to June 2013. There are two phases of this study. The first phase includes education to the multidisciplinary team on tobacco cessation. The second phase of the study includes implementing the computerized clinical decision support tool which involves tobacco cessation order sets, documentation of tobacco cessation interventions and compliance with the Joint Commission Tobacco Measure set, letter to primary care physician, and enrollment of patients in the Quitline. <bold>Results</bold>: This study will address the second phase of the study of the Pharmacist Led Tobacco Cessation Program. The data for phase two of the study will be collected on the documentation of the clinical decision support tool to assess the hospital’s compliance to the Joint Commission Tobacco Measure set.</p>

<p>Opioid abuse and misuse has become an epidemic to the United States. The New York City Department of Health and American College of Emergency Physicians have released statement positions and recommendations for prescribing of opioid medications in the emergency department.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013486091">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190013486091">2</xref></sup> The goal of these recommendations is to reduce the misuse and over prescribing of opioid medications. The Emergency Department Clinical Pharmacist and Pharmacy Resident in coordination with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians have developed initiatives to ensure the Maimonides Medical Center Emergency Department is in compliance with the new recommendations. The specific areas of interest for this study include medication orders for chronic non-malignant pain patients, concurrent benzodiazepine use, and discharge prescriptions for opioid containing medications. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of opioid prescribing initiatives that are aimed to reduce opioid misuse and abuse. This study will be done by surveying and collecting information on patients with opioid orders for chronic non-malignant pain and patients who are discharged with opioid prescriptions both before and after the initiatives were implemented to calculate the frequency of opioid misuse. Information that will be collected includes de-identified patient information, opioid medication(s) ordered, concurrent and home medication(s), and basic laboratory information. Orders for chronic non-malignant pain will be considered inappropriate if non-opioid therapies have not been attempted prior to opioid prescribing unless contraindications to therapy are present. Discharge prescriptions will be considered inappropriate if a 6-day supply or greater is dispensed. The initiatives consist of prescriber education, modifications to the computer physician order entry system. An estimated 250 orders will be included in this analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used in this analysis.</p>

<p>Tobacco addiction is a chronic disease that requires multiple interventions and attempts for patients to quit. According to the Public Health Service’s Smoking Cessation Guidelines, tobacco use causes 435,000 deaths each year in the United States and is a preventable chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1a-0897190013486091">1</xref></sup> A recent assessment by the Department of Health evaluating the current tobacco cessation practices at our institution, a 700-bed tertiary care teaching hospital, revealed a gap in care. To close this practice gap, we plan to implement a two-phase pharmacist-led tobacco cessation program. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the pharmacist-led tobacco cessation program in improving compliance with the current Joint Commission Tobacco Use Standards. The first phase will involve the education of clinicians (i.e. medical residents and attending physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical pharmacists, and respiratory therapists) on the topics of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, Joint Commission tobacco performance measures, and methods of patient counseling to facilitate quitting attempts. The second phase of the implementation will involve a computerized intervention document and computerized physician order entry screens. The metrics collected regarding use of the intervention document and smoking cessation therapy prescription will be used to assess effectiveness in complying with the following Joint Commission standards: screening for tobacco use, recommendations to quit by a care provider, offering assistance with quitting using smoking cessation therapies, counseling on smoking cessation and pharmacotherapy, and arranging follow-up to assess smoking status 30-days after discharge. This project will address the first phase of the aforementioned tobacco cessation program. The primary study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist-led tobacco cessation education to train clinicians to effectively screen, counsel, and initiate evidence-based tobacco cessation therapy and meet the requirements of the Joint Commission Tobacco Measure Set. To achieve these outcomes, a clinical pharmacist will educate clinician groups and use a pre-test/post-test model to assess their baseline knowledge and knowledge after educational sessions. The projected number of clinicians to be educated is 140. The projected number of patients to be affected by this program through their care providers is 360. The mean pre-test score will be compared to the mean post-test score by independent sample t-test. A P-Value of &lt;0.05 will denote statistical significant difference between the groups. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the pre-test and post-test responses.</p>

<bold>Background</bold>: Despite efforts to improve VTE prophylaxis, appropriate pharmacological and mechanical VTE prophylaxis was underused on two medical units at a community hospital. <bold>Purpose</bold>: An inpatient VTE stewardship program was piloted for three months to improve appropriate VTE prophylaxis in medical patients on two medical units in a community hospital. The baseline rate of appropriate VTE prophylaxis on the two medical units was 64% and 80% respectively based on random chart audits. <bold>Methods</bold>: Using real time clinical surveillance software, patients were identified on the target units who were not receiving pharmacological prophylaxis for VTE. Once patients were identified the stewardship team of a clinical pharmacist and a physician would prospectively review the charts of the identified patients on two days of the week for approximately 1.5 hours. Direct intervention to providers with written feedback was left on the chart to suggest either pharmacological prophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis (if pharmacological prophylaxis was contraindicated). In addition, patients with whom mechanical prophylaxis was ordered were evaluated to determine if this was appropriate over pharmacological prophylaxis and if the mechanical prophylaxis was implemented and/or implemented correctly. <bold>Results</bold>: During the pilot period, the VTE stewardship team made 214 interventions. This included 24 interventions to suggest VTE prophylaxis with either pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis, 73 interventions to suggest pharmacological prophylaxis, 19 interventions to suggest mechanical prophylaxis, and 98 interventions made to alert nursing to implement mechanical prophylaxis. Of the 116 interventions to suggest either pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis that were available for analysis during the evaluation period (n=71) 70% of the recommendations were accepted, 27% of the recommendations were declined, and 3% of the recommendations were declined and justified. Following the pilot period, random chart audits were repeated and found appropriate VTE prophylaxis rates had improved to 96% and 92% respectively on the two medical units. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: The VTE stewardship pilot program improved outcomes for VTE prophylaxis on two medical units in a community hospital. The plan is to continue the service and possibly branch out to more medical units throughout the hospital.</p>

<bold>Objective</bold>: Expand pharmacy services to include direct patient care in a community hospital outpatient cancer care center infusion and clinic setting. <bold>Methodology</bold>: St. Peter’s Hospital Cancer Care Center provides care for Medical Oncology patients. The pharmacist attended Medical/Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology Chart Rounds to identify candidates for counseling service. Criteria for counseling service were: scheduled for a chemo teaching session, scheduled to receive first or second chemotherapy infusion, complex home medication list, high degree of anxiety, or recommended by nurse During the counseling session the pharmacist reviewed the chemotherapy course, side effects and management, home medications, and answered questions. The pharmacist provided highlighted handouts on chemotherapy and a home medication list. The pharmacist contacted the physician with any drug or disease related problems identified and documents the visit in progress note and adds a home medication list attached. Additionally, the pharmacist served as drug information resource for all staff. Success of the pilot program was assessed with ongoing feedback, patient satisfaction survey, and formal staff evaluation. <bold>Results</bold>: In the month of January 2013, 38 patients cases were reviewed and 23 patients were seen by the pharmacist. Thirty three counseling sessions were performed with eight patients receiving more than one session. Eleven problems requiring physician contact were identified. The average time spent on individual patient counseling was 30 minutes (range 10 minutes to 90 minutes). Six drug information questions were answered for nursing staff. Fifteen survey responses were received. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: This service facilitated the development of new pharmacist roles in this community outpatient oncology center as a patient educator, drug information resource, and process improvement team member. Counseling services included educating on the correct use of home medications, answering medication-related questions, and preparing patients for what to expect with their chemotherapy and how to manage side effects and toxicities. On the qualitative satisfaction survey given to 15 patients who received pharmacist counseling, 100% indicated they felt more comfortable with their treatment afterwards and would recommend the service to others. Drug-related problems identified included under/overdose of narcotics, drug toxicity/adverse effects, untreated indications, drug interactions, and drug diversion/abuse. Drug information questions were asked regarding drug compatibility, interactions, dosing, safety, efficacy, and adverse effects. The clinical pharmacist also became an integral member of process improvement initiatives, assuming roles in design and implementation of processes to track missed chemotherapy doses and carboplatin dose calculation standardization.</p>
