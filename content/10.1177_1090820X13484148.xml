<p>Many of you already know the story. In 1967, Drs Simon Fredericks and John Lewis sat in Harry’s Bar in Venice, Italy, scribbling on a napkin the names of plastic surgeons who they felt might be interested in forming a new society dedicated solely to aesthetic surgery education. What you may not remember is that the original name given to this new entity was the Society of Aesthetic Surgeons. (<italic>Aesthetic</italic> was felt to be more elegant than <italic>cosmetic</italic> and without the connotation of superficiality.) In 1969, at the group’s first Scientific Meeting—which was attended by some 100 members and guests—the name was changed to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). The reason on record for incorporating <italic>plastic surgery</italic> into the name was to identify that the members of this new society were board-certified plastic surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484148">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (ASPRS) changed its name, after long and heated debate among members, to the simplified American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). The early impetus for contemplating some type of name change was an ASPRS survey suggesting that Americans equated <italic>plastic surgeon</italic> with <italic>cosmetic surgeon</italic> and did not understand the role of reconstructive surgery in the specialty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484148">2</xref></sup> Some members argued that having both <italic>plastic</italic> and <italic>reconstructive</italic> in the society’s name gave the impression that reconstructive surgery was something different and apart from plastic surgery. Others, who believed the economic future of the specialty was dependent on cosmetic rather than reconstructive surgery, felt that the original name played into the hands of competitors who sought to characterize board-certified plastic surgeons as “generalists” rather than cosmetic surgery specialists. In a March 2000 <italic>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</italic> editorial, Dr Rod Rohrich hailed the name change as bringing ASPS “in line with the modern concept of who we are and what we do today as plastic surgeons.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484148">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we are painfully aware today, communicating with the public about our qualifications is not simply a matter of selecting the right name. The thought processes that compelled both of these societies to change their names may seem quite logical to us “insiders” but surely are lost on the average consumer bombarded by competing messages from a variety of self-proclaimed credible sources, each trumpeting its own official-sounding credentials. The article by Galanis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484148">4</xref></sup> (“Factors Influencing Patient Interest in Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the Process of Selecting a Surgeon”) in this issue of the Journal highlights the fact that, despite our best efforts, the public remains confused about the appropriate training and certification for physicians performing cosmetic surgery. It seems that we still have failed to deliver a clear message of who we, as plastic surgeons, are and what we do.</p>
<p>I commend the authors for undertaking their examination of such a complex subject. Indeed, it is difficult to probe too deeply when necessarily limited to a brief questionnaire and, as the authors acknowledge, many questions are open to further inquiry. For example, they note that “only 8 of the 96 respondents correctly pointed to the fact that any physician with a medical degree [is] legally qualified to perform cosmetic surgery.” However, it is the authors, in their Discussion, who bring up the issue of legality; there was no mention of it in the questionnaire, which simply asked, “Which of the following training paths can produce a cosmetic surgeon?” and proceeded to list 6 types of medical specialists as well as “dentist.” I can’t help but wonder what the response might have been if the question had been stated as “Which of the following training paths can produce a <italic>well-qualified</italic> cosmetic surgeon?” Perhaps the 34.4% of respondents who indicated that “surgeon” was the only training path that could produce a cosmetic surgeon were actually thinking about qualifications more than legality, although admittedly it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>The authors report that “board certification in plastic surgery” was indicated as the second most important factor (after “surgeon reputation”) in the selection of a surgeon to perform cosmetic surgery. That is encouraging, although the authors acknowledge that their survey did not attempt to investigate the public’s understanding of the <italic>meaning</italic> of board certification in plastic surgery. And, I believe, that is really the crux of our identity crisis. The authors state that their data suggest the public does not grasp the distinction between various certifications, nor whether a particular certification is approved or not. It would have been interesting to see how many respondents to the Galanis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484148">4</xref></sup> survey would have selected “board certification in <italic>cosmetic surgery</italic>” rather than “board certification in <italic>plastic surgery</italic>” as key to their surgeon selection, if they had been given that option.</p>
<p>A study published in 2011 by Gill et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484148">5</xref></sup> illustrated that the public still has little understanding of what plastic surgeons do and what their training encompasses. A study group consisting of 213 participants, systematically selected from the telephone White Pages, was asked to indicate their choice of surgeon in 3 different areas: breast reduction, excision of skin cancer from the facial region, and hand trauma. Only 19% of respondents chose “plastic surgeon” for all 3 types of procedures. “Dermatologist” was most often selected for excision of skin cancers, “breast surgeon” for breast reduction surgery, and “hand surgeon” for hand trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484148">5</xref></sup> The results of this study suggest that, with apparently limited information about what plastic surgery training entails, consumers do respond to titles and credentials that suggest specialization. This gives lesser-trained competitors a golden opportunity to make their case to the public.</p>
<p>Here is how the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery, which is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), defines the difference between cosmetic surgery and plastic surgery:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cosmetic surgery is a unique discipline of medicine focused on enhancing appearance through surgical and medical techniques. Cosmetic surgery can be performed on all areas of the head, neck and body. Because treated areas function properly but lack aesthetic appeal, cosmetic surgery is elective. Plastic surgery is defined as a surgical specialty dedicated to reconstruction of facial and body defects due to birth disorders, trauma, burns and disease. Plastic surgery is intended to correct dysfunctional areas of the body and is reconstructive in nature. . . . Cosmetic surgery and plastic surgery are not the same thing . . . doctors seeking to learn cosmetic surgery primarily obtain training and experience after completing their residency training. Knowing this fact is necessary to understanding the difference between ‘cosmetic surgery’ and ‘plastic surgery.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484148">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
 <p>I believe that most plastic surgeons, at this point, have come to peace with the idea that there are other specialists, certified by ABMS-recognized boards, who are highly qualified to perform cosmetic procedures within their areas of expertise. Many of these non–plastic surgeon specialists are among the contributors to, and readers of, this journal. Yet, there are vast numbers of other practitioners who perform cosmetic procedures for which their training is inappropriate and inadequate, and it is these individuals who may pose a danger to the public. Despite the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and the sincere efforts of excellent marketing professionals, the successful “branding” of board-certified plastic surgeons and other qualified surgical specialists as the preferred providers of cosmetic surgery remains, at best, in doubt. Aggressive promotion by organizations such as the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery promulgates the concept that cosmetic surgery is an entity unto itself, distinct from plastic surgery, and expertise is primarily dependent on postresidency training and clinical experience. A study published in 2004 by Hamilton et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13484148">7</xref></sup> also utilizing a survey, suggested that the public believes that cosmetic surgeons require significantly less training than plastic or reconstructive surgeons and that cosmetic surgery is technically less difficult. It is somewhat ironic that, only 15 or 20 years ago, members of ASPRS were concerned that the public equated plastic surgery with cosmetic surgery, while plastic surgeons today are concerned about precisely the opposite—that consumers do not automatically consider plastic surgeons as the “go to” specialists for cosmetic procedures! And, although Galanis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484148">4</xref></sup> found that advertising was the least important factor in surgeon selection, one cannot discount both the conscious and subliminal effects of less-than-accurate (if not deceptive) marketing messages delivered over and over through a variety of media—messages that help to shape consumers’ views about cosmetic surgery and who is qualified to perform it. This is one reason why ASAPS remains so vital to the specialty. ASAPS, by its very existence, reminds the public that board-certified plastic surgeons are indeed the specialists in aesthetic surgery, something that arguably an organization serving diverse interests and agendas cannot as effectively achieve.</p>
<p>We must continue to support the important work of ASAPS in educating the public and the media about cosmetic surgery and the qualifications (or lack thereof) of those who perform it. This work has been ongoing for the past 25 years or more. Further research is needed to accurately assess the progress that has been made. I feel—and I believe most members would agree—that ASAPS has contributed greatly to raising the visibility of board-certified plastic surgeons, but there is no way to quiet the other voices clamoring for attention in the cosmetic arena. Considering the cultural shifts taking place in our society, as well as changes in the health care environment and increased competition for cosmetic surgery patients, it behooves us to take a fresh look at our messaging and pinpoint areas of weakness. Our societies, including ASAPS and other credible subspecialty groups, should take the lead in these communication efforts. At the same time, however, it is up to us, as individual physicians, to present ourselves to our communities in a manner that best showcases the training and unique skills that distinguish our particular practices. Good reputations are built on good work and, as the Galanis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484148">4</xref></sup> study confirms, there is no substitute for a sterling reputation. It matters little, in a clinical context, whether I call myself a “plastic surgeon,” “cosmetic surgeon,” or “aesthetic surgeon.” My work, whether I am performing a purely aesthetic procedure or a procedure that combines reconstructive and aesthetic elements, is guided by essentially the same principles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13484148">8</xref></sup> For better or worse, the nuances of nomenclature about which we sometimes obsess often mean very little to our patients. What matters is that we communicate confidence, competence, and caring in our interactions with them. When we focus on our own strengths and on providing the best possible care to our own patients, plastic surgery’s identity crisis doesn’t seem as much of a crisis after all.</p>
