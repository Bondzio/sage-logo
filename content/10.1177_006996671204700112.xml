<p>These 14 essays examine, state by state, the gender bias in inheritance laws and land distribution schemes in India. They revisit many of the issues raised by Bina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-006996671204700112">Agarwal (1994)</xref>. Since then, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 was substantially amended in 2005. It now mandates full inheritance rights for the married/unmarried daughter as a co-parcener and improves upon similar amendments made by four states in the 1980s and 1990s. Another important central government initiative is the policy directive to the states in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997–2002) to target women, both singly and by joint-titling, as beneficiaries of land distribution.</p>
<p>The studies indicate that people found inheritance rights for daughters in ancestral land the least acceptable among these measures. The essays on Punjab, Himachal and Haryana show that the daughter continues to be disinherited by use of the unrestricted testamentary powers given to the father under the Hindu Succession Act. Once the entire property has been willed to the sons, a daughter has to enforce her claim through the court, a confrontation few women were found willing to initiate. Daughters are also made to sign relinquishment deeds in favour of their brothers such as the <italic>dasbardari</italic> in Haryana (p. 55) and the <italic>hibanama</italic> by Muslim women in Assam (p. 5) before they can marry.</p>
<p>Customary laws, which are often the distillation of patriarchal values, also make it difficult to implement legislation-led reforms. The Naga and Kuki tribes in the Manipur hill tracts, for example, do not have to follow the more gender-just Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act 1960 (p. 169). Muslims too rely on custom to avoid their obligations under the Muslim Personal Law (<italic>shariat</italic>) 1937 to give an inheritance share to daughters and wives. They claim local custom in all but two states of India (and partially in two others).</p>
<p>The four field-enquiry based studies in the volume found that the antagonism to a daughter inheriting agricultural land was deeply embedded in the structures of kinship and social identity. Moreover, given village and clan exogamy in north India and the spread of virilocal marriage in matrilineal enclaves like Kerala (p. 130), women questioned the usefulness of inheriting land in their natal village. They said it was impractical for them to cultivate in villages where they do not reside (pp. 94, 98).</p>
<p>The near universal objection to a daughter being given land was that her dowry is an alternative to inheritance. The criticisms of this position are well known. Yet, while they refused to give land in inheritance, household questionnaires from Bengal and Karnataka showed that the parents were willing to part with a significant proportion of their resources for dowry and marriage expenses. These amounted to nearly the value of an acre of unirrigated land among households owning one acre and 580 days of wages among landless households (pp. 286–87) in West Bengal, while wedding costs exceeded the price of one acre of land in every one of four districts studied in Karnataka (p. 92). In both states, informant households gave this as the major reason for sale of land averaging 40 per cent in Karnataka and 49.7 per cent of land sales in Bengal.</p>
<p>Compared to the daughter, the entitlements of wives and widows were viewed more favourably. It may be germane to remember here that the widow is still not a member of the co-parcenary body under the Hindu Succession Act and her life-share has been reduced under the 2005 amendment. Most female-headed households in the surveys belonged to widows, who mainly relied on village and family elders to protect their rights. The problem with these social institutions, however, is that they are both motivated and limited by notions of patriarchal benevolence. Widows in UP, who were made co-heirs with their sons in 1997 by an amendment to the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (UPZALR) (p. 251), said that village elders and local revenue officers discouraged them from getting property registered separately from their sons (pp. 263–64). Some of the writers recommend that women beneficiaries of ameliorative schemes should have special safeguards against dispossession like those for Scheduled Castes and Tribes.</p>
<p>Overall, states seem to have followed the patriarchal framework of inheritance practices rather than bring in gender-sensitive legislation. Even a showpiece law such as the UPZALR Act 1950 places an unmarried daughter fourth in the order of succession and the married daughter further down (p. 262), as in most north Indian inheritance systems. Nor are land-ceiling laws even-handed between sons and daughters. Many states permit sons to take a share independent of the father’s household but do not allow daughters a separate share. Orissa amended its surplus land laws in 1974 and its R&amp;R Act in 2006, to allow the claim of an adult daughter but only if she was unmarried (pp. 199, 205).</p>
<p>Most starkly, the authors point out, women are rarely primary beneficiaries of land distribution schemes although their participation as cultivators and agricultural labour is high. The basic patriarchal assumption is that married women’s capacity for productive labour is subsumed under the authority of the male head of the household and does not make them eligible for independent entitlements.</p>
<p>The essays also confirm the argument that modernisation has unequally impacted male and female farmers because the latter lack the assets required for success in the public domain, chiefly education and access to government officials and information-networks.</p>
<p>The transition from communitarian shifting cultivation to settled agriculture in the North-East, for example, may have displaced ordinary tribal people from the land more generally (pp. 191–93), but it is seen to harm women farmers more. The new individually owned fields can only be owned by male heads of the family whereas women had easier access to community-allocated plots (p. 14).</p>
<p>Lastly, many essays argue that subsistence agriculture is getting ‘feminised’ as men move into better paid, non-agricultural work. This is a powerful argument for giving property rights to women farmers. The authors feel that it would help them get loans and make independent decisions that could help to lift them out of low-yield agriculture.</p>
<p>The studies confirm that a low social status prevents women from claiming property rights granted by ameliorative legislation. It is unfortunate that there are no chapters in the volume on Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra which have historically led the rest of India on issues of social reform and also initiated changes in the Hindu Succession Act ahead of the Centre. It is here that one might have expected greater success of the state-initiated reforms.</p>
