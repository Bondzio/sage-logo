<p>This is a very short primer on the meaning of editorial decisions made on manuscripts. For the author, this provides an understanding of the implications of a decision, something that I am always asked. For the reader, it provides a glimpse at one aspect of peer review that leads to publication of quality content. The peer review process involves the following steps:</p>
<list id="list1-0898010112464943" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Initial screening of a manuscript to ensure basic criteria have been met and that no identifying author information exists to inhibit a fair and objective review.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A review by the editor for alignment with aims and scope of the journal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reviews conducted by two to three expert reviewers with knowledge in the content area and skills in evaluating scholarly writing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An associate editor reviews the manuscript and the reviews and recommendations of the reviewers. The associate editor has expertise in the field of holistic nursing research, education, practice, or aesthetics. The associate editor makes one of four recommendations for publication: accept, accept with minor revisions, major revisions required with no guarantee of acceptance, and reject. The associate editor makes a recommendation to the editor for a decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The editor makes a decision based on a final review of the manuscript and all previous reviews and recommendations. The decision reached is one of the four recommendations noted above.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The decision is communicated to the author(s) along with all the reviews and notations from the editor. Each decision has particular meaning and implications for the author that are often misunderstood.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112464943">
<title>Accept</title>
<p>This particular decision is very rarely made on the first submission of a manuscript and is more typical of a manuscript that is submitted after being revised. This clearly means that the manuscript is in a condition that requires no further revisions. It moves forward to a process of copy editing that results in page proofs that are sent to the author for final review and approval before being posted online and appearing in the print version of the journal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0898010112464943">
<title>Accept With Minor Revisions</title>
<p>This decision means that a manuscript is acceptable for publication if some minor revisions can be made to improve the quality of the content and writing. The author is told that the manuscript has been reviewed very positively and the manuscript can be published if it is revised in response to the reviewers’ concerns. The author is provided with a set of instructions of how to resubmit the manuscript once it is revised. It is critical that the author include a table that addresses each of the reviewer concerns noted and a response to the concerns noting how the manuscript has been revised. The author is also given the opportunity to choose not to revise the manuscript according to a reviewer comment or suggestion, but is asked to provide a rationale for that choice in the table. Following the resubmission, the manuscript undergoes a very limited review to ascertain if the recommended changes have been made. It is then moved into the accept category for publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010112464943">
<title>Major Revisions Required With No Guarantee of Acceptance</title>
<p>This decision means that the manuscript has substantive flaws in the content and writing that make it unacceptable for publication. It is the one that leads to the greatest amount of confusion by authors. This decision is a culmination of all the reviews done by the parties involved including reviewers, associate editor, and editor. While we cannot publish the manuscript in its current form, it could be published following major substantive revisions and a second review. The author is told that the reviewers suggest major substantive revisions being done before submitting the revised manuscript for another full review process. Since there is no guarantee of acceptance in the second review, the author(s) must determine if they wish to revise the manuscript based on the reviews and resubmit it or not. However, it is my experience that while there is no guarantee, the probability of acceptance is greatly improved if the author can demonstrate that the recommendations have been considered seriously and addressed in the revised manuscript. It is important that the author include a table detailing each reviewer concern and describing how the concern has been addressed in the revised version of the manuscript. We welcome resubmissions that attend to the reviewer concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010112464943">
<title>Reject</title>
<p>This decision means that the manuscript is so flawed in the view of the editor that it is not acceptable for publication, even with substantive revisions. It is the most difficult decision to reach by reviewers and editors. The decision implies clearly that the author should not try to revise and resubmit the manuscript.</p>
<p>I hope this brief summary has offered you an opportunity to understand the decision process and what it means to the author. Understanding the decision is important in guiding the future development of the manuscript. For the reader, I hope this give a glimpse into our review and decision process that ensures the highest possible quality of journal content.</p>
