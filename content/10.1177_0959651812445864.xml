<title>Journal of Systems and Control Engineering - Feedback</title>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Those of you with long memories will recall that the <italic>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers</italic>, including the <italic>Journal of Systems and Control Engineering</italic>, frequently included Contributions from Readers. At times these challenged/corrected the Authors, but more frequently they served to enhance the value of the Paper by extending the material or adding to the discussion of earlier work. I am delighted that our Innovative Forward Look articles have led to an exchange of correspondence between authors, as Published in this Issue. I hope that this serves to encourage more readers to discuss the published papers for the benefit of the Systems and Control Engineering community.</p>
<p>Like all Professional Journals, we rely on the expertise of Reviewers to help ensure that the published papers are both technically correct and original. It is inevitable that occasionally errors go undetected, or earlier publications are overlooked. At other times the value of a published Paper may be increased by readers sharing their experience or insights. Whatever the motivation, the Editorial Board would like to invite readers to accept this invitation to contribute to our proposed ‘<italic>Feedback</italic>’ section.</p>
<p>A primary aim of the Journal is to publish work that includes experimental validation. The importance of analysis and synthesis in Systems and Control Engineering is obvious, but that is enhanced by the Journal’s aim to ‘give prominence to experimental application and industrial studies’ with due weight given to ‘new theoretical developments which are likely to provide the foundation for future applications’. The Board has sought to define a scope for the Journal consistent with these aims, but we would be delighted to receive feedback and comment from Readers.</p>
<p>One matter I should like to mention is that whereby authors make an effort to relate their material to earlier work published in the Journal. If we are able to achieve this I believe it would provide an important contribution to the continuous development of the Journal. I look forward to your feedback on this or any relevant issue.</p>
