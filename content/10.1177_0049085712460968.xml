<p>The main focus of this book is on riot victims in Mumbai in the aftermath of the violence against Muslims—that took place in the city during December 1992–January 1993—in the wake of the 6 December 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. The author, a working journalist, then posted in Mumbai, spent time looking at how the city has changed and how people have lived through the difficult times after the riots, which had torn apart the social fabric. Very little has been done to punish those guilty of committing heinous crimes during the riots.</p>
<p>Common threads emerged from the interviews with riot victims: many had sought refuge within their own community; others suffered trauma, lost livelihoods and were alienated. These riots and the ones preceding them have created a schism, which is reflected in Hindu attitudes towards the Muslim community which is constantly vilified as owing allegiance to Pakistan; as causing terror and as being ‘anti-national’. How did the divisions creep up over the years and what were the factors leading to mistrust and the perpetuation of stereotypes? These questions bothered the author.</p>
<p>The Srikrishna Commission Report (1998) on the riots said 900 people had been killed in mob violence and police firing that took place in 1992–3; 2036 were injured and thousands driven into relief camps. The riots intensified the historically pre-existing divide between Hindus and Muslims and created a process of ghettoisation. Many people went to live in extended suburbs of Mumbai or in the neighbourhood of Thane district. New colonies have been created by this migration, which, in course of time, have developed their own identity and culture. These areas are now labelled ‘terrorist hotbeds’. People in areas such as Mumbra in the Thane district and Naya Nagar in Mira Road are routinely picked up by the police as ‘anti-nationals’.</p>
<p>The riots were followed by the serial bomb blasts of 12 March 1993 in Mumbai. These were unprecedented events and increased the distrust and suspicion between the two major communities in the city. To understand the complexities of the situation, the author went back to the riots, met people who had suffered, examined the pre- and post-independence history of riots in Mumbai and the overall context of notions such as nationalism, Hindutva and secularism. As she puts it, ‘the book is as much a journey as an exploration; it does not aim to offer any answers but actually raises more questions’ (xxi).</p>
<p>As stated, today in Mumbai, one hears frequently of ‘ghettos’ and thinks of Muslims as the ‘other’ and as ‘terrorists’. Many are denied living accommodation and housing simply because they are Muslims; they also find it difficult to get jobsaccentuating alienation. The popular myth has arisen that ‘all Muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims’! The serial bomb blasts killed 257 people and injured 713. Anger spilled over against Muslims and many told the author that Muslims were not victims but were the perpetrators of the violence! The Srikrishna Commission Report, which looked into the bomb blasts and the riots, came out with extensive documentation. The accused in the bomb blasts were arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA). A highly publicised and prolonged trial was conducted and a hundred convictions obtained including death sentences.</p>
<p>However, justice for the riot victims remained. The Dadar police registered nine cases against ‘Samna’, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece and its editor Bal Thackeray. Six ended in acquittal and three were closed. The Bombay High Court dismissed appeals against the acquittals saying that no useful purpose would be served by digging up old cases and opening old wounds! The difference was clear: terror would be punished but the perpetrators of riots would go scot free! The riots were seen as a war against the historical Muslim invaders of India by the Shiv Sena warriors! The 1995 state assembly elections went in favour of the Shiv Sena in alliance with the BJP! Moreover, the July 2006 terror attack on a suburban train in the city further hardened attitudes against Muslims and aggravated the communal divide.</p>
<p>The government change in 1995 brought right wing parties into power and the terms of reference of the Srikrishna Commission were expanded to include the serial bomb blasts. After an interruption, the Commission finally submitted its report in February 1998.</p>
<p>The long struggle for justice to the riot victims continued. In 2007, civil society organisations mounted pressure demanding justice to riot victims and implementation of the recommendations of the Srikrishna Commission Report. The police registered 2,267 riot cases and made about 9000 arrests including 5,103 Hindus, 3,456 Muslims and 414 others. 1371 cases were closed. A Special Task Force was formed and a review taken. About 112 cases were re-investigated and fresh charges framed in eight. Sarpotdar, a leading politician, was convicted of the offence of inflaming communal passions. Thirty-one policemen had actively participated in the riots. One of them was a Joint Commissioner of police who was acquitted after a prolonged trial. Four Special Courts were set up to try 253 pending cases and 894 charge sheets filed. In 2010, a High Level Committee was set up to review pending cases; 202 cases were sent to the fast track court. Of the 900 dead in the riots, 575 were Muslims, 275 Hindus and others unknown.</p>
<p>The author’s research, conducted from February 2007 to November 2009, consisted of tracking down people affected by the riots and interviewing them. Bravely, she did not take a tape-recorder or camera. She mostly talked to people at length about their experiences and made notes in long hand! Her material mainly comprised long interviews. She covered the areas in the city as follows: (<italic>i</italic>) Mazagaon, Thakurdwar Tulsiwadi in South Mumbai; (<italic>ii</italic>) Behrampada, Naupada in West Mumbai; (<italic>iii</italic>) Kurla, Ghatkopar, Sion, Chunabhatti, Antop Hill, Bainganwadi, Govandi in Central Mumbai; (<italic>iv</italic>) Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Malad, Kandivli, Naya Nagar (Mira Road) in North Mumbai. It would have been educative for the reader if the author had provided a Map of Mumbai highlighting the areas of her work!</p>
<p>The author’s sources of information consisted of material from the archival department of the state government; the Elphinstone College; newspaper reports, first hand interviews, reports on the riots, books on communal violence, writ petitions, relief workers, non-government organisations and activists. Some of the materials have been published as articles in <italic>The Hindu</italic>.</p>
<p>The book is divided into several chapters following a lengthy introduction containing extensive quotations from scholars on communal violence past and present. The author, however, fails to note that communal riots in India do not just happen due to various historical and other reasons cited by her but are meticulously prepared for, organised and conducted by various forces in society who work as ‘institutionalised riot systems’. These systems are graphically analysed by Paul Brass in his seminal study <italic>The Production of Hindu-Muslim Violence in Contemporary India</italic> (Oxford, 2003). This study has unfortunately been completely ignored by Indian scholars on communal violence including the painstaking author. If she had looked at this book, her work might have taken on a different dimension. It is not too late, though, for her to read it!</p>
<p>The introduction is followed by chapters on Jogeshwari riots, the ghettos in Naya Nagar, the displacement and polarisation, the loss of livelihood and the perceptions of justice. These are, in fact, the most interesting parts of the book and bring out the experiences and feelings of many innocent victims of violence both Hindu and Muslim. Reading these chapters, one was reminded of VS Naipaul’s great book <italic>A Million Mutinies Now</italic>. The author must be complimented for her painstaking effort in carrying out these interviews with victims and recording her findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the author notes both positive and negative factors in the situation of the people in the great city. Reconciliation of a sort has occurred but without justice. Her reference to Mahmood Mamdani’s work on how it was the second best option for South Africans to get on with their lives not in acrimony but with a spirit of togetherness is well taken. The end to violence cannot come from more violence! Many of the ordinary people interviewed by her did in fact reflect the same view as Mamdani and have got on with their lives in spite of the fact that both the central and state governments who have a responsibility to prevent communal violence, protect the victims and undertake relief and rehabilitation in a non-partisan manner which they failed to do in Mumbai. Thereby hangs a tale!</p>
<p>It is the great spirit of resilience of the ordinary people of India that the distinguished author has successfully brought to our notice in this book. She deserves our appreciation and thanks!</p>
