<p>Although cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and in the United Kingdom, there are effective treatments for primary and secondary prevention. Before 1990, eligibility for preventive treatment was mainly determined by elevated levels of single risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12437246">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12437246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12437246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12437246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12437246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12437246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12437246">7</xref></sup> but more recent UK guidelines determine eligibility on the basis of the total estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12437246">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12437246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12437246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12437246">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Total risk of cardiovascular events is estimated from the patients’ age, sex, diabetic and smoking status, blood pressure, and total cholesterol and HDL levels, although some guidelines make additional adjustments to risk for South Asian ethnicity and for family history of premature coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12437246">12</xref></sup> According to UK guidelines, patients with existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a 10-year cardiovascular risk above 20% are eligible for statins. High-risk and diabetic patients are also eligible for antihypertensive treatment if their blood pressure exceeds 140/90 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12437246">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12437246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12437246">11</xref></sup> Patients whose blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg are eligible for antihypertensive treatment, irrespective of their cardiovascular risk. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are eligible for statins, irrespective of their cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Although general practitioners (GPs) are aware of cardiovascular guidelines, adherence to guidance in routine clinical practice is variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12437246">13</xref></sup> There is some evidence that more recently qualified physicians are more likely to follow guidelines and that degree of adherence to guidelines is a characteristic of particular health care centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12437246">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12437246">15</xref></sup> Physicians may not fully appreciate the clinical importance of cholesterol lowering, and when patients are eligible for treatment, it is common for physicians to delay a decision on prescribing until the next visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12437246">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12437246">17</xref></sup> Underuse of statins in secondary prevention is also well recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12437246">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12437246">19</xref></sup> Overuse of statins has been reported in a number of studies: In the Netherlands and Norway, a majority of treated patients had cardiovascular risk levels below eligibility criteria, and in the United States, a majority had insufficient additional risk factors to be eligible for treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12437246">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12437246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12437246">22</xref></sup> In the past, concern about overuse of antihypertensives has focused on misdiagnosis and white coat hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12437246">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12437246">24</xref></sup> However, in New Zealand, the earliest adopter of risk-based hypertension guidelines, surveyed clinicians reported that they would treat younger adults (at low cardiovascular risk) at a lower blood pressure than older adults (high cardiovascular risk).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12437246">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, while eligibility for treatment is determined by total cardiovascular risk, when deciding whether to offer preventive treatment, GPs mention numerical risk estimates much less commonly than individual risk factor values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12437246">26</xref></sup> Evidence also suggests that physicians do not assess cardiovascular risk accurately, giving insufficient weight to some risk factors and too much to others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12437246">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, risk estimation varies from one physician to another and may be estimated differently by generalists and specialists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X12437246">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12437246">29</xref></sup> About two-thirds of physicians continue to estimate risk without using risk calculators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12437246">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not clear how the decision-making process of GPs can be modified to ensure greater compliance with management based on total cardiovascular risk. In a local randomized controlled study (see Methods for details) aimed at primary prevention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12437246">31</xref></sup> cardiovascular risk assessment in some general practices was undertaken by a trained nurse who made treatment recommendations to the GP on the basis of the patients’ total cardiovascular risk. This study gave us the opportunity to test the hypothesis that assessment by the project nurse will result in more guideline-compliant treatment decisions when compared with the usual process of care employed by GPs, while simultaneously enabling us to identify the risk factors that are associated with treatment decisions (with or without nurse assessment).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0272989X12437246">
<title>Practices and Data Sources</title>
<p>This is a secondary analysis of data collected during a cardiovascular prevention project in six general practices in a deprived city of the West Midlands (England) in 2007. The study has been reported elsewhere but is described in brief below.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12437246">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all six practices age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factor data were extracted from electronic medical records on patients aged 35 to 74, without a preexisting diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, who were not receiving preventive treatment. An estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was calculated (see below) for all patients. Patients whose estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was ≥20% were categorized as high risk. In a nonrandomly selected intervention arm (four practices), a project nurse systematically sent letters inviting these high-risk patients for a checkup in their own practice. The letter mentioned that preventive medication might be offered. The project nurse measured the patients’ blood pressure and cholesterol levels and determined their ethnicity, smoking status, and family history of premature heart disease. From this assessment, their eligibility for treatment was determined.</p>
<p>Eligible patients’ preferences for medication were discussed (using visual aids if appropriate), and they were referred to their GP for prescription of treatment. In the control arm (two practices), similar patients received usual care. Some had their blood pressure and cholesterol levels measured opportunistically and were prescribed treatment by their GP. After 1 year, patient risk factor data and prescription records for preventive drugs were extracted from electronic medical records in all six practices.</p>
<p>The extracted risk factor data used for this analysis included blood pressures and cholesterol levels recorded during the course of the year’s project and the most recently available diabetic and smoking status. Any patient whose risk factors were assessed during the study year was included in this secondary analysis of factors influencing prescribing decisions.</p>
<p>The original study found that after 1 year, 61.7% of the invited high-risk patients in intervention practices had their cardiovascular risk factors assessed, and 40.6% of invited patients were started on at least one preventive treatment. In control practices, 27.9% of the invited patients had their cardiovascular risk factors assessed, and 12.7% were started on treatment. In total, 500 patients had their cardiovascular risk factors assessed and recorded.</p>

<title>Determining Cardiovascular Risk and Treatment Eligibility</title>
<p>Ten-year cardiovascular risk was calculated from each patient’s risk factor data using the method advocated in 2005 UK guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12437246">11</xref></sup> This method calculates cardiovascular risk as the sum of coronary heart disease risk and stroke risk, multiplying by 1.4 for South Asian ethnicity and 1.3 for family history of premature coronary heart disease. HDL values were available for only 374 patients. For the remaining patients, cardiovascular risk was estimated using a default HDL value: the population mean for each patient of a specified age, sex, diabetic status, and smoking status. This previously described method is known to yield accurate estimates of cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12437246">33</xref></sup> For each patient, eligibility for antihypertensives and statins was determined on the basis of their blood pressure, total cholesterol, 10-year cardiovascular risk, and other risk factor characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12437246">
<title>Selected Variables</title>
<p>The following patient-level variables were included in our statistical analyses: age (years), sex (male/female), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status (smoker/nonsmoker), total cholesterol (mmol/L), HDL (mmol/L), diabetic status (yes/no), family history of premature coronary heart disease (yes/no), South Asian ethnicity (yes/no), and 10-year cardiovascular risk (0%–100%) derived via the Framingham equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12437246">12</xref></sup> Two separate outcomes were considered: prescription of an antihypertensive drug and prescription of a statin.</p>
<p>HDL was recorded in 374 patients; therefore, five datasets with 126 imputed missing values were generated by chained equations (using the ICE function in STATA 11) using age, sex, smoking status, diabetes, family history of premature cardiovascular heart disease, total cholesterol, statin prescribed, and antihypertensive medication prescribed as covariates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X12437246">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Continuous variables were categorized. Ten-year cardiovascular risk was categorized into four levels (&lt;10%, 10%–19.9%, 20%–29.9%, ≥30%). Total cholesterol was categorized into three levels (&lt;5, 5.0–6.9, ≥7 mmol/L) based on local clinical guidelines. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were categorized into three levels (&lt;140, 140–159, ≥160 mm Hg) and (&lt;90, 90–99, ≥100 mm Hg) also based on UK clinical guidelines. As there are no clinically accepted thresholds for HDL (mmol/L), this was categorized into quartiles (≤1.2, 1.3–1.4, 1.5–1.7, ≥1.8 mmol/L).</p>
<p>Separate analyses were conducted for patients assessed by the project nurse and those assessed only by their GP. The multivariable modeling strategy began with a model based on 10-year cardiovascular risk, followed by a model based on cardiovascular risk factor covariates. A further analysis was undertaken, including 10-year cardiovascular risk as well as individual risk factors. This was to determine whether cardiovascular risk factors might have an additional influence on prescribing beyond their contribution to the cardiovascular risk equation. For the antihypertensive model the &lt;10% and 10%–19.9% 10-year cardiovascular risk categories were combined because only one patient at the &lt;10% 10-year cardiovascular risk category was prescribed statins. <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were predefined to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>We also investigated the extent to which antihypertensive prescribing was an independent predictor of statin prescribing for the GP and the nurse separately. This analysis provides additional insight into the relationship between prescribing decisions net of individual patient risk factors.</p>
<p>All analyses were carried out with STATA 11.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Five hundred patients participated in the study, of which 55.8% (297 of 500) were assessed by the project nurse and 40.6% (203 of 500) were assessed by the GP. In all, 199 (39.8%) patients were eligible for antihypertensives and 325 (65%) for statins according to the UK guidelines. Of those eligible for antihypertensives, 54.3% (108 of 199) were prescribed treatment along with 5.0% (15 of 301) of ineligible patients. Of those eligible for statins, 66.5% (216 of 325) were prescribed a statins along with 45.7% (80 of 175) of ineligible patients.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12437246">Table 1</xref> compares patient baseline characteristics, eligibility criteria, and treatment decision between patients assessed by the GP and the project nurse. Patients assessed by the nurse were less likely to be diabetic (9.4% v. 18.2%), more likely to have a family history of premature coronary heart disease (19.5% v. 3.9%), and more likely to have a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of &gt;20% (61.3% v. 47.8%). However, similar proportions of patients were eligible for hypertensive treatment (nurse 39.4% vs GP 40.4%) and statin treatment (nurse 67% vs GP 62.1%). Treatment was more likely to be prescribed when the nurse assessed the patients (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12437246">Table 1</xref>). The patient risk factors that were associated with treatment were investigated using separate statistical models for the GP and the nurse.</p>

<title>For Patients Assessed by the GP</title>
<p>Cardiovascular risk was not a predictor of statin prescribing in the GP model. In the GP model with individual cardiovascular risk factors only, total cholesterol ≥7 mmol/L was a predictor of statin prescribing: odds ratio 12.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.46 to 67.52). A family history of premature coronary heart disease had an odds ratio of 7.38 (95% CI: 0.82 to 66.59) but was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.075). Odds ratios very were similar in a model including 10-year cardiovascular risk in addition to individual risk factors (Supplementary Table 1). Prescription of an antihypertensive had an odds ratio of 5.38 (95% CI: 1.74 to 16.67) as a predictor of statin prescribing, but its inclusion in the model did not significantly alter the relationship to any other predictors (model results not shown).</p>

<sec id="section9-0272989X12437246">
<title>For Patients Assessed by the Project Nurse</title>
<p>In the project nurse model, cardiovascular risk was a predictor of statin prescribing. In the model with individual cardiovascular risk factors only, age, male sex, smoking status, diabetic status, family history of premature coronary heart disease, total cholesterol 5.0 to 6.9 mmol/L, total cholesterol ≥7 mmol/L, and the highest quartile of HDL were all significant predictors of prescribing. The strongest predictors were total cholesterol levels 5.0–6.9 mmol/L (odds ratio: 11.84; 95% CI: 5.66 to 24.75), total cholesterol ≥7 mmol/L (odds ratio: 75.63; 95% CI: 13.78 to 415.25), and diabetes (odds ratio: 7.68; 95% CI: 2.24 to 26.33). South Asian ethnicity was not found to be a predictor of statin prescribing. Adding 10-year cardiovascular risk to the individual risk factors model made very little difference to the odds ratios for individual risk factors, but there was no longer a significant association between prescribing statins and 10-year cardiovascular risk (Supplementary Table 1). Antihypertensive prescribing was not a significant predictor of statin prescribing (odds ratio: 2.21; 95% CI: 0.9 to 6.12) (model results not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section14-0272989X12437246">
<title>Summary of Main Findings</title>
<p>GP prescribing of statins was influenced by total cholesterol (≥7.0 mmol/L) as well as antihypertensive prescribing but not by cardiovascular risk. Among patients assessed by the project nurse, statin prescribing was most strongly influenced by total cholesterol, but all the main cardiovascular risk factors from the Framingham equation influenced prescribing.</p>
<p>Antihypertensive prescribing in patients assessed by the GP was strongly associated with blood pressure ≥160/100 mm Hg, but after taking account of blood pressure, prescribing was not associated with cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive prescribing in patients assessed by the project nurse was strongly associated with blood pressure and also with cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>When GPs assess patients, they appear to prescribe in response to elevated total cholesterol and elevated blood pressure, not cardiovascular risk: a pattern resembling pre-1990 guidelines. But GP prescribing in patients assessed by the project nurse was more guideline concordant, suggesting that (1) prescribing practice can be modified and (2) the constraints appear to be in the assessment process. However, the overall finding that one-third of eligible patients were not prescribed statins and half of noneligible patients were prescribed statins suggests that there is considerable headroom for optimizing the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Since the potential to benefit from preventive treatment is greatest in patients with the highest overall risk, the focus on individual risk factors is a considerable missed opportunity for prevention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272989X12437246">
<title>Comparison With Existing Literature</title>
<p>Other researchers have reported that GPs take less account of cardiovascular risk than what hypertension guidelines recommend. In a survey of Swedish GPs only half reported using calculating cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12437246">34</xref></sup> In a case vignette–based study, Swedish GPs systematically underestimated risk compared to WHO/ISH guidelines, with decisions to treat mainly influenced by blood pressure and younger age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12437246">35</xref></sup> In a Dutch survey, GPs reported that they did not always assess key cardiovascular risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12437246">36</xref></sup> All three studies also reported reluctance to initiate treatment for hypertension in patients eligible under national guidelines. Empirical analysis of antihypertensive prescribing in France suggests that cardiovascular risk factors only modestly influenced the decision to prescribe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12437246">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have found that eligible patients are frequently not prescribed statins, although they are more likely to be prescribed to those patients with more risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12437246">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12437246">39</xref></sup> We found moderately high compliance with statin guidelines and that patients at high cardiovascular risk (more risk factors) were more likely to be prescribed. Unlike previous studies, we found no relationship between patients’ age and prescribing statins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12437246">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12437246">19</xref></sup> However, our analysis included no patients aged over 74 years. An association between antihypertensive prescribing and statin prescribing has also been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12437246">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous research has also shown that nurse-led cardiovascular prevention clinics result in more guideline compliance and better risk factor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12437246">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12437246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12437246">42</xref></sup> The observation that guideline compliance was greater in patients assessed by the project nurse suggests that the clinician and the process of invitation were significant factors in guideline compliance.</p>
<p>There may be good reasons why clinicians do not comply with clinical guidelines. Noncompliance may be rational since guidelines for patient assessment, and follow-up can be impractical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12437246">43</xref></sup> Patients assessed by their GP in this study were assessed opportunistically, but in normal consultation, responding to the presenting problem takes precedence over opportunistic prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12437246">44</xref></sup> It is also possible that patients and GPs may be using different thresholds for prescription because they weigh the evidence of costs and benefits differently from those indicated in clinical guidelines.</p>
<p>When not informed by a project nurse, GPs treat elevated risk factors and not high cardiovascular risk. Clinical practice is therefore less effective and may be more costly than current, risk-informed prevention guidelines. The cost and cost-effectiveness implications of divergence from statins guidelines may be substantial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12437246">45</xref></sup> Improving guideline compliance therefore has considerable potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of prevention in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0272989X12437246">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>This study is the first study of observed prescribing behavior that relates prescribing of preventive treatments to cardiovascular risk and to individual risk factors. It would be more robust to test the derived models in another data set, and generalizability may be limited by the inclusion of only six practices from one inner-city region of the United Kingdom in the context of a specific cardiovascular prevention project.</p>
<p>A number of potential influences on prescribing decisions are unknown in this study. There was no information on comorbidities, although absolute contraindications to statins or antihypertensives are uncommon. Patients’ treatment preferences were not recorded. This is important, as preferences vary widely among individuals and individuals’ preferences may diverge from guideline recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12437246">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12437246">47</xref></sup> Patients’ preferences could explain discrepancy between decision making and guidelines and, in particular, the inconsistent relationship between family history and prescribing found in our study. Nevertheless, it has been observed that GPs’ decisions to start preventive treatments can take little account of patient preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X12437246">48</xref></sup> Furthermore, although patients’ preferences were not recorded, the project nurse reported that, following assessment, almost all eligible patients indicated a preference for drug treatment. Patients assessed by the project nurse had chosen to attend after being informed that preventive medication might be offered. Because they already knew the aim of the checkup (prevention and treatment), it is likely that those who attended had moved beyond Prochaska’s precontemplative stage of change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X12437246">49</xref></sup> This is consistent with a previous study of patient preferences, where participants attended after having received a written invitation for a checkup mentioning the possibility of drug treatment: most attendees indicated a preference for accepting treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12437246">46</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Repeating this analysis in a larger and more representative population of patients receiving routine clinical care would add weight to the findings. Qualitative research could shed light on the reasons why GPs’ prescribing decisions deviate from guidelines and the role of patients’ views in relation to guideline compliance. Research should investigate methods of improving clinician compliance with guidelines.</p>
