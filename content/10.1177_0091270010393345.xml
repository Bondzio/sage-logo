<p>Most lead exposures are occupational; however, intermittent environmental exposures may be more prevalent than generally thought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393345">1</xref></sup> Chronic lead nephropathy is associated with modest proteinuria, hyperuricemia, gout, and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393345">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnosis of lead nephropathy is clinically important because chelation therapy in early disease is safe and effective at preventing progression of renal impairment. The body lead burden is the criterion most commonly used for determining when chelation therapy is required, particularly in patients with mild disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393345">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010393345">2</xref></sup> The blood lead concentration only reflects recent exposures so it is not a useful biomarker of the body lead burden when considering whether a patient might benefit from lead chelation therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010393345">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The calcium–disodium–EDTA (CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA) lead mobilization study is the most widely used test to diagnose an elevated body lead burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393345">1</xref></sup> This biomarker of exposure involves a single parenteral dose of CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA followed by measurement of the urinary excretion of the lead–EDTA complex, as this excretion is proportional to the body lead burden. Patients with high urinary lead excretion are then considered for prolonged chelation therapy.</p>
<p>Because patients on hemodialysis are often oligoanuric and the clearance of the lead–EDTA complex by dialysis is unknown, the standard mobilization test is fraught with difficulties. Clearance studies have been performed in end-stage renal failure patients using hemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis, but this necessitates an expensive change in therapy for standard hemodialysis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010393345">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010393345">6</xref></sup> To our knowledge, clearance of the lead–EDTA complex by routine hemodialysis has not been described.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it is possible to assess body lead burden by measuring the amount of lead in dialysate effluent. The molecular weights of EDTA and lead are 292.24 g/mol and 207.2 g/mol, respectively. The high-flux hemodialysis cartridge used in our unit is the Gambro Polyflux H 210-H. Manufacturer specification sheets for this product report a sieving coefficient for large compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (molecular weight 1355.37 g/mol) of 1.0 with clearance increasing by 14% with hemofiltration at a rate of 60 mL/min (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gambro.com/upload/pdf/PolyfluxH.pdf">http://www.gambro.com/upload/pdf/PolyfluxH.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this brief report is to describe the use of high-flux hemodialysis to perform a lead mobilization study and to determine the clearance of EDTA via this protocol.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 58-year-old man with a history of chronic severe polyarticular tophaceous gout and chronic kidney disease progressed to end-stage renal failure requiring hemodialysis in 2008. His occupational history revealed the possibility of lead exposure. He declined a renal biopsy, but a random whole-blood lead level was found to be elevated (0.49 µM; reference range &lt;0.48 µM). Given the clinical syndrome, his history, and this blood test, the diagnosis of lead nephropathy was proposed.</p>
<p>Concurrently, there was a decline in his mental health status leading to multiple prolonged episodes of nonattendance for hemodialysis, so we sought to evaluate the lead body burden. Chelation therapy was not anticipated to reverse end-stage renal failure; however, we hoped it would improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, as has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010393345">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient consented to participate in the diagnostic study. Prior to the lead mobilization study, baseline lead excretion was determined in dialysate samples and a 72-hour urine collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0091270010393345">
<title>Protocol and Analyses</title>
<p>Similar to previous studies in patients receiving hemofiltration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010393345">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010393345">5</xref></sup> 1 g of CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA in 250 mL of 5% dextrose was administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour. The patient was commenced on hemodialysis 30 minutes later via an arteriovenous fistula. A Gambro 210-H filter was used with dialysate flow of 500 mL/min and initial blood flow 350 mL/min, reduced to 300 mL/min after 40 minutes because of mild hypotension.</p>
<p>To maximize the collection of the lead–EDTA complex by hemodialysis, its toxicokinetics need to be understood. The peak plasma lead concentration is usually observed ~1 hour but sometimes within 3 hours of completion of the infusion, which is within the usual 4 to 5 hours of hemodialysis treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010393345">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010393345">10</xref></sup> In patients with normal renal function, the peak lead urinary concentration is noted around the same time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010393345">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010393345">11</xref></sup> In contrast, in patients with renal impairment the peak urine concentration is delayed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010393345">12</xref></sup> so a complete 72-hour urine collection is recommended.</p>
<p>Given these toxicokinetic data, the following were determined. All samples were collected into containers that had been washed with a diluted EDTA solution to remove residual lead.</p>
<list id="list1-0091270010393345" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Lead concentration in a 72-hour urine collection commencing immediately following the administration of CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whole-blood lead concentrations at the inflow port when hemodialysis was commenced and then at 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes, and 240 minutes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Concentration of lead in dialysate effluent very soon after commencement of hemodialysis and then at 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes, and 240 minutes</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The amount of lead excreted by dialysis was determined by multiplying the mean lead dialysate concentration by the rate of effluent production for each hour of treatment. The amount of lead excreted in the 72-hour urine collection was determined by multiplying the lead concentration in urine by the volume.</p>
<p>A single blood and dialysate sample was collected at the start of hemodialysis 2 days later to check for circulating EDTA and to determine whether there was an interdialytic rebound in lead concentration.</p>
<p>For proof of concept of this protocol we determined the clearance of EDTA by hemodialysis by measuring the concentration of EDTA in dialysate. The concentration of EDTA in dialysate is proportional to that of plasma so the systemic clearance (CL) was calculated using this formula: CL = (0.693 × Vd)/half-life. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of EDTA is 0.21 L/kg, the patient’s mean weight was 84 kg, and urinary clearance was assumed to be minimal during the 4-hour treatment. The amount of EDTA eliminated in dialysate effluent was determined by calculating the amount eliminated each hour by the same method used for lead (above). To determine the maximum amount of EDTA that could be removed by hemodialysis, we calculated the area under the EDTA dialysate concentration–time curve (AUC) extrapolated to time infinity and multiplied by the dialysate flow rate.</p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria for an elevated body lead burden on the basis of the EDTA mobilization study vary slightly between different reports. Commonly, mobilization of more than 150 µg in 24 hours is consistent with low-level poisoning and more than 600 µg is consistent with significant poisoning (although chelation therapy has been administered to patients when more than 80 µg is mobilized in 24 hours).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010393345">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010393345">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010393345">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010393345">15</xref></sup> Others have suggested that normal lead excretion is less than 600 µg in 24 to 72 hours and that chelation is necessary when excretion is greater than 1000 µg of lead per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393345">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010393345">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concentration of lead in urine and dialysate was determined by NSW Health Division of Analytical Laboratories, Sydney, Australia, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and the reporting limit was 2 µg/L. The concentration of EDTA in dialysate was determined by Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy, and the reporting limit was 50 µg/L.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Baseline whole-blood lead concentration was 0.28 µM before hemodialysis. The CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA lead mobilization study was conducted on the next dialysis session, during which the whole-blood lead concentrations fluctuated between 0.34 and 0.31 µM.</p>
<p>The lead concentration in dialysate prior to the lead mobilization study was less than the reporting limit of the assay (&lt;2 µg/L). Following CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA, the dialysate lead concentration increased to 2 µg/L at the start and 1 hour after commencing hemodialysis, after which the concentration decreased to below the reporting limit. Therefore, during the 4-hour hemodialysis, less than 240 µg of lead was excreted. The total amount of lead excreted in urine was 25 µg. In total, less than 270 µg of lead was excreted by the CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA lead mobilization study, which is less than 600 µg, a usual indication for chelation treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010393345">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The elimination of EDTA in dialysate effluent is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010393345">Figure 1</xref>. The peak concentration at the commencement of hemodialysis was followed by a log-linear decay consistent with first-order elimination, with a half-life of 1.26 hours. The amount of EDTA removed during hemodialysis was ~550 mg during 4 hours (a further 90 mg would have been eliminated if treatment continued to infinity). The fate of the remaining 35% to 40% of the dose of EDTA cannot be determined from this data. EDTA was detected in dialysate effluent 24 hours following the mobilization study, but the concentration was very low (0.1 mg/L) so the amount persisting in the circulation at this time was small. At this time, dialysate and blood lead concentrations were 2 µg/L and 0.34 µM, respectively.</p>

<p>EDTA clearance during hemodialysis was 162 mL/min over 4 hours. The patient’s hematocrit was approximately 0.25, which equates to a plasma flow of 225 to 262 mL/min at the stated blood flow. Given that EDTA does not partition into erythrocytes to a significant extent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010393345">16</xref></sup> the extraction ratio across the hemodialysis filter was 0.62 to 0.72.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have presented the rationale and methods for conducting a CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA lead mobilization study as a biomarker of exposure in a patient on maintenance hemodialysis. In this instance, the results indicated a low body lead burden; however, these pharmacokinetic data suggest that a protocol using conventional high-flux hemodialysis is a valid means of measuring body lead burden. EDTA was rapidly eliminated by hemodialysis, and it is therefore likely that chelated lead would be cleared at a similar rate. The index of body lead burden measured using the described method has not been validated against the most important parameter: a clinical response to chelation therapy. However, as approximately 70% of EDTA is excreted in urine over 4 hours in those with normal renal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010393345">16</xref></sup> and this is comparable to the amount excreted in dialysate in our study, it seems reasonable to assume that the cutoffs that determine a potentially toxic body lead burden will be similar in hemodialysis patients.</p>
<p>In our patient, nearly 40% of the administered dose of CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA was not eliminated by hemodialysis and is unaccounted for. The blood concentration is predicted to be very low at the conclusion of hemodialysis given the rapid clearance, so a large proportion is unlikely to have remained in the systemic circulation. Some EDTA would be excreted into the urine, but it seems unlikely that this proportion would be significant in a patient with oliguric end-stage renal failure. The volume of distribution is relatively low (mean 0.21 L/kg; range, 0.05-0.23 L/kg),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010393345">17</xref></sup> but it is approximately 3-fold larger than the blood volume, so extravascular distribution cannot be excluded. Other methods of excretion such as the feces contribute a minor pathway only.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This brief report demonstrates a method for conducting a lead mobilization study in patients with end-stage renal failure and suspected lead poisoning. Intravenous CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA and lead were removed by hemodialysis, allowing estimation of the body lead burden. This can be useful for assessing the role of chelation therapy in a patient with suspected lead poisoning.</p>
