<p>Our required minimum outcome award for a pre-registration nursing education programme is a degree in nursing. Degree-level registration underpins the level of practice needed for the future, and enables new nurses to work more closely and effectively with other professionals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112449960">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Following the publication of new standards for pre-registration nursing education that focused on enabling nurses to deliver and support high-quality care within a changing healthcare environment, the move to degree-level registration was confirmed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) responsible for the regulation of nurses and midwives in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112449960">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2010</xref>). From September 2013, diploma programmes will no longer be available for new entrants to nurse education with the minimum level for pre-registration nursing education rising to degree. This regulation change aligns closely to the implementation of the Modernising Nursing Careers agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 2006</xref>) as outlined in ‘A high quality workforce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 2008</xref>), namely that nurses will be equipped with the necessary skills and capabilities for their roles. Whilst nurses seek to modernise their careers, coalition government policy focuses on ‘liberating’ the health service: putting patients and the public first, improving healthcare outcomes, cutting bureaucracy and improving efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 2010</xref>); also the role that public sector workers must play in shaping and improving the services that they deliver whilst assuring workforce productivity and value for money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112449960">HM Treasury, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although nursing degrees have been available in the United Kingdom for several decades, a mixed model of provision for pre-registration nursing education has been the norm; the levels of study offered by academic institutions across the four countries ranging from Diploma to Masters, and financial incentives available in the form of a non-means tested bursary available for those choosing to study at diploma level and some degree-level courses. Having completed a first degree in nursing nearly 30 years ago whilst also learning to be a nurse, the benefits of undergraduate education were consistently articulated throughout my training: delivery of evidence-based care, integration of theory and practice, understanding the art and science of nursing; I was to be part of a cohort of nurses who would ‘close the theory–practice gap’ and deliver research-based nursing care whilst role modelling best practice. Likewise, there were high expectations for those undertaking ‘Project 2000’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112449960">UKCC, 1986</xref>) curricula that were further increased by the emphasis within ‘Making a Difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 1999</xref>) on aspirations for new service and education partnerships that would be more responsive to changing health service needs.</p>
<p>The new NMC standards clearly propose the benefits of degree-level thinking for new graduate nurses: better preparation to deliver care within increasingly complex environments, higher levels of professional judgment and decision-making to drive up standards and quality; improved ability to lead, supervise and challenge others, including those already educated to degree level. However, evidence related to the contribution of graduate nurses to patient outcomes and quality of care is inconclusive. Although some North American studies report associations between improved patient outcomes and proportions of nursing workforce graduates, the variables are considerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112449960">Robinson and Griffiths, 2008</xref>) and comparable European studies are in their infancy. Implementation of the changes to pre-registration nursing education are part of a wider workforce transformation programme, underpinned by health care policy, focused on developing an agile and responsive workforce to overcome the challenges of delivering high-quality care within a complex and changing health economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112449960">2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Existing studies provide some insight into the likely consequence of the move to degree-level registration, with potential benefits including higher-calibre applicants seeking graduate status, with higher career expectations. Whilst lower competence of graduates has not been identified as a significant risk, potential risks do include the impact of the changes on the diversity of applicants with concern expressed about employers’ ability to meet graduate expectations and aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112449960">NNRU, 2008</xref>). The impact of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112449960">Browne (2010)</xref> review and revised bursary arrangements for many healthcare students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112449960">Department of Health, 2011b</xref>) further complicate the picture. There has been concern for some time about the possibility that ‘free’ tuition fees and subsidised maintenance arrangements may attract the ‘wrong sort’ of applicants into nursing. Equally, there is concern that the reduction in financial support may restrict opportunities for people, particularly mature students, to change careers and enter the profession, in effect narrowing access to nursing rather than widening it. Universities will need to be alert to this, so that the impact of funding changes on the existing and future body of applicants can be monitored, analysed and responded to over time.</p>
<p>With commentary on public perceptions of nursing a recurring feature in the media, both nurses and nursing are under increasing public scrutiny. Therefore, it is essential to recruit the right people into the profession as well as retaining the most talented individuals. Rigorous and reliable selection processes, jointly carried out by universities and employers, are vital to ensure that students are selected to join the nursing profession and to pursue a career in nursing rather than to complete a university programme in isolation. The move to degree-level registration provides further opportunity to attract the right candidates:<disp-quote>
<p>Delivering good nursing care calls for an intellectual ability to combine technical and clinical competence with emotional awareness, an understanding of feelings and behaviours. Taken alone, these may seem quite simple, but bringing them together in a way that achieves improved health outcomes for patients is complex and powerful. It forms the basis of a trusting relationship with patients and shapes public perceptions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112449960">Beasley, 2012</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
