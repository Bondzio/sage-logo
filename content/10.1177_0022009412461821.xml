<abstract>
<p>Fritz Todt created a program of lectures for German engineers in 1941. This ‘Speaker System’ was designed to enhance technical training, spread Todt’s Deutsche Technik ideology and prepare for technocratic Nazi control of postwar Europe. The Speaker System illustrates the tension inherent in the ‘ideological-pragmatic synthesis’ that was the Third Reich. Due to deteriorating wartime conditions and to Albert Speer’s shift to a ‘total war’ footing, the Speaker System faded away after 1943. Lectures were on the whole apolitical, with the ideological thrust varying widely between regions. Many speakers were not members of the Nazi Party or its engineering affiliate, demonstrating the regime’s wartime shift to technological pragmatism. Fritz Todt’s ideological vision proved secondary to the core Nazi goals of conquering Lebensraum and destroying the Jews.</p>

<p>As German armies pressed their attack into Russia at the end of August 1941, Fritz Todt, Nazi Minister of Armaments and Munitions, established a program of lectures for German engineers. It was referred to as a ‘Speaker System’ (Rednerwesen or Vortragswesen) and it served three purposes. It acquainted engineers and technicians with new information considered vital to their effective participation in the war effort. It continued Nazi ideological indoctrination of engineers. It allowed the Nazis to catalog and to control lecturers at the national, regional and district levels, laying the groundwork for increased politicization of the engineering professions after the war. During the period for which we have full statistics, from October 1941 through June 1942, over 7000 lectures were given to German engineers under the auspices of the Speaker System. Todt’s program provides an excellent opportunity to explore in microcosm what Adam Tooze calls the ‘ideological-pragmatic synthesis’ that lay at the heart of the Third Reich, for the Speaker System sought to increase the efficiency of engineers, while at the same time indoctrinating them in Nazi ideology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461821">1</xref></sup> The Speaker System demonstrates the tension between competing goals: a desire for pragmatic efficiency on the one hand and an impulse to control and indoctrinate on the other.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the ideological part of Todt’s Speaker System. It explores to what degree, under wartime conditions, the Nazis were able to maintain ideological momentum for their specific approach to technology. The first part of the article briefly describes what can be called Fritz Todt’s ‘technocratic ideology’ and his effort to control and politicize German engineers. We then follow the chronological evolution of the Speaker System, from its inception to its breakdown, and see how it fit into Todt’s technocratic plans. As the war progressed, wartime conditions, the friction between efficiency and indoctrination, and Albert Speer’s ideological indifference all led to the disintegration of the program. The fact that Todt’s system was eventually abandoned suggests that his <italic>Deutsche Technik</italic> approach was what Thomas Klepsch calls a ‘satellite’ element of Nazi ideology, one that drifted away from Nazism’s racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Bolshevik ‘gravitational core’ as historical circumstances dictated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009412461821">2</xref></sup> In the last, ‘fanatical utilitarianism’ phase of the Third Reich, an increasingly radicalized regime fought a ‘total war’ against both its external enemies and ‘community aliens’ – with weapons developed through traditional science and technology. No room remained for Todt’s holistic vision of a harmonious, technocratic community.</p>
<p>The second part of the article analyzes to what degree the program’s speakers and their lectures can be labeled ideological and shows to what extent national lecturers were Nazi Party members or members of the Nazi engineering association, the NSBDT. It is clear that the Speaker System was much more pragmatic than ideological. In addition, there were striking regional differences in the ideological thrust of the program among the Nazi <italic>Gaue</italic>. The commitment of local NSDAP leaders appears to have been crucial to the amount of ideological content in the program in any given region, as quite possibly was the influence of traditional German engineering societies. Although the Nazis had recruited a sizable proportion of German engineers to join the NSBDT, the Speaker System demonstrates the wartime limits of National Socialist indoctrination and control. Trapped between their desire for ideological control and the pragmatic need to win the war, Todt’s engineers never fully resolved their dilemma – before being swept away in the struggle to save the Third Reich.</p>
<p>A component of Nazi ideology that has received increasing attention is ‘German Technology’ (<italic>Deutsche Technik</italic>), the construct proselytized by Fritz Todt and the Nazi Party Office for Technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009412461821">3</xref></sup> Developed by Nazi engineers Gottfried Feder and Fritz Todt, this technocratic ideology combined the socio-economic critique and aspirations of the international ‘Technocracy’ movement of the 1930s with the racist <italic>Volksgemeinschaft</italic> principles of National Socialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009412461821">4</xref></sup> As such, it was a clear expression of the ‘reactionary modernist’ element within Nazi thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009412461821">5</xref></sup> Feder, whose anti-capitalist rhetoric had influenced the early Nazi program, developed a form of <italic>völkisch</italic> technocracy in which politically committed engineers would oversee a radical industrial decentralization of German society, made possible by the application of modern technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009412461821">6</xref></sup> Todt, uncommitted to Feder’s anti-capitalist resettlement schemes, emphasized the ‘spiritual revolution’ inherent in National Socialism. For Todt, the true <italic>Volk</italic> community could be achieved only when the engineer took his place alongside the peasant and the soldier as a pillar of the national community and when the German public recognized the importance of modern technology for its well-being. Engineers would no longer be merely technical specialists, but culturally aware ‘techno-politicians’, whose ‘personal qualities’, enhanced by techno-political training, would lead to increased efficiency (<italic>Leistungsteigerung</italic>) in carrying out the Führer’s tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009412461821">7</xref></sup> The National Socialist revolution would combine man, machine and nature in a collectivist whole – indeed, Todt wished to unify technology, art and nature. For Todt, ‘the works of technology must be erected in harmony with nature’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009412461821">8</xref></sup> And this harmony would be achieved with the eye of the artist. The National Socialist conception of technology, wrote Todt, was ‘a turning away from pure materialism toward an emphasis on the creative and a close reliance on the artistic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009412461821">9</xref></sup> The best-known example was the aesthetic of the <italic>Autobahnen</italic>, with its attempt to express the German soul through an artistic synthesis of highway and landscape<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009412461821">10</xref></sup> The Autobahnen were ‘to make out of Nature and technology one perfect unit … Technology and art, nature and life’ would take on a new form, reflecting ‘the deeper and spiritual movement of the National Socialist revolution … a psychic and cultural renovation of the German citizen’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009412461821">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Todt and his Nazi engineers spread this technocratic ideology in numerous ways. First, he sought to gain control of the German engineering professions, however in a less heavy-handed fashion than his predecessor, Gottfried Feder. Feder had bungled a direct takeover of the German Engineering Association (VDI) in 1933 and, seen as too radical by Hitler and German elites, fell from grace in late 1934.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009412461821">12</xref></sup> Todt took over as head of the Office (later Central Office) for Technology within the Nazi Party structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009412461821">13</xref></sup> He also headed the National Socialist League of German Technology (NSBDT), a professional association for engineers controlled by the Nazis, with membership theoretically limited to Nazi Party members – although from 1935, members of the SS, SA, SA Reserves and National Socialist War Victims Association could join without being members of the Nazi Party.</p>
<p>Todt consciously sought to ‘coordinate’ German engineers gradually. Between 1934 and 1937, the traditional, non-Nazi engineering associations maintained a quasi-independent status in what was called the Reich Community of Technical-Scientific Labor (RTA), separate from the NSBDT. By April 1937, however, Todt and his chief deputy Karl-Otto Saur, had gained sufficient power to carry out the ‘Reordering (Neuordnung) of German Technology,’ dissolving the RTA and making the party-affiliated NSBDT the umbrella professional association for all German engineering societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009412461821">14</xref></sup> Todt told the Party Rally in September 1937 that 81,000 (37 per cent) of the 220,000 engineers in Germany were members of the NSBDT; of those NSBDT members, 27 per cent were members of the Nazi Party – 9 per cent having joined before 1933. Even after the Reordering of Technology, Todt continued to leave membership in the NSBDT voluntary, claiming that ‘two hundred thousand passive hangers-on are less important than eighty thousand active collaborators.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009412461821">15</xref></sup> The traditional engineering associations, while more closely under Nazi control – Todt became Chairman of the VDI in January 1939<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009412461821">16</xref></sup> – were not disbanded as organizations. Shortly before his sudden death in February 1942, Todt lamented what he considered the ingratitude of German professional engineering societies. ‘I have tried hard’, he wrote, ‘to preserve the technical-scientific associations and, through their gradual transfer into the NSBDT, to find another way of proceeding than that of doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc., whose earlier associations were all dissolved and replaced by purely National Socialist organized and affiliated associations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009412461821">17</xref></sup> Todt’s goal was to use the Central Office for Technology and the NSBDT to slowly push German engineers to accept his Deutsche Technik ideology, while enhancing the status and authority of engineers.</p>
<p>Beginning in June 1937 ‘techno-political’ training courses for German engineers took place at the ‘Reich Castle of Technology’, the Plassenburg in Lower Bavaria, which became the symbol of the new Nazi technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009412461821">18</xref></sup> Todt described the Plassenburg as a miniature Volk community in action, creating the future National Socialist engineer corps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009412461821">19</xref></sup> The ‘educational task’ there, Todt said, was the ‘cultivation, promotion and heightening of a National Socialist attitude’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009412461821">20</xref></sup> The four-day techno-political courses were held in a quasi-military atmosphere replete with obligatory uniforms, morning gymnastics and barrack-like sleeping quarters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009412461821">21</xref></sup> Lectures included both purely technical topics like iron smelting and zeppelin construction and ideological exposés such as ‘<italic>Weltanschauung</italic> and Technology’ or ‘Race as the Shaping Force in History’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009412461821">22</xref></sup> True to Todt’s desire to broaden the cultural-political awareness of engineers, cultural evenings on the Plassenburg included music recitals and poetry readings, where German engineers ‘were pledged to beauty and culture for the first time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009412461821">23</xref></sup> Crucial to Todt’s effort were articles in party-controlled engineering journals, particularly <italic>Deutsche Technik</italic>, the official voice of the NSBDT and the purest expression of National Socialist technical thought. Numerous minor Nazi ideologues made the case in the pages of <italic>Deutsche Technik</italic> for integrating technology into the cultural totality of the Volksgemeinschaft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009412461821">24</xref></sup> Because Todt wished not only to ‘re-educate’ engineers, but also to win over the public for his approach, Nazi propaganda showcased ‘German technology’, for example in traveling exhibits (‘Voyages of Technology’) to support plebiscites in Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009412461821">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The coming of the war, however, eroded Todt’s efforts at ideological indoctrination. On the one hand, the war accelerated the trend toward centralization of technical control and presented Nazi engineers with new opportunities for enhanced power, particularly after Todt became Minister of Armaments and Munitions in March 1940. Engineers assumed key administrative positions in Todt’s effort to organize German armaments and the regional Offices of Technology became responsible for implementing Todt’s directives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009412461821">26</xref></sup> Yet ironically, at the moment when Nazi engineers achieved their greatest political success, Todt’s technical ideology declined in importance. Time and resources had to be concentrated on the war effort. Already in 1939, the Plassenburg school had been converted to a rest and recovery home for wounded Organization Todt workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009412461821">27</xref></sup> By the autumn of 1941, Germany was facing a severe manpower shortage; virtually all men in their twenties had been conscripted already – although military conscription affected engineers less than other professions, since engineering expertise was seen as critical to arms production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009412461821">28</xref></sup> Germany was also suffering from a serious lack of engineering students, making on-going professional training of engineers working in war industries a necessity for the war effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009412461821">29</xref></sup> To make matters worse, a shortage of paper in Germany brought about wartime restrictions, which affected the publication of professional journals for engineers, including <italic>Deutsche Technik</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009412461821">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to offset the effect of these restrictions, Todt developed the Speaker System, with lectures to be given at the regional (<italic>Gau</italic>) and district levels. ‘The war situation’, wrote Todt in August 1941, <disp-quote>
<p>is the reason that the development of engineers through technical-scientific lectures must be intensified this winter. Present conditions prevent large conferences (<italic>Tagungen</italic>) with their attendant technical workshops, as has been the practice until now. Restrictions on paper and on printing facilities in general compel a reduction in professional journals. Lectures remain, therefore, the only method for the technical development of engineers. These, however, are particularly urgent in wartime. War and the war economy require retraining and adaptation for a large number of engineers engaged in new functions for which they have not always had professional experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009412461821">31</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Todt followed this announcement with another in October, arguing that a speaker program was required because ‘the more that our Reich and its political influence is expanded, the greater are the number of tasks [required of] individual engineers’. Limits on the paper supply meant that it was ‘all the more important to employ the spoken word’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009412461821">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Already in 1940, in order to prevent his rival Robert Ley and the German Labor Front (DAF) from encroaching into his sphere of techno-political education, Todt had begun centralizing engineering lectures through a catalogue published by the NSBDT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009412461821">33</xref></sup> By May 1941 the Central Office for Technology had provided a list of potential speakers to regional offices, requesting that information be provided concerning each individual’s membership in the NSBDT and the Party, his political and professional reliability, and the themes on which he was likely to speak, ‘in particular … if they are techno-politically oriented’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009412461821">34</xref></sup> In addition to assessing potential speakers in their own region, offices were asked to comment on the political beliefs and possible themes of any speakers on the list with whom they may have been familiar. In this way, Todt and the Central Office for Technology began to create a system that would serve both the war effort and be useful as an instrument of political control and indoctrination afterwards: the circular admonished that the verified speaker list ‘must be ready by the end of the war’.</p>
<p>Whether or not one was chosen to participate as a lecturer in the Speaker System depended primarily on the results of a review by the regional Office for Technology. This procedure did not always meet with the approval of regional leaders. A case in point is a letter by the head of the Office for Technology in Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt dated October 9, 1941. He questioned the necessity of detailed political review of potential speakers:<disp-quote>
<p>Too great an interest in personal data on the speaker, particularly regarding his Party …  activities, I consider unnecessary … We are much more interested in his professional knowledge and his willingness to serve. If the speaker is ‘in order’ he cannot himself say!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this regional official also conceded that lecturers who spoke on techno-political questions should be specifically selected and carry an identity card.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009412461821">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although determined in its political effort, the Central Office for Technology carried out its control process with a certain amount of discretion, as is revealed in a letter sent by the Central Office to the Office of Technology in Styria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009412461821">36</xref></sup> The letter concerns a Professor Schumann of the Munich Technical University and his inadmissibility to become a Reich Speaker; it deserves quoting at length:<disp-quote>
<p>Professor Schumann is without doubt a distinguished expert in his area of specialization, but unfortunately his political opinions cannot be judged positively. Therefore there can be no question of [Professor Schumann] as a Reich Speaker for the NSBDT. Nevertheless, we have nothing against his giving a specialized technical lecture (<italic>Fachvortrag</italic>) for your Gau once during the war. However, we ask that care be taken that political matters are not woven into this technical lecture. Should that be the case, and the opinion expressed contradicts the National Socialist interpretation, then the representative of the Gau Office for Technology should rectify this in the following discussion. In the future, we recommend that we be asked if a speaker can be approved or not in order to investigate the speaker. If a refusal is necessary, it is much easier to give the speaker reasons which do not offend him, than for us to have to give the real reasons. You yourself know that an unreliable political attitude must not always be linked with treasonous activity …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In creating the speaker lists, the Offices of Technology often camouflaged their ultimate objective of political control. The form sent out to potential speakers in the Magdeburg-Anhalt region, for example, indicated that filling out and sending back the form did not create any further obligation for the respondent: ‘We invite collaboration only with those who enjoy it’. Nevertheless, it was made clear that ‘later’ only those on the official speaker lists would be allowed to lecture before engineering associations in the NSBDT – the reason given was to prevent individuals from engaging in advertising for specific firms under the guise of giving technical lectures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009412461821">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given wartime conditions, the organization of a speaker program was not a simple task, nor were Central Office instructions always followed to the letter. As early as September 1941 the Central Office of Technology said that it had difficulty organizing the undertaking, primarily due to lack of personnel – and they were dependent on the regional offices, who themselves were short of personnel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009412461821">38</xref></sup> The head of a regional Office for Technology complained that the catalogue of speakers sent him ‘appears to be the product of pure accident’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009412461821">39</xref></sup> In November 1941 some regional offices still had not contributed to the Reich Speaker List.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009412461821">40</xref></sup> In some cases, specific professional associations in the NSBDT took initiatives which ran counter to the rigorous organization sought by the Central Office. For example, the NSBDT leadership admonished the Construction Engineers Association to stop scheduling lectures dealing with topics not strictly related to construction, such as mechanical or chemical engineering. The ‘entire uniform structure of the NSBDT would be destroyed’, they wrote, if each professional society delved into other areas of competence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009412461821">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>In February 1942 Fritz Todt was killed in an airplane crash after leaving Hitler’s wartime headquarters. Coming the morning after a confrontation between Hitler and Todt over further prosecution of the war – not the first such confrontation – Todt’s death still continues to provoke suspicion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009412461821">42</xref></sup> Todt was replaced by Albert Speer and initially the impetus to develop a politicized Speaker System continued, primarily due to the strong ideological orientation of Todt’s deputy, Karl-Otto Saur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009412461821">43</xref></sup> Under Saur’s leadership, the effort to assure the political reliability of speakers appears even to have intensified. In September 1942 the managing director of the NSBDT Construction Association complained about the six-to-eight week delays in getting approval for speaker candidates from Gau Berlin: ‘Last year, when Dr. Todt demanded the activation of speaker programs, we did not always have time to examine speakers politically’. He went on to criticize the absurdity of overlapping examination procedures for potential lecturers:<disp-quote>
<p>In addition to the political evaluation from you and a professional check through the Gau professional association, every lecture that uses slides must also have the permission of the Reich Propaganda Ministry. I believe that one takes much of the pleasure out of work for many speakers when they learn that their proposal to participate first has to be examined by three separate offices before they can be given further consideration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009412461821">44</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, anyone who spoke on military themes, construed as verging on state secrets, also had to be approved by the Ministry of Propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009412461821">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the deteriorating military situation, progress toward a fully functioning Speaker System was slow. In April 1942, Deisenroth, the Central Office of Technology official charged with overseeing the program, reported on his activities and plans for the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009412461821">46</xref></sup> Decrying the ‘heretofore lack of political interest’ of many engineers, Deisenroth acknowledged that the program was ‘still far from its goal.’ When he had begun, he had been given a rough hand-written catalogue of speakers and little else. He was updating the catalogue and classifying speakers in three categories: alphabetically, by region and by the themes on which they spoke. His aim was a ‘speaker corps’ divided into local, regional and Reich speakers, each with his own identity card indicating whether he lectured on purely technical, techno-political, techno-historical, techno-military or techno-economic topics.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1942, however, neither the Central Office for Technology nor the NSBDT had the personnel or administrative structure to develop a full Speaker System under wartime conditions. Consequently, the German Engineering Association (VDI) was given temporary charge of continued professional development (<italic>Fortbildung</italic>) for engineers. Yet the NSBDT remained ‘absolutely responsible’ for the program with a view toward their future role: ‘As soon as the NSBDT has developed its personnel and organization to the point that it can undertake further responsibilities, we think it appropriate that the NSBDT more tightly control the speaker program’, wrote Deisenroth. The goal was a reconstructed Speaker System under direct NSBDT administration. He questioned if that could happen during the war, but nevertheless ‘the totalitarian demands (<italic>Totalitätsanspruch</italic>) and authority of the NSDAP, and with it the NSBDT, make it absolutely necessary that this goal be sought’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009412461821">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>In effect, Deisenroth desired full Nazi Party control of techno-political education for engineers – in line with the technocratic assumptions underlying Fritz Todt’s ideology. Like Todt, he saw techno-political education as developing the ‘personal leadership qualities’ of engineers as they took on a National Socialist attitude. The Speaker System would breed ‘a certain political or techno-political way of thought’ among technicians, who were so often are accused of lacking one. By overcoming political indifference among engineers ‘technology [can] obtain the place which it deserves in the life of the <italic>Volk</italic> – and that is the leading place’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009412461821">48</xref></sup> Clearly Deisenroth and Nazi engineers in the Central Office for Technology, bolstered by their increased influence in wartime, foresaw a major voice for engineers in post-war Germany.</p>
<p>Evidence of this is a plan for a ‘Higher Office for Technology and Economics’, with vast technocratic authority, which was drawn up in the spring of 1941 and signed by Saur, although Hitler was probably not informed of it until late in the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009412461821">49</xref></sup> It was among several such plans developed by the Nazi engineers. Under this Higher Office would be Central Offices for General Administration, Technology, Leadership Activities (<italic>Führungsaufgaben</italic>) and Economics. The Technology Office in turn would be subdivided into the same engineering divisions as the NSBDT: Mechanical Engineering, Energy, Mining and Metallurgy, Chemicals and Construction. The Leadership Activities Office had bureaus for the techno-political press, for techno-political education in technical schools and universities, for the so-called Houses of German Technology and for the Plassenburg. The director of the Higher Office for Technology and Economics, directly responsible to the Führer, would oversee management not only of German technology, but of the economy as a whole, including the construction of new factories and energy facilities. The plan was a direct outgrowth of the authority that Todt had accumulated in the war and demonstrates the immense technocratic ambition of Nazi engineers. Indeed, Todt had planned to head a powerful Ministry of Technology after the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009412461821">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>The realities of war intervened, however, accelerated by Albert Speer’s desire for efficiency and his indifference to the ideological orientation that had been taken by Fritz Todt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009412461821">51</xref></sup> In July 1942 Speer began the process of decentralizing the program by shifting the responsibility of advertising and coordinating lectures to the regions. By November 1942 certain regions were ‘lagging behind’ with their lecture programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009412461821">52</xref></sup> By the winter, programs were being curtailed by the war. Schleswig-Holstein, Weser-Ems and Danzig-West Prussia were among the regions where night bombing raids were inhibiting the program. The Office for Technology in Danzig attributed declining attendance at lectures to three factors: too many lectures were offered, general demands on NSBDT engineers had grown, and police regulations required lectures to begin at seven o’clock due to the danger of night bombing – leaving no time for ‘a warm meal at home or in a restaurant’ between work and the lectures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009412461821">53</xref></sup> Schleswig-Holstein reported that engineers were ‘tired’ of the program. They were professionally ‘overloaded’ and faced with ‘greatly reduced transportation possibilities’, especially with the menace of evening bombing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009412461821">54</xref></sup> In Weser-Ems not only the danger of bombing, but also the reticence of individual engineering associations, inhibited planning for lectures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009412461821">55</xref></sup> Wartheland complained that overworked engineers had little interest in specialized technical lectures, causing attendance to fall off to 30 or 40 participants, and hence planned only two lectures per month on general themes in 1943.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009412461821">56</xref></sup> By the beginning of 1943, the Bayreuth region could only plan speakers for the first quarter of the year because ‘so many factors dependant on the war’ caused plans to change from day to day; the same was true in Danzig, where it was very difficult to get commitments from speakers beyond March 1943.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009412461821">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>The slow breakdown in transportation led several regions to further decentralize the program, holding fewer lectures in the cities and using local speakers. In such cases it was often necessary to schedule lectures with broad themes in order to bolster attendance from among the smaller number of engineers in the local area. A case in point is South Westphalia, where lectures were expanded to the smaller cities to overcome the ‘extraordinarily difficult transportation situation’. The head of the Office for Technology there called for presentations that ‘deal with technology from a general point of view or in a unified or popular fashion (<italic>volkstümlich behandeln</italic>)’, adding that such lectures were important ‘to educate wider circles to the meaning of technology for our entire life and production’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009412461821">58</xref></sup> In March 1943 the East Prussian NSBDT said that engineers were too overloaded to engage in the program and that VDI lectures were ‘mostly badly attended’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009412461821">59</xref></sup> The same month, the NSBDT office in Dortmund informed its members that ‘unforeseeable events’ could lead to the cancellation of lectures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009412461821">60</xref></sup> (It was a prescient notification, as two months later Dortmund suffered the largest bombing attack of the war to date.)</p>
<p>In February 1943, after Stalingrad, Albert Speer halted the publication of a number of technical-scientific journals, including <italic>Deutsche Technik</italic>, and insisted that engineering associations be ‘geared exclusively to the demands made by the war’. He proposed that lectures on the regional and local levels be intensified – but he emphasized purely technical lectures needed for the war effort, with no mention of techno-political indoctrination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009412461821">61</xref></sup> Finally, in June 1943, Saur ended work on the central catalogue of speakers, effectively killing the Speaker System at the national level. The remnants of the program were transferred entirely to the regions and to the regional engineering associations. Indeed, it was not only the Speaker System that was curtailed at this point, but virtually all activities of the Central Office for Technology: a skeleton six-person staff was kept to manage four bureaux on professional leadership activities, professional questions, technical science and finance/management, with the rest of the personnel released for military service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009412461821">62</xref></sup> Todt’s Deutsche Technik ideology, and the Nazi Party office that propagated it, had been submerged by the war.</p>
<p>Throughout the period of its existence, the ideological content of the Speaker System depended greatly on the attitude of the regional or local NSDAP leadership. Just how different that initiative might be is clear from a listing of all regional lectures given as part of the Speaker System in the period October 1941 to June 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009412461821">63</xref></sup> Divided into separate lists for October through December 1941 and January through June 1942, they provide insight into the degree to which the Speaker System was ideological and how it varied from one region to the other.</p>
<p>A word of caution is necessary. The Central Office for Technology and the NSBDT referred to lectures which combined technical training with political indoctrination as ‘techno-political’. Such lectures usually dealt with ideological themes that either presented National Socialist ideology in its widest sense (examples are ‘The Formation of a New German <italic>Volks</italic>-soil in the North-East of the Reich’; ‘The Economic and Political Re-Ordering of Europe’; ‘Technology and Economics in the East’; ‘The Task of German Economics and Technology in South-East Europe’; and ‘The Buildings of the Führer’), or they expressed a specific aspect of Fritz Todt’s ‘German Technology’ approach (‘The Role of the Engineer in the Volk’; ‘Weltanschauung and Research’; ‘The Task of Engineers in the Four Year Plan’; ‘The Autobahn as Artistic Creation’; ‘The Engineer and the Art of Public Speaking’; ‘Culture and Technology’; ‘Techno-Political Indoctrination’). Other techno-political lectures mirrored Todt’s concern with increasing efficiency (<italic>Leistungssteigerung</italic>) through political education or his interest in energy and construction policy. An example of how overtly ideological a techno-political lecture could be is one given in Gau Franken by Werner Daitz, Nazi <italic>Grossraumwirtschaft</italic> theoretician, who spoke on ‘Europe’s New Economic and Political Order’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009412461821">64</xref></sup> Themes covered in Daitz’s lecture, given to 300 engineers on April 16, 1942, included ‘freemasonry and Judaism as opponents of the New Order; the significance of racist foundations for nations [<italic>Völker</italic>]; the political machinations [<italic>Ränke</italic>] of England in the history of nations; the implications of Europe’s New Order’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009412461821">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>In its central catalogue of speakers (discussed later), the NSDBT explicitly indicated which individuals spoke on techno-political themes, so it is relatively easy to determine the extent to which the Reich Speaker List reflects an effort to spread Nazi ideology. In the regional monthly programs, however, only the titles of lectures are given. Without actually seeing the content of the lectures, the researcher can only assume that certain lectures, such as those listed above, were ideological in character. Some themes – ‘Nature as a Model for Technology’, for example – are ambiguous and thus cannot be included as specifically ideological. In addition, it is important to distinguish between lectures with purely war-related, military content (‘The Role of Technology in Total War’; ‘English Sea Power in the Struggle Against the European Continent’; or ‘The Technical Construction of the Maginot Line and its Conquest’), which we can consider legitimate war propaganda by an active belligerent, and those which treat engineers and technology in a specifically National Socialist context. For example ‘The Engineer and Architect in a Responsible Role in the Fateful Struggle of the German Volk’ can be considered ideological because of its insistence on a quasi-technocratic position for German engineers, a key theme in Nazi technical thought.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>In the following discussion every effort has been made to eliminate ambiguity in order that we may assume that those lectures cited as techno-political are indeed ideological in character. Such appears to be the way that the National Socialists themselves defined the term. Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt, for example, distinguished between ‘technical speakers’ (<italic>Fachredner</italic>) and ‘techno-political educational speakers’ (<italic>technopolitischen Schulungsredner</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009412461821">66</xref></sup> Nevertheless, at least one region, South Westphalia, distinguished between ‘techno-political’ lectures and ‘<italic>weltanschaulichen</italic> lectures’, the latter being ‘left to the political organizations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009412461821">67</xref></sup> Although this appears to be an anomaly, it is enough to caution us that, in the absence of more precise information on the exact content of techno-political lectures, our conclusions must be considered tentative.</p>
<p>A first impression from the lists of regional lectures, here based also on specific regional speaker programs lasting through 1942, is that this effort in wartime technical training was often surprisingly intensive. For example, at the ‘House of Technology’ in Essen (founded by Karl-Otto Saur), from October to December 1941, 39 lectures were given covering a whole range of engineering topics and this does not include full-scale training courses on topics like the use of gas in industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009412461821">68</xref></sup> At the highpoint of the program, January to June 1942, nearly 500 lectures were given in both Berlin and in the Essen region, 457 in the Westmark and over 500 in Saxony, to name the most active regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009412461821">69</xref></sup> Despite deteriorating wartime conditions, 60 lectures were given in the Madgeburg-Anhalt region in the three-month period, October to December 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009412461821">70</xref></sup> Obviously, the Nazi engineers considered the Speaker System an important element in the war effort.</p>
<p>The second impression created by the lists of regional lectures is that, taken as a whole, the Speaker Program was not particularly ideological. In the period between October and December 1941, only 5.8 per cent of all lectures given throughout Germany can be considered ‘techno-political’ – that is, ideological – in orientation. From January to June 1942 – the highpoint of the program – this percentage increased to 9.7 per cent. Overall, in the first nine months of the program, from October 1941 through June 1942, only 8.7 per cent of the lectures given were primarily ideological in character. This low percentage can be interpreted in differing ways. Since the Nazis were obsessed with controlling discourse, it may well be that few competent engineers met the Party standard for presenting ideological lectures. More likely it demonstrates that the use of the Speaker System for ideological indoctrination was secondary to the need for technical training to assist the war effort (see above, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022009412461821">Table 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0022009412461821" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pattern of Ideological Content in the Speaker System by Gau, October 1941–June 1942.</p>
<p><italic>Source:</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zonu.com/fullsize-en/2011-05-2713793/Administrative-districts-in-territories-under-the-control-of-Nazi-Germany-in-1941.html">http://www.zonu.com/fullsize-en/2011-05-2713793/Administrative-districts-in-territories-under-the-control-of-Nazi-Germany-in-1941.html.</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009412461821-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The great majority of lectures were overwhelmingly technical in character. To take but one small example, in October 1941, when the Speaker System was being put into place, only two of twelve lectures at the House of Technology in Essen were ideological: ‘England and the Founding of the German Reich’ and ‘Fateful Shaping Forces (<italic>Gestaltungskräfte</italic>) in the Life of Peoples (<italic>Völker</italic>).’ The other, non-ideological lectures included ‘Modern Telegraphy’; ‘Light and Electro-technology’; ‘New Experiences with the Reprocessing of Used Sand’ and ‘Flame Cutting with Coal Gas and Oxygen.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009412461821">71</xref></sup> By October of the following year, there were only five lectures and all were technical: ‘X-Ray Analysis of Chemical Bonding’; ‘The Practice of Small Bessemer Processing’; ‘Metal Materials in Metallurgical Machine Companies’; ‘Large Mining Operations in Steep Locations with Difficult Seam and Rock Conditions’; ‘The Status of Mining in the General Government’ (which verges on the ideological), in addition to conferences on ‘Saving Energy in Industry’ and ‘Rationalization in Welding Operations’ and a course on ‘The Broad Outlines of Technical Thermodynamics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009412461821">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>These patterns in the Speaker System of 1941–2 are also evident in a catalog of lecturers who had been examined and approved to speak at the regional level by December 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009412461821">73</xref></sup> A partial listing of approved speakers throughout Germany, it shows only the first 17 regions listed alphabetically (plus the <italic>Auslandsorganization</italic>). Of 553 regional speakers, 29, or 5.2 per cent, spoke on topics which can be described as techno-political – again a low percentage. Eastern Bavaria (22 per cent) was the most ideological; other regions with a relatively high percentage of techno-political speakers were Danzig-West Prussia (17 per cent) and the Mark-Brandenburg (12 per cent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009412461821">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>These low percentages of ideological content expose the dilemma faced by Nazi functionaries in trying to meet the need to train engineers for the war, yet also further their ideological agenda. This tension is illustrated by Todt’s plan for speakers in the newly conquered territories. In October 1940, well before he initiated the Speaker System throughout the entire Reich, Todt had urged newly acquired regions to develop speaker lists and speaker programs. For Todt, the Offices for Technology had to ‘start from scratch’ in the new territories in East and West – where ‘nothing is yet politically organized.’ The Central Office for Technology in Munich would help procure speakers. Yet true to his ideological orientation, Todt cautioned that ‘a great many politically responsible leaders’ did not recognize that holding good technical lectures was only a part of the task that lecture programs were to fulfill. ‘The fact that technology is a cultural achievement and that the engineer is a cultural representative (<italic>Kulturträger</italic>)’, wrote Todt, ‘obliges us to come forward once a year with a presentation in which the Gau Office for Technology appears not only as representing technical concerns, but is also an important political and cultural factor in the Gau’. A solution was urgent he said, and despite the difficulties created by the war, ‘under no circumstances may it be postponed to some future time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009412461821">75</xref></sup> Todt’s call for a single ‘techno-political’ lecture per year can hardly be termed an aggressive ideological initiative! Nevertheless, he saw the new regions within the context of his overall ideological approach and was unwilling to set aside completely his Deutsche Technik vision.</p>
<p>A third observation is that the extent of ideological content within the Speaker System varied dramatically among the regions. During the initial stages of its development in 1941 nearly a quarter of the lectures in Schleswig-Holstein were techno-political as were more than 14 per cent of the lectures in eight other regions. However, during the same time frame, October–December 1941, nine regions had no techno-political lectures whatsoever, including not a single one among 254 given in Berlin. When the overall number of techno-political lectures increased to nearly one in ten during the winter and spring of 1942, the wide differences between regions continued. Moselland had nearly one-third techno-political lectures, Sudetenland and Carinthia had more than 28 per cent and five other regions were over 20 per cent. Yet none of the lectures in Mecklenburg, the Upper Danube or Styria were techno-political, 13 other regions were under 5 per cent and only three of nearly 500 lectures in Berlin were ideologically oriented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009412461821">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wide regional variation in ideological content in the Speaker System is due to a multitude of factors and we can only offer tentative suggestions as to what they may have been. Chief among them was probably the ideological commitment of regional Party and NSBDT officials. As a report from East Bavaria put it, success of the Speaker System depended on ‘the initiative of the individual [Office for Technology] director and upon his influence on local agencies and offices, as well as upon the Party itself.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009412461821">77</xref></sup> It remains to be proven, but it would be logical that the most activist Offices of Technology and NSBDT chapters also had the most techno-political lectures. As historical studies of the Nazi regions emerge, the importance of the personal strengths and weaknesses of local leaders continues to be emphasized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009412461821">78</xref></sup> The ‘patchwork’ pattern of Nazi indoctrination evident in the Speaker System would lend support to those historians who have argued that a ‘Gau particularism’ arose in the war years (see Figure 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009412461821">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another possible reason for regional variation may well have been the influence of traditional engineering societies, like the VDI. In the urban centers, where the traditional engineering societies were the strongest, the lectures tended to be less ideological. Throughout the nine-month period from October 1941 to June 1942 only three of the 753 lectures given in Berlin were techno-political, as were only five of 142 lectures in Hamburg and four of 213 in Cologne-Aachen. Other regions with many total lectures, but with little ideological content, were often in urbanized western Germany, for example Essen, with only 3.6 per cent of 553 lectures and the Westmark, with 4.8 per cent of 457 lectures. The influence of the VDI and other traditional engineering associations on the content of lectures should not be minimized: their outlook was more purely technical than that of the NSDAP offices and the NSBDT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009412461821">80</xref></sup> And, as we have seen, from April 1942 the VDI had been given considerable authority over the re-training of engineers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009412461821">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Reich Speaker List for the whole of Germany was completed, probably in late 1942, it contained 202 names, replete with a notation for most on the individual’s political reliability, on his technical competence and on the topics on which he was prepared to speak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009412461821">82</xref></sup> Eight were considered unfit as Reich Speakers, for reasons ranging from previous studies under Jewish professors or relations with Jews to lack of speaking ability. Thirty-one, or nearly 15 per cent, were prepared to speak on techno-political themes. Of these, virtually all were Party and/or NSBDT members – reflecting the Central Office insistence on ideological control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009412461821">83</xref></sup> The Reich Speaker List was thus more ideological in character than the totality of actual lectures given in the regions, where many of the experts for purely technical presentations were drawn from among local engineers. In addition, Reich Speakers with techno-political themes often repeated their lectures during a given month, whereas purely technical lectures were usually given but once.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009412461821">84</xref></sup> As a consequence, although relatively few in number, techno-political Reich Speakers could have a disproportionately strong influence on regional lecture programs. A good example is in Magdeburg-Anhalt, where of the 60 lectures given from October to December 1942, nine lectures can be considered ideological in character and seven of the nine consist of two lectures sponsored by the NSBDT and repeated multiple times: ‘The Development of Technology as a political Mission [Aufgabe]’, given three times, and ‘Germany’s Mission in the East’, given four times – by the infamous <italic>Gauleiter</italic> of the Wartheland, Arthur Geiser, who was executed for war crimes in 1946.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009412461821">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of particular significance is the political make-up of the Reich Speaker List. Of the 202 individuals, only half (102) were members of the Nazi Party and 127 (63 per cent) were NSBDT members. In addition, 15 per cent of the Party members on the Reich Speaker List had not joined the NSBDT, while nearly one quarter of the NSBDT members were not members of the Nazi Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009412461821">86</xref></sup> Given the fact that adhesion to the Party had been severely restricted in 1934–6, 1938, and from 1942, the percentage of Party members is not too surprising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009412461821">87</xref></sup> The NSBDT membership level, however, seems low for a list of individuals who had been thoroughly vetted and granted permission to speak throughout the Reich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009412461821">88</xref></sup> This may be evidence that the Nazi Party was not overly concerned with the political reliability of engineers, if they were not speaking on a techno-political theme – a plausible explanation, given the readiness of engineers to serve the war effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009412461821">89</xref></sup> That a third of the Reich Speakers were not in the NSBDT strongly suggests that the urgent need for technical training overshadowed the need to ensure absolute political loyalty among those whom spoke on non-ideological topics. In any case, it is evident that an engineer was not forced to join the Party or be an NSBDT member to actively participate in the wartime Speaker System, even as a Reich Speaker. Because the regime sought pragmatic solutions to technical problems, active Nazi affiliation assumed secondary importance. As Konrad Jarausch has noted, ‘The demands of war put priority on apolitical problem solving.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009412461821">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limited political commitment shown in the Reich Speaker list also reflects the frustration of Party officials with what they perceived as political indifference on the part of engineers, as is evident in repeated complaints about recruitment to the NSBDT. At the ‘House of Technology’ in Frankfurt am Main, between January 1 and July 31 1942, 82 presentations were made to a total of 12,240 participants, of whom well over half (6812) were <italic>not</italic> members of the NSBDT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009412461821">91</xref></sup> The head of the Office for Technology there openly admitted a problem with recruitment, but claimed that since the founding of the House of Technology in August 1941 the number of new NSBDT members was on the rise. The Office for Technology in the Gau Wartheland was proud that its recruitment efforts had led to 63 per cent of the engineers in the Gau joining the NSBDT – which it said rivaled the 64 per cent membership level in the ‘Old Reich.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009412461821">92</xref></sup> In Gau Upper Bavaria, only 444 of 2357 engineers joined the NSBDT – this at a time when membership in the traditional engineering associations like the VDI was increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009412461821">93</xref></sup> In Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt, the NSBDT counted 3400 regular members in October 1942, which represented approximately 20–30 per cent of the engineers, chemists and technicians in the region; the Office for Technology estimated that there were still 8–10,000 engineers to recruit. ‘Therefore join the NSBDT!', it pleaded. ‘Bring suggestions! Expose techno-political problems. Do not limit yourselves simply to observing, but help in solving these problems, so that at last the genuine engineering mentality makes itself felt … where until now non-technicians have had the decisive word’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009412461821">94</xref></sup> The technocratic impulse remained an important motivating force among Nazi engineers, but the wartime response was limited.</p>
<p>We should not conclude, however, simply because the Speaker System was relatively non-ideological and recruitment to the NSBDT a continuing Party concern, that engineers were unaffected by Nazi propaganda. When Todt ‘re-ordered’ the engineering associations under the NSBDT in 1937, 81,000 (37 per cent) of the 220,000 engineers in Germany were members of the NSBDT – up from 33,000 in 1934.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009412461821">95</xref></sup> By September 1942, according to the Office of Technology in the Wartheland, NSBDT membership in the ‘Old Reich’ had grown to 64 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009412461821">96</xref></sup> We must be cautious with the Wartheland document: although they played little role in the NSBDT, architects are listed among potential adherents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009412461821">97</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this is still is a substantial figure and represents a significant increase in NSBDT membership since 1937. It is, for example, double the percentage of doctors who engaged in a similar way. According to Michael Kater’s calculations, 31 per cent of all German doctors joined the Nazi Physicians’ League, which, with its combination of professional and ideological activities and its quasi-military Leadership School at Alt-Rehse, resembled the NSBDT in many ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009412461821">98</xref></sup> The Wartheland document is but one source and further research is required.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009412461821">99</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if indeed nearly two-thirds of the engineers in the Old Reich joined the NSBDT, it means that they were more politically engaged than is often argued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009412461821">100</xref></sup> Although a substantial number of engineers remained aloof from Nazi affiliation, as the Speaker System shows, the view that ‘engineers were remarkably immune to the Nazis’ beckoning’ may require serious revision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0022009412461821">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>What lessons can we learn from the Nazi Speaker System? The Nazi Speaker System demonstrates a steadily declining, although not totally extinguished, effort to spread Fritz Todt’s ideology. The clear intention of Todt and the National Socialists was to establish tighter ideological control over the German engineering societies in a victorious post-war Greater Germany. This control was directly linked to Todt’s Deutsche Technik ideology, with its emphasis on incorporating politically sensitized engineers into the Volksgemeinschaft, on educating the public in the advantages of modern technology and on creating a collectivist harmony of man, machine and nature. Technology was considered crucial for the evolution of Nazi society and for the post-war economy, with engineers to assume a decisive leadership position.</p>
<p>However, lists of lectures given under the Speaker System, as well as the Reich Speaker List, show that the main emphasis of the program was technical training for engineers, over and above ideological indoctrination. Despite the important role played by engineers in Todt’s Armament Ministry, the war hampered any real progress in mobilizing the mass of engineers for Todt’s ideological goals. Speer’s conscious shift away from Todt’s technocratic ideology and his pursuit of a ‘total war’ effort put an effective end to the program.</p>
<p>The amount of ideology in lectures varied widely between regions. The commitment of local NSDAP leaders, and possibly the local influence of the traditional engineering societies, appear to have been crucial to the amount of ideological content in the program. As a consequence, a ‘patch-work’ pattern developed, ranging from no ideological lectures in a region to as many as 30 per cent in another. This suggests that the overriding factor in determining the ideological content of the program was the commitment of the regional and local Offices of Technology and NSBDT chapters, and it opens the perspective for further research on comparative ideological activism among the Nazi Gaue.</p>
<p>The Speaker System also shows that, while the bureaucratic requirements to review potential speakers for their political opinions hampered the program, one did not need to be a Nazi Party member or have joined the NSBDT to serve as a lecturer, even as a Reich Speaker. Fully half of the Reich Speakers were not Nazi Party members. Although Todt and his associates managed to recruit many German engineers to the NSBDT – perhaps as many as two-thirds – a significant minority of engineers did not join. As the urgency to train engineers took precedence, the Central Office for Technology was willing to use engineers without Nazi affiliation as speakers, providing they did not speak on ideological topics.</p>
<p>The demise of the Speaker System raises questions as to the place of Todt’s ’German Technology’ in the constellation of concepts we call Nazi ideology. As the war turned more and more against Germany, the regime embarked on a path of ‘fanatical utilitarianism’, whereby non-essential components of Nazi ideology, such as ‘German physics’ (<italic>Deutsche Physik</italic>), were jettisoned in favor of traditional science and technology, while at the same time, the brutal, racist essence of Nazism found expression in the ‘war against the Jews’ and Goebbels’ frantic defense of the Volksgemeinschaft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0022009412461821">102</xref></sup> The fact that the Nazi Speaker System was essentially non-ideological suggests that Todt’s Deutsche Technik, while the quintessential expression of Nazi technical thought, was nevertheless a ‘satellite’ element within Nazi ideology. Todt’s vision of a harmonious, technocratic national community lost its ideological importance as the regime sought to train technicians for the battle against its enemies, be they Allied armies or ‘community aliens.’ Deutsche Technik was subordinate to the core Nazi goals: conquest of <italic>Lebensraum</italic> and destruction of the Jews.</p>
<p>The Speaker System was born out of wartime necessity; it failed due to deteriorating wartime conditions. But it also failed because Todt’s engineers were unable to be completely pragmatic, to shake off their inherent authoritarian impulse to establish ideological control. Nazi engineers were caught between two conflicting demands. On the one hand, they needed to find a way to quickly overcome wartime restrictions and train engineers to be as efficient as possible in fighting the war – a reflection of the regime’s shift to technological pragmatism. On the other hand, their penchant to seek ever greater control over German engineers, their desire to maintain at least a modicum of ideological momentum and their post-war ambitions hampered the development of an effective Speaker System until the ‘total war’ engulfed it.</p>
