<p><bold>Communications from BAUS</bold></p>
<p>We keep in touch with our Members through regular President’s Newsletters, E-Updates and emails to Section Members. If you have not been receiving these please contact the BAUS Office (<email>membership@baus.org.uk</email>) to check we have the correct email address for you.</p>
<p><bold>BAUS website</bold></p>
<p>We would also encourage you to log onto the BAUS website for up-to-date information about BAUS, the specialty of urology and information for patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baus.org.uk">www.baus.org.uk</ext-link>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p><bold>FROM THE PRESIDENT, Adrian D Joyce:</bold></p>
<p>My February Newsletter (emailed to BAUS members on Friday 8 February) set out two of the most important challenges facing our specialty at the beginning of 2013 – namely the question of specialist commissioning in urology and the announcement, before Christmas, of the planned publication of individual surgeons outcome results for operative procedures (for surgeons based in England).</p>
<p><bold>1 Individual Surgical Outcomes:</bold></p>
<p>In early December 2012 Sir Bruce Keogh (Medical Director of the NHS in England) announced plans to publish individual surgeons’ results within two years as he believes this will force clinicians to focus on their performance and seek help when surgical practice falls below acceptable standards.</p>
<p>However following a meeting held at the RCS England on Monday 4 February the announced date for publication of such data was June 2013. The decision is that the Specialty Associations and surgeons have to recognize that the discussion as to “why” is over and the real debate now is to “how”.</p>
<p>The announcement is that our data as surgeons will be out there in the public domain from June and it forces us, both as a Specialty Association and as Urologists, to recognise that if our results are going to be out in the public domain, we need to concentrate on ensuring the accuracy of the data and setting the parameters for variation.</p>
<p>The decision has been not to use HES, which would seem the logical approach, but due to concerns relating to HES accuracy and buy-in by clinicians, the decision has been to use the national audit databases via the Specialty Associations. In our case this is the Nuvola system - managed by Sarah Fowler. The aim is to include both NHS and private practice activity and the process is such that individual (rather than unit) data will be public. Therefore there is a need for us (BAUS) to agree on the following principles:</p>
<list id="list1-2051415813481289" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Define the outcomes for the procedure in question</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Agree and set standards for performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Define acceptable and unacceptable variation, adjusted according to – casemix, calibrate for contemporary practice and publish using funnel plot methodology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Validation of data prior to publication</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Validation of the data prior to publication is crucial. The suggested process for identifying outliers is that the individual will be notified in the first instance but, if this fails to draw a response, the Specialty Association President will be involved prior to notification of the individual’s Trust medical director. However the exact process in relation to BAUS is yet to be officially determined.</p>
<p>The planned proposal is that the data, when ready, will be uploaded by BAUS to HQIP who will work with a unit at Imperial College to undertake the statistical analysis and ensure uniformity and consistency of the platform on which the data will be published on the HQIP website for public consumption. The message to us was that there is no negotiation on the timeline.</p>
<p>The levers that will be applied to clinicians to ensure the success of this process will be the new revalidation process, entrance to the CEA award system and contracts through local commissioning.</p>
<p>Following brief discussions it has been proposed that the following datasets could be the ones to go live from June 2013, however these need to be ratified with HQIP:</p>
<list id="list2-2051415813481289" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Nephrectomy audit</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Audit on Urethral Surgery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>RPLND (TBC)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We are now looking at how we can achieve this in such a short space of time. We need to aim to achieve 90% compliance by June 2013. However, we are currently seeking clarification over key issues with HQIP and we will report back to you as soon as possible. I recognise that this will not cover all urologists from June 2013 but this should reflect a reasonable start to the process.</p>
<p><bold>Action by you</bold>:</p>
<p>This means that all those individuals undertaking these procedures will need to retrospectively enter all patients undergoing such surgery in 2012. However all Urologists should undertake updating their 2012 data into the audits as it is likely that further audits will come on-line in due course.</p>
<p>Further information about each of the audits, including a full copy of the datasets, are available on the section pages of the BAUS Website:</p>
<p>Nephrectomy (proforma listed under the complex operations datasets)</p>
<p>Urethroplasty</p>
<p>RPLND</p>

<p><bold>2 Specialist Commissioning in Urology:</bold></p>
<p>Following on from the adverts to appoint a chair and members for the Specialist Commissioning Group (CRG) in Urology, the concern was that this appeared to have only an oncology remit (particularly penile and testis cancer). Many members have raised concerns in respect of the non-oncological aspects of urological practice, which are already being raised by local commissioners with regard to restricting availability of services. I have therefore written to Mr James Palmer (Clinical Director Specialised Services, NHS Commissioning Board) making the following points:</p>
<list id="list3-2051415813481289" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>In relation to the recent service specifications for specialist commissioning of complex gynaecology, BAUS has significant concerns that the existing CRG has not engaged with urologists in drawing up the service specifications and consequently they have not fully appreciated the role of the urologist in the management of patients with these complex conditions</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>In the United Kingdom, BAUS, through the SFNUU, have identified a network of specialist centres, which are multidisciplinary in nature involving urologists, urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons. We strongly support the concept of complex female urology being undertaken in centres with regular MDTs, a network of specialists and regular audit of outcomes</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Other areas which we feel need specific commissioning guidance include</italic>:</p>
<list id="list4-2051415813481289" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>the management of sling erosions where urethral repair is exclusively performed by urologists</italic>,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Neurological incontinence where urologists treat the majority of patients, including women</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The role of Sacral neuromodulation</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Treatment for the overactive bladder with BOTOX</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Complex and redo stress incontinence surgery</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The implantation of devices such the artificial urinary sphincter and penile prostheses</italic></p></list-item></list></list-item>
</list>
<p>Subsequent to this a meeting was held at the RCS England on Tuesday 5 February the principal part of which was a presentation by James Palmer. Mark Speakman attended for BAUS and he reported the following:-</p>
<p>Specialised commissioning, which previously had 10 specialised commissioning groups, will now be replaced by a single operating model overseen by a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) which is the group that sets the prescribed services within each Clinical Reference Group (CRG). The underlying principle is that <italic>“all patients requiring treatment from a specialised service are to have access to the same standard of service and the same clinical policy wherever they live”.</italic></p>
<p>The Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs) have been increased from 67 in 2012 to 75 now - including a Specialised Urology CRG. The 75 CRGS with their chairman are on:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/files/2013/01/crg-chairs.pdf">http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/files/2013/01/crg-chairs.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>The full membership of all the CRGs should be available on the Commissioning Board website by the end of February.</p>
<p>Each CRG will have a member from each geographical senate area (14 members) and will now have 4 members from Affiliated Organisations – those with a lead function in education and professional leadership (e.g. the speciality associations like BAUS). When lay and other members have been included each CRG can have up to 27 members!</p>
<p>BAUS can apply for an Affiliated voting membership of a CRG or for different levels of Stakeholder involvement ranging from simply receiving minutes etc. to submitting recommendations to the CRG but Stakeholder involvement does not provide voting power on the CRG.</p>
<p>Although the final brief for each CRG may still change; the prescribed elements in them for the coming year have largely been decided. For example, the Specialised Urology CRG is placed in the ‘Blood and Cancer’ domain and includes penile and testicular cancer. The CRG will however have the ability over the coming year to advise the CAG to change its brief over the following year.</p>
<p>Of the 75 CRGs at least 5-6 have a major urological interest for which we should consider Affiliate membership and another 15 where having a more limited urological Stakeholder involvement would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Examples of CRGs with potential urological input with their current CRG chairmen are:-</p>
<p>A6 Renal Dialysis; Chas Newstead (Leeds), A7 Renal Transplant; Keith Rigg (Nottingham) and A8 Specialised Colorectal Surgery; Mark Chapman (Birmingham)</p>
<p>B14 Specialised Urology, which will have a urological chair</p>
<p>C5 Gender Identity Service; Vacant</p>
<p>D4 Neurosciences (incl. MS); Graham Venables (Sheffield), D8 Specialised Pain Andrew Baranowski (UCLH) and D13 Spinal Cord Injury Charles Greenough (Middlesbrough)</p>
<p>E2 Paediatric Surgery; Julian Roberts (Sheffield) and E10 Complex Gynaecological Services CRG chaired by Anthony Smith (Manchester)</p>
<p>There is a guide to CRGs, aimed primarily at clinical staff on the website:-</p>
