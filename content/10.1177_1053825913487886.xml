<abstract>
<p>This study focused on the mediating effect of two adventure programs emphasizing relationship establishment between youth on the relationship between family styles and levels of intrinsic motivation. Family style is defined as the levels of caring and discipline family members give to their children. Because of its connection to interest, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, family style is considered as a variable impacting on levels of motivation participating in experiential-based programs. Findings indicated that during the overall adventure experiences, the high support and high challenge (HSHC) family group showed an enhanced level of relatedness than the low support and low challenge (LSLC) group. In addition, pairwise comparisons indicated differences in competence and relatedness between the HSHC and the LSLC groups in the pretest, but were no longer significant at the posttest. The paired <italic>t</italic> tests showed that the LSLC group improved on interest, competence, and relatedness throughout the adventure experiences. The findings indicated that the adventure programs offer an environment, which enhance youth participants’ perceived interest and psychological needs, especially for youth from the LSLC group.</p>

<p>Scholars have investigated a number of different variables through which adventure programs produce specific outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487886">Hattie, Marsh, Neill, &amp; Richards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, Paisley, &amp; Gookin, 2007</xref>). A participant’s motivation, behavior, and outcomes depend on not only the characteristics of a program but also on antecedent variables such as personal characteristics, experiences, and family backgrounds. The main focus of this study is to examine family style and its association with perceived psychological needs and interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002</xref>) before and after participating in adventure programs.</p>
<p>Previous studies indicate that children reared in families providing both a high level of warmth and reasonable levels of discipline obtain more flow experiences during productive activities, such as schooling and organized recreation activities than peers from families with low levels of support and challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487886">Csikszentmihalyi, Rathunde, &amp; Whalen, 1993</xref>). This suggests that family styles can play an important role in motivating individuals to engage in activities beneficial to their development, particularly in their performances and attitudes toward learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487886">Hektner (2001)</xref> suggested there are a number of variables that can play important roles toward the development of youth’s motivational orientation, such as school and family styles. Previous studies have shown that adventure programs can provide a context for fulfilling psychological needs and further empower participants to exercise or expand their competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487886">Hill &amp; Sibthorp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, Paisley, Gookin, &amp; Furman, 2008</xref>). This study investigates the relationship between the contexts of family styles and adventure programming, in addition to examining the changes in perceptions of psychological needs before and after adventure programs.</p>

<title>Intrinsic Motivation</title>
<p>Intrinsic motivation is defined as the “inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise one’s capacities, to explore, and to learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>, p. 70). Intrinsic motivation is facilitated when three psychological needs are satisfied, including competence, autonomy, and relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002</xref>). Perceived competence represents a sense of efficacy when interacting with an environment. According to White (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487886">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>, p. 231), feeling competent provides energy for maintaining behaviors. In addition, to experience true intrinsic motivation, an individual must perceive that his or her competence matches environmental challenges. Inflated or underdeveloped competence may lead to a state of anxiety or boredom, and hinder motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487886">Csikszentmihalyi, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487886">1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, autonomy refers to an individual’s perception that an action is self-endorsed and freely chosen, and thus he or she takes responsibility for his or her actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2006</xref>). Autonomy is considered as an important element when categorizing types of motivation; intrinsic motivation indicates that an individual’s action is driven by internal rather than external forces, such as monetary incentives or scores. Finally, relatedness refers to the perception of feeling connected to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002</xref>), which encourages people’s exploratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487886">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053825913487886">Edmunds, Ntoumanis, &amp; Duda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053825913487886">Grouzet, Vallerand, Thill, &amp; Provencher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053825913487886">Vlachopoulus &amp; Michailidou, 2006</xref>) has examined the relationships between the basic psychological needs and intrinsic motivation. In general, competence and autonomy have a stronger association with intrinsic motivation than relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487886">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053825913487886">Edmunds et al., 2006</xref>). This difference may result from contextual factors. For example, personal exercise typically requires a lower level of interaction with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053825913487886">Vlachopoulus &amp; Michailidou, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, self-determination theory (SDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053825913487886">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>) emphasizes the impacts of social contexts with regard to facilitating intrinsically motivated behaviors. Social contexts, which are either immediate to an individual, like family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487886">Hektner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487886">2001</xref>), or more distal, such as an adventure program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487886">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487886">Freeman, 1992</xref>), are influential on levels of intrinsic motivation and psychological needs.</p>

<title>Adventure Programs</title>
<p>An adventure program uses selected, adventurous activities as a means for participants to develop physical, mental, and social competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053825913487886">Gilbertson, Bates, McLaughlin, &amp; Ewert, 2006</xref>). Risk is inherent in many adventure programs, potentially evoking anxiety, uncertainty, and dissonance. Despite this, the managed risk typically used in adventure programs promotes positive changes in behaviors or cognitive patterns and encourages the development of competencies that allow an individual to adapt to a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487886">Luckner &amp; Nadler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053825913487886">Priest, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487886">Priest &amp; Gass, 2005</xref>). Beyond simply obtaining concrete skills, knowledge, and experiences from outdoor adventure experiences, competence implies an innate human desire to feel effective within a given context. Scholars have discussed connections between outdoor adventure settings and the establishment of competence, such as adventure experience paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053825913487886">Priest, 1999</xref>), empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487886">Hough &amp; Paisley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, 2003</xref>), and the Outward Bound process model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053825913487886">McKenzie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1053825913487886">Walsh &amp; Golins, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that adventure programs can be effective in satisfying psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In a study regarding camps for diabetes management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487886">Hill and Sibthorp (2006)</xref> found that an informational and autonomy supportive environment satisfies the needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1053825913487886">Sklars, Anderson, and Autry (2007)</xref> posited that adventure programs support the fulfillment of psychological needs and positive youth development by focusing on strengths and positive competences youth have, instead of overemphasizing their problems. Basic needs are met using several approaches: (a) a sense of community and belongingness with peers and adults (i.e., relatedness), (b) competence established during skill building, (c) perceptions of choice and expression of self (i.e., autonomy), (d) exploration of self-identity, and (e) the introduction of active leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487886">Caldwell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487886">Larson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Empowerment, like autonomy, is related to an individual’s capacity to control the environment and actively engage in an activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487886">Hough &amp; Paisley, 2008</xref>). Empowerment and autonomy can be considered a process and an outcome. To incorporate these two concepts in adventure programs, practitioners have enlisted a series of approaches, including challenge by choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487886">Priest &amp; Gass, 2005</xref>). Challenge by choice indicates an activity where participants play active roles in selecting levels of challenges to match their perceived abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053825913487886">Schoel &amp; Maizell, 2002</xref>). Challenge by choice is a philosophy often used in activities such as rope courses.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this does not mean other types of programs prevent learners from making choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053825913487886">Sibthorp and his colleagues (2008)</xref> suggested that “leaders of the day” and “student-led expeditions” are two examples of activities in which learners create their own experiences. In addition, when tasks, environments, and group dynamics are appropriate, outdoor instructors may use more democratic leadership styles, granting learners more decision-making power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487886">Priest &amp; Gass, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The argument that adventure programs fulfill a learner’s need for relatedness stems from the interpersonal skills, such as communication, cooperation, and trust, promoted by the programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487886">Priest &amp; Gass, 2005</xref>). The unique social environment allows learners to establish reciprocal and interdependent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053825913487886">McKenzie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1053825913487886">Walsh &amp; Golins, 1976</xref>) and compels participants to work together to address physical and social challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487886">Kimball &amp; Bacon, 1993</xref>). Moreover, being supported by other group members also empowers learners to develop new skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487886">Hough &amp; Paisley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487886">Carver (1996)</xref> posited that there are three types of learners’ experience in experiential education, and involve agency, belongingness, and competence. Within this ABC framework, agency represents a student’s sense of being able to assume a significant role in making positive changes in their life. Likewise, belongingness entails considering group interests and needs in the development of a particular group. Finally, Carver defines competence as acquiring the skills and knowledge required to accomplish a specific goal or outcome. Carver’s notion of ABC provides an important link between adventure and experiential education programs, and SDT.</p>
<p>In summary, the current literature suggests adventure programs can facilitate the actualization of psychological needs such as perceived autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053825913487886">Sibthorp et al., 2008</xref>). However, program outcomes can be influenced by course characteristics and antecedent variables. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487886">Hattie and his colleagues (1997)</xref> noted that participants’ motives to attend an adventure program may influence their learning outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487886">Sibthorp (2003)</xref> found that participants’ motives and expectations are in direct relation to their perceptions of empowerment. The next section will outline how family style may influence a learner’s motivation orientations and perception of need satisfaction.</p>

<title>Family Styles</title>
<p>Family is a critical environment for fostering socialization and human development. Previous studies regarding family styles have shown the influences of parenting on a child’s cognitive and social competencies, motivation, behavior adjustment, and problematic behaviors in social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487886">Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, &amp; Dronbusch, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind (1991)</xref> argued that a family should support children who pursue individuality and exploration as well as provide discipline to prevent unfavorable behaviors and poor decision making. In addition, as an individual’s character is associated with social surroundings, an individual can be influenced by a family context at any life stage.</p>
<p>Based on two family dimensions, responsiveness and demandingness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind (1991)</xref> proposed four parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and rejecting-neglecting. Authoritative style can be characterized as being highly responsive and reasonably demanding, and as such style facilitates children’s ability to regulate their attention on personal growth. In contrast to authoritative parents, authoritarian parents lack responsiveness and take a more restrictive and obedient approach to rearing their children. In contrast, permissive parents tend to indulge their children and generally do not ask for regulation and responsibility. Finally, with the rejecting-neglecting style of parenting, insufficient/no caring and disciplines are typically offered by parents. This classification approach has been broadly used and adapted by other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487886">Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487886">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053825913487886">Strage, 1998</xref>). Due to the focus on intrinsic motivation and related items, in this article, Rathunde’s terms of “family support and challenge” will be used and the classification using these two dimensions will be discussed.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487886">2001</xref>), family support provides stability and satisfies children’s needs, which enables a child to develop exploratory behavior, a sense of openness, and spontaneous interest. Family challenge refers to parental expectations and the supervision of a child’s progress in taking responsibility and learning skills to accomplish important goals.</p>
<p>A number of studies have examined how family styles influence a child’s development in a school setting. For example, a child reared in a family with warm relationships and reasonable but firm discipline tends to be more involved with schoolwork and demonstrate better academic performance than counterparts from families with lower levels of warmth and discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053825913487886">Rathunde, Carroll, &amp; Huang, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053825913487886">Strage’s (1998)</xref> study showed that college students from authoritative families tended to have clearer academic goals and plans for the future, accounting for their ability to manage their time well and extend extra efforts toward achieving their goals. These differences in children’s performance and behavior indicate that family styles contribute to a child’s capability to display optimal goal-directed behaviors in social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487886">Joussemet, Landry, &amp; Koestner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487886">Csikszentmihalyi et al. (1993)</xref> found that youth from HSHC families tend to report more flow experiences, positive effects, and goal-directedness when engaging in productive activities, such as sports and academic works, than counterparts from low support/low challenge (LSLC) families. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde (1996)</xref> determined that the HSHC group presents higher spontaneous and directed interest than the LSLC group. Additional evidence suggests that adolescents from authoritative families (i.e., similar to the HSHC family) have greater psychological maturity, socialization, and school competences than adolescents in neglectful groups (i.e., similar to LSLC family) and other groups mostly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>). In addition, the high support/low challenge (HSLC) family revealed higher spontaneous interest and social competence than the low support/high challenge (LSHC) group, while the LSHC family had higher levels of directed interest than the HSLC group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, youths from other family styles may present comparable strengths to youths from HSHC families. For example, the differences between the HSHC and the HSLC (indulgent, high responsiveness, and low demandingness) groups in social competence and social reliance are not significant. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind (1991)</xref> found that families that are highly restrictive and demanding but not responsive to children’s needs hinder the development of competencies such as autonomy, social consciousness, cognitive competence, motivation, and academic achievement. In summary, the HSHC family structure seems to provide optimal stimulation for children to develop immediate and committed interests, as well as facilitate the development of psychological, social, and cognitive competencies. Noticeably, although the HSHC family structure may not be the only optimal environment in which to develop children’s capacities, parenting in HSLC and LSHC families may overemphasize either love or discipline and thus children’s capacities may not be as broadly developed. On the other hand, the above discussion suggests that adventure programs facilitate needs and interest satisfaction, and it will be worthwhile to assess the impact of adventure programs on how individuals adjust their perceptions throughout the experiences.</p>

<title>Family Styles Across Cultures</title>
<p>In terms of the influence of cultural difference on family styles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind (1991)</xref> stated that social contexts are associated with the actual parenting situation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487886">Chao (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487886">2001</xref>) argued that the parenting style authoritarian is not accurate to represent Chinese parents’ approach embedded the idea of “training,” which is considered as parents’ responsibility to discipline children toward socially desirable behaviors, such as academic performance and achievement. Parenting behaviors like control or governance are not necessarily hostile or constricting, but are the means to express love and caring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487886">Chao (1994)</xref> claimed this cultural context for some Chinese participants to consider their parenting styles as authoritative. However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487886">Chen and Luster (2002)</xref> has shown that the idea of training is, to some extent, rooted in both authoritative and authoritarian parents’ belief.</p>
<p>Despite cultural differences, empirical studies involving parenting styles in Asian cultures broadly use two-dimensional approach, such as warmth and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053825913487886">Berndt, Cheung, Lau, Hau, &amp; Lew, 1993</xref>) and responsiveness and demandingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487886">Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053825913487886">Pong, Johnston, &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>) to assess perceived parental love and discipline and use it as criteria for family style classification. Pong and her colleagues (2010) found that authoritative style is positively associated with Taiwan adolescents’ school performance while authoritarian indicates an inverse effect, which shows no differences in the effects of these two styles, compared with studies conducted in Western cultural contexts. In addition, the effect of authoritarian is mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053825913487886">Wu (1997)</xref> posited that authoritarian style is not necessarily negatively associated with self-esteem and suggested that incorporation of training may be the reason. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487886">Gau and her colleagues (2008)</xref> found that high suicidal risk group (i.e., people with current suicidal behaviors and intentions) report higher ratio of parental and maternal authoritarian control. Therefore, cultural difference may result in variance in defining family style across cultures and should be considered as a potential confounding variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487886">Ewert &amp; Sibthorp, 2009</xref>). However, it should be noted that the effects of family styles can be similar between Eastern and Western cultures.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected during the summer of 2007 in Taiwan. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit youth participating in adventure programs used challenge education to facilitate relationship establishment. To obtain a sufficient sample size and reduce the impact of program differences, two 3-day challenge education courses provided by a local adventure program in Taiwan were utilized. As for similarities of the programs, both programs included initiative games, low element activities, and high element activities to achieve team building. In addition, to sustain the function of adventure programs, participants were divided into several small-size groups with an adult facilitator and staff. Finally, the youth participants recruited were high school students from Taoyuan and Hualien counties, Taiwan, respectively.</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<sec id="section9-1053825913487886">
<title>Family Styles</title>
<p>The Complex Family Questionnaire (CFQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487886">Hektner, 2001</xref>) was utilized to investigate each participant’s perceived levels of family support and family challenge and to classify the participants into the four family styles. The CFQ used 4-point Likert-type scale questionnaire containing 32 statements (16 statements each for family support and challenge). The questions regarding family support measured elements such as love, support, and stability as perceived by the participants while the questions regarding challenge measured elements such as achievement, responsibility, individualization, and self-discipline. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487886">Hektner (2001)</xref> reported the acceptable internal consistencies for both indicators: family support (α = .81) and family challenge (α = .72).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053825913487886">
<title>Basic Needs and Interest</title>
<p>The original Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053825913487886">Self-Determination Theory, n.d</xref>.) contains seven subscales, which are Interest, Perceived Competence, Choice, Relatedness, Usefulness, Effort, and Pressure. In this study, the subscales of Interest/Enjoyment, Perceived Choice, Perceived Competence, and Relatedness were chosen and created a 21-item questionnaire. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053825913487886">Tsigilis and Theodosiou (2003)</xref> reported acceptable levels of internal consistency for the selected subscales: Interest/Enjoyment (α = .78), Perceived Competence (α = .84) and Effort/Importance (α = .80).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-1053825913487886">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To classify participants into four family style groups, a mean-split method was used. To do this, total mean scores of family support and challenge were first calculated. Individual mean scores higher than total mean scores were defined as high level, and vice versa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde (1996)</xref> used this approach to divide participants into four family styles groups: HSHC, HSLC, LSHC and LSLC. In addition, for conservative reasons, grand mean substitutions were used to replace missing values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1053825913487886">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Finally, multivariate and univariate outliers were excluded from the subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>The Statistical Package for Social Sciences 17 (SPSS17) was used to analyze the data. A repeated-measure MANOVA was introduced to examine the combination of four DVs associated with differences in family styles before and after the adventure programs and interaction effects. Post hoc comparisons were subsequently used to examine the influence of family styles and adventure program experiences in detail. In addition, based on previous findings, Hypothesis 3 included six comparisons; (a) HSHC versus LSLC with autonomy, competence, relatedness, and interest and (b) HSLC versus LSHC in relatedness and interest. Hypothesis 4 assessed these six group comparisons in the posttest. Due to multiple comparisons, Bonferroni adjustments were used (significant level = .05/6 = .008) for hypotheses 3 and 4. Finally, to examine the changes in DVs for each family style group over time, 16 paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used and therefore the common-used significant level, .05 were divided by 16 and the adjusted significant level was .003.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The CFQ and the pretest/posttest of IMI were first translated into a traditional Chinese version. Proofreaders proficient in English and traditional Chinese examined the translation to ensure its accuracy and ease of reading for youth. It should be noted that family styles have been studied on Asian groups in Western and Eastern contexts and participants may interpret the parenting they received in different ways.</p>
<p>During the survey, both instruments were delivered to youth participants immediately after the orientation of the challenge course field. In addition, information regarding participants’ rights and confidentiality were distributed. The posttest of the IMI was delivered after the program was completed.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Out of 105 participants, 84 (80%) are included in this study. To classify participants into four family style groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053825913487886">Table 1</xref>), a mean-split approach was used. Descriptive statistics show the mean score of responses for family challenge as 3.04; participants with mean score higher or equal to this score were divided into the high level while mean score lower than 3.04 belong to the low level. The same application was used to divide family support into two levels. The cutoff score of family support was 2.95. Therefore, all participants were categorized into four groups: HSHC, HSLC, LSHC, and LSLC. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053825913487886">Table 1</xref> indicates the number and gender of participants in each family style group.

<p>For the CFQ, Cronbach’s alpha values of both subscales were acceptable (i.e., Family Challenge = .788; Family Support = .817).

<p>Corresponding to Hypothesis 1, “There is no relationship between the combination of DVs (i.e., three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, relatedness, and interest) and the effects of family styles, outdoor adventure experience, and interaction.” A Wilks’s criterion in repeated-measure MANOVA indicated that the combination of the four DVs was significantly affected by family styles and adventure program experience (i.e., time), while the interaction effect was not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053825913487886">Table 2</xref>). Following univariate tests, the scores of all DVs significantly changed with participation in the outdoor adventure experience (i.e., time) at α = .0125 level (i.e., .05/4 = .0125, the original significant level is divided by four DVs).

<p>To answer Hypotheses 3 and 4, multiple comparisons were conducted with the understanding that the interaction effect of family styles and time was not significant. Six comparisons indicated preexisting differences between the HSHC and the LSLC groups in the pretest were found in competence, <italic>t</italic>(80) = 3.547, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and relatedness, <italic>t</italic>(80) = 3.801, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Group differences in interest and relatedness between the HSLC and the LSHC groups were not significant. After the programs, the differences between the HSHC and the LSLC groups were no longer significant. In addition, for interest in the posttest, the LSHC group outperformed the HSLC group, <italic>t</italic>(80) = −2.262, <italic>p</italic> = .011; however, the difference was not significant at α = .008 level.</p>
<p>To test changes in psychological needs and interests within each group across the programs, several paired <italic>t</italic> tests were introduced. Because there were 16 comparisons (four DVs for four family styles), the significant alpha level of Bonferroni adjustment was made to .003 (i.e., .05/16 = .003). For the HSHC family, the posttest score of relatedness was significantly higher than the pretest score, <italic>t</italic>(29) = 4.104, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In addition, the LSLC family group showed improvements in interest, <italic>t</italic>(31) = 3.178, <italic>p</italic> = .003, competence, <italic>t</italic>(31) = 3.396, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .002, and relatedness, <italic>t</italic>(31) = 4.742, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, at α = .003 level.

<p>The findings indicated that family style and adventure program experiences were related to youth participants’ perceptions on autonomy, competence, relatedness, and interest. The tests demonstrated that the impact of family style was only supported by the difference between the HSHC and the LSLC groups on relatedness. On the other hand, significant improvements on the scores of interest, autonomy, competence, and relatedness implied that the challenge course program in this study created an environment that youth participants found interesting and self-determined.</p>
<p>In this study, youth participants from the HSHC family better perceived their abilities to integrate with social groups and exert control over challenging tasks than the LSLC group in the pretest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1053825913487886">Table 4</xref>), which was consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487886">Csikszentmihalyi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>). Disparities in competence and relatedness between these two groups, moreover, no longer existed after the program. In addition, although previous studies showed that individuals from the LSLC family usually presented lower cognitive and social competencies than their counterparts who receive high levels of family support and discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487886">Baumrind, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487886">Lamborn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053825913487886">Rathunde et al., 2000</xref>), youth participants from the LSLC family in this study displayed significant changes in perceptions on interest, competence, and relatedness after the program. The changes in these perceptions may also explain why the preexisting differences associated with family styles no longer reveal.</p>

<p>The difference in level of interest of the LSHC and the HSLC family group approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .011) in the posttest and the LSHC group also reported the highest marginal means in interest and choice after the programs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487886">Rathunde (1996)</xref> argued, youth from LSHC families may fall into a state of “drudgery,” which indicates overemphasis on the duty of a task without feelings of playfulness. The observed adventure programs appeared to provide a context that compensated for “drudgery” and thus the LSHC group perceived the experience as interesting and autonomous.</p>
<p>Although the adventure programs in this study seem to help participants satisfy their psychological needs and interests effectively. However, this study only used evidence presented in the literature to draw the assumption that SDT is embedded in adventure programs. Other theories may similarly be useful as well. The mechanism of need satisfaction in adventure programs was not examined, which limits the ability of the study to explain why the programs fulfill psychological needs. Future studies should incorporate characteristics of outdoor adventure experiences as variables, such as empowerment and autonomy support environment, and observation and examine those variables empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487886">Hill &amp; Sibthorp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1053825913487886">Sibthorp et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall improvements on the scores in the posttest may be due to postgroup euphoria or social desirability response bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487886">Hattie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, 2003</xref>), especially the posttest scores that were obtained from an immediate self-report after the program. To avoid such bias, future studies may use instruments detecting social desirability responses or place unrelated effects intentionally to examine unexpected alterations of such an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487886">Hattie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487886">Sibthorp, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The differences in perceptions on psychological needs and interest were only found between the HSHC and the LSLC groups. One possible explanation is that there were fewer participants from the HSLC (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and the LSHC (<italic>n</italic> = 10) groups than the other two groups and limited sample size hinder the inferences. In addition, the proportion of family styles is different from previous studies (i.e., done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487886">Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053825913487886">Pong et al., 2010</xref>). A larger scale of investigation is needed to ease the impact of underrepresentative samples. Nonetheless, it should be noted that studying family styles can provide a new approach to understanding the various antecedent factors that participants to experiential education programs bring with them. This study provides a glance of one such antecedent factor, namely, family styles, especially the HSHC and the LSLC families, on reported outcomes from participation.</p>
<p>It is uncertain what impact the interaction of culture and family styles has on outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487886">Chao, 2001</xref>). To address this, a deeper look at participants’ social and cultural contexts should be examined. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487886">Chen and Luster (2002)</xref> suggested, the formation of a certain family style depends on parents and children’s characteristics, as well as contextual factors such as incomes. Considering these factors will provide a better understanding on an individual’s real life situations and consequently will enhance the ecological validity of future work in this area.</p>
<p>Even though the mean-split approach was convenient to categorize the groups, it was manipulated by scores rather than reality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053825913487886">Hodge and Petlichkoff (2000)</xref> suggested that mean- or median-split methods may force participants with average responses into either high or low levels of groups. In addition, due to the self-report nature of this study, it is uncertain whether the participants actually serve as representatives of their respecting groups. Therefore, more demographic information should be collected and the similarities and differences (e.g., culture) should be listed and compared with the previous studies.</p>
<p>The CFQ and IMI can be used in adventure programs to evaluate the levels of intrinsic motivation of adventure program participants from different family styles and to help identify whether their programs are able to promote intrinsic or internal motivation for every participant. In addition, contemporary family style research focuses on the impact of family/parenting styles on human development; practitioners and researchers may consider developing individualized plans to motivate participants from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the impact of family styles on youth perceptions was supported by this study’s findings. However, family styles are not the sole determinant of an individual’s motivations. When an environment fully satisfies psychological needs and interest, an individual from an LSLC family may benefit from certain activities as much as his or her counterparts. Moreover, previous family style studies mostly examined the effects of family styles on school settings and career building; this study extends the investigation to another productive social context—experiential-based adventure programs. The nature of such programs seems to be appropriate for youth from diverse family styles to satisfy needs and develop a sense of interest in outdoor adventure activities.</p>
