<abstract>
<p>The infant mortality rate (IMR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) defined as the number of infant and newborn deaths per 1000 live births, respectively, are widely accepted as population indicators of the level of perinatal and postnatal health. Since the end of World War II, Japan has made substantial progress in reducing its IMR and NMR. This resulted from improving living standards and the provision of universal maternal and child health care (MCH) services. Okinawa, the island prefecture that is the furthest from mainland Japan, had the third highest IMR and the highest low-birth-weight rate (LBW) among all prefectures when its statistics were integrated into Japan in 1973. Even though the LBW rate in Okinawa has remained higher than the all-Japan average, Okinawa has shown a considerable improvement in IMR and NMR. The aim is to review the trends in IMR, NMR, and LBW in Japan and Okinawa and to discuss sociodemographic trends, economics, and the provision of health care services. The IMR and NMR in Okinawa decreased during that time from 14.8 to 2.4 and from 7.5 to 0.8, respectively. The LBW rate decreased until the mid-1980s, but since then it has increased to 11.5 (Okinawa) and 9.6 (Japan) in 2009. Okinawa’s public health and primary health care model for infants has been very successful and may be applicable to child health in island nations of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prefecture of Okinawa is made up of the islands of the Ryukyu archipelago lying to the southwest of the Japanese mainland. Originally, Okinawa was an independent kingdom with strong links to both China and Japan, which was incorporated into Japan in 1873. Lying at the crossroads of the trading routes between Japan and China, the Kingdom of Ryukyus developed a unique culture incorporating aspects of both its powerful neighbors. The nutrition of the Kingdom incorporated indigenous Ryukyan culture with foods from neighboring countries. Food was imported from many regional sources and a variety of tropical and semi-tropical foods were grown locally and gathered from the surrounding seas. Toward the end of World War II, Okinawa was invaded by American forces and about 25% of the civilian population died. After the war, Okinawa was retained under US control and became the site of many American military bases. After a quarter of a century of control by the US military, Okinawa reverted to Japanese control in 1972 and is now governed as a prefecture of Japan. However, the continuing large American presence has led to a proliferation of fast food stores and restaurants serving American-style foods, which are used by the American population and increasing number of Okinawans.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century, Okinawa was an economically depressed area and currently the general prefecture income (GPI) per capita averages approximately 70% of mainland Japan. During the early 20th century, the islands were the center of major sugar industry and tropical horticulture, but now production is limited because of high cost structure and frequent typhoons. The modern Okinawan economy relies on tourism, the provision of support for the American bases, some agriculture, and support from the national government. Despite its economic disadvantage, Okinawa is renowned for the longevity of its citizens. Between 1972 and 2000, Okinawa had the longest life expectancy of any prefecture in Japan and in the world. The national census of Japan showed that in 1985 the life expectancy in Okinawa was 76.3 years for men and 83.7 years for women, 2 and 3 years more than the figures of Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453250">1</xref></sup> The longevity of the Okinawan population has been the subject of many scientific studies undertaken over the past 2 centuries in an attempt to explain the difference between the island population and mainland Japan. The first published epidemiological report was published at the beginning of the 20th century when Prof Matsushita from Kyoto Imperial University visited Okinawa and noted the high life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453250">2</xref></sup> He suggested that the climate of Okinawa, with its comfortable temperature all year round, and the relaxed pace of life, were reasons for the longevity he found there. Diet has been extensively studied as it is known from epidemiology and animal studies that nutrition patterns have an influence on longevity. Some of the factors that have been suggested include increased pork and protein consumption and diets that are low in fat, and high in vegetable and seafood intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453250">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453250">4</xref></sup> Okinawans sleep for longer hours and have less disturbed than their mainland counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453250">5</xref></sup> Others have concentrated on social factors and have noted that older persons are valued in Okinawan society and culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453250">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apart from being known for its longevity in 1980, Okinawa has shown a considerable improvement in child health during the past 4 decades. Secular trends of infant mortality rate (IMR) shows there were 3 phases to achieve the improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453250">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, recent studies suggested that Okinawa’s longevity potentially will be adversely affected by the increasing low-birth-weight rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453250">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453250">9</xref></sup> It is the aim of this article to review the changes in child health statistics in Okinawa, the island prefecture of Japan, over the past 4 decades.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Information on infant and neonatal deaths was collected from the national vital registration statistics, which has a 100% coverage rate in Japan. Infant mortality data from 1973 to 2009 were retrieved from the Okinawa prefecture government office reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453250">10</xref></sup> and the Maternal and Child Health Statistics of Japan edited by the Mothers’ and Children’s Health Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453250">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453250">11</xref></sup> The definitions used in the study were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1010539512453250" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Infant mortality rate (IMR) = number of deaths younger than 1 year divided by the number of live births</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neonatal mortality rate (NMR) = number of deaths during 0 to 28 days, divided by the number of live births</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low birth weight (LBW) = number of low-birth-weight births divided by the number of live births (LBW = 2499 g or less from 1995; 2500 g or less until 1994</p></list-item></list>
<p>The main sociodemographic data (population and crude birth rate), economic data (gross national income/prefecture income per capita), and health care indicator (number of physicians per population) were collected from the annual reports of population statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453250">1</xref></sup> Japan has an excellent vital registration system and census and annual reports are readily available. The registration system in Okinawa was integrated into the national Japanese system in 1973. Since that date, reliable information on health statistics, including mortality rates and birth weight, sociodemographic and economic data, have been available for all the prefectures in Japan, including Okinawa. Unfortunately, following the massive destruction on the island during World War II, we have been unable to locate any individual records of birth weight from the first half of the 20th century, but some secondary sources are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453250">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Child Health Indicators: IMR, NMR, and LBW Rates</title>
<p>The secular trends of the IMR and NMR are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512453250">Figure 1</xref>. The IMR of all Japan showed a constant decline during the period of 1973 to 2009. The IMR of Okinawa for the period showed 3 phases. During the first phase from 1973 to 1985 the IMR declined faster than the all Japan IMR. During the second phase from 1986 to 1998, the Okinawan IMR tended to fluctuate, but at a level above the overall Japan rate. In third phase after 1999, the IMR of Okinawa started to decline rapidly to approach and even dip below the level of all Japan. Over the past 4 decades, the IMR decreased by 8.9 (from 11.3 to 2.4) and 12.4 (from 14.8 to 2.4) points for Japan and Okinawa, respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>The NMR in Japan overall has shown a continual decline. The trend of NMR of Okinawa was parallel to that of the IMR of Okinawa, decreasing in the first phase and fluctuating in the second phase. Since 1973, the NMR decreased by 6.2 (from 7.4 to 1.2) and 6.7 (from 7.5 to 0.8) points for Japan overall and Okinawa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512453250">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The incidence of LBW in all Japan reached a low point in 1978-1979, but since then the rate has increased again, reaching 9.6% in 2009. The LBW rate of Okinawa reached a low point in 1981, but since then the rate increased again, reaching 11.5% in 2009. The LBW rate showed a trend parallel to that of IMR and NMR until the late 1970s, after that the LBW rate has shown reverse trend to IMR and NMR in all Japan and Okinawa. The incidence of LBW of Okinawa has consistently been about 20% higher than that of all Japan for the past 4 decades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1010539512453250">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Demographic changes</title>
<p>The population of Japan has matured with a low birth rate and low death rate and its overall size started to decrease in 2006. In contrast, the population of Okinawa is still increasing and is now 1.4 million compared with 1 million in 1972. The crude birth rate has been declining from 19.4 to 8.5 and from 23.4 to 12.2 for Japan and Okinawa, respectively. The secular trends of crude birth rate show that the rate of Okinawa has consistently been about 20% higher than that of all Japan.</p>

<title>Economic growth and the recent recession</title>
<p>In the postwar period, Japan’s economy continued to grow until the early 1990s and was then followed by recession. The gross national income per capita for all Japan was ¥720 800 (Japanese yen) in 1972, increasing until 1996 during which the income was ¥3 230 000. However, after that it has fluctuated because of economic recession, being ¥2 916 000 in 2009 in all Japan.</p>
<p>The GPI per capita of Okinawa was ¥418 600 (only 58% of that of all Japan) in 1972. It had increased until 1995 during which GPI per capita was ¥2 136 000 (69.9% of that of all Japan). However, after that it has fluctuated because of economic recession. The secular trend in the GPI per capita shows that the income of Okinawa has consistently been about 70% of that of all Japan since 1974.</p>

<p>The Japanese child health–related laws and the universal health insurance system were applied in 1972 to the Okinawa prefecture when it reverted to Japan. Several programs to recruit health professionals have been implemented to support island-based health professionals, for example, the Remote Island Support Laws. The system of mobile health checks started in 1974 providing universal child care services in rural areas and remote islands where it was difficult to provide permanent medical and health facilities. The system was originally developed by the prefecture government with support of the Japanese government. Subsidies for pregnant mother to move to the mainland (eg, Naha, Okinawa) for delivery have been provided by most remote island municipalities. In the island prefecture and island municipalities, recruiting health and medical professionals has always been a top priority for mayors and local government. The Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine were established in the University of the Ryukyus in 1969 and 1980, respectively, to nurture health professionals and medical doctors in Okinawa. The former school was funded to raise the public health of the people of Okinawa. The latter faculty was funded after a strong request from the residents of Okinawa prefecture as a part of the national project for the “establishment of a medical school in every prefecture.”</p>
<p>Medical scholarship students have worked in remote islands and rural areas to complete their service obligations. The number of physicians per population of Okinawa was only 50% of that of all Japan in 1975, but the current rate is 104%, which is higher than the rest of Japan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539512453250">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Japan is an island country with a total population of 128 million in 2010 living in 47 prefectures and 1719 municipalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453250">12</xref></sup> Municipalities have been encouraged to develop their own MCH programs and provide MCH services to their residents, with support and advice from the national government. The MCH law was revised in 1994 and implemented in 1996 to deliver more comprehensive MCH services at the local level. After registration of pregnancy, the following MCH services are provided by each municipal government: (<italic>a</italic>) regular health examinations for pregnant mothers, (<italic>b</italic>) regular health examinations for infants and children, (<italic>c</italic>) nutrition education for mothers, (<italic>d</italic>) subsidies for disabled children and children with chronic diseases, (<italic>e</italic>) immunizations, (<italic>f</italic>) screening tests for metabolic disorders, and (<italic>g</italic>) home visit for LBW infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512453250">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a consequence of provision of MCH care services, before and after birth, the IMR of Japan has decreased steadily to 2.79 in 2010, which is the lowest in the world and less than half the rate of the United States, 6.14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512453250">14</xref></sup> The leading causes of Japanese infant deaths are now congenital malformations, deformities, and chromosomal abnormalities (CMDCA), respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) during the period 2005-2008. These 3 causes together were responsible for 48.4% of all Okinawan infant deaths during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453250">7</xref></sup> Japan is aiming to reduce mortality due to SIDS through the National SIDS Prevention Campaign. In the United States, CMDCA was also the number one cause of infant mortality, whereas SIDS was ranked third, according to the latest report from the US National Center for Health Statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512453250">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512453250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512453250">17</xref></sup> For international comparison, caution must be taken to ensure that the definition of a live birth is consistent between countries.</p>
<p>As reported by Schulman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512453250">18</xref></sup> after his site visit to Japan, “infant mortality in Japan is low, as are health care costs.” He suggested that the dramatic reduction of IMR in Japan after World War II might not be due to the improvement in medical care alone and could include socioeconomic development, improved living standards (water supply and sewer/sanitation infrastructure), universal health insurance, reform of MCH laws and universal distribution of the Mother and Child Health Handbook. Wu and Chiang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512453250">19</xref></sup> explained the rapid decline in IMR in Taiwan by using the Mosley–Chen framework, and they identified economic growth (improved living standard), gender equity and empowerment (raised child caring capacity), and health services (universal accessibility) as the 3 major factors. These 3 socioeconomic and cultural determinants have been observed in most developed countries when IMR has rapidly improved.</p>
<p>In Okinawa prefecture, universal access to MCH services based on Japan’s MCH Law and the introduction of universal health insurance coverage in 1972 has led to a more rapid decline in IMR and NMR than for the rest of Japan. Furthermore, the Prefectural Mobile Health Check System was launched for the infants in rural areas in 1974 by Okinawa prefecture through the Okinawa Child Health Association. The system is a good model of primary health care, which provides infant health care services in rural area and island municipalities.</p>
<p>The recent economic recession does not appear to have changed the rate of IMR and NMR decline in all Japan. However, economic recession might have locally influenced the IMR and NMR in Okinawa and during the second phase of IMR decline (described above) from mid-1980s to the end of 1990, IMR and NMR tended to fluctuate widely in Okinawa, reflecting the influence of sociodemographic factors, including the economic recession. The period in which IMR and NMR fluctuated in the 1980s and 1990s in Okinawa was partly concurrent with economic recession and the trend of the increasing LBW rate. This period illustrates the fragility and vulnerability of mother and child health in the island prefecture to the influence of socioeconomic determinants. Toward the end of this phase, a perinatal network council was launched in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512453250">20</xref></sup> The network has been very effective in raising the level of perinatal care level in Okinawa. From 1999, the IMR, and especially NMR, in Okinawa started to decline rapidly to approach, and even below, the level of Japan during the third phase.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539512453250">Table 2</xref>, one of specific trends in health care indicators has been the increase in the number of physicians in Okinawa. Although there has been a disparity of per capita income between all Japan and Okinawa during this time, the number of physician per population reached the average level of all Japan. This increase in the workforce resulted from the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. The establishment of educational facilities for health and medical workers seems to be the best way to nurture and retain health and medical personal within an island prefecture. The former Faculty of Health Sciences (currently, the School of Health Sciences), University of the Ryukyus, was established to educate public health professionals in 1969 and the Prefectural Teaching Hospital, Okinawa Chubu Hospital was established in 1966. The role of Schools of Public Health in Island Health is to educate those who are responsible for the delivery and management of health care in remote islands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539512453250">21</xref></sup> The graduates from the school have been successfully deployed in the remote islands of Okinawa.</p>
<p>The success of infant health in Okinawa may be attributed to community participation and maximization of the use of existing resources, including by bringing services to the people. For example, the mobile health checks provided by the Okinawa Child Health Association include pediatricians, community health nurses, and psychologists. Another example of the successful use of existing resources is that neonatal units of public hospitals were linked together to deliver comprehensive neonatal care services through the perinatal care network. Although IMR and NMR have consistently declined in all Japan, the LBW rate has increased since 1980. Among the developed nations, this trend is specific to Japan and reasons include increase in maternal smoking, multiple births, and restriction of weight gain during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453250">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512453250">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increasing multiple birth rate is at least in part the result of new reproduction technologies that have increased since the 1980s and today 1% of newborns in all Japan are the result of in vitro fertilization technology.</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of modern neonatal intensive care there was a strong link between LBW and IMR/NMR, but this has been changed by the use of advanced high technology in neonatal care and the development of a prefecture-wide evacuation system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the relatively low per capita income, Okinawa prefecture has been successful in closing the health gap with mainland Japan and has managed to reduce its IMR and NMR to that of all Japan’s average level. This has been because of the following reasons:</p>
<list id="list2-1010539512453250" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The application of Japanese public health law and introduction of universal health insurance to Okinawa. Even if universal health insurance is introduced into the islands; the residents cannot use the insurance if there are not sufficient health facilities in the island. Mobile health checks for infants have been implemented to provide health services to islanders and residents of rural area who do not have sufficient access to health and medical facilities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recruitment of health and medical workforce by prefecture and municipal governments. The Japanese government established the School of Health Sciences and Faculty of Medicine for nurturing health professionals and medical doctors. The Okinawa prefecture government has recruited medical doctors through student scholarships. Recruiting physicians is a top priority for every municipality and mayor in remote areas/remote islands.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mobile health checks for all infants and a network for perinatal care services. The members of the mobile health check teams are recruited from existing health resources from all Okinawa. Perinatal Care Councils coordinate the use of existing neonatal intensive care unit beds of national, prefecture, and other hospitals.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The IMR and NMR in Japan have decreased steadily over the past 4 decades, even during economic recession of the 1990s. Despite a relatively low income per capita, Okinawa prefecture has been successful in reducing its IMR to the Japan average. In addition to applying Japan’s MCH Law and introducing universal health insurance coverage in Okinawa in 1972, developing an effective health care service system by prefecture and municipalities has contributed to this reduction. The universal mobile health check services and neonatal care support system have been developed by using existing health and medical facilities and by recruiting workforces by local government. Okinawa’s progress in infant health in reducing IMR and NMR and its implementation of effective health care system is a model of public health and primary health care for island regions/nations of the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, the LBW rate is still increasing in Okinawa and in all Japan. Although advent of modern neonatal intensive care units has reduced the link between LBW rate and IMR/NMR, the prevention of LBW remains a high priority in child health in Okinawa and all Japan.</p>
