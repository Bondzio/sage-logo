<p>In <italic>Between the Guerrillas and the State</italic>, Maria Clemencia Ramirez has written an excellent analytical description of the cocalero movement in the Putumayo province in the Colombian Amazon during the 1990s. Cocaleros in Putumayo were a mix of colonos occupying land without property titles, landless economic migrants, and some indigenous groups that cultivated coca in small plots. The focus is on the uprising of 1996, when about 32,000 cocaleros occupied regional cities and made a series of demands to the central state. Ramirez tells this story using a variety of primary and secondary sources: extensive fieldwork in the area, semi-structured interviews with a variety of political actors and local people, as well as secondary sources.</p>
<p>The analysis of the movement is placed along three larger contexts: interactions with the state and the process of local state making, the content of citizenship, and the development of identity. In this fashion the book contributes to our understanding of the origins of modern social movements, highlighting the difficulty of separating “new” identity and cultural movements from “older” economic and political movements. The author argues that marginality of the region and of the people with respect to the central state is a fundamental factor explaining the origins and the identity of the movement. Economic and political marginality, in addition to a favorable climate, was instrumental in the establishment of illegal crops in the region. Yet Ramirez argues “The forms of dialogue established between the state and its margins are paramount in shaping communities” (p. 7).</p>
<p>First, the state marginalized the region by its very absence; second, the state constructed a narrative which identified these regions as barbaric and lawless in order to legitimize the use of force; and third, the state forcefully eradicated coca crops through military occupation. In a parallel process, the identity of the peasants changed from peasants or colonos, to cocaleros: “Once the state began to fumigate their [the peasants’] coca crops, and they started protesting the fumigation, they began to identify as cocaleros” (p. 35). Movement participants, faced with the stigma surrounding the cultivation of coca, embraced the stigmatized identity, cocaleros, and gave it a new meaning, one that included political recognition and citizenship rights.</p>
<p>Cocaleros’ demands included: state recognition of the historical reasons why they cultivated an illegal crop; a stop to publically calling and treating them as criminals; their recognition as legitimate partners in the negotiations; better public goods; technical and economic help to find viable alternatives to coca cultivation; and a halting of the indiscriminate fumigation of small plots that damaged the environment, caused health problems, and ruined the source of their subsistence. Thus, the <italic>cocalero</italic> movement combined cultural <italic>and</italic> more traditional economic demands.</p>
<p>The interaction between the state and the cocaleros occupies center stage in the book. But Ramirez rightly emphasizes a third collective actor, the oldest Marxist guerrilla organization in Colombia, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC. Cocaleros sold their coca crops to drug traffickers who processed and exported it and paid taxes to FARC, which occupied positions of authority in the region, organized the administration of justice, and exercised military control over territory and people. In short, FARC filled many of the local functions of the central state, and placed itself as a protector of the peasants against the state, and against the drug-traffickers. In addition, FARC played an important role in the mobilization and organization of the cocalero movement.</p>
<p>Here Ramirez draws a delicate line between, on the one hand, emphasizing cocaleros’ political agency and their different strategic interests with FARC, and on the other, acknowledging FARC’s contribution to the movement. FARC was interested in the continuation of the status quo, benefitting from the illegality of coca, while peasants would be better off with legal and viable coca substitutes. Not surprisingly, when it seemed that an agreement between cocaleros and the government that included eradication of coca crops was reachable, cocaleros inevitably found themselves, in the words of the mayor of a local town, “between a rock and a hard place” (p. 149). Unfortunately, Ramirez does not look in any detail at the particular ways in which FARC influenced and organized the movement, and thus, misses an opportunity to help clarify the recurrent ways or mechanisms that networks of activists use in the development of grass roots political movements.</p>
<p>Less attention is given in the book to another collective political actor, the drug traffickers. Ramirez tells us that in the 1980s there was an uneasy alliance between FARC and drug traffickers. FARC was an intermediary between producers and distributors of coca, taxing production and distribution, in exchange for military protection. But in 1987 drug traffickers assaulted a FARC military base and a war between the two groups was declared. The author clearly shows that cocaleros were not neutral in this war and that they allied with FARC. Why? Ramirez mentions some cases in which drug traffickers used force and physical threats to recruit labor to produce and process coca, and paid workers in kind with low-grade cocaine. How generalized were these practices? Did traffickers prefer small or large producers? Overall, the reader knows little about the interaction between traffickers and peasants, and as a consequence the path that led to an alliance between cocaleros and FARC seems to be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Ramirez does not promise theoretical developments or extensions. She is nonetheless theoretically informed, and she does a good job in engaging the description of the political movement with theories of state making, and identity in particular. At times however it is difficult to know why some specific aspects of theories are emphasized, and theoretical statements appear obscure and arbitrary, given that these theories are not systematically discussed. For example, in explaining the emergence of the cocalero uprising Ramirez argues that “…the notion of citizenship mediates the paradoxes within the cocalero movement, which derives its identity not from its opposition to the state but from the social and political exclusion of its members <italic>by</italic> that state” (emphasis in original, p. 111). Or “…spatial categories affect the articulation of identity, concretely in relation to those meanings ascribed to rural and urban spaces” (p. 111). There is little empirical discussion of individuals’ meanings of identities, and no way to know how notions of citizenship mediate the paradoxes of the movement.</p>
<p>The cocalero uprising did not ultimately succeed. Some goals, including voluntary eradication and crop substitution were short term and only partially applied. Aerial fumigation continued under the U.S.-funded Plan Colombia, and paramilitary forces with the mission of clearing the region of leftist influence were responsible for mass killings of political activists and peasants. But Ramirez ends her book with an optimistic tone: the cocalero movement achieved international recognition, and cocaleros are now recognized by the international community as agents and citizens. That achievement was the fundamental claim of the movement.</p>
