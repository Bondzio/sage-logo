<abstract>
<p>Guided by the social cognitive career and cognitive evaluation theories, the authors theorize and test differential predictions regarding the moderating role of student- and parent-rated support when considering the influence of students’ learning goal orientation on career decision-making self-efficacy. Data were collected from 141 undergraduate students and their parents over a 6-month period. Time 1 learning goal orientation was positively related to career decision-making self-efficacy at Time 2. Results also revealed a differential pattern of moderating effects for student ratings of parental support and parent ratings of support. High student ratings of parental support strengthened the association between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. In contrast, low levels of parent-rated support strengthened the relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. The discussion highlights the importance of considering how perceptions of parental support differ between parents and their children.</p>

<body>
<p>Interest in the study of career decision-making self-efficacy has accelerated rapidly over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069072711417162">Betz, 2007</xref>), largely due to the development of social cognitive career theory (SCCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711417162">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>). This theoretical approach has been used to understand the processes by which individuals formulate vocational and career interests, choices, and goals. Despite generating a great deal of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417162">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711417162">Lent, Lopez, Lopez, &amp; Sheu, 2008</xref>), however, there are still aspects of the SCCT that warrant further investigation. Although recent work has focused on examining the role of personality in influencing career self-efficacy and interests, most studies have focused on the Big Five personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711417162">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>) and Holland’s vocational interest themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711417162">Holland, 1997</xref>). Less work has examined personal characteristics and their interaction with contextual conditions. Departing from these broad personality themes and focusing on specific personality traits may offer new insights into our understanding of career decision-making self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711417162">Borgen &amp; Betz, 2008</xref>). Indeed, examining the joint effects of person and contextual factors are important as both are inextricably linked with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711417162">Vondracek, 2007</xref>). Specifically, personal attributes and contextual factors may interact bidirectionally to account for changes in the development of an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417162">Bandura, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>More importantly, the SCCT highlights the importance of differentiating between objective and perceived aspects of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, the SCCT suggests that the impact of a specific contextual factor, such as parental support, may partly depend on how an individual interprets and responds to this factor. Thus, students (as support recipients) and parents (as support providers) may have different interpretations of what constitutes supportive parental behavior. Despite this, existing research exploring the influence of parental support in career development predominantly uses students’ ratings of the extent to which they perceive their parents are supportive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711417162">Alliman-Brissett, Turner, &amp; Skovholt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711417162">Constantine, Wallace, &amp; Kindaichi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711417162">Diemer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072711417162">Turner &amp; Lapan, 2002</xref>). However, we argue that examining parental support from the <italic>sole perspective</italic> of the student may potentially obscure salient differences and relationships. Thus, in order to add greater precision to our predictions, we test the moderating role of parental support from both student and parent perceptions. This is warranted as while researchers have assumed that both parents and students perceive parental support in a similar manner, this issue remains empirically untested.</p>
<p>In this article, we extend the theoretical and empirical literature on career decision making in a number of ways. First, we focus on the interaction between learning goal orientation (a person factor) and perceived parental support (a contextual factor) in predicting career decision-making self-efficacy. Second, by integrating the social cognitive career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 1994</xref>) and cognitive evaluation theories (CET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>), we theorize and test the differential moderating role of parental support. If students (as support recipients) and parents (as support providers) vary in their perceptions of what constitutes supportive parental behavior, then we would expect a differential pattern of moderating effects. Investigating these differential effects is important as these predictions account for different aspects of the same phenomena that consequently results in a more accurate understanding of the factors that hinder or facilitate career decision-making self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Finally, we extend the utility of the SCCT in a non-Western context. Although studies on the SCCT have used diverse groups, most of which have predominantly focused on ethnic minorities in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711417162">Constantine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069072711417162">Luzzo &amp; McWhirter, 2001</xref>), which may have been affected by acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069072711417162">Mau, 1997</xref>). Testing the observed relationships in a non-Western context such as the Philippines extends and enriches the applicability and generalizability of the SSCT.</p>
<p>An important context in which self-regulation processes operate is within achievement settings. Theorists have identified an individual’s goal orientation as an important influence on the way she or he responds to achievement situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711417162">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711417162">Elliot &amp; Harackiewicz, 1996</xref>). We focus on learning goal orientation, an individual characteristic that results in individuals pursuing continuous improvement and increased competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711417162">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711417162">Elliott &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>). High-learning goal orientation individuals seek to master new skills, complete difficult tasks, and succeed in overcoming obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072711417162">Meece, Anderman, &amp; Anderman, 2006</xref>). This characteristic promotes challenge seeking and mastery oriented responses (e.g., strategy formulation, positive affect, and sustained performance) as opposed to performance goal orientation, which results in helpless response amidst failure, low ability attributions, negative affect, and impaired performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711417162">Elliott &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The SCCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 1994</xref>) proposes that personal factors or predispositions such as goal orientations can shape learning experiences that consequently influence self-efficacy. This is because learning goal-oriented individuals may view challenging situations as an opportunity for personal development, and this positive outlook can serve as an experiential source of efficacy. Indeed, numerous studies found a positive relationship between learning goal orientation and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711417162">Phillips &amp; Gully, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417162">Porter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417162">Payne, Youngcourt, &amp; Beaubien, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711417162">Phillips and Gully (1997)</xref> found that individuals who were high as opposed to low in learning goal orientation were more likely to have greater levels of self-efficacy. High-learning goal orientation individuals are also inclined to have high levels of self-set goals and goal commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072711417162">Klein &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). Although prior research provided support for the positive influence of learning goal orientation on personal agency and career outcomes, it mainly focused on general self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711417162">Phillips &amp; Gully, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417162">Porter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417162">Payne et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417162">Bandura (1986)</xref> noted that judgments of self-efficacy should be task and domain specific as these beliefs are dependent on the context by which it operates (i.e., achievement settings). Thus, we focus on career decision-making self-efficacy or an individual’s belief that she or he can successfully complete tasks necessary in making career decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711417162">Betz &amp; Luzzo, 1996</xref>). Competent career decision-making involves (a) accurate self-appraisal, (b) gathering occupational information, (c) selecting goals, (d) planning for the future, and (e) solving problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711417162">Betz &amp; Luzzo, 1996</xref>). Based on the literature presented above, we predict that learning goal orientation will be positively related to career decision-making self-efficacy (Hypothesis 1).</p>
<p>Parental support is defined as assistance provided by a primary caregiver to an individual in the form of verbal encouragement, instrumental assistance, career-related modeling, and emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072711417162">Turner &amp; Lapan, 2002</xref>). The SCCT asserts that contextual factors such as parental support influence the direction of an individual’s career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 1994</xref>). This occurs as children tend to model the behaviors of significant others such as their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417162">Bandura, 1986</xref>). For example, children can develop career decision-making self-efficacy vicariously by observing their parents carry out tasks associated with career exploration and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711417162">Alliman-Brissett et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, support from parents also facilitates children’s engagement in career-related learning experiences that then shape self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072711417162">Turner &amp; Lapan, 2002</xref>). Indeed, support and encouragement from parents have significant implications on their children’s academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711417162">Cutrona, Cole, Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Russell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069072711417162">Ginsburg &amp; Bronstein, 1993</xref>) and striving for and achieving academic, vocational, and career outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072711417162">Kenny, Blustein, Chaves, Grossman, &amp; Gallagher, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the SCCT, contextual factors such as parental support may interact with person factors to influence career related self-efficacy. However, we theorize that two different patterns of relationships will emerge depending on who perceives parental support (i.e., student vs. parent perceptions). The SCCT postulates that the influence of contextual factors such as parental support may partly be dependent on the individual’s appraisal of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072711417162">Vondracek’s (2007)</xref> notion of “contextual affordances” emphasizes the importance of considering the individual’s own perception of the situation as aspects of the environment such as resources, supports, and barriers may be subjectively appraised. This process of actively making sense of the environment demonstrates that individuals have the ability to exercise personal agency and are not mere conduits of external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 2000</xref>). In the context of the present study, this suggests that students’ subjective perceptions of parental support may not necessarily equate to their parents’ interpretations. For example, children may readily convey their subjective experiences as recipients of parental support while parents may only infer based on their children’s behavior if the support that is provided is helpful or beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711417162">Kazdin, Esveldt-Dawson, Unis, &amp; Rancurello, 1983</xref>). Thus, we expect that the benefits and value placed on parental support may be dependent on subjective interpretations of the support recipient (i.e., students) and the support provider (i.e., parents).</p>
<p>Given that perceptions of supportive parental behavior may differ between students and parents, we expect differential moderating effects. We invoke the cognitive evaluation theory (CET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>) to explicate these proposed differential effects. Specifically, we argue that differences in perceptions of supportive behavior may be a result of unmet needs salient in facilitating learning goals. According to the CET, contextual factors such as parental support may enhance or thwart intrinsic or internalized motivation depending on the extent to which the primary needs for autonomy and competence are supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>). Learning goal-oriented individuals are also driven by such psychological needs. Adoption of learning goal orientation drives individuals to increase competence because ability is viewed as malleable as opposed to fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711417162">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>). Moreover, difficulties are viewed as challenges that can enhance competence once surpassed. An environment that supports autonomy may also facilitate learning goals due to its focus on personal needs and interests to master tasks. Furthermore, provisions for autonomy matches learning goal-oriented individuals’ belief that the result of outcomes depend on the actor and not on external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072711417162">Legault, Green-Demers, &amp; Pelletier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1069072711417162">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To this end, we expect that students with high-learning goal orientation perceive parental behaviors as supportive only to the extent to which it promotes autonomy and competence. High-learning goal-oriented students will therefore view parental support as beneficial if it enhances their sense of competence and mastery as well as provides them the opportunity to exercise freedom, volition, and responsibility. In line with this reasoning, we predict that student ratings of parental support will moderate the relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. Specifically, there should be a stronger positive relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy under high as opposed to low student ratings of parental support (Hypothesis 2a).</p>
<p>Conversely, parent perceptions of supportive behavior may not necessarily account for students’ needs for competence and autonomy. According to the CET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>), negative effects may potentially occur when the environment fails to address the need for competence and autonomy. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that parental career-related behaviors may also be perceived by students as controlling rather than facilitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417162">Schultheiss, Kress, Manzi, &amp; Glassock, 2001</xref>). Parents may impose their wishes and aspirations on their children thereby hindering personal career interests and choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417162">Schultheiss et al., 2001</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072711417162">Dietrich and Kracke (2009)</xref> found that parental interference was positively related to difficulties in career decision making. Thus, parents may interpret their behaviors as supportive but adolescents may consider it as too much control over their own career development.</p>
<p>The differential effects of parental support may be particularly salient in collectivist cultures. Due to a strong focus on familism and communalism, adolescents in collectivist cultures may place more importance on familial goals and needs rather than on individual desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711417162">Constantine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069072711417162">McWhirter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072711417162">Restubog &amp; Bordia, 2006</xref>). Filipino adolescents’ career choice and decisions are anchored in the desires of influential others such as parents, who view education as an opportunity to advance family welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711417162">Salazar-Clemeña, 2002</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that forgoing self-interests and desires regarding one’s career may result in reduced career decision-making self-efficacy due to parental interference with learning goals.</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417162">Mau (2000)</xref> found that Taiwanese students had lower career decision-making self-efficacy levels compared to their American counterparts. This difference was attributed to Taiwan’s collectivist culture, which places importance on group effort rather than individual abilities and competence. Based on these theoretical and empirical considerations, we expect that parent ratings of support will moderate the relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. However, contrary to Hypothesis 2a, we predict that there should be a stronger positive relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy under low as opposed to high parent ratings of support (Hypothesis 2b).</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were 141 graduating undergraduate students enrolled in a large university in the Philippines. The sample consisted of a roughly equal number of males (49.6%) and females (50.4%) with a mean age of 19.35 years (<italic>SD</italic> = .59). A wide variety of academic programs were represented, including business and commerce (26.2%), engineering (25.5%), science and allied health (14.9%), liberal arts and humanities (16.3%), and computer science and information technology (17%). Data were also collected from the participants’ parents and guardians, consisting of 53 fathers (37.6%), 79 mothers (56%), 3 grandmothers (2.1%), 4 guardians (2.8%), and 2 who did not report their relationship to the participant (1.4%). Parents/guardians’ mean age was 47.02 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.02). Participation was entirely voluntary and all participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any point in time.</p>
<p>We surveyed graduating students attending a university-sponsored modular seminar course on career planning and management. The 6-month seminar course was aimed at preparing graduating students to cope with the demands and challenges associated with starting a professional career. At Time 1 (T1), participants were asked to report their learning goal orientation, perceived parental support, and demographic characteristics. Of the 275 participants surveyed, 217 completed surveys, which correspond to a response rate of 78.9%. In addition, students were requested to give a brief questionnaire to one of their parents or to their legal guardian. The parent questionnaires assessed demographic characteristics as well as the extent to which parents/legal guardians provide support for their children’s chosen career. Parents/guardians returned the questionnaire directly to the research team via mail in an enclosed, reply paid envelope. We received a total of 176 completed questionnaires representing a response rate of 64%. At Time 2 (T2), 6 months after Time 1 data collection, a second survey was administered to students assessing career decision-making self-efficacy. We received 160 completed surveys yielding a response rate of 73.7%. Nineteen surveys could not be matched with the first survey because the participants did not indicate their self-generated code and thus were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the two waves of data collection along with the parent questionnaires resulted in a final sample of 141 student and parent dyads.</p>

<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1069072711417162">Figure 2</xref>
 suggests a significant and stronger positive relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy only for low parent ratings of support, <italic>t</italic>(136) = 5.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The slope representing high parent ratings of support was nonsignificant, <italic>t</italic>(136) = −.18, <italic>ns</italic>. Thus, Hypothesis 2b was supported. As an additional check, we tested whether the differences between perceptions of support were not a function of the scales we used. To do this, we conducted hierarchical moderated regression analysis of student ratings of parental support with the same items as those used in parent ratings. Results revealed that the moderating role of student ratings of parental support (i.e., using a 12-item measure) was significant. Overall, the supplementary analysis lends further support to our predictions thereby ruling out alternative explanations to our study findings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inspired by the SCCT and the CET, we examined the interactive effects of learning goal orientation and perceived parental support in predicting career decision-making self-efficacy. Results supported our first hypothesis that learning goal orientation would be positively associated with career decision-making self-efficacy. Individuals high in learning goal orientation are more likely to persist when faced with challenges and focus on efforts to increase competence and exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072711417162">Meece et al., 2006</xref>). This persistence and strong initiative may stem from the belief that errors are a natural part of one’s personal growth and development and is not a reflection of absolute failure or inherent inability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711417162">Elliott &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>An important aspect of our theory building effort concerns the differential moderating effects of parental support (i.e., student vs. parent perceptions; Hypotheses 2a and 2b) in the relationship between learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. Both our hypotheses were supported. This suggests that students and parents may have different interpretations of what constitutes supportive behavior and that this divergence in perception may result in differential effects on learning goal orientation and career decision-making self-efficacy. These results lend support to SCCT’s claim that it is important to attend to a recipient’s active phenomenology to accurately capture the influence of contextual supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417162">Lent et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are also in line with the CET (Deci &amp; Ryan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">2002</xref>), which highlights the importance of aligning the kind of support given to students to address their psychological needs for competence and autonomy. These psychological needs may be particularly important for students with a learning goal orientation. It is possible that when students rated their parents’ supportive behavior, they were thinking of parental behaviors that address their needs of autonomy and competence, which were relevant to their learning goals. Preliminary support for this may be derived from further analyzing when these different patterns of relationships emerged. It should be noted that there was a significant positive correlation between both student and parent ratings of support and career decision-making self-efficacy. Specifically, both measures of parental support (i.e., student and parent perceptions) increased career decision-making self-efficacy. However, it was when we tested the interactive relationship between learning goal orientation and parent-rated support that we observed decreased career decision-making self-efficacy. This may suggest that learning goal orientation serves as a basis by which students judge parental behaviors as supportive or coercive.</p>
<p>The cultural context in which we have collected data also warrants discussion as it may have influenced the moderating effects of parent-rated support. The study was conducted in the Philippines where parents usually decide for their children’s career for the sake of family welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711417162">Salazar-Clemeña, 2002</xref>). This behavior may potentially undermine needs for competence and autonomy, which in turn, interferes with learning goals and career decisions. Indeed, recent research suggests that the acceptability of parental control is contingent upon the individual’s motivation and goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711417162">Bernardo, 2010</xref>). In a study of Filipino students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711417162">Bernardo (2010)</xref> found that individual-oriented achievement motivations were negatively related to the perceived legitimacy of parental control in learning activities. It also revealed that Filipino students’ personal autonomy was positively related to achievement, which was consistent with previous studies linking autonomy and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417162">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1069072711417162">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). In sum, these results highlight the importance of aligning the type of support given with the students’ dominant motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic) and goal orientation (learning, achievement, or avoidance).</p>
<p>The results of our study should be interpreted with caution in light of a number of limitations. First, we used the CET only as a heuristic in explaining the difference between students and parents perceptions of support. As such, we did not explicitly measure needs for competence and autonomy. Future research should explore the extent to which needs for autonomy and competence facilitate learning goals and result in career decision-making self-efficacy. For example, studies have shown that a sense of competence will only enhance intrinsic motivation with the presence of autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711417162">Fisher, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711417162">Ryan, 1982</xref>). There may be value in testing whether the same set of results would apply for learning goals, given the overlap between motivations and goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711417162">Koestner &amp; Zuckerman, 1994</xref>). Second, we only tested a subset of the SCCT model. It will be interesting to find out how learning goals and parental support interact not only in the prediction of career decision-making self-efficacy but also how these variables distally influence career interests, choice, and performance. Finally, while we incorporated a temporal element in our research design, this was not sufficient to ascertain causality as we did not obtain a baseline measure for career decision-making self-efficacy at Time 1.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study extends the literature on the SCCT by providing preliminary evidence for the differential moderating effects of parental support in a non-Western context. It highlights the salient role of the family environment in shaping individuals’ career decision-making self-efficacy. Moreover, we have demonstrated that parental support may not necessarily facilitate greater career decision-making self-efficacy because it may depend on how students construe what their environment provides. Indeed, parental support matters but whether it is perceived as beneficial or not rests in the eye of the beholder.</p>
