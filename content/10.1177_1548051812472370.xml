<abstract>
<p>Electronic communications collected from 233 undergraduate business students in 50 virtual teams were coded to identify group exchange structures. Results revealed four types of structures: unified generalized (characterized by high-quality exchange relationships among group members and high information sharing and cooperation; <italic>n</italic> = 10), unified generalized with isolates (high-quality exchange among most members, with negative exchange among some isolated members; <italic>n</italic> = 16), unified balanced (characterized by low-quality exchange relationships among members and low trust and concern for others; <italic>n</italic> = 8), and unified balanced with isolates (low-quality exchange among most members and negative exchange with some isolated members; <italic>n</italic> = 16). Contrary to expectations, virtual teams with unified generalized as opposed to unified balanced exchange structures did not experience higher levels of performance and member satisfaction. However, when isolates were present, adverse effects on performance and satisfaction were observed, but only for teams with balanced as opposed to generalized structures, as expected. The findings reveal the importance of promoting generalized exchange structures to avoid the potentially detrimental effects of group isolates on virtual team performance and member satisfaction. The implication for organizations planning to adopt virtual teams is that concerted efforts to foster positive social exchanges characterized by high levels of trust, cooperation, information sharing and coordination, and thereby avoid the creation of group isolates, may produce dividends in member satisfaction and team productivity.</p>

<p>With the rise of virtual teams on today’s corporate landscape, there has been increasing interest in the influence processes that arise within these nontraditional types of group structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812472370">Algesheimer, Dholakia, &amp; Gurau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812472370">Ayoko, Konrad, &amp; Boyle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812472370">Balthazard, Waldman, &amp; Warren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812472370">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812472370">Carte, Chidambaram, &amp; Becker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812472370">Cogliser, Gardner, Gavin, &amp; Broberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812472370">Gibson &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812472370">Hertel, Geister, &amp; Konradt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812472370">Huang, Kahai, &amp; Jestice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812472370">Kirkman, Rosen, Tesluk, &amp; Gibson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812472370">Merriman, Schmidt, &amp; Dunlap-Hinkler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812472370">Oakley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812472370">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812472370">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812472370">Sarker, Ajuja, Sarker, &amp; Kirkeby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812472370">Wakefield, Leidner, &amp; Garrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812472370">Zimmermann, 2011</xref>). Overall, research on virtual teams suggests that conventional modes of organizing used in traditional teams will not necessarily yield the same benefits in a virtual setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812472370">Ayoko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins, Gilson, &amp; Maynard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812472370">Merriman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812472370">Oakley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812472370">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812472370">Zigurs, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason why traditional models are less effective in virtual settings is that they assume a hierarchical influence process of an assigned leader. In many cases, virtual teams are self-managed or absent the formal hierarchy of reporting relationships depicted in 20th-century organizational charts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812472370">Nemiro, Beyerlein, Bradley, &amp; Beyerlein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812472370">Zigurs, 2003</xref>). The purpose of our study is to empirically explore the relationships of group social exchange processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812472370">Ford &amp; Seers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers, Petty, &amp; Cashman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812472370">Seers, Wilkerson, &amp; Grub, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert, Sparrowe, &amp; Liden, 2003</xref>) with the virtual team outcomes of team performance and member satisfaction.

<title>Virtual Teams</title>
<p>Based on an extensive review of the literature on virtual teams and definitions of the construct, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al. (2004</xref>, p. 808; italics in original) define virtual teams as “<italic>teams whose members use technology to varying degrees in working across locational, temporal, and relational boundaries to accomplish an interdependent task.</italic>” Note that this definition reflects the distinguishing attributes of virtual teams, including their reliance on technology-driven communications and their ability to transcend the geographic, temporal, and relational boundaries that exist for teams that interact face-to-face. Indeed, in contrast with “conventional” or “traditional” face-to-face teams, virtual teams are not restricted to one physical location and can include members from across the globe. In recognition of this fact, several scholars have focused their attention on the unique attributes of “global virtual teams” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812472370">Cordery, Soo, Kirkman, Rosen, &amp; Mathieu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812472370">Janssens &amp; Brett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812472370">Jarvenpaa, Knoll, &amp; Leidner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812472370">Jarvenpaa &amp; Leidner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812472370">Maznevski &amp; Chudoba, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812472370">Montoya-Weiss, Massey, &amp; Song, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812472370">Pauleen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812472370">Sarker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812472370">Zakaria, Amelinckx, &amp; Wilemon, 2004</xref>). The geographic dispersion of members across time zones and the use of asynchronous communication media (e.g., e-mail) contribute to the need and ability of virtual teams to cross temporal boundaries that constrain the interactions of traditional teams that meet in “real time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812472370">Gibson &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812472370">Kirkman &amp; Mathieu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al., 2004</xref>). Virtual teams can also transcend relational boundaries such as organizational affiliations as members are often drawn from different organizations as a result of outsourcing or joint ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812472370">Maznevski &amp; Chudoba, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812472370">Nemiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812472370">Zigurs, 2003</xref>). Finally, the definition reflects a basic component of any team—the work of members to accomplish and interdependent task.</p>
<p>Using an input-processes-output framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al. (2004)</xref> review the predominate constructs that have garnered attention from virtual team researchers to date. Team inputs that have received extensive attention include team size, knowledge/skills/abilities, technology, the nature of the task, and team composition. Team processes that have been examined include planning (e.g., goal setting), actions (e.g., communication, participation), and interpersonal processes (e.g., conflict, informality, cohesiveness, group identity, trust). The focal team output constructs include affective (e.g., member satisfaction) and performance (e.g., time required, decision quality) outcomes. Moderator variables that have been examined include the task type, time requirements, and social context. Following their review, Martins et al. identify a number of areas that merit increased attention from virtual team researchers. Of particular relevance to the focus of this study is their assertion that the social integration of members represents an important interpersonal process that warrants investigation. The current study seeks to address this gap in the literature by investigating the role that group social exchange structures play within virtual teams.</p>

<title>Team–Member Exchange</title>
<p>Additional insight into the social integration of members within virtual teams is provided by Seers and colleagues’ research on team–member exchange (TMX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812472370">Ford &amp; Seers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812472370">Seers, Keller, &amp; Wilkerson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 2006</xref>). Building on social exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812472370">Blau, 1964</xref>) and leader-member exchange (LMX) theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812472370">Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1975</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers (1989)</xref> introduced the TMX construct to describe the exchange relationship of an individual team member with other members of the team. TMX quality involves “the reciprocity between a member and his or her team with respect to the member’s contribution of ideas, feedback, and assistance of other members and, in turn, the member’s receipt of information, help, and recognition from other team members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 1995</xref>, p. 21). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al. (1995)</xref> note, there are similarities and differences between LMX and the TMX constructs. Both constructs assert that (a) relationships rather than job positions are the fundamental building blocks for organizational structures, and (b) reciprocity between the parties involved in a relationship must be assessed in terms of the resources each brings to the exchange process. However, the LMX construct focuses on the employee role making process relative to supervisory leadership, whereas the TMX construct pertains to employee role making within the context of work team dynamics. In addition, TMX differs from LMX in that the focal relationship is not dyadic; instead, the TMX construct focuses on a member’s relationship with other members and the team as a whole.</p>
<p>A key assumption underlying the TMX construct is that members can and do aggregate the perceptions they form from role episode exchanges with other team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 1995</xref>). Members expect other team members to communicate internally consistent role messages, and to in turn respond to such messages in an internally consistent fashion to identify their roles within the team. Through such reciprocal exchanges between team members, the identity of both members’ roles and the group as a team are reinforced. Members who experience high-quality TMX relationships contribute more to the team through collaborative and cooperative effort, and in return garner more social rewards from the team. Conversely, members with low-quality TMX relationships with other team members invest less energy in the team and receive relatively few social rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a naturally occurring quasi-experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al. (1995)</xref> demonstrated that self-managing work teams as opposed to traditional work groups experienced higher levels of TMX quality, which in turn fostered higher levels of satisfaction with coworkers, cohesiveness, general job satisfaction, and production efficiency. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812472370">Ford and Seers (2006)</xref> found teams that were characterized by high-quality LMX and TMX relationships experienced higher levels of within-group agreement on some measures of work climate. Moreover, their results revealed that differentiation in TMX relationships within a team had adverse effects on within-group climate agreement. These results suggest that variance in member perceptions regarding the quality of team member contributions and receipts within the team foster divergent perspectives of the work environment. Together, these findings highlight the likely utility of social exchange relationships to explaining key outcomes for virtual teams.</p>

<title>A Taxonomy of Group Exchange Structures</title>
<p>Building on the lessons of social exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812472370">Blau, 1964</xref>), social economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812472370">Sahlins, 1972</xref>), and LMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812472370">Dansereau et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812472370">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert et al. (2003)</xref> posit that alternative group exchange structures will emerge, reflecting various combinations of balanced, generalized, and negative exchanges. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812472370">Sparrowe and Liden (1997)</xref>, balanced exchanges are equivalent to low-quality LMX exchanges. This type is characterized by transactional or economic exchanges whereby each party is concerned with a strict reciprocal exchange of inducements and contributions. In contrast, generalized exchange is equivalent to the high-quality exchange found in mature leader–member relationships; it is characterized by high levels of trust, respect, loyalty, and concern for the welfare of the partner. In an extension of LMX theory, Sparrowe and Liden propose the concept of negative exchange where both leader and follower pursue a path of self-interest that may, at times, result in harm to the other party.</p>
<p>Building on these basic forms of social exchange, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert et al. (2003)</xref> consider the implications of alternative combinations for shared leadership to identify five prototypical group exchange structures: (a) unified, (b) unified with isolates, (c) polarized, (d) multiple coalition, and (e) fragmented. The unified group is characterized by generalized exchange relationships among all members such that high levels of information sharing, cooperation, coordination, and mutual trust are achieved. The unified with isolates structure is characterized by generalized exchange relationships among the majority of members, but negative exchange relationships among some isolated members with the majority and each other. The polarized group exchange structure is one where members of each subgroup form generalized exchange relationships with one another, but work in opposition to the other subgroup. The multiple coalition group exchange structure has multiple subgroups characterized by generalized exchange relationships that operate in opposition to one another through negative exchange relationships. Finally, the fragmented group exchange structure is characterized by negative exchange among all group members.</p>
<p>Additional sophistication in identifying alternative group exchange structures can be accomplished by adding balanced social exchange relationships to the mix. Toward this end, we have refined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert et al.’s (2003)</xref> taxonomy to include three pure types and five hybrid structures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051812472370">Table 1</xref>). The pure types include the <italic>unified generalized exchange</italic> and <italic>fragmented</italic> (negative exchange relationships only) structures described by Seibert et al., plus a <italic>unified balanced exchange</italic> structure. The latter structure is characterized by low-quality relationships among members in which strictly transactional exchanges occur accompanied by low levels of trust and concern for others. Among the hybrid types, we include the <italic>unified generalized exchange with isolates</italic> structure identified by Seibert et al., and add an analogous <italic>unified balanced exchange with isolates</italic> structure. The latter involves low-quality transactional exchange relationships among members of the dominant subgroup and negative exchange relationships among isolate members with this subgroup and each other. To reduce the complexity of our revised taxonomy, we collapse the polarized and multiple coalition structures (since the primary difference between these structures stems from the number of coalitions) into a single category labeled <italic>generalized exchange coalitions</italic>. We also add a corresponding structure labeled <italic>balanced exchange coalitions</italic> to describe groups composed of coalitions of members with low-quality relationships who operate in opposition to other balanced exchange coalitions. Finally, we identify a <italic>mixed generalized and balanced coalitions</italic> structure characterized by subgroups with both generalized and balanced exchange relationships, with the former corresponding to an in-group and the latter as an out-group as described in classic LMX literature.</p>

<title>Research Questions and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The current study employs qualitative analyses to classify the group exchange structures found in virtual teams of business students and explores the relationships between these structures and the group outcomes of team performance and member satisfaction with the team. Team performance and member satisfaction with the team constitute fundamental outcomes that have received the most extensive theoretical and empirical attention in the field of work group research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812472370">Cohen &amp; Bailey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812472370">Hackman &amp; Morris, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812472370">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812472370">Richter, Dawson, &amp; West, 2011</xref>), as well as in the emerging literature on virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812472370">Algesheimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812472370">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>). Our specific research question centers on the effect of alternative group exchange structures on group performance and member overall satisfaction with the team. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert et al.’s (2003)</xref> predictions, we expect that the unified generalized exchange structure will yield the highest levels of work outcomes and the fragmented structure the lowest. Among the hybrid with isolates forms, we expect more positive outcomes to occur for those who have relatively high levels of generalized exchange, followed by those with balanced exchange structures, respectively. Note that these predictions are also consistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812472370">Balkundi and Harrison (2006)</xref> that revealed team network structures with more densely configured interpersonal ties achieved higher levels of performance and viability. Similarly, a recent field study of the effects of generalized versus direct social exchange structures, which “feature reciprocal transfers of resources between two people,” revealed that the former resulted in higher levels of group identification and solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812472370">Willer, Flynn, &amp; Zak, 2012</xref>, p. 119). Because we did not expect the 7-week-long team project completed by the student virtual teams examined in this study to be conducive to the formation of coalitions, no predictions were advanced for the hybrid structures with coalitions.</p>
<p>Building on the prediction of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812472370">Ford and Seers (2006)</xref> that average TMX quality interacts with TMX differentiation to influence perceptions of work climate, we anticipate that the effects of team isolates on work team outcomes will depend on the quality of team exchange relationships. Ford and Seers hypothesized that TMX differentiation would have deleterious effects on within-group climate agreement, but only when average TMX was low. They reasoned that
<disp-quote>
<p>[w]hen the team’s average TMX is high, differentiation should reflect a minority of members whose relative shortcomings may be excused or overlooked. Yet when the team’s average level of TMX is low, differentiation would have to reflect that it is the minority of members whose contributions and receipts exceed the norm, and we should not expect this to go unnoticed. (p. 261)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although their findings did not provide support for this hypothesis, their reasoning is sound and highly relevant to the current study. Specifically, it implies that the adverse effects of team isolates will only occur for teams with balanced (or low quality) exchange relationships. For teams with generalized exchange relationships among the majority of members, the presence of isolates is unlikely to detract from the overall performance of the team, or the satisfaction of its members. Indeed, even the isolates may express satisfaction if a high level of performance was achieved with minimal contributions on their part.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasoning, we advance the following hypotheses:</p>

<sec id="section7-1548051812472370">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 289 undergraduate business students in three large public universities who were enrolled in five different sections of management courses. Individuals participated in teams of five to eight members, for 50 mixed gender teams (mean team size was 5.78 members; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). Team members from the various sections were randomly matched with team members from other sections; team leaders were not assigned. Of the student’s overall course grade, 10% was determined by their individual and team output over a 7-week period.</p>
<p>Complete data were obtained from 233 respondents (for a response rate of 80.6%). The participants averaged 23.2 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.18) and 55.3% were male. Sixty-six percent were working at the time of survey administration. Racial composition of the respondents was 76.4% White, 10.0% Asian, 4.3% Black, 5.7% Hispanic; the remaining 3.6% classified themselves as “other.”</p>

<sec id="section8-1548051812472370">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Each team was assigned a project that required a written case analysis on a realistic ethics scenario. Participants completed the project via an electronic communications tool (Blackboard), which allowed threaded discussion groups, email, online chats, and document sharing. Team interactions were captured from the various means of communication during the project (4,154 interactions in total). Data were drawn from team communications and two questionnaires administered at the start and completion of the project. Participation in the surveys was voluntary, and students were given nominal extra credit for participating.</p>

<p>Three of the authors reviewed the discussion boards of a subset of the teams and rated the group exchange structure as described previously (the full definitions used are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051812472370">Table 1</xref>). Each team was rated by at least two raters. Following the initial coding, the two raters met to discuss discrepancies. Based on a conceptual review of the underlying theory and literature from which the group exchange taxonomy was derived, all discrepancies were subsequently resolved to obtain 100% agreement.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Team performance and group exchange structure were assessed directly at the group level. However, team member satisfaction was assessed by each individual team member. Prior to aggregating this measure to the team level, it is important to show within-group agreement. Accordingly, we calculated the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812472370">James, Demaree, and Wolf (1984)</xref> within group agreement index (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic>) for each group. The average <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> index for team member satisfaction across groups was .82 (median was .91) and 82% of the teams had an <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> index greater than .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812472370">James et al., 1984</xref>). Finally, the group-level component of variance was strong for team member satisfaction, explaining 34.3% of the variance (<italic>F</italic>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our examination of group exchange structures yielded several findings that have implications for better understanding interpersonal influence processes within virtual teams. First, we found that many of the potential group exchange structures identified in our taxonomy did not emerge within the student virtual teams studied. Indeed, none of the 50 teams in our sample exhibited structures that included coalitions or fragmented exchange relationships. Recall that the fragmented exchange structure proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812472370">Seibert et al. (2003)</xref> involves negative exchange relationships among all team members, as members actively oppose each other and work at cross purposes. Although the emergence of such dysfunctional team structures within work groups is certainly possible, the incidence of such structures is likely to be relatively low since they would encounter extreme difficulties in accomplishing assigned tasks.</p>
<p>In the current study, where students were required to work together in virtual teams over 7 weeks to complete a written analysis of an ethics case, all teams were found to exhibit at least a minimal level of cooperation in fulfilling task requirements. Thus, the incentives to cooperate and the presence of multiple forms of virtual media (e.g., e-mail, bulletin boards, online chat) designed to promote team communication and enhance team productivity appeared to facilitate the emergence of balanced and generalized group exchange structures. We expect fragmented group exchange structures within virtual teams to likewise be rare in work environments, where more substantial incentives for team success (e.g., monetary rewards, promotion opportunities) and dire consequences for failure (e.g., financial losses, demotions, termination) are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812472370">Algesheimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812472370">Ayoko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812472370">Cordery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812472370">Jarvenpaa &amp; Leidner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812472370">Lepsinger &amp; DeRosa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812472370">Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812472370">Maznevski &amp; Chudoba, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812472370">Montoya-Weiss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812472370">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812472370">Wakefield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812472370">Zakaria et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We also found that none of the group exchange structures observed reflected coalitions among members. This finding was not unexpected, as we anticipated that the relatively small size of the project teams (5 to 8 members), the short duration of the project task, and the exclusive reliance on virtual media would not be conducive to the formation of coalitions. We suspect that coalitions will be most common among virtual teams characterized by a relatively large number of members, longer interaction histories, and disagreement regarding task goals and/or processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812472370">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812472370">Cordery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812472370">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812472370">Martins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812472370">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812472370">Wakefield et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, as the literature on organizational politics suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812472370">Ammeter, Douglas, Gardner, Hochwarter, &amp; Ferris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812472370">Porter, Allen, &amp; Angle, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812472370">Treadway, Hochwarter, Kacmar, &amp; Ferris, 2005</xref>), coalitions are particularly likely to arise in virtual contexts characterized by functional silos, scarce resources, and task ambiguity, since members with similar functional backgrounds may perceive that it is necessary to band together to protect their interests. Future research focused on the degree to which these and other factors contribute to the emergence of coalitions among virtual teams, as well as the effects of such coalitions on team outcomes, is warranted.</p>
<p>Second, we did not obtain support for the predictions of Hypotheses 1a and 1b that unified generalized versus balanced exchange structures would yield higher levels of task performance and team member satisfaction. Hence, contrary to our expectations derived from prior social exchange research on LMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812472370">Liden, Sparrowe, &amp; Wayne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812472370">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>), TMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 1995</xref>), and team network structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812472370">Balkundi &amp; Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812472370">Willer et al., 2012</xref>), groups that enjoyed the higher levels of mutual trust, information sharing, cooperation, and coordination reflected in generalized exchange processes, did not achieve higher levels of performance and member satisfaction than groups that exhibited balanced and transactional exchange processes. Perhaps the relatively short duration of the project task for the virtual teams participating in the present study prohibited them from realizing the beneficial consequences of generalized exchange processes. Alternatively, the inherent limitations of using electronic communications among team members to capture the subtle differences in trust levels, information sharing, and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812472370">Ayoko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812472370">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812472370">Hambley, O’Neill, &amp; Kline, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812472370">Kahai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812472370">Liu, Magjuka, &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812472370">Merriman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812472370">Oakley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812472370">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812472370">Sarker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812472370">Wakefield et al., 2008</xref>) found in generalized versus balanced exchange structures may account for the lack of supportive findings. Future research using social network theory and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812472370">Balkundi &amp; Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812472370">Borgatti &amp; Foster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812472370">Lucius &amp; Kuhnert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812472370">Oh, Chung, &amp; Labianca, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812472370">Sparrowe, Liden, Wayne, &amp; Kraimer, 2001</xref>) and available measures of social exchange processes within teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812472370">Seers et al., 2006</xref>) may prove to be useful in exploring the posited effects of group exchange structures. Indeed, given the critical importance of LMX and TMX to leader–member relationships and team processes, respectively, future research that explores that explores these exchange these exchange processes within virtual environments is necessary to understand how leadership, and shared leadership in particular, emerges within virtual teams.</p>
<p>Third, we obtained support for the predictions of Hypotheses 2a and 2b that the presence of group isolates would have detrimental effects on team performance and team member satisfaction, respectively, but only for teams with balanced exchange structures. One possible explanation for these findings is that teams for which the majority of members experience generalized exchange relationships are more likely to tolerate relatively low contributions by team isolates, since the team as a whole enjoys positive social exchanges, along with successful task accomplishments and member satisfaction. Moreover, even team isolates may experience satisfaction with team outcomes since they enjoy the benefits of effective task performance despite making minimal contributions. However, for teams with balanced exchanges characterized by relatively low levels of trust, information sharing, and cooperation, the presence of one or more isolates appears to have particularly detrimental effects on team performance and member satisfaction. Under these circumstances, it is likely that nonisolate members may be resentful of isolates, particularly if they are perceived as “free riders” who failed to contribute their fair share in terms of effort and resources to the completion of team assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812472370">Ford &amp; Seers, 2006</xref>). Team isolates may in turn feel that they are unfairly blamed for team failures because they are given limited opportunities to make positive contributions to the team. Hence, satisfaction among all members is likely to be low for groups with balanced exchange structures and isolated members. Future research that includes more direct measures of social exchange (e.g., TMX receipts and contributions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812472370">Seers, 1989</xref>) and other internal team processes (e.g., mutual trust, cooperation, coordination) may help in ascertaining the merits of this explanation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article presents a taxonomy of group exchange structures and applies it to examine the types of group exchange structures found in virtual teams of business students. Our results demonstrate the importance of fostering generalized exchange structures within virtual teams to prevent the potential detrimental effects of group isolates on team performance and member satisfaction. Although virtual teams with generalized as opposed to balanced exchange structures did not outperform or realize higher levels of member satisfaction when isolates were absent, they did when isolates were present. The implication for the increasing number of organizations that adopt virtual teams is that efforts to foster positive social exchanges characterized by high levels of trust, cooperation, information sharing, and coordination may produce dividends in member satisfaction and team performance by insulating the team from the potential adverse effects of team isolates. Hence, as is the case in face-to-face settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812472370">Salas, Rozell, &amp; Mullen, 1999</xref>), team building and other techniques designed to promote team development and generalized social exchange processes may prove to have beneficial effects on the productivity and viability of virtual teams. Further research is necessary to explore the extent to which elements of the organizational context, including functional silos, resource scarcity, and task ambiguity, promote the creation of different forms of group exchange structures and coalitions in particular within global virtual team settings.</p>
