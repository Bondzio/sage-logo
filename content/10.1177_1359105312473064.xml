<body>
<p>In recent years, contemporary obesity discourse has come under critical scrutiny from ‘critical weight scholars’. <italic>Debating Obesity</italic> is a timely book that seeks to expand the debate on obesity by bringing together a number of alternative, critical perspectives on the so-called obesity crisis or obesity epidemic. The book is an edited collection of chapters written mostly by academics from a range of disciplines (including Social Psychology, Sociology and Law and Human Geography). However, the contributors also include health professionals (e.g. dietitians) and political activists (e.g. a self-defined ‘fat activist’). The chapters cover a range of issues, themes and trends that are central to obesity debates, including the reality of the ‘obesity epidemic’ and the validity of claims that fatness kills, the gendered and gendering nature of discourse around obesity and the ethical implications of obesity discourse for children in a range of settings (school, family home). Later chapters chart modes of active resistance (past and current) towards dominant obesity discourse and the practices (e.g. modes of intervention) informed by this, within branches of formal health care and by successive waves of the fat liberation movement.</p>
<p>There are a number of central aims that underpin critical weight studies, and these are dealt with in the text across individual chapters. First, this seeks contextualised and politicised understandings of body weight, fitness and health, which, for example, recognise the sociocultural and structural influences and constraints upon these understandings. This is important in order to counter or to supplement neo-liberal, individualised analyses that draw heavily on notions of individual choice and behaviour, thus holding the individual responsible for their ‘ill health’. Second, the book exposes and explores ‘obesity’ as a socially constructed, discursively constituted category. In doing so, its contributors often scrutinise (e.g. by highlighting contradictory and inconclusive evidence) many ‘taken-for-granted’ ‘truths’ about ‘obesity’ that will be familiar to readers. These include notions of fatness as illness or disease, an indicator of poor health, morally suspect and something in need of correction. Instead, the book highlights the health–weight relationship as a complex one, a complexity that (as a number of contributors argue) is often glossed over in public health discourse and official policy documents. Finally, the book explores the real, everyday consequences of obesity discourse such as the forms of action that are legitimated by this, including the ‘war on obesity’ and the stigmatisation and oppression of those whose bodies do not conform to cultural ideals as well as their carers (e.g. mothers in the case of ‘obese’ children). Rather, alternative, non-discriminatory approaches, for instance, to optimising health are put forward (e.g. Health at Every Size).</p>
<p>Given the ‘the ubiquity and power of obesity discourse’ and ‘the everyday Western cultural fear and loathing of fatness’ (p. 20), the project described above is an important one. <italic>Debating Obesity</italic> often accomplishes the aims outlined in ways that are comprehensive and engaging. For example, the second chapter deconstructs obesity and dieting myths by scrutinising the existing evidence in a point-by-point fashion that is clear and easy to follow. This chapter is an excellent starting point for anybody who is relatively unfamiliar with the problems associated with dominant obesity discourse and the public policies associated with it. Other chapters draw upon rich qualitative data in order to illustrate, for example, the experiences of men (chapter 3) and women (chapter 4) defined as fat in a sizist society as well as the discursive strategies that they employ and identity work that they engage in, in dealing with how dominant health, beauty and other related discourses position them. Similarly, in chapter 6, Rich, Evans and De Pian explore children’s experiences of the surveillant practices that they are subjected to in a range of sites (e.g. school) as part of an attempt to combat childhood obesity, as well as how children mediate and resist these. The result of drawing upon people’s embodied experiences in these ways is an engaging read, which brings the issues and processes discussed to life. In addition, this book potentially has something to offer people who work in a range of settings and are interested in critical weight studies for a variety of reasons (as discussed in more detail in the final paragraph below). Overall, this is an important, informative text, and I learnt much about obesity debates from reading it.</p>
<p>The main problem with the book is its price. At £55.00 in hardback (the price quoted on the publisher’s website), the book seems very expensive, and a cheaper paperback version did not appear to be available for purchase at the time the review was written. Some of the chapters are also more accessible and engaging than others. The first chapter, which provides an overview of the book’s aims and content, is rather dense. For example, this is littered with academic terminology that someone who is in unfamiliar territory may struggle with (the concluding chapter written by the same authors – the book’s editors – is similarly difficult to digest in places). There are also, perhaps inevitably, some gaps. For example, although the importance of class and ethnicity in the social construction and representation of bodies is acknowledged throughout the book, and intersections between racism/sizism and classism/sizism are briefly acknowledged, ethnicity and class are not examined in the same level of detail as gender. Similarly, it is argued at various points in the book that socio-economic conditions and status have a real impact on people’s bodies and health. However, again, the impact of socio-economic conditions and status is not really explored in any great depth, with references made instead, for example, to reviews of such work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312473064">Aphramor, 2005</xref>). This, therefore, leaves some lingering questions concerning the ‘reality’ of some claims regarding ‘obesity’, such as whether certain environments and areas are ‘obesogenic’ ones (but that this reflects social inequalities rather than poor choices and lifestyles) or whether these claims themselves should be treated with scepticism. That said, the editors are clear that they are not seeking to provide definitive answers, but rather extend the ‘obesity debate’, and that the contributors hold different positions with regards to, for example, the extent to which they regard the phenomena they discuss as socially constructed versus having a material reality.</p>
<p>I have already recommended <italic>Debating Obesity</italic> to colleagues employing both critical and mainstream perspectives in their research on body weight, size and management. In addition, some elements of the text may be useful to those (e.g. scholars and postgraduates) who do not conduct work on body matters per se but who have an interest in some of the theoretical, epistemological and methodological approaches employed by the contributors. For example, in chapter 4, Tischner and Malson outline the main assumptions underpinning their post-structuralist, discursive approach and provide a description of how they analysed their research data using Foucauldian discourse analysis. However, this book will not just be useful for academics, it will also be of benefit for health professionals seeking alternative frameworks and interventions to those centred around weight loss and those seeking to become involved in fat activism in various guises.</p>
