<p>I belong to the “less is more” school of thought in introducing students to the study of sociology. Rather than cram a multitude of topics into 15 (or fewer) weeks, I like to focus on the big picture, helping students grasp the most important ideas and concepts of the discipline in a relatively leisurely, more in-depth way. And I make sure to build into my syllabus plenty of time and space for students to consider the relevance of these ideas for their everyday lives, their selves, and the world around them. I want students to see their groups and societies and selves with “new,” more sociological, eyes, and I want them to feel moved to contribute toward the improvement of their worlds as shapers of their own lives. I fail to understand how anyone could not love and appreciate this discipline and all its lessons and gifts, and so my main (if latent—or, indeed, secret) objective is for students to find something in it to love and appreciate as I do.</p>
<p>I mention all this up front in my review of <italic>The Engaged Sociologist </italic>by Kathleen Korgen and Jonathan White, because I want to make very clear why my response to this book is so strongly positive. It is the rare text of any kind that complements a firmly humanistic approach to teaching. Most sociology textbooks are too dense, too thick with unnecessary detail, too dull, and not incidentally, too committed to reproducing the structure of the status quo (as in their insistence on reifying theoretical perspectives on society). They are too intent on cramming a multitude of terms and theories in between their heavy, expensive covers, and they all do so relatively similarly. (Corey Dolgon and Chris Baker’s excellent <italic>Social Problems: A Service Learning Approach</italic> is the exceptional textbook that commits none of these sins and thereby proves this rule.) My appreciation of The <italic>Engaged Sociologist</italic> is great because it brings students into the field of sociology in an interesting and inviting way and because it demonstrates the great potential of sociology—and students of sociology—to make communities and the larger society better, more humane places through social action.</p>
<p>This book is compact, with basic sociological concepts well represented and illustrated (research methods, theory, culture, socialization, stratification, deviant behavior, social movements, social institutions, race, gender, and power), but not made clichéd or inert. Most content is presented in the context of civic engagement. Readers are challenged to think about how the study of sociology can lead to more engagement in their own lives and those around them, and then case studies, exercises, and suggestions for actually doing so are presented. This is a thoughtful yet do-able approach to sociology, as well as being a wellspring for all kinds of service projects. And the writing is so sharp, focused, and accessible as to keep students at all levels, I would think, interested.</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious agenda for a relatively small book, but one that <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic> more than fulfills. Instructors will find it a boon for course development; it’s user-friendly, loaded with features and sample assignments, and contains specific instructions as to how to carry out the many suggested projects. Students who have read the book in my classes have become enthralled with the stories, the humanistic charge, the challenge to apply their knowledge of sociology directly and immediately. And that is what they have done. In the spaces I created in my courses for the development of hands-on projects, even my introductory students have come up with the most wonderful, creative applications of sociology: developing surveys on how racial issues affect their campus, doing content analyses of media depictions of war and global poverty, helping numerous local community organizations improve their outreach efforts and effectiveness, among dozens of other projects. Many of these were either outlined specifically in or inspired by <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic>.</p>
<p>There are countless ways in which <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic> could contribute to or supplement a course with the aim or objective of providing these kinds of experiences and understandings to students. It could even serve as a primary text, probably to be supplemented by a set of readings. My only quibble is that its myriad ideas are often, too often in my opinion, presented in so many “boxes” scattered throughout each chapter that the reading flow of the text can be impeded. It’s a very well-written volume and Korgen and White’s text should be fully appreciated along with its many useful, informative sidebars (including such topics as how to uncover sweatshop labor on college campuses, organize to address hunger, or perform participant observation of a political demonstration).</p>
<p>I highly recommend <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic> for introductory courses in the foundations of sociology and social problems, but I think it could be a useful supplement in upper-level courses as well in which a direct service or other hands-on project may be planned. When I use the book, I instruct students to hold onto it, because I know there is a good chance I will want to use it again. And I have never gotten a complaint regarding my request. A course text that students willingly hold onto and agree not to resell? That might be reason enough to give <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic> a closer look.</p>
