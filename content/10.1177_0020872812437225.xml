<body>
<p>Chile’s main indigenous group is the Mapuche. The Mapuche are known for their strong cultural identity and a profound attachment to the land. In fact, in Mapundungun, their native language, ‘Mapuche’ signifies ‘people of the land’. Archeological evidence indicates that Mapuches have been present in Chile for more than 13,000 years, stretching from Chile’s central valleys to the southern island of Chiloé. Before the Spanish colonization during the 16th century it is estimated that there were over one million Mapuches living in Chile.</p>
<p>According to the 2002 Census, there are more than 600,000 people who identify themselves as Mapuche, representing 87.3 percent of people of indigenous descent in Chile. Today the largest population of Mapuches is found in the Araucania region, the region home to the highest indigent (27.1%) and poverty levels (14.9%) according to the 2009 Social Characterization Survey (CASEN) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mideplan.cl">www.mideplan.cl</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Advances in matters pertaining to the indigenous peoples in Chile are in Chile’s 1993 law 19.253, which places norms on the protection, fomentation, and development of indigenous peoples. Law 19.254 created the National Corporation aims to meet the needs and demands of indigenous peoples primarily through land restitution and programs focusing on cultural strengthening and productive development. In 2006, Chile also ratified the International Labor Organization’s Convention 169, which requires the recognition and protection of indigenous and tribal peoples.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Chile has advanced in implementing policies aimed at meeting the needs of indigenous populations since its return to democracy more than 20 years ago, what has been labeled the ‘Mapuche conflict’ has far from dissipated. Land disputes, high levels of poverty and indigence, unequal access to resources, high unemployment, as well as few development opportunities are only some of the pressing issues facing Mapuche communities today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437225">Valenzuela, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This article presents the most relevant findings of a case study of a Mapuche women’s organization, the Flor de Canelo Association, in the Nueva Imperial community of the Araucania region, Chile. The study examined intangible endogenous capitals that favor local development processes in this community. Specific emphasis was placed on analyzing cognitive, cultural, and institutional capitals and the findings are presented here.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872812437225">
<title>Local development</title>
<p>Initiatives that take into account the local realities of indigenous communities are needed in order to address the specific contextual problems these communities face. As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812437225">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref>, ‘(. . .) a current understanding of “indigenization” holds that social work knowledge should arise from within the culture, reflect local behaviors and practices, be interpreted within a local frame of reference and thus be locally relevant, that is, it should address culturally relevant and context-specific problems’ (p. 615). A local development perspective offers thus an optimum lens for studying indigenous initiatives that seek development and sustainability, due to its focus on local contexts that lead to improved life quality and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812437225">Madoery, 2000b</xref>).</p>
<p>The local development perspective is in strong agreement with theoretical and empirical assertions that economic growth is not synonymous with development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812437225">Alburquerque, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437225">Arocena, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812437225">Bervejillo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812437225">Chaparro, 1977</xref>). This perspective breaks away from a rational constructivist viewpoint, in which development is considered solely on technical terms. Instead, importance is placed on understanding the political, institutional, and cultural contexts in which development takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812437225">Madoery, 2000b</xref>). Within this perspective, additional elements are taken into consideration such as endogenous control, local knowledge, institutional networks, interaction between people, power relations, and the expansion of local capacities among other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812437225">Arocena, 1995</xref>). The process of local development is further considered intangible and endogenous due to its ties to local culture and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437225">González, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812437225">Madoery, 2000a</xref>).</p>
<p>Sergio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437225">Boisier (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">2000</xref>) offers a framework for studying local development, in which he identifies nine forms of intangible capitals that when properly articulated, generate endogenous processes that lead to development in a specific territory. Within the nine capitals Boisier identifies, this article will focus on three: cognitive capital, cultural capital, and institutional capital.</p>
<p>Cognitive capital refers to the scientific and technical knowledge available within a community. Cognitive capital as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437225">Boisier (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">2000</xref>) is not uniform and includes knowledge about territory (specifically geographic and historical knowledge) as well as scientific and technical knowledge that lead to growth and development. One of the challenges that local development faces today, particularly due to globalization, is the exogenous nature of cognitive capital as scientific and technical knowledge are concentrated in large transnational corporations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437225">Boisier (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">2000</xref>), the challenge for local development is reencountering local knowledge with local culture and traditions.</p>
<p>Cultural capital refers to the traditions, myths, beliefs, language, social relations, and the means of production of a particular community. Cultural capital within a certain community may or may not present traits that are inclined towards modernization as understood in Western society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437225">Boisier, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutional capital refers to the public and private institutions present in a given territory. It not only focuses on the number of institutions present but also on structural attributes that should be present in organizations. Institutional capital also places importance on the quality of the relationships between organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437225">Boisier, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The research method</title>
<sec id="section3-0020872812437225">
<title>The research design</title>
<p>This research utilized an interpretative, qualitative case study design. This design was chosen in order to capture a more in-depth understanding of the particular local development experience of the research respondents. The interpretative qualitative case study is defined as empirical and multifaceted, in which a contemporary phenomenon is studied in its proper context when the limits between the phenomenon and the context are not evident or clearly differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812437225">Corbetta, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812437225">Padgett (2008)</xref>, a case study seeks multiple sources of information in order to construct a more in-depth and meaningful understanding of specific experiences.</p>
<p>The local organization from the Nueva Imperial community named the Flor de Canelo Association was the focus of this case study analysis. This is a productive Association that manufactures Mapuche textile handicrafts and is composed of 200 active members from 15 different Mapuche indigenous communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872812437225">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>This study utilized multiple sources of data collection including document and record analysis, a focus group discussion, and a participant observation exercise. According to Yin (1984), utilizing multiple sources of information is always relevant in a case study for various reasons: it allows for corroborating evidence obtained through the use of other instruments; obtains more specific detail in regards to certain processes; formulates new questions to be applied in other instruments; as well as obtaining important information in regards to the phenomenon studied.</p>
<p>In this study, the following documents and records were scrutinized and analyzed:</p>
<list id="list1-0020872812437225" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Presentations of the Flor de Canelo Association;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Marketing brochures of the Association;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recordings of a news report about the Association from a national television station.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the document and report analysis, a focus group was organized with six female representatives of the Association including the Association’s president, treasurer, secretary, and quality assurance manager. Focus groups are particularly relevant when studying an organization or community because relationships are already present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812437225">Padgett, 2008</xref>). Lastly, a meeting of the Association was observed in which 10 community delegates were present including the board of directors of the Association.</p>

<sec id="section5-0020872812437225">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>In this study, the analysis of the information underwent two separate processes of description and interpretation. The data were grouped into themes linked to the three intangible capitals: cognitive, cultural, and institutional. In regards to cognitive capital, the themes identified were origin of knowledge, territorial knowledge, and knowledge transmission. Themes identified within cultural capital were relationships of solidarity and cooperation between the women, and complementarity in the endogenous and exogenous factors that influence local development. Institutional capital was identified with the themes of institutional support and coordination between institutions.</p>

<title>Research results</title>
<sec id="section7-0020872812437225">
<title>Cognitive capital</title>
<p>This study identified three core themes in cognitive capital: origin of knowledge, territorial knowledge, and knowledge transmission.</p>
<sec id="section8-0020872812437225">
<title>Origin of knowledge</title>
<p>The origin of their knowledge has been fundamental to the success of the Flor de Canelo Association. The women of the Association indicated that the knowledge they utilize comes from three sources: intergenerational family transfer, formal training, and experience. Each source provides a different type of knowledge but together enrich the knowledge found within the Association.</p>
<p>The first source of knowledge, intergenerational transmission, is taught primarily by women, specifically mothers and grandmothers, as well as great-grandmothers. This transmission of knowledge is directly related to the art of the product they produce specifically, the treatment of fabric and yarn, the weaving, and the color combination. This knowledge transfer is considered natural, which is to say it has not been sought out by the women nor has it been imposed on them by their mothers or grandmothers, but rather, has been assimilated naturally during daily interaction. One woman stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From my part the knowledge comes from my mother, from my grandmothers, it will now be over four generations more or less that have this knowledge and have leant it. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This intergenerational transmission of knowledge presented another interesting finding. As this knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the next, it is perfected, as the respondent also stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(. . .) we manage it better than before, for example we have produced new colors (. . .) (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From these statements it is possible to appreciate one of the principal characteristics of intangible cognitive capital, in which an increased use of this form of capital leads to increased rendition and greater knowledge accumulation. This is contrary to material or tangible capitals such as economic resources, which, over time, have become depleted. Cognitive capital is therefore, not only transmitted and utilized in favor of growth and development, but also grows and accumulates positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812437225">Silva, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier (2000)</xref>, a large part of cognitive capital belonging to a determined locality is exogenous. However, the intergenerational characteristic of the knowledge of the Flor de Canelo Association is of an endogenous nature as it is not dependant on exterior transfers but rather on internal reproduction through intergenerational transmission. This is important when considering the nature of the knowledge that is generated and transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812437225">Moncayo, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The second source of knowledge transmission is formal training. One woman commented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sure, for generations, but we have also have gone through training in institutions, we have grown in knowledge (. . .) for those other teachings we are studying. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unlike intergenerational transmission of knowledge, the knowledge acquired through formal training is of an exogenous nature since it comes from external institutions. This type of knowledge relates to the integration of technology into the Association in areas of manufacturing and management. Here technology is utilized to speed up the manufacturing process as well as facilitate business agreements using the Internet and financial software, which are acquired through training and consulting with external organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812437225">Silva, 2003</xref>). The analysis of this second source of knowledge demonstrates a second characteristic of intangible capital, which is the synergy created between intangible capitals that benefit the development process. In this specific case, it is possible to observe the synergy produced between cognitive capital based on formal training and institutional capital based on knowledge acquisition through training networks.</p>
<p>The third source of knowledge is experience. This type of knowledge refers specifically to the years dedicated to working the handicrafts that have led to creativity and innovation in the women’s work. This cognitive capital is also of a more endogenous nature as it comes from the women themselves in which experience becomes the source of innovation and creativity. The use of modern technologies as mentioned above is related to the innovation and creativity developed by the Association’s women since it provides the means for them to work with more safety and ease.</p>
<p>It is possible to discern that the three sources of cognitive knowledge as a whole offer interesting and relevant benefits to the Association. In particular, the positive results are due to experience and the relationship between local endogenous knowledge, specifically the intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge and traditions, and exogenous knowledge, primarily of a technical nature. These three sources of knowledge have led to the accumulation and growth of cognitive capital among the Mapuche women in favor of local development.</p>

<sec id="section9-0020872812437225">
<title>Territorial knowledge</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It belongs to the community in which we live, it is typical of here, we could say that it belongs to our culture because production in other places exists but it is different to the work we do here. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The phrase above from one of the women refers to knowledge as belonging to the territory and therefore of the culture which is endogenous in nature. The endogenous nature of this knowledge is not only relevant on its own but also due to the women recognizing the knowledge as their own, or as belonging to their culture. This claiming of their knowledge increases their motivation and their local development experience as mentioned by another woman, who said ‘Of course it belongs here, and this is important’ (authors’ translation).</p>
<p>Territory is important both physically and symbolically. In this local development experience, knowledge and culture as belonging to the territory have been fundamental for local benefit. It is important to highlight that territory in the local development perspective includes a number of meanings within which heterogeneity and complexity are taken into consideration as well as environmental characteristics, social actors and their strategies and projects as well as the existence of strategic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In this case, territory as a source of knowledge for the Flor de Canelo Association constitutes an enhancing element of development, not only because territory has influenced the traditions with which the women produce their handiwork, but because they have known how to use it in favor of successful local development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020872812437225">
<title>Intergenerational transmission</title>
<p>For the women in the Flor de Canelo Association it is clear that intergenerational transmission of cognitive capital will continue to future generations. In fact, many daughters have been incorporated into the Association’s work. However, the women recognize that it is not an obligation to learn the handicraft, stating that the most important factors to learning are interest and motivation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we have girls, we do not get anything by telling them you need to do this work or obligating them to do so, if they don’t want to its like obligating them (. . .) one has to have interest within oneself, one has to have interest and enthusiasm or else it isn’t worth much (. . .) When there is interest all is possible. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that a new phenomenon is occurring in which men of the community are also being incorporated into the intergenerational transmission of knowledge:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Times are changing, now the situation between men and women is different (. . .). In my case, we are four, my son, my daughter, my husband, all of us are involved but my husband knows the most simple, he can help in spinning or making handicrafts. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though men are only assigned simple tasks, it is relevant to mention it as this cognitive capital has traditionally been considered female work, but is now being passed on to the men of the community. Of special interest is the women pointing out that ‘Boys are faster in learning’ (authors’ translation).</p>
<p>The incorporation of men has resulted in other positive outcomes in this local development experience for two reasons: overcoming macho barriers to female participation in work and an increase in the work force. Traditionally women would have encountered difficulty in participating in such an Association due to the macho characteristics found within the culture, specifically negative perceptions about female work outside the home and the capacity for women to earn more than men. However, this experience demonstrated that as the men participated actively in this initiative such macho barriers were overcome. Furthermore, the men’s work also helped in increasing production. It is however important to mention that although men were incorporated into the labor of the organization, the Association’s organization and management remained in the hands of the women. Therefore it is possible to affirm that family participation and cooperation were key in attaining the objectives of the Flor de Canelo Association.</p>
<p>In all, cognitive capital has been a fundamental pillar in this local development experience. It has allowed the Association to appropriate cultural and territorial knowledge as well as integrate technological advances in the Association’s manufacturing and management processes, advances that have been key to the success of the Flor de Canelo Association.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020872812437225">
<title>Cultural capital</title>
<p>Cultural capital according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier (2000)</xref> refers to the accumulation of rites, traditions, language, and social traditions among other elements belonging to a determined locality. Within this concept culture is not only understood generically but also in terms of cultural development, particularly the attitudes that favor this process within the community.</p>
<p>It is possible to identify cultural capital in the Flor de Canelo Association through the following themes:</p>
<sec id="section12-0020872812437225">
<title>Solidarity and cooperation</title>
<p>It was possible to observe through the participant observation exercise that relationships are characterized by trust, respect, solidarity, and cooperation. The weakest members were supported, work was equally distributed, and mutual agreements that privileged the common good were reached.</p>
<p>In their own words, the women explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes there are problems, but one resolves them, let’s say, through talking, we are more likely to talk things over. Or not harm one another. (Authors’ translation)</p>
<p>[. . .] for me personally it is about cooperation because since I have been knitting I like to teach and I like that the others win as well and when I knit I send out to spin and to another women I send out to sew, I think that I am cooperating with all the rest in order to benefit not only myself but all of us. (Authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relationships of cooperation and solidarity are found primarily at two levels: the first in relation to the work, which relates to the importance placed on equally distributing workloads, with the understanding that all must be involved on the same level in order to receive equal economic benefits. Furthermore, it is understood that hoarding work is not only a loss of time but also a loss of benefit for the group. The Association understands that group work is much more efficient than individual competitive work, making cooperation a strong characteristic of the Association.</p>
<p>The importance placed on maintaining good relationships is a second characteristic of the relationship between the women of the Association. This does not mean conflict-free relationships but rather that they have the capacity to confront conflicts adequately through conversation. This has been a key factor in the positive results of this local development experience.</p>
<p>The initiation and maintenance of relationships based on solidarity and cooperation are also due to experience. It has been the women’s collective experiences that have shown them that relationships based on collaboration are more beneficial on a personal and professional level and lead to optimum benefits for the organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0020872812437225">
<title>Complementing the endogenous with the exogenous</title>
<p>Another element associated with cultural capital is the culture itself. This specific local development experience, according to the Association’s women, has been the renewal of the Mapuche culture based on faithfully respecting what has been inherited from their ancestors, while adapting to ‘new times’. The Association’s women are proud and feel that the success of the Association is a cultural success but they are also aware that their success has been further propelled by the international market’s interest in Mapuche textiles for its symbolism and traditions.</p>
<p>The Flor de Canelo Association’s members are aware that modern processes of an exogenous character can complement and improve their work, yet the rescue of the essential elements of an endogenous character is not only due to cultural factors associated with traditions but is also a strategy in terms of taking advantage of the current international interest in indigenous products. There is a tendency to value highly these products that, complemented with quality assurance processes by the Flor de Canelo Association, has been a key factor in the success of this particular experience.</p>
<p>Once again, it is possible to appreciate the synergy produced between the endogenous and exogenous.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020872812437225">
<title>Institutional capital</title>
<p>Institutional capital can be divided into two central aspects: the number of public and private organizations that exist in the locality and the characteristics that these institutions’ possess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier, 2000</xref>). This investigation considered the characteristics of the institutions in more depth.</p>
<p>It is possible to identify the following themes when analyzing the role of institutional capital in the Flor de Canelo Association.</p>
<sec id="section15-0020872812437225">
<title>Private and public institutions are fundamental supports</title>
<p>Both private and public institutions have supported the Flor de Canelo Association in diverse forms. The private institutions that have played a role in contributing to the Association are nonprofit organizations such as Fundación Chol-Chol<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020872812437225">1</xref></sup> and the Institución Tierra Viva.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020872812437225">2</xref></sup> Both these institutions have played a key role in guiding the Association from its beginning stages particularly in its organization and systematization. Public institutions such as the Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversión Social (FOSIS),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020872812437225">3</xref></sup> the Ministry of Education, the Service for Technical Cooperation (SERCOTEC),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020872812437225">4</xref></sup> and the Municipality of Nueva Imperial<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020872812437225">5</xref></sup> also play key roles in supporting the Association.</p>
<p>Each of the aforementioned institutions contributed to the growth and consolidation of the Flor de Canelo Association through training, economic support, technical support, and human resources. According to the women’s discourses, this institutional support has benefited the Association by assisting them in finding new forms of relating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812437225">Muñoz, 2003</xref>), assuming positive leadership roles, negotiating effectively with providers and buyers, offering quality products, and opening horizons in relation to the market in which to sell their products.</p>
<p>The contributions from these institutions have however been varied. Some have been present in granting specific and concrete services such as FOSIS, in regards to economic resources, and the Ministry of Education regarding training. Others, such as Fundación Chol-Chol and the municipality of Nueva Imperial, have offered permanent support that has been present throughout the process of the Association, although they have slowly diminished their participation as the Association has grown and consolidated itself. In fact, the goal of the municipality was to empower the women and work towards the Association’s autonomy.</p>

<title>Lack of coordination among the supportive institutions</title>
<p>Regarding institutional capital, and as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier (2000)</xref>, the number and size of the institutions involved is not the only important aspect in local development but also the types of inter-organizational relationships that are established.</p>
<p>In this study, there were no existing relationships between the institutions involved. This does not mean that there have been conflictual relationships but that each institution has acted according to its own logic, rhythm, and space without generating synergy between them.</p>
<p>This situation raises the question that if a successful local development process has been established with parceled support from different institutions, how much more could results not improve if the institutions acted in a coordinated and integrated manner.</p>
<p>In this sense, institutional capital has been limited, due to the fact that if there had been more cooperation between institutions, its impact would have been greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437225">Boisier, 2000</xref>). This study however concentrated on the number of institutions involved and the support they have given the Association, but not the relationships established between them.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>In today’s globalized world, the local is often forgotten or cast aside. However, for social work, especially in Latin America, interculturality, respect for indigenous peoples, and local development are areas of intervention that need further study. This article sheds light on some challenges the profession faces in regards to local development in an indigenous cultural environment.</p>
<p>The first challenge for the profession is to consider territory as a central element, especially in the case of collective interventions, not only from a geographic perspective, but also from its symbolic, historical, and intangible dimensions. Thus, it is essential that social workers possess knowledge and understanding of a territory, of its people, and the social processes that are developed there. In this specific case, territory as a source of knowledge for the Flor de Canelo Association acts as an enhancer of development, not only because it is the territory that has marked the traditions with which the women have designed their products, but also because they have known how to use it and take advantage of it in order to promote a successful local development.</p>
<p>Second, the results of this investigation demonstrate that it is important for social work to strengthen local dynamics based on the capacities of the actors involved, as well as the intangible capitals of the territory and the specific characteristics found within it. This is especially relevant in the case of indigenous populations in which historic, cultural, and endogenous elements constitute a highly effective resource to propel local development processes.</p>
<p>Further, the findings that the creation and maintenance of cooperative and supportive relationships through experience over time are important. These relationships, rather than those based on competition and individualism, are more beneficial on a personal and organizational level.</p>
<p>The third challenge for social work in the region consists in reversing the logic of social policies that, at least in the case of Chile, are still tied to traditional paradigms in which summative, efficient, exogenous, and short-term logic predominate. The rescue of intangible capital in local space is an opportunity for social work to promote increased ownership and pertinence of local programs.</p>
<p>In sum, the following quote captures the challenges indigenous social work faces:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>More important for indigenous contexts, social work’s dominant modern foundation that includes human rights, individualism, and materialism, cannot adequately deal with the responsibilities that membership in a particular community and place, relationship patterns, and/or longstanding cultural traditions require. For indigenous peoples – for whom relationship to community is experienced as part of the fabric of their identity – this denial of history and place has been immensely damaging and disempowering, and challenging it lies at the heart of Indigenous social work.
