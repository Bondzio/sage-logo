<abstract>
<p>In this article, we outline the necessary action steps for schools to improve the achievement of bilingual students. We review, summarize, and utilize the pertinent scholarly literature to make suggestions for school-wide, collaborative efforts to support the achievement of bilingual learners through linguistically responsive pedagogy and practice. Our research-based recommendations include the need for school actors to negotiate language policy and mandates, lay the necessary ideological foundations, build effective school structures and systems, and foster meaningful collaboration with families and communities. When teachers, administrators, counselors, families, and community members work together, schools can improve to promote the social, cultural, linguistic, and academic achievement of bilingual students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schools across the world are more diverse today than ever before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450235">Banks, 2008</xref>), including a rise in students who enter classrooms speaking a language other than the medium-of-instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1365480212450235">Tsui &amp; Tollefson, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, cultural diversity maintains the predominant focus in educational literature, with language subsumed as one aspect of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212450235">Lucas, Villegas, &amp; Freedson-Gonzalez, 2008</xref>). As language diversity increases in the school-age population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450235">Banks, 2007</xref>), educators must acknowledge and address the challenges and issues related to linguistic difference. When schools make an explicit effort to improve practice around language-related issues, educators can effectively support bilingual students’ social, cultural, linguistic, and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). Building on the notion of <italic>culturally responsive practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212450235">Gay, 2010</xref>), we utilize <italic>linguistically responsive practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212450235">Lucas et al., 2008</xref>) to conceptualize the school that constructs policies, foundations, structures, and communities to value, celebrate, and utilize language and linguistic diversity.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to share recommendations to improve schools for bilingual students, grounded in the scholarly literature and our practical experiences in schools. Our dialogue on effective practices with bilingual students began in a doctoral seminar entitled ‘Linguistically responsive practice: Re-thinking language education in the United States’, which utilized current research to push forward discussion on language education in various contexts. Each author contributed a unique perspective to the dialogue with our past and current professional roles, including the lenses of administrator, instructional coach, teacher, professor, community member, and parent. With varying experiences in education, including curriculum, instruction, assessment, administration, and policies, the seminar sparked participants’ interests in contributing to a field of growing importance internationally. The present text offers its readers an amalgamation of theory and practice, as guided by a) readings that began our conversations on the topic, b) pertinent literature on language education to enrich and provide comprehensive, research-based recommendations for schools, and c) general literature on effective school change to address the gaps in language-specific research.</p>
<p>We explain how school actors can collaborate with colleagues, parents, and partners to conceptualize and utilize linguistic diversity as an opportunity, rather than a challenge. Our goal is to encourage local actors to improve and change schools from within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212450235">Barth, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1365480212450235">2004</xref>), linking theory and practice to provide practical tools for all stakeholders. Rather than create a list of static characteristics or fixed factors that oversimplifies the process of school improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1365480212450235">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1365480212450235">2004</xref>), we utilize the findings in the broader literature to outline a sequence of dynamic and flexible steps for each unique school to reflect and embark upon the change process to a) negotiate language policy and practice, b) lay the ideological groundwork for school change, c) build school structures and support systems, and d) foster collaborative communities of learners (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1365480212450235">Table 1</xref>). We close with future directions for research and practice to open the door for continued school improvement for bilingual students.</p>

<title>Negotiate language policy and practice</title>
<p>Educators often talk wistfully about what happens when they close the classroom door and get down to the business of teaching, where <italic>closing the door</italic> symbolizes shutting out policies that get in the way of vibrant and responsive teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212450235">Heineke &amp; Cameron, 2012</xref>). By closing the door the teacher creates an educational space shielded from outside pressures, but simultaneously limits the possibility for broader advocacy for students inside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). Teachers must open their classrooms and embrace opportunities to improve education for bilingual students on a larger scale. Educators then begin to build linguistically responsive schools through the negotiation of language policy and practice to a) investigate required policies and guidelines, b) recognize the school’s unique linguistic needs and challenges, and c) advocate for bilingual students.</p>
<sec id="section3-1365480212450235">
<title>Investigate language policies and guidelines</title>
<p>Language policy guides educators in the design and implementation of language teaching and learning. Described as an onion to capture the complexities of the many agents and processes involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212450235">Evans &amp; Hornberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1365480212450235">Ricento &amp; Hornberger, 1996</xref>), policy is not a strict prescription, but rather a guide to inform local practice in each unique school setting. While the onion-like layers can create inconsistency and confusion, educators can find space within their practice to work and advocate for the benefit of their bilingual students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212450235">Johnson and Freeman (2010)</xref> note that ‘even within ostensibly restrictive language policies, there is often <italic>implementational space</italic> that local educators and language planners can work to their advantage’ (p. 14). Rather than utilize the notion of rote implementation, language policy <italic>appropriation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212450235">Levinson &amp; Sutton, 2001</xref>) begins when local actors investigate the mandated guidelines for teaching.</p>
<p>Language policies (e.g. Bilingual Education Act, California’s Proposition 227) and legal precedents (e.g. <italic>Lau v. Nichols, Castaneda v. Pickard</italic>) guide the educational requirements and provide contexts for advocacy on the behalf of bilingual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1365480212450235">Wiley, 2001</xref>). Familiarity with broader policies enables educators to use a given policy as justification to seek approval and resources to support locally identified initiatives and practices. For example, school leaders can leverage policy requirements to foster inclusive reform for bilingual students and encourage community building and professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1365480212450235">Theoharis &amp; O’Toole, 2011</xref>). An administrator in the United States might use specific language from a piece of legislation, such as the seemingly rigid Title III of the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) which actually states the requirement for staff development and funding to increase the promotion of family and community participation.</p>
<p>When educators understand the language policies of the school context, they can find the implementational space to identify possibilities for promoting positive change. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212450235">Johnson and Freeman (2010)</xref> note ‘the line of power does not flow linearly from the pen of the policy’s signer to the choices of the teacher’ (p. 27). In the ample space between the layers of language policy and the practice carried out in classrooms, teachers have multiple opportunities to influence the policies and practices that directly impact bilingual students. Familiarity with local and national policies leads educators to a better understanding of the frameworks in which they work and provides greater leverage to advocate for bilingual students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1365480212450235">
<title>Recognize the linguistic needs at the school</title>
<p>Imploring educators to engage with the dilemmas facing schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés (2001)</xref> notes that ‘adequate policies and practices can only be implemented if policy makers, school administrators, and practitioners begin with a deep and clear understanding of the complexity of the issues surrounding the acquisition of English by minority youngsters’ (p. 9). In addition to knowledge of the policies that guide the education of bilingual students, local actors need a firm understanding of the issues related to second language instruction, assessment, and achievement, as well as the unique challenges of the school context.</p>
<p>The broad obstacles to the achievement of bilingual students are well-documented in the literature. Challenges that span across educational contexts include a) inappropriate testing and assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212450235">Abedi, 2007</xref>), b) inadequate teacher training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212450235">Gandara &amp; Hopkins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212450235">Garcia et al., 2010</xref>), c) insufficient exposure to challenging academic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450235">Callahan, Wilkinson, &amp; Muller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212450235">Olsen, 2010</xref>), d) deficit mentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>), e) curricular isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450235">Callahan et al., 2010</xref>), f) poverty and familial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450235">August &amp; Hakuta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco, Suarez-Orozco, &amp; Todorova, 2008</xref>), and g) lack of appropriate curriculum, materials, and resources dedicated to educating bilingual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212450235">Gándara, Rumberger, Maxwell-Jolly, &amp; Callahan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212450235">Olsen, 2010</xref>). Educators need to collaboratively discuss and investigate the issues that directly affect their practice and ability to meet the needs of their bilingual students. By recognizing and outlining the challenges faced within the unique school context, teachers can make decisions that are specifically grounded in local practice rather than broad policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1365480212450235">
<title>Advocate for bilingual students</title>
<p>Educators who work directly with students are the most immediate advocates for bilingual pupils. A well-informed teacher – familiar with language policy guidelines and aware of the unique linguistic needs – can better advocate for classroom and program resources. Critical to instruction and advocacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis and Coulter (2008)</xref> explain that teachers need to develop a <italic>commitment in practice</italic> to question and redesign the local context and beyond, which begins with sound knowledge of policies that are the foundation of programs for bilingual students. Advocacy-minded educators can inform administration and colleagues of policies, research, and best practices to positively shape the educational experiences of bilingual students. For example, an understanding of the complexities and limitations of testing policies will enable educators to make better-informed decisions and advocate for local policy change if needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212450235">Gándara &amp; Baca, 2008</xref>). As local educators who work directly with students deepen their understanding of the web of regulatory policies, they can better use these policies, laws, and regulations as a lever to make positive change in schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1365480212450235">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<td>Administrators in the School District of Philadelphia found that flexibility in the wording of a restrictive language policy allowed implementational space for the development of bilingual education.

The initiative encouraged an <italic>egalitarian discourse community</italic> of language policy developers in which educational researchers, administrators, and teachers worked together to develop programs promoting additive bilingualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212450235">Johnson &amp; Freeman, 2010</xref>).</td>

<p>With knowledge of language policies to guide and frame practice, paired with an evaluation of the broad challenges documented in research and the specific needs of unique school contexts, local educators can appropriate policy into effective and meaningful practice as a way to advocate for bilingual students. If teachers collaborate openly and regularly while bringing policy into their classrooms, the likelihood of effective practices being implemented will increase radically. When the implementational space is used to negotiate policy to match the needs of the local context, educators can then move forward to improve their work with bilingual students by defining the macro-level vision, mission, and culture of the school.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1365480212450235">
<title>Lay the ideological groundwork for school change</title>
<p>A school’s vision, mission, and culture should invest all school actors – faculty, administration, parents, and students – created collectively from the bottom up to set goals for student learning that are grounded in individual school values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes, Nadeau, &amp; Commins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>), such as the development of lifelong learners, global citizens, or social advocates. Ideological statements should describe what students will learn and do as a result of attending that particular school and target the student population and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>). Schools may opt for a formal <italic>language policy document</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212450235">Johnson &amp; Freeman, 2010</xref>) that reflects the vision and mission, as well as its adherence to policy requirements and regulations. Steps to build the school foundations include a) drafting a vision that incorporates linguistic diversity, b) defining a mission with goals to guide daily practice, and c) cultivating a culture of achievement and diversity. Vision statements serve as the commonly desired destination, and mission statements act as the step-by-step directions on how to arrive at that destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212450235">Gabriel &amp; Farmer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1365480212450235">
<title>Draft a vision that incorporates linguistic diversity</title>
<p>A school dedicated to improving the education of bilingual students should utilize an explicit lens on the appreciation and contribution of linguistic diversity to teaching and learning. By initiating a school-wide vision, stakeholders ground daily practice in the recognition and maintenance of a strong commitment to bilingual student achievement. When drafting or revising a school vision, pertinent elements include: a) an emphasis on the value of linguistic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes et al., 2011</xref>), b) a description of how bilingual students will contribute to the school community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>), c) a sketch of how teachers will deliver the curriculum in a way that is culturally and linguistically responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>), and d) a statement in the native language of students and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1365480212450235">Waterman, 2006</xref>). With a vision that is decided upon by all stakeholders and is clear, concise, and easily remembered, a school’s programs and practices can then be assessed for their roles in getting to the envisioned destination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1365480212450235">
<title>Define a mission with goals to guide daily practice</title>
<p>The school vision serves as a springboard for stakeholders to jointly develop a mission for students’ social, cultural, linguistic and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212450235">Horwitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). The act of creating common, unifying goals for a school that stretch across disciplines, grade levels, and learners can result in ‘swift, dramatic improvements in schools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212450235">Schmoker, 2011</xref>, p. 1). Similarly, schools whose bilingual students demonstrate substantial academic progress developed and communicated a unified vision of instructional reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212450235">Horwitz et al., 2009</xref>). The mission statement must: a) define the school’s purpose, b) describe the school’s directions and functions, and c) outline the values and core competencies to help achieve the mission (Davis, Ruhe, Lee, &amp; Rajadhyaksha, 2006) in clear and measurable language to enable monitoring and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450235">Boyle, 2010</xref>). At a linguistically responsive school, faculty utilize the mission statement to outline linguistic goals for students, which would ideally emphasize <italic>additive bilingualism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes et al., 2011</xref>) and encourage achievement in multiple languages or dialects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212450235">Siegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The mission should reflect a shared responsibility of the school community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1365480212450235">2003</xref>). Every teacher, counselor, and administrator should feel the same sense of responsibility to meet the needs of every student, including bilingual students. Because the mission statement drives curriculum, instruction, and coherence of initiatives, staff members and community partners must participate in its creation; while this makes drafting the statement more laborious, the outcome will increase fidelity to the mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450235">Boyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212450235">Gabriel &amp; Farmer, 2009</xref>). Stakeholders must collectively find the words to align focus, invest them in the school community, and positively affect student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212450235">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). Through developing explicit statements regarding the school’s mission for bilingual student achievement, educators gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their own personal perspectives of what it means to teach bilingual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes et al., 2011</xref>). This active construction of goals and outcomes provides an opportunity for school actors to engage in meaningful collaboration to begin to cultivate a culture of achievement and diversity.</p>

<p>School personnel play a critical role in creating educational environments that welcome, promote, and hold high expectations for bilingual student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). After defining the mission, faculty should implement practices for bilingual students to feel valued within the school. Rather than be the sole source of knowledge in the classroom, educators should enhance classroom learning through the integration of the cultural and linguistic <italic>funds of knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>) of students, families, and communities. In so doing, teachers ‘formulate a pedagogy specific to their situations and that builds strategically on the social relations and cultural resources of their school’s community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>, p. 91). Students’ unique and dynamic experiences with cultures, languages and literacies are then conceptualized and utilized as beneficial resources, not deficits or barriers to learning.</p>
<p>Educators should begin by investigating the practices and resources at students’ homes to determine funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212450235">Zentella, 2005</xref>). Examination of socialization practices can inform how students acquire and use cultural and linguistic practices within families and communities and how those skills might be utilized in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212450235">Heath, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212450235">Zentella, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212450235">Heath (1982)</xref> compared home and school discourse patterns for asking and answering questions; by recording and having students listen to their oral use of questions and statements, teachers supported the learning of unfamiliar classroom discourse to better communicate with teachers and classmates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll and Gonzalez (1997)</xref> describe a teacher’s qualitative study and discovery of families’ expertise in the medicinal use of plants and herbs; when designing a unit on plants, the teacher then incorporated lessons on how plants might be used to treat or cure certain illnesses. While no prescriptive method exists for connecting home lives to classroom pedagogy, these examples provide models for teachers on how to best utilize students’ funds of knowledge. If teachers are willing to open their classrooms to create opportunities for students and their families, a classroom community can become more culturally and linguistically responsive while also deepening rapport among students and teachers.</p>
<p>General guidelines for culturally relevant teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212450235">Gay, 2010</xref>) can help teachers create learning communities that value cultural and linguistic diversity, while simultaneously holding high expectations for achievement. A teacher with culturally relevant pedagogy helps students: a) make connections between the content being taught and students’ community, national, and global identities, b) work collaboratively in learning communities to teach one another, and c) develop necessary skills and maintain rigorous academic standards, while respecting diversity and individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212450235">Ladson-Billings, 2009</xref>). Enacting culturally relevant pedagogy also requires that learning environments reflect the concept of <italic>hybridity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212450235">Gutierrez, Baquedano-Lopez, &amp; Tejeda, 1999</xref>) to bring together and embody multiple languages, worldviews, ways of reasoning, and roles for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212450235">Lee, 2008</xref>). To build specifically on linguistic funds of knowledge, teachers can utilize the <italic>critical language awareness</italic> approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212450235">Siegel, 2006</xref>); students’ languages and dialects become the medium-of-instruction to critically analyze the institutional demand for standard English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212450235">Lippi-Green, 1997</xref>) and build the collective identity associated with their linguistic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212450235">Ogbu, 1999</xref>). Teachers can use these principles to reflect on the classroom created under their direction, as well as foster an environment where students are valued for the resources they bring to the learning community (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1365480212450235">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>A school’s vision, mission, and culture should welcome, respect, and value bilingual students and their families. All school stakeholders, including administrators, classroom teachers, resource teachers, counselors, and advisors, must be involved in this process to collaboratively construct school structures and support systems that foster personal, social, cultural, linguistic, and academic success. Through collaboration and openness to the opinions of others, educators can begin to construct a more linguistically responsive school.</p>

<title>Build school structures and support systems</title>
<p>A school’s priorities, as determined and defined through its ideological statements, should be reflected in the physical, temporal, and curricular structures that drive daily practices. Without the necessary structures and supports in place, a school’s vision, mission, and culture are unlikely to manifest in the actions of teachers and students. Educators who aim to become more linguistically responsive should evaluate the school structure, systems and schedule and consider specific changes to support the social, cultural, linguistic, and academic growth of bilingual students.</p>
<sec id="section11-1365480212450235">
<title>Evaluate and align school structures and schedule</title>
<p>The overall structure of a school must reflect the ideological foundations of an inclusive learning community that celebrates linguistic diversity and student achievement. Research on bilingual students reveals that common impediments to school success include students’ lack of positive engagement, prevalence of social isolation, and lack of authentic access and use of the medium-of-instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). To overcome challenges and create a positive and productive learning environment, bilingual students must be included in the larger school community, thus having opportunities for meaningful interaction with peers and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>). This begins with the physical layout of the building, ensuring that bilingual students are not sequestered to one wing or classroom, but rather given access to the school and mainstream student body as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). In addition, the inclusion of hallway displays to celebrate cultural and linguistic diversity should be present across the facility, such as flags that represent students’ countries of origin and banners in students’ native languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The schedule represents the values that drive a school, such as the time allotted for common planning periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212450235">DiMartino &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>). As school actors work together through common planning time to best support their students socially, emotionally, culturally, linguistically, and academically, classroom doors open for educators to engage in collaboration, observation, co-teaching, and professional development to reflect on and fine-tune practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212450235">DiMartino &amp; Clark, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>). This is particularly important for teachers of bilingual students, as learning communities and collaboration create a shared sense of belonging, and similar practices across settings take the guesswork out of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212450235">Harklau, 1999</xref>). Finding time for school staff to collaborate around curricula, instructional practices, and contextual issues is unlikely to occur unless that time is set aside during the work day for that purpose. When scheduled successfully, common planning time allows teachers to share strategies, assess student work, and plan subsequent units. In addition to classroom teachers, counselors, support staff, and partners can be influential collaborators.</p>
<p>When a school’s master schedule is created, school leaders must create opportunities for teachers to make decisions based on student achievement data and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1365480212450235">Oxley, 2007</xref>). To allow teachers to get to know students and their unique needs on a deeper level to make data-driven and well-informed decisions, schools can organize the larger school population through learning communities wherein teachers and counselors work with the same group of students over time, known as <italic>looping</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1365480212450235">Oxley, 2007</xref>). Looping fosters enduring rapport between students, teachers, families, and curriculums, which particularly benefits immigrant students’ adjustment to new school environments, educators, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212450235">Haslinger, Kelly, &amp; O’Lare, 1996</xref>). When bilingual students stay with the same teacher and peers for at least two years, they are more likely to take risks during second language acquisition and make greater social, linguistic and academic gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212450235">Haslinger et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1365480212450235">
<title>Organize social networks and relationships</title>
<p>Mentors and school-based relationships are integral to promote the success of bilingual students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco and colleagues (2008)</xref> state the importance of mentoring relationships to help maneuver obstacles typical to immigrants and diverse groups. In addition to support through new cultural and linguistic differences and challenges, mentors guide students through other school-based realities such as peer relationships, college entrance, and negative social pressures like gangs or substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212450235">Harklau, 1999</xref>). Overall, of keen importance is that every student has an adult mentor and advocate who guides and monitors progress through the holistic schooling experience to ensure that no student <italic>falls through the cracks</italic>. With every individual student matched strategically with an effective adult mentor, this longitudinal and targeted attention through relationships increases bilingual student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The adult mentor can then match students with the appropriate social networks and resources to meet their unique social, cultural, linguistic, and academic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212450235">Gillies, Wilson, Soden, Gray, &amp; McQueen, 2010</xref>). A home–school liaison teacher may be given release time from teaching or other duties to conduct home visits and identify and take steps to overcome barriers that impede school–family relationships or integration into the school community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). Based on the anecdotal data collected by mentors, these networks may be grassroots efforts to meet the needs of immigrant students, such as weekly counseling groups for immigrants who have experienced traumatic situations or family separations, or after-school bilingual study sessions to help students with specific linguistic and academic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to targeted supports, social networks must also include opportunities for bilingual students to interact with peers in activities that match their interests, such as enrichment and extra-curricular programming after school hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). During school hours, strong social networks are fostered through strategic placement of students in advisory, resource, and elective classes to encourage social growth and personal connections and engage students in learning and school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1365480212450235">
<title>Target and scaffold language to support achievement</title>
<p>Longitudinal support through school-based relationships and social networks must be paired with the appropriate scaffolds to set students up for success in schools. Extensive studies of bilingual students have demonstrated the devastating lack of opportunities for movement and transitions between language programs and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450235">Callahan et al., 2010</xref>; Suarez-Orozco et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). The term ‘ESL ghetto’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>, p. 145) is used to describe the low-level language track that is difficult to escape without a clear path and ample opportunities for students to advance to American mainstream content and classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). When students are able to shed the label and move beyond language-specific instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1365480212450235">Gutierrez &amp; Orellana, 2006</xref>), the lack of transitions between language program models and contexts deters the rate of success in new academic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>); a <italic>second immigration</italic> occurs when students are moved into a new context (e.g. bilingual elementary setting to ESL middle school classroom) with no targeted transition or scaffolded language support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With these findings in mind, school actors must ensure that bilingual students: a) are held to high expectations for both linguistic proficiency and academic achievement, b) have clear pathways to move into rigorous content curriculum, and c) receive appropriate transitions through various program models. For example, if school personnel decide to utilize ESL classrooms to target English instruction for emergent language learners, teachers must set rigorous goals and expectations to guide the instruction that specifically sets up students for success in content and mainstream classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). Cognizant of clear guidelines for language instruction, teachers must critically analyze the provided curriculum, textbooks, and materials to ensure that effective and meaningful teaching and learning is occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212450235">Crookes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212450235">Gulliver, 2010</xref>). Using portfolios and other formative classroom assessments can demonstrate student growth to guide this targeted and scaffolded linguistic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1365480212450235">Spinelli, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Plan and provide rigorous academic instruction</title>
<p>Daily instruction of bilingual students must not stop with language; students must have access to rigorous academic instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212450235">Valdés, 2001</xref>). Many schools utilize sheltered instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212450235">Krashen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212450235">1987</xref>) to allow students exposure to content while simultaneously scaffolding language. Originally defined as a way to make input comprehensible to students based on language proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212450235">Krashen, 1987</xref>), the approach was operationalized to provide teachers with a variety of practical and flexible strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212450235">Echevarria, Short, &amp; Vogt, 2011</xref>). Research on bilingual student achievement demonstrates the benefit of effective use of sheltered strategies, including a) a non-stressful atmosphere where risk-taking is encouraged (Horwitz et al., 2011), b) active learning contexts that provide frequent interaction and language use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450235">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>), c) real-world and relevant activities and materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1365480212450235">Toohey, 2000</xref>), d) technology use to support and enrich learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450235">Cummins, 2009</xref>), e) access to authentic English, including academic language and vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450235">Cummins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212450235">Villareal, 2007</xref>), and f) use of students’ native language as a resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212450235">Zentella, 2005</xref>).

<title>Foster collaborative communities of learners</title>
<p>In a community of learners, multiple stakeholders are involved in and dedicated to student achievement, and their varying expertise informs the process of improving schools for bilingual students. Creating the spaces, foundations, and structures described above requires the engagement of well-prepared educators, as well as the development of a broader community of learners that extends beyond school grounds. The kind of collaboration necessary moves beyond inviting community partners into schools; schools must fully and equitably engage partners in the change process to formulate relationships that support student achievement.

All school actors should have a strong base in theories, research, and pedagogy for teaching bilingual students, preferably having gone through the process of second language acquisition personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212450235">Lucas et al., 2008</xref>) to relate to the plight of students in the process of learning the majority language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212450235">Bartlett &amp; Garcia, 2011</xref>) and medium-of-instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1365480212450235">Tsui &amp; Tollefson, 2004</xref>). In addition to linguistic knowledge, educators need know pertinent social and cultural attributes that affect academic performance, such as prior schooling experiences in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212450235">Farr &amp; Barajas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>) and specific familial expectations based on cultural and linguistic viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212450235">McCarty, 2002</xref>; Ogbu, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212450235">Zentella, 2005</xref>), to open the classroom door to support each student as a whole person.</p>
<p>Once general knowledge on language teaching and learning is established, a school’s professional development time should model a community of learners and allow school actors to learn from one another. Instead of isolated, short-term trainings, teachers can collaborate in study groups to ground learning in the unique school context. Professional development sessions, supported by valuable localized knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>), are venues for teachers to identify cultural biases, critically examine communication with students and families, and engage in sustained interaction to develop mutually supportive relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1365480212450235">Terrion, 2006</xref>). In study groups, teachers formulate specific strategies they might employ in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1365480212450235">Thibodeau, 2008</xref>) and draw upon students’ cultural and linguistic resources to address students’ social and academic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212450235">Brooks, Adams, &amp; Morita-Mullaney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>).

<p>After building and utilizing internal capacities to improve practice for diverse learners, school actors need to recognize where external capacities would best suit the professional development of teachers and other staff. Schools must then seek out opportunities for community partners such as foundations, libraries, community centers, other schools, families, and universities, to share pertinent information with the faculty. When both internal and external stakeholders come together as a broader school community to create and engage in a targeted plan for growth together, the result of such bottom-up planning is higher involvement and engagement from all involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to supporting teacher dialogue and learning, enlisting and engaging community actors improves schools for bilingual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Enlist and engage multiple community stakeholders</title>
<p>Schools benefit from building collaborative relationships with stakeholders in the community. Because time is such a precious commodity in schools, engaging external partners can be critical to ensure that all students’ needs are met. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212450235">Suarez-Orozco and colleagues (2008)</xref> argue that ‘addressing immigrant families’ needs through partnerships among after-school groups, community organizations, schools, and churches would go a long way toward expanding these networks of supportive relations and easing the transition for these families’ (p. 87). When a learning community is composed of both the school and the larger community, and it is focused on the students, schools may be better equipped to engage students in their education.</p>
<p>The vision of an equitable learning community is one where teachers, administrators, parents, community leaders, university faculty, and others come together to support the learning of one another and commit to the collaborative effort to create change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). Each stakeholder is an expert who contributes valued knowledge to promote the school’s mission, foster student learning, and improve education for the children in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212450235">McCarty, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212450235">Miramontes et al., 2011</xref>). Through active involvement in school change, teachers, students, families, and others have a voice through community-based, bottom-up efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450235">Cummins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212450235">McCarty, 2002</xref>). This places the responsibility for cultivating student learning on schools and communities, who then are not completely reliant on outside experts to direct the education of youth. To achieve a collaborative community, all stakeholders should be considered and invited into the school to share responsibility for student learning. Schools can conduct an <italic>asset inventory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212450235">Kretzman &amp; McKnight, 1993</xref>) of the community and identify organizations they can partner with to support bilingual student achievement.</p>

<title>Mutually collaborate with parents and families</title>
<p>The pertinent two-way relationship between home and school must be mutually supportive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212450235">Wrigley, 2000</xref>). Families have valuable insights to inform educators about the linguistic and cultural resources that students bring to schools; when schools value local expertise and open the door to initiate positive communication, educators develop trusting relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450235">Adams &amp; Christenson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212450235">Zentella, 2005</xref>), increase parent involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1365480212450235">Seitsinger, Felner, Brand, &amp; Burns, 2008</xref>), and create a climate to ‘reflect critically on their teaching, take risks in enacting instructional reform, and act as agents of positive change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1365480212450235">McCarty, 2003</xref>, p. 152). For schools to be a resource, teachers and other school staff must understand and respect home cultures and languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212450235">Eberly, Joshi, &amp; Konzal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212450235">Farr &amp; Barajas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450235">Farrell &amp; Collier, 2010</xref>) and become a part of families’ social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212450235">Moll &amp; Gonzalez, 1997</xref>). Once this occurs, a mutually supportive relationship will develop between schools and bilingual families.</p>
<p>With an equitable and respectful relationship established, school personnel can help families find the resources they need to support their children’s education. Teachers and other school actors have the potential to educate families about how to support bilingual student learning inside and outside of the classroom. For instance, schools can provide classes for parents on how to navigate the school system and prepare for college. An example of an effective initiative is the Parent School Partnership started by the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1365480212450235">MALDEF, 2009</xref>) to help parents advocate for their children’s education. Schools can also create structures that encourage families to teach and advocate for one another, such as the development of a <italic>buddy system</italic>, where new families are paired with those who are well-established in the community. Each family helps its partner navigate the school system, communicate with teachers and administrators, and request support from school and community organizations. By building reciprocal relationships between schools and community organizations, families become aware of mentoring opportunities available to their children, and schools take advantage of organizations to mentor students and provide support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212450235">Gillies et al., 2010</xref>). Community involvement in school issues is integral, as schools can more effectively tap into the resources that are embedded in the surrounding area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1365480212450235">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>When stakeholders collaborate to improve education for bilingual students, the well-being of the community becomes the central focus and opens the door to meaningful change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212450235">McCarty, 2002</xref>). All local actors must be willing to learn from one another to better serve youth in the classroom and beyond the school grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212450235">Lewis, 2008</xref>).

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Linguistic diversity across the globe is a present and growing reality that must be conceptualized as both a strength and opportunity for meaningful and effective school change. With this article, we utilize the existing literature to give a broad and dynamic set of recommendations for stakeholders to begin building linguistically responsive schools. Because every setting has a unique context and population of bilingual students, educators should be empowered to utilize these steps to reflect and discuss practice to improve their schools. This is not a responsibility reserved for administrators or language teachers; all school personnel must take an active role in the social, cultural, linguistic and academic achievement of every student. In addition to collaboration among local actors, educators should open the school doors to share effective practices with the broader external community. When educators open classroom doors to collaborate with colleagues, families, and community members, they support and promote student achievement. We hope that readers utilize this article as a call to action to improve schools for bilingual students.</p>
