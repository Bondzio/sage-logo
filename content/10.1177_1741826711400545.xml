<abstract>
<p><bold>Background: </bold>The prevalence of persistent lipid abnormalities in patients receiving statins in primary and secondary care is needed to formulate recommendations for future treatment. Studies associating cardiovascular risk factors with lipid target goal achievement are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A cross-sectional, observational study that assessed the prevalence of persistent dyslipidemia in patients treated with statins and analyzed predictors of lipid target achievement.</p>
<p><bold>Methods: </bold>Serum lipid values of 22,063 statin-treated patients were studied in the context of their cardiovascular risk factors, and the potency and composition of their lipid-lowering treatment. European Society of Cardiology recommendations were used to classify patient risk, and to define LDL-cholesterol goal and normal levels for HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>
<p><bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 48.2% of patients did not achieve the therapeutic goal for LDL-cholesterol, either as a single lipid anomaly or associated with low HDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, or both. Lack of goal achievement was more prevalent among low-risk patients (55.8%) than high-risk patients (46.8%). Serum LDL-cholesterol levels were lower in high-risk patients. Predictors associated with LDL-cholesterol goal achievement were higher statin dose (odds ratio (OR): 0.35), specialist treatment (OR: 0.74), or combined lipid-lowering therapy (OR: 0.80).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions: </bold>Nearly half of statin-treated patients missed their therapeutic LDL-cholesterol goal, highlighting a gap between recommendations and clinical practice. Better achievement of LDL-cholesterol therapeutic goal was found among patients at high cardiovascular risk, those on high statin doses or using combination therapy, and patients managed by specialists. Results suggest that residual dyslipidemia in statin-treated patients at low cardiovascular risk may be reduced by increasing statin dose.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711400545">1</xref></sup> and cost European Union countries around €169 billion in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711400545">2</xref></sup> CVD will continue to be a major burden, driven by the growth in obesity and prevalence of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711400545">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711400545">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Statins have greatly advanced treatment of dyslipidemia; for every mmol/l reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality decreases by 19%, and overall mortality decreases by 12%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711400545">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711400545">6</xref></sup> Statins are first-line lipid-lowering therapy in patients at risk of CVD, with those at highest risk considered to benefit most.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711400545">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400545">8</xref></sup> Despite risk reductions, a substantially high number of clinical events are not prevented by statins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711400545">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711400545">11</xref></sup> This may be due to residual total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol abnormalities, as well as undertreated risk factors including high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711400545">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711400545">12</xref></sup> There is also increasing evidence of sub-optimal use of lipid-lowering therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711400545">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400545">8</xref></sup> The EUROASPIRE III survey of 2273 patients with CHD, found that 42.7% of patients on treatment had TC ≥4.5 mmol/l.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711400545">13</xref></sup> Other data suggest that two-thirds of patients on lipid-lowering therapy still have at least one abnormal lipid parameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400545">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711400545">16</xref></sup> This suggests an unmet medical need for comprehensive lipid management.</p>
<p>This study’s objective was to assess prevalence and types of persistent lipid abnormalities in patients receiving statin therapy, across both primary and secondary care settings. In addition, lack of achievement of lipid therapeutic target goals was investigated by association analysis, to establish a framework within which recommendations for future treatment practice might be made.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711400545"><title>Study population and centers</title>
<p>The Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) is an epidemiologic multicenter, cross-sectional study of the lipid profile of 22,063 statin-treated outpatients. Patients were enrolled from 2954 sites across 11 European countries and Canada, and were eligible for inclusion in the study if they: (a) had been on statin therapy for ≥3 months at the time of assessment visits; (b) were aged ≥45 years; and (c) had at least one fasting lipid parameter available in their chart while receiving statin therapy. Exclusion criteria included active participation in a clinical study.</p>
<p>To ensure a representative sample of primary and secondary care patients, research was conducted in participating countries to assess the setting in which patients with dyslipidemia are usually treated. Study centers were then invited to participate based on random and convenience samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711400545"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>All data were collected from clinical examination and medical charts from single outpatient visits between April 2008 and February 2009. Selection bias was reduced by enrolling patients from consecutive visits over a 2-month recruitment period irrespective of the visit’s cause.</p>
<p>Data were submitted by fax or electronically in local-language case report forms to a central database, held and managed at the Institut für Herzinfarktforschung Ludwigshafen an der Universität Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
<p>Patient demographic data, information on treating physician, including their specialty, medical practice, and location, were collected. Serum lipid parameters from the last test available within the previous 6–12 months—based on local testing frequency—for TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were recorded. Specific patient-related lipid targets, whether patients were at goal/normal levels or not, and the relevance of the different lipid parameters for the physicians were also recorded. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations to classify patients’ risk and define the LDL-cholesterol goal as well as abnormalities of HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400545">8</xref></sup> Patients at high risk were defined as those with pre-existing CVD, diabetes and/or ESC score ≥5%. Low-risk patients were those without those conditions or ESC score &lt;5%.</p>
<p>Clinical variables collected included: patient and/or family medical history of diabetes mellitus and CVD; glucose level; height; weight; waist circumference; blood pressure; smoking history; sedentary lifestyle; and alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Information collected on lipid and cardiovascular therapies included the name and daily dose of the current statin and statin in use at the time of the last blood test. Statin dose was normalized using a potency calculation described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711400545">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711400545">18</xref></sup> In brief, the potency of different statins was benchmarked against six simvastatin doses: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg/day. Each statin dose was given a potency rating, ranging from 1 ( = 5 mg/day) to 6 ( = 160 mg/day). Use of other lipid-modifying therapies at visit and before the previous blood test was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711400545"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are reported as means with standard deviations or medians with 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles (interquartile range—IQR) as appropriate. Non-parametric kernel density estimation was used to accurately estimate the distribution of TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.</p>
<p>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to detect independent predictors for LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride abnormalities with variables including medical history, statin use, and physician’s specialty. A stepwise backward selection (alpha = 0.05) was used to identify parameters associated with dependent variables. All statistical comparisons were two-tailed, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with the Statistical Analyzing System, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Patients who did not have the appropriate lipid parameters were not included in the analyses.</p>

<p>The most frequently used statin was simvastatin (47.7% of patients), followed by atorvastatin (28.3%), and rosuvastatin (11.1%); notably, only 13.5% of patients received lipid therapies in addition to statins. Slightly more patients (52.2%) were using lower statin potencies (1–3), vs 47.8% using potencies of 4 to 6; the most frequently used statin dose potency was 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711400545">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Observations not recorded exceeded 3% for the following variables: LDL-cholesterol (6.7%); HDL-cholesterol (6.4%); triglycerides (6.3%); physician’s specialty (4.4%); fasting plasma glucose (15.4%); and race (23.9%).

<sec id="sec10-1741826711400545" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report the results of an observational study of lipid levels in patients receiving statin therapy across 2987 primary care and specialist treatment centers in 12 countries (Europe and Canada). To our knowledge, this is the first such study using a large dataset focused solely on statin users in both primary and secondary care settings. This study was conducted after the release of the 2007 ESC guidelines for the prevention of CVD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400545">8</xref></sup> and the 2006 Canadian Guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711400545">19</xref></sup> A number of cross-sectional epidemiologic studies have also investigated the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and statin use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711400545">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711400545">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711400545">27</xref></sup> These studies, however, addressed patients from a single country or using different methodologies or data collection systems. They were also limited to specific populations, focused on specific lipid parameters, or had mixed patients with different lipid-lowering therapies.</p>
<p>Consistent with published data, nearly three-quarters of patients in our study had residual lipid abnormalities despite statin therapy.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711400545"><title>LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides</title>
<p>It was disappointing that LDL-cholesterol levels remained elevated in nearly half of these statin-treated patients. The finding that LDL-cholesterol was frequently raised in combination with low HDL-cholesterol and raised triglycerides is of concern given the lack of therapeutic approaches to successfully target HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711400545">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711400545">30</xref></sup> This is reflected in the fact that while low HDL-cholesterol and/or raised triglycerides were found in 49.3% of patients in the study, only 2.4% of patients were receiving treatments that might manage these lipid parameters. No clear pattern was seen with respect to predictors of lipid levels. However, some trends were seen: ischemic heart disease and diabetes, as well as BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, large waist circumference, and hypertension uniformly predicted low LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol, and high triglyceride levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711400545"><title>Lipid-lowering therapies</title>
<p>This study provides valuable information on statin dosing. Treatment dose varied little between 2000 and 2003, with an average statin dose potency of 2–3 (simvastatin equivalent 10–20 mg/day).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711400545">28</xref></sup> Data from our study suggest a small shift to higher doses, with most patients receiving statin dose potency between 3 and 4 (simvastatin equivalent 20–40 mg/day). Multivariate analysis indicated higher statin dose as a robust predictor of target achievement for LDL-cholesterol, alone or in combination, and combination therapy to a lesser degree. Use of alternative therapies combined with statins was low, reflecting somewhat variable availability and interest in the surveyed countries. Multivariate analysis indicated that treatment with ezetimibe was a predictor only for LDL-cholesterol goal achievement. These results suggest a need for, and potential benefit of, approaches using high statin doses and multi-targeting lipid treatment strategies, addressing the full range of lipid abnormalities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711400545"><title>Lipid levels and cardiovascular risk</title>
<p>Consistent with published data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711400545">27</xref></sup> nearly three-quarters of patients included in the DYSIS had residual lipid abnormalities despite statin therapy, and nearly half had elevated LDL-cholesterol levels, either as a single anomaly or in combination with either low HDL-cholesterol or raised triglycerides. An important finding from our study was the association analysis of serum lipid levels with CVD risk factors, which revealed that high-risk patients had LDL-cholesterol and TC at goal more frequently than patients at low risk. Results were even clearer when only patients with pre-existent CVD or diabetes were considered. In agreement with this view, analysis of the distribution of LDL-cholesterol and TC levels across patients found lower values for those lipid parameters in high-risk patients. Further, multiple logistic regression analysis independently showed that ischemic heart disease, diabetes, as well as BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, large waist circumference, and hypertension, uniformly predicted low LDL-cholesterol. This is not too surprising if we consider that high-risk patients receive higher statin doses than low-risk ones. Management of patients by a specialist was associated with increased odds of having LDL-cholesterol at goal, alone or in combination with other lipid abnormalities. Limited intervention may be derived from this finding due to geographical reasons, although it should be paid due consideration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711400545"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Firstly, DYSIS was a cross-sectional (single point) observational study; therefore, any risk estimates are calculated based on current or retrospective data. Secondly, lipid parameters were those taken from patients’ case notes. There was no blood sample collection or central evaluation of the lipid parameters. Notwithstanding this observation, our results are a true reflection of clinical practice. Thirdly, the treatment centers included were those using statins, given that current statin use was a patient eligibility criterion. Statins are, however, the mainstay of therapy with rates up to 95% in some of the countries included in DYSIS. Fourthly, our study did not collect data on the full patient lifestyle, including nutritional habits, in-depth genetic predisposition to CVD (although family history was assessed), or treatment compliance. Finally, study participants were included by physicians willing to participate in DYSIS and consequently, are likely to be more interested in dyslipidemia than the average physician. Therefore, the study could over-estimate the number of subjects achieving treatment goals compared with the general population.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711400545" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Lipid abnormalities were highly prevalent in statin-treated patients. More than three-quarters of the total study population were at high risk of cardiovascular complications, including half with pre-existing CVD. Higher statin doses were used in high-risk patients, who had lower LDL-cholesterol levels and were more frequently at goal than low-risk patients. A more intensive statin treatment or a combination with other lipid-lowering agents should be considered for low-risk patients, as these factors are both associated with keeping LDL-cholesterol levels at goal. New treatment algorithms addressing dyslipidemia are needed for a more effective management of HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</p>
