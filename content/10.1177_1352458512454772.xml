<title>Background:</title>
<p>Callosal lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) are usually focal, involving the inferior aspect of the corpus callosum on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but little is known about callosal lesions in neuromyelitis optica (NMO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512454772">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To clarify MRI abnormalities in callosal lesions of NMO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512454772">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Japanese patients with NMO (<italic>n</italic>=28) or MS (<italic>n</italic>=22) were assessed. The distributions and appearances of callosal lesions were evaluated on a brain mid-sagittal T2-weighted image (T2WI) or a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image with a 1.5T MRI scanner. Logistic regression analysis identified which characteristics of the callosal lesions were useful for discriminating NMO from MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512454772">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Callosal lesions were present in 79% of NMO and 82% of MS patients. Callosal abnormalities of NMO, including splenial lesions (57% in NMO versus 27% in MS, odds ratio (OR)=4.23, <italic>p</italic>=0.04), diffusely spreading lesions from the lower to upper edges of the corpus callosum (71% versus 23%, OR=7.18, <italic>p</italic>=0.0024), and heterogeneous T2 hyperintense lesions (71% versus 9%, OR=44.3, <italic>p</italic>=0.0006), were feasible for discriminating NMO from MS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that preferentially affects the optic nerve and spinal cord.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512454772">1</xref></sup> Serum autoantibody NMO-immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) has been found as a specific marker of NMO, and NMO-IgG reacts with the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512454772">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512454772"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512454772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512454772">5</xref></sup> which is densely expressed in the astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512454772">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512454772">7</xref></sup> AQP4 antibodies induce NMO-like lesions in the rat brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512454772">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have detected abnormalities in approximately 60–89% of patients with NMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512454772">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512454772">10</xref></sup> while another study found that the brain lesions were nonspecific and did not satisfy the neuroimaging criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512454772">11</xref></sup> Previous studies also showed that cloudlike enhancement was specific to NMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512454772">10</xref></sup> and that brain lesions in patients with NMO preferentially localized at sites with high AQP4 expression, including the hypothalamus and periventricular white matter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512454772">12</xref></sup> An MRI study of lesions of the corpus callosum reported that edematous lesions with heterogeneous signal intensity (indicated by a marbled pattern) occasionally occurred in patients with NMO in the acute stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512454772">13</xref></sup> In MS, the callosal lesions were demonstrated as confluent and/or focal lesions involving inferior aspects of the corpus callosum on brain MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512454772">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512454772">15</xref></sup> and they were in the middle and posterior thirds of the corpus callosum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512454772">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>After daily observation of brain MRIs of NMO and MS, we hypothesized that callosal lesions of NMO tend to form in the splenium. No study has systematically analyzed the differences in the callosal lesions in terms of distribution and the signal intensity between NMO and MS. Our aim was to reveal the characteristics of callosal lesions in patients with NMO in contrast to MS, and to evaluate whether or not these characteristics are useful for discriminating between the two diseases.</p>

<p>This study was cross-sectional and retrospective. Consecutive patients with NMO or MS, who were referred to our hospital and who then received MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord between March 2002 and January 2011 were recruited. The diagnostic criteria for the NMO were based on the 2006 Wingerchuk et al. criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512454772">17</xref></sup> and those for the MS were based on the McDonald criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512454772">18</xref></sup> Among the patients with NMO, those who were revealed to be seropositive for the anti-AQP4 antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512454772">4</xref></sup> instead of NMO-IgG were included in this study.

<title>MRI</title>
<p>An MRI of the brain was scanned at least one month after the latest clinical relapse using a 1.5-Tesla MR system (GE, Munich, Germany). We used axial and mid-sagittal T2-weighted images (T2WIs), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and axial T1-weighted images (T1WIs) with gadolinium contrast medium. T2WIs were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time=4000 ms, echo time=96 ms, number of examinations=2; slice thickness/gap=4.0/0 mm, field of view=220×220 mm, matrix=320×256. A FLAIR image was acquired using the following parameters: repetition time=10000 ms, echo time=120 ms, number of examinations=2; slice thickness/gap=4.0/0 mm, field of view=220×220 mm, matrix=256×192. T1WIs with gadolinium contrast medium were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time=560 ms, echo time=20 ms, number of examinations=1; slice thickness/gap=4.0/0 mm, field of view=220 × 220 mm, matrix=320×256. The HNS head coil was used to scan the MR images of the brain. We also used sagittal T2WIs of the spinal cord to evaluate the spinal cord lesions’ MRI abnormalities. These images were performed closest to the brain MRI scan using a 1.5-Tesla MR system (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sagittal T2WIs of the spinal cord were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time=2000 ms, echo time=120 ms, number of examinations=4; slice thickness/gap=3.0/0.3 mm, field of view=300×300 mm, matrix=352×241. The SENSE-spine coil was used to scan the MR images of the spinal cord.</p>

<title>Evaluating the callosal lesions</title>
<p>One neuroradiologist (TM), who had been blinded to the diagnosis, evaluated the brain MRI findings of the callosal lesions in patients with NMO and those with MS for the following items: (a) the distribution (the genu, the body, or the splenium), (b) the spreading appearance (diffuse or focal), (c) the margin (blurred or well marginated), and (d) the signal intensity (homogeneous, heterogeneous, or cystic) on a mid-sagittal T2WI or FLAIR image. The partitioning of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512454772">Figure 1</xref>. Diffuse lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512454772">Figure 2(A)</xref>) were defined as continuously confluent T2 hyperintense lesions spreading from the lower surface to the upper surface of the corpus callosum on mid-sagittal T2WIs or FLAIR images. Cystic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512454772">Figure 2(B)</xref>) were defined as lesions whose signal intensities were similar to those of cerebrospinal fluid on T2WIs and FLAIR images. Focal lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512454772">Figure 2(C)</xref>) were defined as well-marginated patchy T2 hyperintense lesions adjacent to the callosal lower surface and localized within the corpus callosum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512454772">14</xref></sup> on mid-sagittal T2WIs or FLAIR images. We also evaluated the callosal lesions on axial T2WIs and FLAIR images for their distribution (the genu or splenium) and spreading appearance. Callosal lesions in minor forceps or major forceps that spread beyond the lateral edges of the anterior horn or pars of trigone were defined as ‘extensive callosal lesions’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512454772">Figure 2(D)</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of other brain and spinal lesions</title>
<p>All participants underwent brain MRI scans to examine the number, distribution (periventricular, subcortical, or extensive), margin (blurred or well marginated), signal intensity (homogeneous, heterogeneous, or cystic), and contrast enhancement pattern (patchy, blurred, or cloudlike) of the lesions on axial T2WIs, FLAIR images, or contrast-enhanced T1WIs.

<p>The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients with NMO or MS are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512454772">Table 1</xref>. A total of 28 consecutive patients with NMO (one man) and 22 consecutive patients with MS (five men) were examined. All patients with NMO in this study were seropositive for the anti-AQP4 antibody. Age at disease onset, age at the time of the brain MRI scans, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at the time of the brain MRI were significantly different between the patients with NMO and those with MS. The clinical phenotypes of the patients with MS were divided into 19 patients with relapse–remitting MS and three patients with secondary progressive MS. No patients with primary progressive MS were included in the present study. All patients with NMO had optic neuritis and myelitis, 17 (60%) patients showed brainstem or cerebellar symptoms, and 5 (18%) patients showed cerebral symptoms. In the patients with MS, 11 (50%) had optic neuritis, 16 (73%) had myelitis, 17 (77%) showed cerebellum or brainstem symptoms, and 5 (23%) showed cerebral symptoms. All patients with NMO and 21 patients with MS received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for five days for the treatment for the clinical relapse between the time of disease onset and that of MR image scanning. After intravenous administration of methylprednisolone, 27 patients with NMO and 16 patients with MS received oral administration of prednisolone. In the patients with NMO, the median maximum dose of orally administered prednisolone was 60 mg per day, and the median minimum dose was 15 mg per day. In the patients with MS, the median maximum dose of orally administered prednisolone was 60 mg per day, and the median minimum dose was 5 mg per day. Other immune-modulating therapies were as follows: among patients with NMO, one patient received oral administration of 125 mg cyclosporine, two patients received subcutaneous injection of 8 million IU interferon β-1b, and one patient received oral administration of 15 mg tacrolimus; among patients with MS, one patient received oral administration of 200 mg cyclosporine, and six patients received subcutaneous injection of 8 million IU interferon β-1b.</p>

<title>Frequency and distribution of the callosal lesions</title>
<p>The callosal lesions of 22 patients with NMO and 20 patients with MS were evaluated on FLAIR images, and those of six patients with NMO and two patients with MS were evaluated on T2WIs of the brain. On mid-sagittal images, callosal lesions were found in 22 (79%) of 28 patients with NMO and in 18 (82%) of 22 patients with MS. Lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum were found in 16 (57%) of 28 patients with NMO compared with 6 (27%) of 22 patients with MS, whilst a similar numbers of NMO and MS patients had lesions in the genu and the body: NMO (genu: 13 (46%) of 28 patients, body: 20 (71%) of 28 patients) and MS (genu: 8 (36%) of 22 patients, body: 15 (68%) of 22 patients). On axial images, 15 (54%) of 28 patients with NMO had splenial lesions, compared with 4 (18%) of 22 patients with MS. Lesions in the genu were found in 12 (43%) of 28 patients with NMO and in 7 (32%) of 22 patients with MS. Logistic regression analysis showed that the splenial lesions on mid-sagittal images were a feasible variable by which to discriminate between NMO and MS (odds ratio (OR)=4.23, <italic>p</italic>=0.04).

<p>On mid-sagittal images, diffuse lesions in any partitions of the corpus callosum were found in 20 (71%) of 28 patients with NMO compared with 5 (23%) of 22 patients with MS, and those of the splenium were found in 12 (43%) of 28 patients with NMO compared with 2 (9%) of 22 patients with MS.

In contrast to diffuse lesions, focal lesions in any partitions of the corpus callosum were found in 16 (73%) of 22 patients with MS compared with 6 (21%) of 28 patients with NMO, and those in the genu were found in 7 (32%) of 22 patients with MS compared with 2 (7%) of 28 patients with NMO; those in the body were found in 13 (59%) of 22 patients with MS compared with 3 (11%) of 28 patients with NMO, and those in the splenium were found in 4 (18%) of 22 patients with MS and in 4 (14%) of 28 patients with NMO. On axial images, ‘extensive callosal lesions’ were found only in patients with NMO (splenium: 8 (29%) patients; genu: 9 (32%) patients).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that diffusely spreading heterogeneous T2 hyperintense callosal lesions of the splenium with blurred margins were more frequent in NMO than in MS, and that these lesions were useful in discriminating NMO from MS. We also showed that the signal intensities of the brain lesions of NMO had characteristics similar to those of the callosal lesions.</p>
<p>The present study showed that both NMO and MS frequently had callosal lesions; this finding is compatible with those of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512454772">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512454772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512454772">11</xref></sup> In addition, we revealed that callosal lesions of NMO tended to be in the splenium, and this characteristic was feasible for discriminating NMO from MS. Since the distribution of brain lesions in patients with NMO corresponded with the sites of high AQP4 expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512454772">12</xref></sup> the AQP4 expression pattern in the corpus callosum and the axonal distributions of the corpus callosum might provide keys to understanding the distribution of callosal lesions in NMO. AQP4 in the human brain was expressed predominantly in astrocytic end-feet, specifically in those membrane domains that face vessels and pia mater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512454772">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512454772">7</xref></sup> In the corpus callosum, AQP4 was highly expressed along the callosal lower surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512454772">6</xref></sup> Regarding the white matter fibers in the corpus callosum, those within the genu consisted mainly of small caliber fibers with low myelination, those within the body consisted of large caliber fibers with high myelination, and those within the splenium consisted of fibers of various calibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512454772">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512454772">23</xref></sup> Detailed studies focusing on the clinicopathological and radiological findings of the callosal lesions of NMO and on the callosal expression of AQP4 could help to explain why the callosal lesions of NMO tended to be in the splenium.</p>
<p>Our results also revealed that diffuse and heterogeneous/cystic lesions with blurred margins in the splenium of the corpus callosum were more frequent in patients with NMO than in those with MS, and that these appearances were characteristic of NMO. This result was in line with a recent report that callosal lesions in NMO were occasionally observed as multiple lesions with heterogeneous intensity (a marbled pattern).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512454772">13</xref></sup> Generally, inflammatory demyelinating lesions in patients with NMO and with MS appeared as T2 hyperintense regions. Previous studies revealed that AQP4, which is expressed predominantly in perivascular regions, was lost and that the permeability of the blood-brain barrier was increased, forming vasogenic edematous inflammatory lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512454772">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512454772">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512454772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512454772">26</xref></sup> The primary blood-brain barrier failure might allow the secondary influx of humoral or cellular components that affect this barrier in adjacent brain regions, subsequently forming diffusely spreading T2 hyperintense lesions with heterogeneous signal intensity. In MS, previous MRI studies reported that callosal lesions often appeared as ‘inner callosal lesions’ or ‘confluent and/or focal lesions involving the callosal-septal interface’, similar to the focal lesions in the present study. These findings suggest that these characteristics of callosal MRI lesions in MS might reflect the histopathological findings of MS: demyelinating lesions with sharp margins forming around the subependymal veins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512454772">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512454772">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512454772">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512454772">28</xref></sup> The differences in MRI findings on callosal lesions between NMO and MS, such as differences in signal intensity and in the margins of the callosal lesions, could reflect the histopathological features observed in each disease, as discussed above. We also revealed that callosal lesions were accompanied by cystic lesions more frequently in NMO than in MS, and that these lesions coexisted mostly as diffusely spread heterogeneous lesions with blurred margins. Previous histopathological studies revealed extensive necrotic cavitary lesions associated with the loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity in spinal cord lesions of NMO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512454772">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512454772">29</xref></sup> as well as the formation of cystic lesions of the brain by similar pathogenic mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512454772">30</xref></sup> Severe inflammation caused by the immunologic reaction between AQP4 of astrocyte and the anti-AQP4 antibody might form callosal cystic lesions.</p>
<p>We also showed that heterogeneous T2 hyperintense brain lesions with blurred margins were also feasible variables by which to discriminate NMO from MS. In addition, the confluent extensive lesions distributing from the periventricular white matter to the subcortical white matter were observed only in NMO, whereas the existence of brain lesions, that of periventricular lesions, or the total number of brain lesions could not be feasible variables for this discrimination. In addition to the analysis of callosal lesions in the present study, detailed analyses of not only the distribution but also the signal appearances of brain lesions might be helpful for distinguishing NMO from MS, although unfortunately only small numbers of patients with NMO and with MS were examined in the present study. No patients with NMO had lesions with a cloudlike enhancement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512454772">10</xref></sup> as the brain MR images were scanned one month or later from the most recent clinical relapse in the present study.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, our study evaluated patients with NMO and with MS for whom the time between disease onset and MRI scanning of the brain or spinal cord was long, and thus it could not analyze patients in the early phase. Second, none of the brain MRI scans with gadolinium contrast medium showed abnormally enhanced lesions in the corpus callosum, though it would be interesting to learn whether or not diffuse callosal lesions with blurred margins were caused by the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Third, not every patient with NMO or MS received sagittal FLAIR scanning of the brain. Longitudinal studies with both T2WIs and FLAIR images of the brain at the initial phase and during relapse with gadolinium contrast medium need to be conducted.</p>
<p>We suggest that diffusely spreading heterogeneous T2 hyperintense lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum are a characteristic of NMO. The ability to differentiate between NMO and MS could be important for determining treatment strategies. After IFNβ-1b treatment, the proportion of patients with more than a 50% increase in the annualized relapse rate was much higher in patients with NMO than in those with MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512454772">31</xref></sup> and immunosuppressive therapy, including low-dose corticosteroids, reduces the relapse rate in patients with NMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512454772">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512454772">33</xref></sup> When callosal lesions showing the characteristics revealed in the present study are observed, it may be helpful to consider NMO rather than MS.</p>
