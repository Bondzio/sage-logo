<abstract>
<p>One current slogan is ‘Another world is possible’, but Marxists have written relatively little about what this new world might look like. Marx himself shied away from this topic as leading to utopias delivered by top-down saviors, whereas his vision of socialism would be built by the victorious working class in line with its needs and desires. This article, on the other hand, takes a different approach. It discusses objections people have to seeing socialism as possible, rooting this discussion not in a utopian vision but rather in thinking through the problems and struggles the working class will face when and if it succeeds in becoming the revolutionary-democratic rulers of the world. I think readers will agree that this is a vision of continued struggle – but also of a much better world to live in.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent discussions among radical sociologists made it clear that we still have no shared definition of our political goals or even of what we mean by ‘socialism’, much less whether we think socialism is in some sense a worthy goal. There also seems to be little agreement over mechanisms through which to reach our goals, or about the role of the working class in a future society. We have little agreement, I might add, about what we mean by ‘working class’.</p>
<p>In this brief article, I want to lay out some thoughts about these issues, with an emphasis on my vision of ‘socialism’ – which I think is quite appealing and, unlike many visions of socialism, manages both to have substantial content and to avoid running afoul of Marx’s warning against trying to preempt working class creativity by setting up a pre-defined system of the kind Owens or Fourier devised. I approach socialism not as such a fixed thing but as a set of problems and struggles we would face after the working class takes power. I have written more fully (but less clearly) about what socialism might look like in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman (2008a)</xref>. Fundamental to my concept of socialism is the idea that the working class should become mobilized and take control of those major political, production, and cultural organizations that it does not disperse and perhaps replace. Thus, workers and workers’ views would be the active agents in deciding what happens in terms of public decision making, what new productive facilities get set up, how work is conducted, how neighborhoods are organized, what counts as ‘work’, and a host of related decisions. I have a broad view of what the working class is when I say this. My ideas on the process of how workers might come to have such power are laid out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511427079">2010)</xref>. They are much closer to the Solidarnosc movement in Poland or to recent events in Tunisia and Egypt (in 2011) than to social democratic or related versions of coming to power through electoral victory or than to views that fetishize ‘the revolutionary party’, though I do think that revolutionary organizations and parties are a crucial part of the process. In saying this, I not only draw on the long history of social democratic and Communist failures, misdeeds and disappointments but also on the elemental need of workers to mobilize and displace current authorities (like the State) and the inactivating habits of subordination to supervisors and the ‘daily routine’ that these authority systems produce.</p>
<p>Indeed, the key to the possibility for socialism, as I see it, lies precisely in the struggles and mobilizations to disperse the current state forms and to seize direct control over processes of production and, indeed, of the collective daily work that we all do. These struggles, in effect, will teach us how to talk with each other, how to come to reasonably democratic decisions, how to implement our decisions after we make them, and leave us holding the burden, collectively, of our own fate. The more conscious we can become that this responsibility is now ‘ours’ and not ‘theirs’ through what we learn during our struggles, the better off we will be. Electoral campaigns, on the other hand, are predicated on the idea of finding others to represent us and to make and implement decisions for us.</p>
<p>These are simple ideas – some would say, ‘simplistic’, – but there is a lot of content and history lying behind them. Let me address some common objections with some very brief ‘answers’ that may be too brief to be satisfying but may also lead to useful discussion.</p>
<p><bold>Objection 1:</bold> Efficient work means people have to spend their time working. But what you are proposing will require a lot of talk time and endless meetings. This means none of the work will get done. And people will get bored and leave all the power to a few.</p>
<p><italic>Answer</italic>: Existing arrangements are incredibly inefficient. Much of what gets produced at work, whether it be physical goods or ideas like advertisement, is wasteful even in capitalist terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511427079">Kidron and Gluckstein, 1974</xref>). Much of the rest is wasteful in human terms – such as the mass of human time, physical energy, and environmentally-precious trees that goes into advertising and imperial wars. Furthermore, much of what goes on at workplaces is also incredibly inefficient at meeting human needs (even if it might make profits). Work needs to have workers who are well-trained, who can do their tasks with a great deal of autonomy even when the work <italic>seems</italic> to require little initiative or skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511427079">Friedman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511427079">Kusterer, 1978</xref>), who actually do the work rather than lazing around, and who work in a well-coordinated way. Existing forms of organization fail in all of these ways: Much of management time is spent making sure workers are working, that they are well-trained, that they do not get mis-coordinated, and that they take initiative when needed – as well as making sure workers understand that they deserve less dignity and other rewards than those with higher positions. In practice, however, managers and workers often collude to make it seem as if good work is getting done, and worker resistance cuts productivity well below where workers might like it to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511427079">Friedman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511427079">Hodson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511427079">Serrin, 1974</xref>). In <italic>Teamster Rank and File</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511427079">1982</xref>), I present a lengthy example of a worker who got fed up with the ways management made his work less efficient and less valuable to the customer – and as a result became an activist steward who effectively battled the company for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511427079">Friedman, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The above paragraph was a ‘grump’ about how things are not so good now. Now let me turn to the positive side. I am proposing that having meetings of smaller work groups once or twice a day, and of larger groupings every week or so, can help workers coordinate their activities. Now, I do not have a good idea about how these meetings should conduct their business, except that these should <italic>not</italic> be events where only one or two people talk and the rest listen. These need to be events where people speak for themselves about what they know best – what they do each day and how it could be more pleasant and yield better results. Collectively, both at each workplace and through the research and trial and error efforts of many workplaces and neighborhoods – as has been happening at some of the recuperated workplaces in Argentina since 2002 – we will need to find ways in which workplace (and neighborhood) meetings can usefully and pleasantly discuss the purposes of what the workplace does, what better uses might be made of work time and workplace resources, the role of the workplace in the world and the environment, and ‘big picture’ issues of the society as a whole. To get to the place where all this works well, we need to work it out ourselves (with it all being counted and paid for as work time) and, over time, we need to develop a culture and a social science of how to make these movements insightful, productive, creative and fun. But when I say we need time to work this all out, what I am proposing is that we try to do this from the very beginning, and struggle with each over how to do it better, and that this become a major issue for worldwide political discussion.</p>
<p><bold>Objection 2:</bold> Even if this works in terms of effective work getting done, it just means that workers run their work environments well. How about all the rest of economics and of life? How will investments be made?</p>
<p><italic>Answer</italic>: I do not think the question is one of ‘investments’, which takes a real question and translates it into language that hides meaning. ‘Investments’ are not questions of profit and loss. They are questions about what changes we want to make and what new things we want to create. In this sense, they are extremely important political decisions rather than questions a few owners or managers should make. As it stands now, one of the Koch or Walton brothers, or Bill Gates, may decide to spend a billion dollars on tearing down a few city blocks and putting up a new store and parking lot, or some office buildings, or a factory, on that land. (They might need to convince, coerce or buy some zoning officials, too.) They then buy the tearing down of a few acres of trees, the digging of steel and the use of coal and perhaps oil to process it, and lay lots of concrete, and then eventually offer non-union jobs for people to apply for. Note that this also involves lots of use of resources, some of which add to the carbon dioxide and other materials that lead to global warming. And all of this is done so that the balance sheets of these billionaires can show some profits.</p>
<p>What I would propose instead is that political bodies of various kinds – usually called workers’ or neighborhood councils – make decisions about what needs to be built, what needs to be torn down, and whether they are worth the global warming, resources, and human labor needed to make them happen. As I discuss through this article, I see these decisions as involving lots of discussion by workers’ councils at different levels (workplace, locality, larger locality, all the way up to national or even global levels); and if there are strong objections they might lead to strikes or demonstrations by those who disagree.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this would end the ways in which the capitalist law of value and one of its major corollaries – the constant need to grow capital and profits on pain of destruction – can be ended before it ends the human race. The question of ‘investment’ hides the question of what needs to be done, and through that puts decisions over which human needs will be met and which human needs will be squashed in the hands of a few people whose interests oppose most peoples’ (in that the rich profit through cutbacks, speedups, low pay levels, and the destruction of the environment), and, equally important, keep the rest of us from having democratic control over what we spend our time on, what gets produced, and what does not get produced.</p>
<p>It will not be easy to take control over investment and production. Andrew Kliman has made this point very forcefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511427079">Kliman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511427079">Jaclard, 2010</xref>). The ‘market’, as economists call it, does keep the economy somewhat functioning so that large numbers of people eat enough and have enough heat to survive the winter. If we try to meet human needs through the mechanisms I am discussing, and fail, lots of people could die. (Of course, depressions, under-development, global warming, and their attendant wars mean that many people die needlessly as it stands.) This means we need to make sure that human needs get met and that we don’t ‘forget’ critical parts of the production and distribution process. And this is one reason we need the ‘talk-it-through’ true democracy I am proposing – billions of heads can remember more than the million or so with any say in the world today, and we have no reason to screw things up or foment wars for profits. Some mechanisms that may help us organize to do this successfully are discussed in the participatory economics literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511427079">Albert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511427079">Albert and Hahnel, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511427079">1991</xref>), and some of the struggles and developments in the working class that may make this feasible are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman (2008a)</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>Objection 3:</bold> Not everyone is a worker. Will this mean that people without jobs lack power? That homemakers will be under the thumbs of their husbands even more?</p>
<p><italic>Answer</italic>: As I said at the beginning, I am describing goals and struggles here, not finished institutions. My vision of socialism is that the process of ending capitalism involves struggles over numerous problems that capitalism has created and how to resolve them, and that visions of how these struggles be waged for human values can help us see the possibilities of the new world. That said, I think that most people without paying jobs make important contributions to human good even under capitalism, and that the struggle to end capitalism will mobilize them to make their power and needs felt in the new world. I have been very struck by the crucial role of unemployed working class members in many social struggles, such as their crucial role in the <italic>piquetero</italic> movement in Argentina earlier in this century – and the way in which the <italic>piqueteros</italic> and others in their community have had influence in discussions of movements since then. I would anticipate similar influence, only magnified, after a transition in which workers took power.</p>
<p>Part of this flows from the logic of the situation we will face after evicting capitalists from positions of power. At that point, responsibility for our world falls on us. We will need to do all the work (not just the 95% we now do), and this work will include undoing the ills capital has left us like global warming and its effects, toxic wastes, massive inequalities that make much of the working class have more or less access to goods and services and that threaten our unity and solidarity, and much else. The insights and the work of people who are currently unemployed will be very useful in doing this work and filling these responsibilities. The workless have had experiences that will be invaluable.</p>
<p>When we think about the specific issues of women who are homemakers, this raises many questions. One of them is the general role of women in society and of struggles to end women’s lesser power and status. Since I want to keep this article short, I will refer the reader to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511427079">2010)</xref> for further discussion of this issue. (These articles also take up other essential issues like the struggles against racial/ethnic/national oppression and the related question of equalizing economic relationships between imperial and imperialized countries.) I will say, however, that these are examples of my basic point: Nothing is guaranteed about the ‘socialist future’, so everything depends on struggling for good outcomes during the struggle to evict capitalism and then during ensuing struggles. And, on these issues, too, I think that the prospects for egalitarian and liberating outcomes are very good indeed –in part because the systemic needs to divide the working class and to pay some workers low wages will be eliminated along with capitalism (as I spell out in the 2008a and 2010 articles, as well as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511427079">Friedman, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511427079">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>But here, I want to focus specifically on homemakers. The essential nature of much of the work they do is beyond question (although some nonetheless question it), but this does not automatically translate into organization, influence or power during the struggles for the transition or after the transition. That means that we have to be very conscious of this as a weakness that may hurt the future society, and thus as having the organization of homemakers be something we all keep in mind. But having said that, on another level, there are other reasons to think that men and women will collectively want to change and improve the current structuring of household work and time.</p>
<p>I think that the question of time and how people spend their time will be one of the basic issues that our taking responsibility for our lives and planet will necessarily thrust into the forefront of political debate. At the workplace this is obvious, and was discussed above. Closely related is the fact that much of the working class spends very large numbers of hours at work (or at multiple jobs to make ends meet). These workers want more time to spend at home and with their families. Many men, it should be added, may lack much experience with the joys of taking care of children or even (within limits) of much of housework when it is not the sole and unshared responsibility of one person. (Other parts of the work, of course, are not pleasant by any measure.) I foresee that one of the easier struggles we will engage in will be to get enough men to take part in these activities for the pleasures and fairness of it to become part of informal communication networks.</p>
<p>To the extent to which housework remains unpleasant or too time-consuming, we are likely to decide to spend time and resources in changes like reorganizing architecture to make group cleaning or child care easier or in developing creative ways to merge work, partying, and family time. (Think of the parties around barn-raising in the American frontier – but with egalitarian division of labor and better equipment.)</p>
<p>Let me add parenthetically here that I think we are likely to make many changes in how we define and structure ‘time’, such that work time, family time, political time, neighborhood time (including environmental time), and ‘self’ time will all be seen as part of the collective and socially-necessary ways in which we need to spend our time. To the extent that ‘pay’ remains a meaningful social category, we will want to discuss and struggle over how best to pay people to engage in such activities. (We might collectively decide that the workgroup or neighborhood will be better off if we pay a workaholic like myself to take a ‘self-time’ vacation, for example. I will admit that I do not know if this is a real possibility or a fantasy.) Making a world wherein such decisions make sense and are feasible is part of what I see as the struggle to end the domination of capital and its ways of thought.</p>
<p><bold>Objection 4:</bold> The problems facing humanity have to do with sustainable economies. These ideas won’t solve global warming or bring back all the dead species. Workers have often resisted environmental demands, so why should workers’ power help at all?</p>
<p><italic>Answer</italic>: Unfortunately, I have to agree with one part of this objection – nothing will bring back the dead species. I think that the methodology of this article, though, points to ways to overcome the rest of the objection. That is, if we approach it by asking what workers need under capitalism, and what we can change, and are likely to want to change, after dispersing capitalist social relationships, then this objection looks much less formidable.</p>
<p>By and large, when workers have opposed environmental demands, this has been for one or both of two reasons. Most basically, workers depend on their jobs to make it under capitalism, and these jobs depend on their jobs making profits for capital. Environmental demands, and even needs, that are seen as threatening these jobs are likely to spur many workers to resist. This is more likely to occur, of course, to the extent to which the environmentalists making the demands are from outside the community and/or are perceived as members of a hostile social class.</p>
<p>On the other hand, workers usually are not happy about opposing many environmental demands. They and their friends and family breathe the same air and drink the same water as other people. (Indeed, in many cases, they breathe worse air and drink worse water because their work and homes are located near sources of environmental pollution or because toxic waste sites are located near where they live. This has been best documented in terms of environmental racism, but applies to white workers to an extent as well.)</p>
<p>So what happens after workers take power? To the extent that we are now the ones making decisions, this means several things: First, issues of corporate profitability no longer exist. The profit-making vampires will no longer rule what is kept open and what is shut down. Second, the discussion over environment vs. jobs will thus no longer be between an enemy group of employers and an embattled group of workers, but rather will be between the collective needs of the working class for a livable world and the question of how the workers involved in harmful work can change what they do to reduce or end the damage. Under these circumstances, discussions of finding better ways to do what is being done (making paper, for example, or generating electricity) will no longer be dominated by the needs of Weyerhaeuser or Exxon for profits (and their political power to protect their desires). Instead, we can all discuss how to maintain the livelihoods and community and work pride of the workers, and the workers directly involved can discuss among themselves what techniques might be less harmful or what other human needs they might be able to fulfill with their labors and time, while minimizing and in time ending the damage done to the environment.</p>
<p>This is not a guaranteed solution, of course. I have no doubt but that there will continue to be struggles over these and similar issues after we take power. I started the article, after all, by saying that my perspective focuses on the struggles to come. But there is one crucial difference – these struggles are now internal to truly democratic and participatory decision making processes among people whose long-term interests more or less coincide, rather than being conflicts between powerful capital and its profits and a divided population with little ability to resist. And ‘all’ this requires, as I see it, is our destroying capital’s social relationships and dispersing capital’s state(s) – and our establishing and then maintaining democratic decision-making and implementation. This ‘all’, of course, is the question of tyranny discussed in the final Objection.</p>
<p><bold>Objection 5:</bold> Won’t this just lead to tyranny, to purges, and to work and life that are less democratic than what we have now? Isn’t this just asking for us to become what Russia used to be?</p>
<p><italic>Answer</italic>: I am writing in Kiev, Ukraine, at this moment. The memory of Russian tyranny remains present in graffiti and popular consciousness. Despite the hardships Ukrainians have endured over the last two decades, few of them want the tyranny back. And I would estimate that there are one or two billion people in the world, perhaps more, who would agree that talk of a working class abolition of capitalism through insurgency would end up creating tyranny. This is one of the most widespread areas of ‘common-sense’ agreement.</p>
<p>But when you look at this common sense, it is impressive to see how flimsy the evidence behind it is. Almost none of the evidence that ‘working class insurgent takeover and dispersal of capitalist power leads to tyranny’ is based on cases where an insurgent working class took power. There is exactly one case where this took place – Russia in 1917. The main leaders of this revolution never thought that the working class in an economically backwards country like Russia could hold power unless workers took power in other countries – and they were right. A combination of civil war, attacks by the armies of other countries, the relatively small size of the working class, and a famine induced by years of war and civil war led the working class to shrink massively as a class and destroyed the bases for its power. This process was helped along in important ways by failures on the part of the revolutionaries to understand the centrality of democracy and human rights to workers’ power and thus the ability to struggle for a new world that reflected workers’ and other people’s needs. By the late 1920s at the very latest, and some would argue within a year of two of their taking power, workers’ councils (the organizations of their power) had become bureaucratic shells, strikes were punished, and a new group of rulers were well on their way to becoming a new ruling class based on exploitation of the workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511427079">Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511427079">Brinton, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511427079">Draper, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511427079">Dunayevskaya, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511427079">Farber, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511427079">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511427079">Pirani, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511427079">Van der Walt, 2011</xref>). The detailed processes through which this occurred remain hotly debated on the left and elsewhere, but the differences between a backward illiterate country like Russia in 1917 and most countries are clear today – as is the clear expression of how people felt about the results of this process in the graffiti I saw this morning in Kiev.</p>
<p>Many people would point to European countries like Hungary and Poland as additional examples. This, however, is either absurd or delusion. Communist Parties took power in these countries on the basis primarily of the military and political power of the army of the USSR at the end of World War II. Others would point to China, Cuba, Vietnam or Yugoslavia as other examples of how working class insurgency led to dictatorial one-party rule. Again, however, this argument has no basis. These countries indeed have had dictatorial one-party rule, but it was established by primarily-peasant armies led by parties that called themselves Communist. They were by no means established by workers’ movements taking power.</p>
<p>Some might point to the bureaucratic non-democracies of many trade unions as showing that workers cannot take power and set up democratic institutions. Indeed, my first book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511427079">Friedman, 1982</xref>) discussed authoritarian bureaucratic rule in the US Teamsters Union – but also argued that such bureaucracy was the result of continuing capitalist power and could be overcome by workers’ struggles. (It showed how this was done in one local union and the struggles that resulted.) I suggest that the argument that union authoritarianism shows that workers’ insurgencies can only establish tyrannies if they take over countries or the world is absurd. Power in one organization in a world dominated by employers is a far cry from running a country. The fact that some people would take such an argument seriously derives from two other forces: Most importantly, the widespread contempt for workers and their ability that is expressed in mass media and the very organization of production (since workers are the ones who ‘need to be ordered around’ for a company to be successful – and thus are framed as incompetent). Secondly, this argument about workers and unions <italic>appears</italic> to be strengthened by the common-sense view that countries where workers take over become tyrannical – except there is only one such case and its relevance is quite weak.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that the weakness of the arguments people use to support the claim that ‘workers’ power leads to tyranny’ is not all that needs to be said here. We should also consider the struggles that are likely to occur around power and authority in the new society. The methodology behind this article points to such struggles as being a key part of what we will go through as we try to build the new world.</p>
<p>The changes I have been discussing involve transforming workplaces, neighborhoods, family relationships, and political authority structures – as well as the relationships among all of these. From the outset, these transformations will erode (or even obliterate) many of the distinctions between ‘economics’, ‘politics’, and the ‘social’, at least as we have come to think of them. These distinctions were created by capitalism as it developed – and by this, I do not only mean that the conceptual distinctions between them came about in this way, but that there was a differentiation among these aspects of life that only coalesced because capitalism separated the social, economic, and political unity of authority that was common in pre-capitalist Europe (and other non-capitalist regions). I will add that this is by no means a controversial statement, and has been argued at length not only by Marxists like Ellen Meiksins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511427079">Wood (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511427079">1999)</xref> but also by Talcott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511427079">Parsons (1966)</xref> and many other sociologists. Established concepts of tyranny, however, are limited to ‘political tyranny’, and thus will not provide adequate guidance for a period in which the political, economic, and social dimensions of life are coming together rather than maintaining their strict separation. Concretely, what this means is that <italic>we will have to learn to look out for, and find ways to respond to, actions that attack workers’ and other people’s freedoms in a wide range of aspects of their lives</italic>.</p>
<p>I do not think that it will be easy to persuade workers and other people who have just taken over their workplaces and dispersed the capitalist state to give up either our newly-won institutions of power or the substance of this power. Indeed, one of the clear positive meanings of the graffiti in Kiev and elsewhere is that billions of people learned from the Russian experience that the single party dictatorial state is not a path to a desired new world, and thus that billions of people will be very alert against movement towards tyranny.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the post-take-over period will involve many difficulties, and will pose difficult problems when we need to think through what the many changes we make mean. Although we will be strengthened by the enormous feelings of solidarity we have built in the struggle to take power, it will almost certainly be true that we will have many different views and opinions about what should be done. Such differences will concern local issues like whether to turn billionaires’ homes into childcare centers, whether to organize (and ‘pay’) teams of people to clean up a waste dump or whether to use this labor to fix decaying roads or to construct solar power stations, but will also include differences about how and at what speed to equalize living standards for workers within countries and across national boundaries. In the USA, differences will arise about how to deal with racial/ethnic inequalities and how to transform the physical environment so people do not need to use automobiles, gasoline, and related environmentally destructive forces in order to meet their daily responsibilities.</p>
<p>In this context, we can be sure that issues analogous to ‘states’ rights’ – that is, the relative authority of local workers’ councils, neighborhood councils, city workers’ councils, national councils, perhaps even world councils – will become correlated with issues of substance over how to deal with the ecological mess, how to unify the human race, how to end the ‘law of value’ and thus to be able to coordinate humanity’s labors in ways that will meet our evolving needs. Sometimes, as in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, calls for local rights may be used to defend relative privilege or fear of change. Other times, it may be used as a way to defend freedoms against over-centralizing tendencies. Sometimes differences between democratically-expressed needs and desires by different newly-built councils will lead to large-scale social movements, sometimes to negotiated solutions, and sometimes they might be resolved through new forms of courts. In all of these contexts, we need to be alert about how to defend our newly run rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Courts that support human rights and that help resolve disputes over authority are different things, of course. Both types of courts will be hard to set up in ways that make them useful. The current court system evolved to meet the needs of a capitalism based on making employers the primary authorities over workplace issues and yet also enforcing contractual agreements of a wide variety of kinds. This led to courts being profoundly alienated institutions that have only occasional connection to concepts of democracy, much less expressing the needs of the new social relationships described in this article. Furthermore, in many systems of courts, there is a long history of ‘common law’ that in many instances may become, in Marx’s words, a force in which the ‘tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511427079">Marx, 1963[1869]</xref>). To the extent to which the common law still retains elements of folk notions of justice in pre-capitalist or capitalist times, including ideas of freedom like some of those forced into the US Constitution by the popular movement for the Bill of Rights, there may be elements of common law that are useful. Here, too, I would expect us to have many differences of opinion. This means that these issues, too, will be instances where we will need to engage in a variety of democratic struggles. It is highly possible, it should be noted, that such struggles and differences of opinion will help maintain activist participation in making the new world.</p>
<p>Since I discussed courts and the defense of freedom at some length in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman (2008a)</xref>, I will not do more here – except to point to the need to maintain due process, public involvement, openness, and appeal mechanisms to help defend human rights.</p>
<p>I have two final notes to add on the struggle against tyranny. First, I want to reiterate that I do not think it would be easy to take power away from a mobilized working class. In Russia, in spite of the enormous famines, war, and economic collapse that dispersed the working class, and in spite of the limited experience with any form of civic involvement among much of the population, strong opposition to political tyranny and to the authority of managers and ‘the party’ at workshops continued for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511427079">Murphy, 2007</xref>). Few countries in the world today have as little popular democratic experience as Russia did before about 1900. Thus, I think we can have some confidence in ourselves on this issue.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I am an activist, and support an engaged social scholarship. To close this discussion of tyranny versus a new workers’ democracy, I want to recall some ideas from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511427079">Friedman (2010)</xref> about what might be useful components of a pre-revolutionary politics that will help defend freedom in a post-revolutionary period. Specifically, I suggest that we put forward ideas like these:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920511427079" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A positive political value on the need to mount challenges to parties and workers’ councils from below.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being willing to split one’s party or other organization if it begins to crystallize as a power above the people.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(Alongside the (often valid) emphasis on the need for efficiency in production, and the argument that the new workers’ councils represent the will of the people (which may also be true), we should put forward a politics that values <italic>defiant and disruptive rank and file activism at work</italic> as potentially crucial for a successful social transformation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511427079">Friedman (2010)</xref>, I proposed ‘a norm that every workgroup or workplace should engage in at least one or two unauthorized strikes a year’. I also proposed that we should consider splitting any post-revolutionary party-in-office that opposes this in practice. Such a practice would also help keep people active and engaged in politics. (I discussed other aspects of how to make sure the revolution continues to engage people in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511427079">Friedman, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511427079">2010</xref>. In addition, this issue is implicit in my discussion of kinds of time under ‘Objection 3’ above.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We need to understand that no set of pre-defined rules or institutions will resolve the issues we will face. We will be in a new world in which billions of people will be actively involved in facing problems as thinking participants. Insofar as possible, this probably means that we should see the legitimacy of engaging in many instances where we try out and test different approaches to problems. The totality of the global warming crisis, and perhaps of other issues, may pose pressures for globally-coordinated action on many issues. This is an example of what I referred to above as a case where we may have disputes among levels of authority and between different forms of workers’ or people’s councils. Such politics will not be easy, but if freedom and active mass involvement in thought, discussion, and action are maintained, such disputes will make us stronger.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>What, then, might socialism look like in the period when we are a few years into using our new power to change the world from the mess capitalism has created into a more livable world? I answered this in one way in a poem I wrote a few years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511427079">Friedman, 2008b</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p><italic>After, on the way to thereafter</italic></p>
<p>After the Heartbreak House of fighting,</p>
<p>and after the fire next time,</p>
<p>after the parties, the toasting and cheering</p>
<p>when none will bewail</p>
<p>that capitalism has been erased,</p>
<p>we will build our global city</p>
<p>like a flower from the ashes</p>
<p>with its roots suckled and fed and watered</p>
<p>by the local and daily and real.</p>
<p>One petal will be the friendships of work time,</p>
<p>another our neighbors, as we talk and we share.</p>
<p>Those who sew diapers, those who pin them and change them,</p>
<p>will share with the planners, will help shape the towers,</p>
<p>the basement foundations</p>
<p>and the neighborly labor of digging,</p>
<p>of digging and building our city anew.</p>
<p>And so, in the morning, I may scrape out a waste dump,</p>
<p>figuring out how with my pals on the job.</p>
<p>In my 2 p.m. gig, I may write a paper on AIDS,</p>
<p>or hug and console</p>
<p>a stranger or friend.</p>
<p>My evening, perhaps, put our heads in the oven</p>
<p>as we clean a community stove,</p>
<p>or I may weave a poem, or rest overlong,</p>
<p>or whatever seems needed and fun</p>
<p>as we build our embraceable</p>
<p>new global city</p>
<p>from the petals and rootings of dreams.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is not the vision offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511427079">Winston Churchill (1940)</xref> of ‘blood, sweat and tears’, nor the ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness’ of the United States Declaration of Independence, nor the <italic>Liberté, Égalité</italic> and <italic>Fraternité</italic> of the French Revolution and subsequent national motto. Not that all of these will be totally absent. Sweat is inherent both in the need to clean up the many messes capitalism will have left us and, more basically, in the fact that much physical work (and enjoyable exercise) will always need to be done. Tears, also, are inherent in life and death and disappointments, but I think we will be able to build new ways to structure our time that will create new forms of social support and solidarity to soothe our pains – and to move us considerably beyond the mere pursuit of happiness to its actuality. Equality will need to be built as an urgent task after we disperse the capitalist state and as a part of destroying and replacing capitalist work relationships. Here, the equality will include eliminating ‘boss’ and ‘worker’ inequalities and probably also international income inequalities in order to build the new economic relationships I have described. The struggles against racial, ethnic, gender, and other inequalities will be strengthened by the solidarities we build in the struggle to end the old world and, I think, by the understanding of the possibilities of the new world, but victory is not foreordained. (That is to say, they are struggles we need to wage even after we eliminate the capitalist state and take over the workplaces.)</p>
<p>Liberty, and indeed much broader freedom than that, will also need to be built and defended. This was the subject of the previous section and, indeed, of the sections before them.</p>
<p>We can and I suspect will go far beyond <italic>Fraternité</italic> (and even <italic>Sororité</italic>) and community. Their origins will be in the solidarity of the struggle to oust capitalism, but they will also flower as we reshape workplaces and neighborhoods to be places of sociability and enjoyment to an ever-greater degree. Beyond this, I think our working together and creating new ideas of how to cooperate and how to organize our lives, and our use of our power and solidarity to eliminate hunger, homelessness, poverty, and boredom may breed many other benefits. One of the four freedoms that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511427079">Roosevelt (1941)</xref> claimed as a goal was freedom from fear. Humanity has always known well-grounded fear of hunger, of scorn, and of each other. I think that we can go a long way towards ending these fears – including most fear of each other – by building the world I have described in this article.</p>
