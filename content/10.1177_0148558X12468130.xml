<abstract>
<p>The legal and economic rationales for using off-balance sheet structures for securitizations of receivables are compelling. However, accounting standards enabled self-interested parties to participate in the securitizations in nontransparent ways. For instance, securitizing firms set up the off-balance sheet structures, sold tranches to these structures, and often booked gains on these sales based on internally determined valuations. In addition, the tranches retained by the firm were marked to market, again based on internally determined valuations. In the wake of the financial crisis, the accounting standards changed and began requiring most off-balance sheet structures to be reconsolidated. However, the standards continued to allow nontransparent treatments. Namely, the securitized assets, which had largely become nonperforming, were written down in a way to avoid income recognition, providing incentives to overaccrue allowances, which are now being released as gains in income. We provide a case study to illustrate the issues in detail, and we expand our study to the group of the largest credit card securitizers. We highlight the implications of triple-counting income for research analysts, academicians, and policy makers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Firms with large pools of receivables, such as mortgages and credit card receivables, often accelerate cash flows by either borrowing against the receivables or by selling them to another entity. In the case of a sale, a firm (the transferor) will remove the receivables from its balance sheet, receive cash, and recognize the sale and the “cost of sale.” The purchaser of the receivables (the transferee) is often an entity established by the transferor itself. The transferee acts as an intermediary between the transferor of the receivables and the investor, who is the ultimate source of financing for the purchase of the receivables. The investors are creditors who buy bonds (or perhaps equities) issued by the transferee. The bonds or other beneficial interests are collateralized by the transferor’s pools of receivables held by the transferee.</p>
<p>In the case of borrowing against the receivables, the firm would leave the receivables on its books and simply show a liability equal to the borrowed amount. The firm would disclose the pledged receivables in note disclosures.</p>
<p>To qualify for sales accounting, certain conditions had to be met, particularly with respect to the relationship between the transferor and the transferee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0148558X12468130">1</xref></sup> Regulators and standard setters came to realize that the accounting standards did not anticipate certain corporate structures that affected transparency and that also affected the relationship between transferor and transferee. Therefore, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently issued new standards to address deficiencies in the old. As a result, many firms that had previously used sales accounting are now undoing this accounting treatment and are transitioning to financing accounting, under one of three transition methods promulgated by the FASB.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to review the reasons why a firm would choose sales accounting. These reasons extend beyond the ability to borrow “off-balance sheet” and include income enhancement through the use of fair values, which were established in an environment characterized by severe agency conflict. This fact has strong implications for standard setters, market participants, and academics who rely on the notion that fair values possess the attributes of unbiasedness and timeliness.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this article is to discuss the FASB’s transitioning methods. We find two of the transition choices to be particularly problematic, as they essentially allow the transitioning firm to double-count income in nontransparent ways. In fact, under certain circumstances, transferors could conceivably book income 3 times from the same pool of assets. The implications of recycling income streams are profound and include overcompensation (where bonuses are based on income), overpricing earnings (for instance, by analysts in setting a firm’s target price), and severe measurement error in academic studies of value relevance of fair values.</p>
<p>We continue as follows. In the next section, we describe conceptual issues and our initial findings. The section titled “Relevant Literature” gives an overview of literature that is specifically relevant to the topic of securitization. The “Sales Accounting and Transition Choices” section discusses sales accounting in particular and gives simplified examples of the transition choices. The section titled “Discover Financial and Its Peer Group” presents the cases of Discover and the broader sample of credit card firms. In the last section, we conclude the article by considering the implications of our findings on standard setters, market participants, and academics. Finally, we pose nonrhetorical questions for considerations by these constituents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148558X12468130">
<title>Conceptual Issues and Initial Findings</title>
<p>Firms that securitize receivables often keep a tranche (called “retained interests”), which they reclassify from a receivable to an investment. Different accounting treatments are used for receivables and investments. Namely, for receivables, firms assess credit risk and make adjustments to the receivables’ carrying value, as needed. For investments, depending on how firms classify the investments, they would use amortized cost or fair values.</p>
<p>The transition from sales accounting to financing accounting revealed that the investments (the retained interests) had to be written down. The write down, which we illustrate in the Section titled “Sales Accounting and Transition Choices,” is taken directly against retained earnings. The write down is surprising because, as we show for the major credit card firms, the investments had in fact been accounted for at fair value. The implication is that fair value methodology did not capture the reduction in value of the credit receivable balances in a timely manner, which generally is considered to be one of the benefits of fair value.</p>
<p>In addition, when the credit receivables that had been transferred to the transferee are reconsolidated onto the books of the transferor, the transferor had to assess credit risks associated with these receivables and compare this assessment against reserves taken by the transferee. In assessing the credit risk, the transferor used a contingency model based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148558X12468130">FASB, 1975</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0148558X12468130">2</xref></sup> Because the provisions were made at the time of reconsolidation, we believe the problems with the receivables had not been recognized in the off-balance-sheet entity in the appropriate period(s). Moreover, the additional reserves that the transferor recognized (on an absolute basis) exceeded the reduction in values that the transferor had taken on its own investments in applying fair values.</p>
<p>An interesting issue arises about whether the relative adjustments to the provisions for credit risk under the contingency model diverge significantly from the adjustments in values under the fair value model. Both models assess future conditions and cash flows and both are probability based. If, for instance, a contingency model obtains a write down of 10% of receivables, whereas a fair value model obtains a write down of 5%, and both sets of receivables are deemed to possess similar quality, insights on the explanation would be useful for standard setters and academics.</p>
<p>With respect to the reconsolidated receivables, transferors had the motive and opportunity to “overaccrue” the provisions (under the contingency model). This is because the recognition of the provision for credit risk is outside income (charged directly against retained earnings), and the subsequent reversals of overaccrued provisions would be through income (with a positive effect). We believe, however, that neither the fair value model nor the contingency model provide unbiased estimates, and our belief rests on the existence of severe agency conflict, rather than on any deficient technology in estimating values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0148558X12468130">3</xref></sup> As we show in the section titled “Discover Financial and Its Peer Group,” our belief is supported by the fact that nontrivial reversals of overaccrued allowances are now appearing in income of our sample firms. For instance, Discover Financial (a firm in our sample and the subject of our case study), reported fiscal third quarter (2010) profit of US$260.6 million, a large part of which resulted directly from the release of reserves. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X12468130">Saha-Bubna (2010)</xref>, “Discover’s provision for credit losses, at US$712.6 million, fell 34% from a year earlier, with the company releasing US$187 million from its reserve in the third quarter.” The reserve release offset a 7% revenue decline from the previous year.</p>
<p>Several academic studies have documented the tendency for firms to engage in big-bath accounting. The tendency in the current context is arguably exacerbated due to the asymmetric effects on income. The negative effects are recognized directly against retained earnings and the positive effects (reversals of the negative effects) are recognized in income in the period of the reversal.</p>
<p>Reserve adjustments are typically required on an ongoing basis due to the nature of the estimation process. We therefore do not imply that Discover’s adjustments (the increase to the provision and the subsequent release) are abnormal in this instance. In addition, we have no basis for determining Discover’s due diligence in arriving at the estimates nor the processes they used. Rather, our focus is on the processes and methods <italic>allowed</italic> by accounting standard setters that impede transparency and give opportunity to firms to act in self-serving ways without objective oversight.</p>
<p>We also believe that standard setters in the United States have unwittingly accommodated the triple-recognition of income from the same pool of assets. The use of the off-balance sheet structure, the use of fair value estimates, and the way that certain transition methods are structured, will have allowed transferors to recognize the (a) gain on the initial transfer, (b) income produced (such as interest) on the reconsolidated receivables,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0148558X12468130">4</xref></sup> and (c) income from the reversals of any overaccrued provisions for bad debt.</p>
<p>The concerns about fair values in an environment of agency conflict call into question the academic studies that have as an underlying axiom the belief that fair values are unbiased and timely. We acknowledge that one sample does not systematically counter the notions of unbiasedness and timeliness and does not necessarily discredit articles that postulate that fair values possess these attributes. However, we argue that our sample, which represents virtually the entire market for credit card receivables, does show that fair values are neither unbiased nor timely in that industry, and we attribute this to agency conflict, rather than to deficiency in the methodology for estimating fair values. We base our claim on the size and the timing of the write downs, which we describe in the section titled “Discover Financial and Its Peer Group.” As we show, the write downs were of significant magnitude and were completely undisclosed until firms were forced to reconsolidate. Our observations represent prima facie evidence that fair values lack unbiasedness and timeliness.</p>
<p>With respect to accounting standards’ facilitation of triple-counting earnings, we draw attention to how the pool of receivables that is broken into component parts is somehow valued at an amount that is greater than it was as a whole. This is <italic>reverse</italic> of the usual cliché of obtaining a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, such as the elusive “synergy” (goodwill) that appears in mergers. By contrast, here, a single pool is more valuable, as determined by the transferor, when it is disaggregated than when it is held together as a single unit. Transferors became a sort of “chop shop” for streams of future cash flows that they would selectively transfer to the off-balance-sheet entity.</p>
<p>One of the prevailing characteristics of accounting standards is that information disclosed should be reliable, meaning that it should be verifiable. One way to verify value that is assigned to an asset is the value that is determined in an arm’s length exchange with an unrelated party. Many observers came to question whether sales of tranches to entities created by the firm itself provided a sufficient basis for verifying value.</p>
<p>Also, the tranche retained by the transferor (retained interest) was relabeled from receivable to investment. Except for held-to-maturity investments, the retained interests would be measured at fair value, with mark-to-market effects in income or other comprehensive income. In addition to retained tranches, the transferor may also have retained rights to servicing activities, which the transferor would recognize as an intangible asset, also measured at fair value. The values assigned to the retained interests and servicing rights were often valued as Level 2 and Level 3 assets (under SFAS No. 157), meaning the firms had control over determining appropriate inputs needed to estimate the values. Given the questions about verifiability, questions also naturally arose as to whether the parts were indeed greater than the whole.</p>
<p>In conclusion, traditionally, receivables offered interest as the only return on the investment. With the ingenuity of the financial services sector, and enabled by accounting standards, alternative ways to monetize the assets opened up. Firms would be able to slice the pool in a way such that the parts would be deemed greater than the whole. The accounting profession accepted as sufficiently reliable the methods of valuing the disaggregated pool, and accounting standards allowed firms to create an entity that became a de facto customer for a tranche (the investors did not buy the tranche directly). Firms were allowed to “sell” to that customer, choose the inventory that was sold, and establish the value of the transaction. Regardless, standard setters believed that the in-house prices were sufficiently reliable.</p>
<p>Transferors then relabeled the retained tranche as an investment, marking it to market in many cases. Thus, for those investments measured at fair value, the firm had a direct role in assigning the values because the market for these investments would often not be liquid and instead would be unique assets requiring Level 2 or Level 3 valuations.</p>
<p>Some observers have drawn analogies to regular inventory of day-to-day products, rather than “inventory” of financial assets. For example, imagine allowing a retailer to break apart its inventory into component parts, sell some inventory to a customer whom it had created, retain some components of the inventory, establish the value of the components it sells and book a realized gain on the sale, relabel the inventory it retains as an “investment,” establish the value of the components it retains, and book a paper gain on those retained components using an internal valuation metric because there is no ready market for the component parts. In the meantime, the sold components become damaged or obsolete, but the retailer is not responsible for the condition of the inventory at the customer’s warehouse and therefore does not recognize a write down in its financial statements.</p>
<p>Understandably, the standard setters began to improve the accounting for such transactions by removing the entity, the so-called “Qualifying Special Purpose Entity,” that allowed the “sale.” Arguably, what standard setters did not anticipate, however, was the severity of the decline in value of the assets that had been transferred to the Qualifying Special Purpose Entity.</p>
<p>As a result of our analysis of our sample firms, we hold the opinion that the new accounting standards actually perpetuate the problem of nontransparency. When transferors undo the past, they determine value on the reconsolidated receivables (or “reclaimed inventory”). These values have implications for the future, potentially allowing firms the chance to book earnings on the same pool of assets twice, if not 3 times.</p>

<title>Relevant Literature</title>
<p>There are few published academic articles that are directly relevant to our study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X12468130">Dechow and Shakespeare (2009)</xref> address whether managers attempt to time securitization transactions to obtain accounting benefits. Our findings suggest that the timing may be secondary to the agency environment in terms of the impact on earnings, specifically with respect to earnings management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148558X12468130">Landsman, Peasnell, and Shakespeare (2008)</xref> address whether asset securitizations are interpreted by the market as sales or loans. They restate the results of securitizing firms as if they had used financing accounting. However, the study does not consider the issues related to unbiased estimates of fair values that transferors arguably made, given the agency environment.</p>
<p>Also, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X12468130">Barth and Taylor (2010)</xref> who support the role of fair value accounting rules in securitizations, we find the use of fair values to be problematic, again due to the apparent bias in estimating fair values. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148558X12468130">Ryan (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148558X12468130">Chen, Liu, and Ryan (2008)</xref> address the roles played by certain accounting issues in the subprime crisis. We add another dimension to these latter articles by showing the inherent conflicts behind the measurements of fair values. In sum, our research suggests that caution be exercised in interpreting results in studies (future and existing studies) that use or defend fair values.</p>
<p>Although our sample is relatively small in number, it nonetheless represents virtually the entire industry of credit card securitizers, measured in terms of total assets. For instance, our sample includes 7 of the top 50 Bank Holding Companies, and 3 of our sample firms (Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Citigroup) are the top 3 in terms of total assets (US$6.2 trillion, combined).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0148558X12468130">5</xref></sup> Thus, our study has implications for the existing studies mentioned above (all of which specifically address securitizations) even though we focus on credit card securitizers. We believe that the severity of the inherent agency conflict in the particular industry that we study should not be interpreted to mean that the conflicts are less severe or confined to this particular industry. Thus, we contend that the use of (or continued use of) specific statistical controls for the agency environment are critical for any future study that uses fair values.</p>

<title>Sales Accounting and Transition Choices</title>
<sec id="section5-0148558X12468130">
<title>Sales Accounting</title>
<p>In sales accounting, the transferor typically transfers a pool of financial assets (receivables) to another entity, the transferee, who pays the transferor for the financial assets with capital obtained through issuances of debt or equity to third-party investors. The financial assets held by the transferee provide collateral for the securities sold to the investors. The transferor often retains a slice (tranche) of the receivables. The retention of a tranche in the receivables often resulted in credit and liquidity risk remaining with the transferor. This retention of risk apparently allowed the transferor to obtain more attractive financing terms. In fact, this is a primary explanation for the transferor being able to sell the tranches at values greater than their assigned cost, that is, at a profit, suggesting that the parts are greater than the whole. Also, the transferee was structured as a bankruptcy remote vehicle, which in combination with the transferor’s retention of risk, contributed to the transferor being able to extract a profit. In essence, these two protections made third-party investors willing to pay a premium for the cash flows.</p>
<p>It is surprising that the gains on sales of receivables did not receive more descriptive disclosure about how they originated and were measured. Firms are required under SFAS No. 157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148558X12468130">FASB, 2006</xref>) to value these tranches for accounting purposes, preferably with reference to prices in the market place (even if the market was problematic in such pricing). Where market prices were absent or inappropriate, firms applied the methodologies either for Level 2 or Level 3 assets, both of which, however, gave managers considerable discretion and possibilities for opportunistic pricing. In addition, credit rating agencies’ conflicted relationships with transferors arguably affected the estimates of credit ratings in a biased way. Therefore, it is surprising, admittedly in hindsight, to observe the degree of trust placed in firms to measure fair values, of the transferred receivables and those retained, because of the degree of agency conflict.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the transferee was officially known as a “Qualifying Special Purpose Entity” (QSPE). The transferee was deemed a QSPE when the outside creditors (investors) who are holders of the beneficial interests are allowed to pledge or transfer their interest. Other criteria for QSPE status are that the transferee is a passive entity, and, as mentioned, the entity is bankruptcy remote, so that the transferred assets are separate from the transferor.</p>
<p>Until recently, QSPEs were stand-alone entities and were not consolidated with the transferors. Meeting requirements for QSPE status was quite attractive, because the transferor no longer had to consider the need for consolidation and therefore could automatically use sales accounting and raise financing off-balance sheet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0148558X12468130">6</xref></sup> Even though creditors did not directly buy the receivables, they bought interests that were backed by the receivables and the interests flowed through the QSPE back to the transferor. When the criteria for QSPE status (and for sales accounting) were not met, transferors would evaluate whether the transferee required consolidation. If consolidation was deemed to be necessary, the transferor would consolidate the receivables and the debt issued by the transferee and use financing accounting.</p>
<p>During the financial crisis, regulators and standard setters came to believe that some firms were misapplying the QSPE criteria, resulting in many securitizations occurring in entities that were not passive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0148558X12468130">7</xref></sup> Therefore, the FASB issued standards which have essentially brought about the demise of the QSPE and the subsequent reconsolidation of the transferred receivables, as well as recognition of the related financing that had been on the QSPE’s books. Entities that were previously automatically exempted from consideration for consolidation now had to be assessed. SFAS No. 167 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12468130">FASB, 2009b</xref>) contains a series of tests to see whether a transferor can bypass consolidation. If these tests are met, then the firm would determine if sales accounting could still be used under SFAS No. 166 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148558X12468130">FASB, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Sales accounting for financial assets such as receivables can be thought of as bifurcation of financial assets into “component parts.” These parts consist of receivables that are retained versus those that are sold. The difference between the values attributed to those component parts that are considered sold and their ultimate selling price is recognized as a gain on the sale. Thus, sales accounting is often referred to as “component part” accounting or as “bifurcation” accounting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148558X12468130">
<title>Transition Choices</title>
<p>For enterprises required to consolidate an entity as a result of SFAS No. 167, standard setters gave firms three transition choices, described below.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0148558X12468130">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<list id="list1-0148558X12468130" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The consolidating firm (the transferor) would measure the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the transferee at amounts equal to those as if financing had been used from the beginning. The transferor would consolidate the transferee’s receivables and debt and would adjust Retained Earnings for all previously recognized income effects, including the gain on the sale of the receivables. This choice is difficult to implement due to the difficulty of determining those historical values for securitizations that occurred many years ago. However, in our sample, General Electric used this transition method. The reconsolidated receivables may require a provision for bad debt.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The reporting enterprise could alternatively consolidate and present assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at fair value. In our sample, CompuCredit used this method.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If the activities of the transferee were primarily related to securitizations or other forms of asset-backed financings, and if the assets could be used only to settle obligations of the reporting entity, then the assets and liabilities could be measured at their unpaid principal balances. This reporting choice is used by the remaining firms in our sample. It is also the method that many firms in the financial services sector lobbied for, as revealed in their comment letters.</p>

<title>Simplified Examples of Transition Choices</title>
<p>The following simplified illustration shows the differences among the transition choices. However, we begin with the securitization itself.</p>
<p>Assume a firm (the transferor) has receivables with a total book value of US$50. The fair value of the receivables if broken into tranches is deemed to be US$70 of which US$40 is transferred to a QSPE. The assigned cost of the receivable sold (“cost of goods sold”) is US$28.6 (40 / 70 × 50). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12468130">Table 1</xref>, we give the entry (in intuitive form, rather than conventional “debit and credit” form) to transfer (sell) the receivables to the transferee.</p>

<p>If the firm had classified the Retained Interest as Available-for-Sale, the offset would have been to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, rather than Retained Earnings. If the financial asset had been designated as held-to-maturity, the accounting would have been at amortized cost, unless there was an “other than temporary” impairment.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Under this transition method, the firm simply reverses the prior entries. The assets are returned, the debt is recognized, and the earnings effects are undone, albeit not through current income, but rather through Retained Earnings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0148558X12468130">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A major concern arising from this method is the potential for double counting earnings. When sales accounting was initially used, the firm booked a gain on the sale of US$11.4. This transition method reverses the gain against Retained Earnings. Therefore, the undoing of the income effect is not shown in current earnings. Subsequently, the assets that are reconsolidated on the transferor’s books will produce income <italic>again</italic>. Namely, the pool of receivables will earn interest income that will be booked in current and future Income Statements. In essence, therefore, income produced from the same pool of assets will be double counted.</p>
<p>One consequence of double counting earnings relates to compensatory arrangements and firm valuations. To the extent that employees are compensated on the same earnings twice or that financial models use the same earnings twice, distortions in incentive effects and firm valuations will naturally result. (Another problem, which we discuss in Transition Choice 3, is the provisioning for loan losses.)</p>

<sec id="section10-0148558X12468130">
<title>Transition Choice 3: Reversal of Securitization Using Current Principal Balances</title>
<p>The final transition choice allows firms to use the current principal balances of the receivable and the debt held by the transferee. This transition choice is on the surface the simplest for transferors to implement because it entails consolidating current balances, as opposed to initial balances (which could be several years in the past) or balances at fair values (which would require using a valuation technique or model). However, this choice is not simple because the receivables must be consolidated at values that are adjusted for loan loss provisions. That is, an allowance for nonperforming assets (uncollectible accounts) must be measured. (As we mentioned above, the first transition choice shares this attribute of having to estimate bad debt on the reconsolidated receivables.) As we will show in our sample, these allowances were of tremendous magnitude and heretofore unknown because of lack of reporting requirements for the QSPEs.</p>
<p>For this simplified example, assume that the transferee had collected US$15 of the receivable and had reduced the principal of the debt by an equal amount. Thus, the principal balances of the Receivable and Debt are both US$25 (40 – 15). We ignore both interest earned and interest paid as it is not germane for our purposes. The transferor would book the following to undo sales accounting and consolidate the transferee (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0148558X12468130">Table 9</xref>).</p>

<p>The balance in the Receivable is US$35. Its book value began as US$50. It was written up to US$70. Of the US$70, US$11.4 adjustment was held on the books of the transferee and US$8.6 on the books of the transferor. Upon adoption of the new standard and this particular transition choice, the transferor writes down the receivable by US$20 (the sum of US$11.4 and US$8.6) to take the value back to the book value of US$50. The transferee’s collection of US$15 of cash reduces the carrying value to US$35.</p>
<p>However, now assume that the reconsolidated receivables need to be adjusted by a loss provision (Allowance) of US$10 (assumed). The Allowance represents a future deduction.

<p>The problem with this method (as well as the first) is that the provision for loan losses will not pass through the Income Statement of the transferor. Rather, the charge for the provision avoids income recognition by going directly to Retained Earnings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0148558X12468130">11</xref></sup> (As we illustrate in the Discover case below, the provision for bad debt is the largest adjustment in the entry in the transition.) As is the case with any provisioning, if the provisions are overaccrued, future income will be enhanced as the overaccrued allowance is released. The likelihood of overaccruing is arguably increased in this instance because earnings are not affected by the provisioning in the first place. A very possible consequence is that income will be earned in three different ways on the same assets: (a) gain on the initial sale, (b) accretion of interest on the reconsolidated receivable, and (c) reversals of provisions on receivables.</p>
<p>The problem is illustrated below by Chimera Investment Company (2009 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission):
<disp-quote>
<p>The consolidation is expected to reverse approximately $98.1 million in previously recorded GAAP gains on sales of assets related to the re-securitizations undertaken in 2009. The reversal of this gain will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the re-securitized assets. (p. 61)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chimera alludes to the compensation issue. It states in the same filing that the “management fee” is based on its stockholders’ equity, adjusted for one-time effects from changes in accounting principles. Thus, any charge to retained earnings would appear to be removed. Although Chimera does not explicitly state that the compensation base would be affected (increased) by accreted interest (as it is ongoing), one could arguably draw that precise conclusion. If accreted interest is included in the compensation base, the management fee would be based twice upon earnings from the same asset pool. This is problematic from an investor’s viewpoint and from a governance viewpoint.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all three transition methods come with issues. The first and third transition choices discussed above have the double (triple)-counting problem, and the second choice has the problem of estimating fair values.</p>
<p>In addition, the standard setters have not addressed in a clear way how the valuations of component parts can total more than the pool of receivables as a single unit. As these component parts are reconsolidated on the balance sheets of the transferors, this previously recognized “premium” has disappeared inside Retained Earnings without understanding its source in the first place. The issue is important because conceivably other asset pools representing future cash flows could be “tranched,” then revalued with a similar type premium, and finally reconsolidated under a mixed attribute model allowing for different accounting treatments for the reconsolidated components.</p>
<p>A final fundamental issue is how the accounting standards allowed transferors to book loan loss provisions in a way that is less than fully transparent (by using Retained Earnings). Even though problems about the creditworthiness of the receivables began in earlier time periods (while at the QSPE and before reconsolidation), the transferor was the originator of the receivable as well as the creator of the QSPE. Therefore, a reasonable question would be whether the transferor should not book in current income the charge for the provision, especially because in many cases, the transferor also retained servicing rights for the receivables and would therefore have some direct knowledge of the performance of the receivables.</p>

<p>The adoption resulted in recognizing credit card receivables of US$27 billion and debt of US$22.3 billion. Retained interests that consisted of interest-only (I/O) strips, available-for-sale securities (AFS) and held-to-maturity securities (HTM) were also reclassified as part of the receivables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0148558X12468130">13</xref></sup> The adoption resulted in a provision for loan losses, net of tax effect, of US$1.3 billion, as shown below and highlighted above:</p>
<p>–2.1 Allowance + 0.8 Deferred Tax Asset = −1.3 Retained Earnings</p>
<p>Thus, the entire reduction in retained earnings equals the newly created loan loss provision, net of income taxes.</p>
<p>Discover’s underperforming receivables are revealed for the first time upon transition from sales accounting to financing accounting. The transition charge of US$1.3 billion is against the “past” (Retained Earnings) and will not ever flow through the Income Statement. Also, if the US$1.3 billion is attributable to third-party beneficial interests (that is, with recourse to the investors), then a note disclosure would appear to be appropriate, but none was made in this instance. Therefore, we infer that the transferor bears the responsibility for the underperforming assets, which calls into question the relationship between the transferor and the QSPE all along.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0148558X12468130">14</xref></sup> However, SFAS No. 140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X12468130">FASB, 2000</xref>) was based on a controls model and not a risks-and-rewards model, so the transferor could retain credit risk and still use sales accounting.</p>
<p>Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), AFS are accounted for at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). An impairment loss is recognized if deemed other than temporary and the firm did not have the intent and ability to hold this instrument to recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0148558X12468130">15</xref></sup> Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost and tested for impairment based on estimates of probable incurred losses. Finally, credit card portfolios are accounted for using a loan loss model under SFAS No. 5. We would expect the unrealized losses in AOCI and impairments on HTM to capture the additional loan loss provisions, when losses are borne by the transferor (i.e., holder of retained interests). The fair value of retained interests should reflect impairments in underlying securities. If losses are attributed to the third-party transferee, the eventual gain on write down of notes payable owed to the transferee offsets the additional loan loss provision taken earlier. However, this may result in an accounting mismatch, because loan losses are recognized at date of adoption through retained earnings. The gains on writing-off notes payable flow through income in future periods.</p>
<p>As shown in the exhibit from Discover (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-0148558X12468130">Table 14</xref>), total unrealized losses sum to US$562,860 (115,857 + 34 + 430,655 + 10,152 + 6,162). This amount is approximately 27.0% of the provision of US$2.1 billion.</p>

<p>Although the QSPEs are now largely recognized on the books of the transferor, better disclosure would have been helpful in understanding the economics of the transactions between the transferor and the transferee. Looking ahead, enhanced disclosure will facilitate this important understanding for continuing and future structures that are similar to those now being terminated under the new accounting standards. In particular, it would be insightful to know how the valuations of the retained interest compare with the valuations of those tranches transferred to the outside entity. Although the values of retained interest were known and audited, the values of the tranches transferred were not, nor were the underlying net assets within the QSPE. It could be reasonably assumed that the retained interests and transferred tranches would be valued similarly, given their underlying commonality in the original pools of assets (such as credit card receivables), but we learn only upon reconsolidation that the transferor had to make significant adjustments. These adjustments were necessary for the retained interest and the reconsolidated tranches, as we show above in the consolidation entry and in the table of unrealized losses. Why this is the case is a cause of concern, and standard setters should pursue the reasons. Are the accounting models so dissimilar that the pools of assets are measured in ways that do not capture the same attribute of “value,” be it market value or net realizable value? Alternatively, do incentives exist to measure the pools of assets in opportunistic ways that distort the economic reality of deteriorating values? By increasing transparency between the tethered pools of assets, it creates the self-checking mechanism on determining values, if the valuation models in fact capture similar economic realities. Thus, we believe the need exists to reconcile the disparity between the loan loss provision under the FASB 5 contingency model and the fair value model (and impairment model for held-to-maturity investments) used in accounting for retained interests. This would better enable an understanding of the underlying causes of the disparities and the economics of the transaction.</p>
<p>In its 10-K, Discover presents financial information on a so-called “managed basis.” This basis presents Discover’s financial results as if it had been using “modified” financing accounting. Discover indicates this is no longer necessary, because they have now adopted financing accounting for GAAP. The previous applications of GAAP (sales accounting) and the managed basis (financing accounting) present a contradiction. If the managed basis is financing, then the question arises as to why sales accounting was even used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0148558X12468130">
<title>Pro Forma Disclosures</title>
<p>Under requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), firms must reconcile their non-GAAP (pro forma) disclosures (such as Discover’s “managed basis” disclosures) to GAAP. Therefore, Discover must show the adjustments from its managed basis to GAAP. On adoption of the new accounting standards, Discover provides “additional adjustments to adjusted” numbers of its managed basis. However, if the managed basis was meant to provide a better assessment of risk and rewards, then Discover’s “additional adjustments to the adjusted” number could imply that this was not the case. Excerpts from Discover’s discussion of its managed basis are below.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>First, we made securitization adjustments to reverse the effect of loan securitization by recharacterizing securitization income to report interest income, income expense, provision for loan losses, discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income in the same line items as non-securitized loans. These adjustments result in a “managed basis” presentation, which we have historically included in our quarterly and annual reports to reflect the way in which our senior management evaluated our business performance and allocated resources in the past. (Form 10-K, p. 48)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Then, additional adjustments were made to reflect results as if the trusts used in our securitization activities had been fully consolidated in our historical results.</p>

<title>Sample of Major Credit Card Securitizers</title>
<p>We extend our analysis of Discover by including a sample of transferors with credit card trusts. We identified these entities through an EDGAR search of financial institutions with large credit card securitizations. The number of such firms is 11. (Target was also identified but we deleted it from the sample because it did not use sales accounting, rather financing accounting.)</p>
<p>For each firm, we calculate the impact on opening retained earnings as of the date of adoption. All firms adopted as of first quarter of 2010, except for Discover. Discover has a different year-end and adopted as of the last quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>CompuCredit chose Method 2 as the transition method from sales accounting and therefore used fair values in its transition. General Electric chose Method 1 and therefore had to undo the impact of sales accounting by reconstructing the accounts as if financing had been used all along. General Electric illustrates the issue of undoing previously recorded gains and recording them again in the future. Because the additional loan loss provision for General Electric is below the reduction in retained earnings on adoption of the new pronouncement, we attribute the differences to reversal of securitizations gains. Those gains will be recognized in the future and will be double counted as they are recognized again through income as investing income.</p>

<p>For all the large credit card securitizers including General Electric, the cumulative effect of the adjustment is attributable to the additional provision for loan losses. As these additional provisions are charged against retained earnings, they never pass through income. These impacts, which we scale by opening retained earnings, range from a reduction of 1% for PNC to 39% for Alliance Data Systems.</p>
<p>The incentives to be conservative in recording the loan loss reserves are clear. When overaccrued reserves are released, future income is enhanced, as confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148558X12468130">Eckblad (2010)</xref>. Eckblad reports that the biggest U.S. banks “virtually doubled their collective earnings in the third quarter just by injecting US$8.1 billion into net income from funds they had set aside to cover loan losses” (p. C1). J. P. Morgan Chase’s third-quarter earnings of US$4.4 billion included US$1.7 billion from the bank’s loan loss reserves that were reversed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148558X12468130">Fitch Ratings (2010)</xref> supports this finding showing that card segment profitability was positive for all issuers through the first 9 months of 2010, excluding Bank of America’s goodwill impairment charge. Fitch states that provision expenses drove bottom line improvement, as revenues were generally lower, given portfolio contraction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The demise of the QSPE brings to light the question of how firms were allowed to assign valuations (without extensive accompanying disclosures) of component parts of a pool of receivables whose values exceeded the value of the pool as a whole. Many interested observers also question (admittedly with the advantage of hindsight) how accounting standards could allow firms to transfer receivables to entities created by the firms themselves without more transparency and oversight of these vehicles. In such a conflict of interest, the passivity of the transferee and independence between the transferor and transferee are called into question. It is also of concern that the transferees had limited or no reporting requirements. That notwithstanding, transferors could arguably have been in position to alert investors about the diminished values of the receivables, even though these receivables were no longer on their (the transferors’) books.</p>
<p>The current set of choices for transitioning from sales accounting to financing accounting means that <italic>no</italic> party (transferor, transferee, investor) accepts the responsibility for diminished values of the receivables, at least as far as income recognition is concerned. The “hit” is against the past, as if it had all along been the responsibility and concern of someone else. Moreover, the charge against the past could easily and conceivably be overaccrued, precisely because there is no downside, but (large) potential upside. Current earnings are not affected, but future earnings could be boosted as potentially overaccrued provisions are reversed. Therefore, this may be the first context in which the same asset pools’ effects on income are not double counted, but rather <italic>triple</italic> counted.</p>
<p>Another question that needs to be addressed is how to justify such large differences between the non-GAAP numbers used for managing a business and corresponding GAAP numbers, because GAAP has the economic portrayal of a firm as one of its major goals. Investors and creditors must be puzzled at the enormous difference between what standard setters have agreed upon as “proper” measurement and recognition versus what firms themselves are presenting. In such an atmosphere, it is difficult and confusing for investors to try to interpret the adjusted numbers and arguably nearly impossible to understand “<italic>adjusted</italic> adjusted numbers.” Investors will also wonder, in assessing firms’ governance and incentive structures, whether precautions are instituted so that employees are not paid twice (or 3 times) for the same earnings streams.</p>
<p>Finally, academics (certainly ourselves included) should be cautious in ascribing “usefulness” or “value relevance” to fair values. The difficulty in measuring “fair” values requires a certain degree of guarded skepticism, as it is quite likely that the technology and methodology for estimating fair value to produce a number that is useful is limited. More important, skepticism is especially warranted because these numbers that are estimated as fair emanate from an environment fraught with agency problems. These issues are particularly timely, as an exposure draft issued June 24, 2010, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” addresses revenue recognition, which involves substantial bifurcation and use of fair values.</p>
<p>As the imbroglio in the financial services sector slowly dies down, we, along with many other observers, are concerned that other potential flare-ups will occur. We encourage the accounting profession, academicians, standard setters, and regulators to consider the issues and questions we raise and make adjustments as deemed necessary. Examples of questions that arise from our study include the following: Should “cumulative effects” be resurrected for issues such as these described in the article (rather than charging prior earnings effects and loan loss provisions directly against Retained Earnings)? Should any and all conduits or other off-balance-sheet entities that the firm (transferor) creates directly or indirectly be reconsolidated (due to a natural agency conflict)? Should non-GAAP results be restricted to only certain allowable adjustments? Should securitization gains be fully justified and described in terms of how a tranched pool of cash flows can be valued at an amount that is greater than the pool as a whole? Should prior academic studies documenting relevance of fair values be reexamined with appropriate controls for agency environments?</p>

<p>Credit card loan provisions are scoped out of SFAS No. 114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148558X12468130">FASB, 1993</xref>) and continued to be accounted for under SFAS No. 5. In our sample, the loan loss provisions are considerably larger than the fair value adjustments recognized for the retained interests accounted for as trading or available-for-sale securities.</p>

<p>It is not immediately clear which party bears the burden of uncollectible receivables. That is, when the receivables are written off, it is unclear whether the transferor will bear the burden or if there is any recourse to the investors in the beneficial interest.</p>

<p>In the context of our article, we are describing issues that we feel the accounting profession, standard setters, and regulators need to address. We chose Discover simply as a reference point for our discussion and analysis but do not suggest in any way that they entered into transactions or made disclosures that were improper.</p>

<p>We note that Discover does continue to show on its November 30, 2009, balance sheet held-to-maturity investments of US$2.34 billion and parenthetically a corresponding fair value of US$1.95 billion.</p>

<p>If the third party ultimately does in fact bear the loan losses, the transferor benefits by not having to repay the third party and also benefits by reversing all of its loan loss provisions. Irrespective of the fact that we observe the transferor booking the provisions, it is not transparent as to which party will ultimately bear the burden of any nonperforming assets.</p>

<p>Under FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X12468130">FASB, 2009c</xref>), a firm no longer determines whether it has “intent and ability,” but rather determines whether it has the intent to sell or is more likely than not required to sell before it recovers its costs basis. If so, the loss goes through income. If the holder does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that it will have to sell before it recovers its cost basis, the holder disaggregates credit losses from other losses and puts through income only the credit losses.</p>
