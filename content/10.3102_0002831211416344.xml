<abstract>
<p>Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study, this study revisited rural-nonrural disparities in educational attainment by considering a comprehensive set of factors that constrain and support youth’s college enrollment and degree completion. Results showed that rural students were more advantaged in community social resources compared to nonrural students, and these resources were associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of bachelor’s degree attainment. Yet results confirmed that rural students lagged behind nonrural students in attaining a bachelor’s degree largely due to their lower socioeconomic background. The findings present a more comprehensive picture of the complexity of geographic residence in shaping college enrollment and degree attainment.</p>

<p>Increasing college readiness, attendance, and graduation is a national priority. In 2009, President Barack Obama announced the American Graduation Initiative to increase the number of college graduates by 5 million over the next decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831211416344">Brandon, 2009</xref>). Out of 36 developed nations, the United States currently ranks 12th in the proportion (41%) of young adults (ages 25–35) who have completed a 2- or 4-year college degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211416344">Lee &amp; Rawls, 2010</xref>). College attendance and completion, meanwhile, vary significantly across gender, socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial groups in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211416344">Deil-Amen &amp; Turley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab, Carter, &amp; Wagner, 2007</xref>). However, less attention is focused on differences in educational attainment related to rurality. Given that approximately 20% of America’s youth live in rural areas, their postsecondary participation and degree completion warrants examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831211416344">Alliance for Excellent Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research on rural-nonrural differences in educational attainment focuses mainly on either high school completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211416344">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211416344">Roscigno, Tomaskovic-Devey, &amp; Crowley, 2006</xref>) or college enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211416344">Hu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith, Beaulieu, &amp; Seraphine, 1995</xref>). The few studies that have examined college completion indicate that rural youth lag behind nonrural youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211416344">Gibbs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211416344">Provansik et al., 2007</xref>). For example, data on 25- to 35-year-olds from the American Community Survey of 2004 indicated that 21% of the rural sample had received a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with 34% for each of the city and suburban samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211416344">Provansik et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, to better address rural-nonrural inequalities in the attainment of a postsecondary degree, it is necessary to examine college degree attainment and noncompletion as well as college enrollment.</p>
<p>In addition, most prior comparative research follows a rural disadvantage perspective, which highlights the lower socioeconomic status (SES), lower parental expectations, and poorer high school preparation in rural than in nonrural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211416344">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211416344">Roscigno et al., 2006</xref>). Although substantial data support this rural disadvantage perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211416344">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211416344">Roscigno et al., 2006</xref>), contradictory evidence is also apparent. With respect to academic achievement, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831211416344">Fan and Chen (1999)</xref> found that students who attended rural schools generally performed as well as their nonrural counterparts on a variety of achievement measures. The authors concluded that all things being equal, rural youth “do not suffer disadvantage simply as the result of their residence in rural areas or their attendance at rural schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831211416344">Fan &amp; Chen, 1999</xref>, p. 31).</p>
<p>Consistent with this view, several researchers have drawn attention to features of rural families, schools, and communities that promote positive youth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211416344">Crockett, Shanahan, &amp; Jackson-Newsom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211416344">C. W. Howley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211416344">Demi, Coleman-Jensen, &amp; Synder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211416344">Elder &amp; Conger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211416344">Hardré, Sullivan, &amp; Crowson, 2009</xref>). Specifically, rural communities often are characterized as high in social resources or capital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831211416344">1</xref></sup> due to their small size and strong connections among families, schools, and religious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211416344">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211416344">Crockett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211416344">Elder &amp; Conger, 2000</xref>). Yet few large-scale studies of educational attainment have examined these features of rural communities.</p>
<p>In this study, we build on and extend previous research that examined rural-nonrural disparities in educational attainment by addressing limitations of prior research. Specifically, we investigate rural-nonrural disparities in college enrollment and degree attainment using longitudinal data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988 that followed high school seniors (1992) through their postsecondary years (2000). Furthermore, we examine a more comprehensive set of factors shaping rural-nonrural disparities in college enrollment and degree attainment. Finally, we examine how predictors of college enrollment and degree attainment vary by rurality.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002831211416344">
<title>Background and Prior Research</title>
<sec id="section2-0002831211416344">
<title>Definitions of Rurality</title>
<p>There are numerous definitions of rurality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831211416344">Arnold, Biscoe, Farmer, Robertson, &amp; Shapley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211416344">Rural Policy Research Institute, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831211416344">Strong, Del Gross, Burwick, Jethwani, &amp; Ponza, 2005</xref>). In the present study, rurality (or urbanicity) is defined according to definitions used in NELS, which includes three categories of schools (rural, suburban, and urban). Rural schools are located outside of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); urban schools are in the central cities of MSAs; and suburban schools are within an area surrounding a central city within a county constituting the MSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831211416344">Lippman, Burns, &amp; McArthur, 1996</xref>). Here, an MSA refers to an urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000 and “comprises the central county or counties containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county as measured through commuting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831211416344">U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 2010</xref>, p. 37252). We acknowledge that considering rural students (or schools) as a homogenous group may be problematic because there is great variability in occupational structure, median income, ethnic composition, population density, geographical isolation, and school quality across rural communities in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211416344">Johnson &amp; Strange, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211416344">Provasnik et al., 2007</xref>). This problem is likely true for the categories of urban and suburban students. Unfortunately, the NELS data set itself does not provide alternative measures of rurality other than the aforementioned locale categories. Thus, generalizations from our results should be appropriately qualified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, given the focus of this study on the role of rurality in explaining differences in postsecondary educational attainment, we use the term <italic>nonrural</italic> to refer to suburban and urban locales. This term has been used in prior comparative studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831211416344">Haller &amp; Virkler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211416344">Lee &amp; McIntire, 2000</xref>). Other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211416344">Gibbs, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831211416344">2003</xref>) have used nonmetro versus metro to capture this distinction. Where appropriate, we highlight differences between youth attending urban and suburban schools and include all three geographical locations in the analyses that follow.</p>

<sec id="section3-0002831211416344">
<title>Characteristics of Rural Communities</title>
<p>Despite variation across rural communities, rural youth tend to face serious challenges that may limit their postsecondary educational attainment. Generally speaking, poverty rates are higher for youth in rural than nonrural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211416344">Lichter &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831211416344">O’Hare &amp; Savage, 2006</xref>). In addition, parents in rural areas have lower postsecondary educational attainment and educational expectations for their children than parents in nonrural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211416344">Provasnik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211416344">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211416344">Roscigno et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, rural youth are more likely than nonrural youth to experience a narrow school curriculum and limited access to career counseling and college preparatory programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831211416344">Graham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831211416344">Griffin, Hutchins, &amp; Meece, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211416344">Lapan, Tucker, Kim, &amp; Koscuilek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211416344">Monk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211416344">Provasnik et al., 2007</xref>). A substantial body of evidence suggests that these precollege factors (i.e., family income, parents’ education and educational expectations, and academic preparation) predict youth’s college enrollment, persistence, and completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211416344">Adelman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211416344">Adelman, Daniel, Berkovits, &amp; Owings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831211416344">Attewell, Heil, &amp; Reisel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831211416344">Bozick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab &amp; Pfeffer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Less is known about the role of these precollege factors in rural youth’s college enrollment and degree attainment. Prior research from a rural disadvantage perspective also overlooks features of rural communities that may be conducive to youth’s educational attainment. As noted, rural communities are often small and have strong ties among residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211416344">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211416344">Crockett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211416344">C. W. Howley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211416344">Elder &amp; Conger, 2000</xref>). A supportive community may offer additional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211416344">Crockett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211416344">C. W. Howley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211416344">Elder &amp; Conger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211416344">Hardré et al., 2009</xref>), often conceptualized as <italic>community social capital</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211416344">Israel &amp; Beaulieu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211416344">Israel, Beaulieu, &amp; Hatless, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211416344">Sun, 1999</xref>). These community resources may potentially offset family economic hardship and school resource constraints. Indeed, several prior studies have shown that social connections between families and to religious organizations are positively related to youth’s educational achievement beyond family background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211416344">Israel &amp; Beaulieu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211416344">Israel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211416344">Sun, 1999</xref>). Therefore, a more comprehensive set of features among families, schools, and communities must be considered.</p>

<title>Prior Research on Rural-Nonrural Differences in Postsecondary Educational Attainment</title>
<p>Limited research has used longitudinal data to test rural-nonrural disparities in postsecondary educational attainment or to identify factors responsible for this gap. Although dated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al. (1995)</xref> used data from the High School and Beyond Study that followed the 1980 sophomore class into the postsecondary years. Results showed that 45% of rural students were enrolled in college as of 1984, compared to 67% of suburban students. Furthermore, Smith and colleagues found that student demographic characteristics, family background and social capital, and community social capital explained some, but not all, of the rural-nonrural differences in college enrollment. Smith et al. also found variation in the predictors of college attendance across different types of communities. Specifically, family income and number of siblings were not predictive of college enrollment among students from rural communities, whereas both were predictive among students from urban and suburban communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, student church attendance<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831211416344">2</xref></sup> predicted college attendance across different types of communities, but the relation was stronger among rural students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211416344">Gibbs (1998)</xref> also reported a significant gap in college enrollment (including 2- and 4-year programs) between rural and urban respondents. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al. (1995)</xref>, Gibbs reported that individual and family factors, including family income and school grades, explained a small amount of the rural-nonrural variation in college attendance. Yet, Gibbs did not examine the differential impact of individual and family factors on college attendance by geographic location. Additionally, the study focused only on college enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0002831211416344">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Although informative, prior studies are limited. First, research has focused more on college enrollment than on college completion. Second, a limited set of precollege factors were examined. Also, the empirical models tested failed to fully account for rural-nonrural disparities in college attendance and completion. Finally, prior research suggested some factors, such as student church attendance, may have a stronger influence for rural than urban youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>). However, few studies have examined potential variation in predictors of college enrollment and degree attainment by rurality.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the current research was guided by three specific aims. Using postsecondary follow-up data from NELS, the first aim was to examine differences in college enrollment and degree attainment (including an associate’s degree, a bachelor’s degree, and no degree attainment) for rural, suburban, and urban youth completing high school in 1992. The NELS is the most recent source of information on the educational attainment of U.S. students 8 years beyond high school graduation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002831211416344">3</xref></sup> The second aim was to identify precollege factors that might explain rural-nonrural differences in college enrollment and degree attainment. In addressing this research aim, we included (a) socioeconomic background, (b) family composition and social resources, (c) community social resources, and (d) academic preparation in high school, in addition to demographic and regional controls. The third aim was to examine variation in relations by rurality.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0002831211416344">
<title>Data</title>
<p>To investigate rural-nonrural disparities in postsecondary educational attainment, we used data from NELS administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). In 1988, the NCES drew random samples of approximately 25 eighth graders in each of about 1,000 randomly selected middle schools. NELS followed the students through high school in 1990 and 1992 (10th and 12th grades, respectively), and beyond in 1994 and 2000 (2 and 8 years after high school graduation, respectively). Due to attrition and nonresponse bias, the sample was freshened with additional respondents in 10th and 12th grades, to maintain a representative data set at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831211416344">Curtin, Ingels, Wu, &amp; Heuer, 2002</xref>). The NELS panel of 1988-2000 consisted of approximately 12,100 students.</p>
<p>We analyzed data from the restricted-use version of NELS, which includes high school and postsecondary transcript data, to obtain more accurate information about academic preparation in high school and college degree attainment. Our analytic sample included only students who were in the 12th grade in 1992 and had valid information about their high school completion and postsecondary educational attainment. We used a longitudinal weight (F4F2HWT), which scales the 2000 sample to the 1992 population of high school seniors and accounts for the sampling scheme and nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831211416344">Curtin et al., 2002</xref>). Due to small sample sizes, we excluded American Indian/Alaska Native and multiracial students. This yielded an unweighted <italic>N</italic> of 9,540 students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002831211416344">4</xref></sup> In the analytic sample, approximately 32% attended rural high schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211416344">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>We selected two outcome measures from the transcript data: college enrollment and degree attainment. College enrollment was measured by whether the respondent had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 2000. College degree attainment was measured by the highest degree attained by 2000: (a) no college enrollment, (b) certificate/associate’s degree, (c) bachelor’s degree, and (d) no college degree attainment (or noncompletion). No college degree attainment refers to students who enrolled in college at any time after high school graduation but had not earned a college degree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002831211416344">5</xref></sup> In our analytic sample, 20% were not enrolled in college, 10% earned a certificate/associate’s degree, 38% earned a bachelor’s degree or above, and 32% were enrolled in college but had not earned a degree by 2000 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211416344">Table 1</xref>). There was variation in college enrollment and degree completion; the proportion of students who had not enrolled in college was highest among rural (26%) students, followed by suburban (18%) and urban (16%) students. Additionally, the proportion of students earning a bachelor’s degree (or higher) was lowest among rural (30%) students, followed by suburban (40%) and urban (43%) students.</p>

A detailed description of these independent variables is in Appendix A in the online version of the journal. To briefly describe, for socioeconomic background, we included two measures: parental educational level and family income. For family composition and social resources, we included (a) family structure, (b) number of siblings, (c) parental expectations for child’s education, and (d) the frequency parents reported discussing academic issues with child. For community social resources, we included (a) the frequency parents reported communicating with parents of child’s friends, (b) the degree parents reported knowing parents of child’s friends, and (c) the frequency students reported participating in religious services. For academic preparation in high school, we used (a) high school GPA, (b) scores on the standardized test administered by NELS, and (c) curriculum intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002831211416344">6</xref></sup> All independent variables were included in the second follow-up (Grade 12, 1992) data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0002831211416344">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>Prior literature suggests that demographic and regional background is a source of differences in college enrollment and degree attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211416344">Deil-Amen &amp; Turley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831211416344">Turley, 2009</xref>). Thus, although our focus is not on the role of demographic and regional background, we included (a) gender, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) region as controls. These variables also were included in the second follow-up, when students were in 12th grade.</p>

<sec id="section12-0002831211416344">
<title>Analytic Strategies</title>
<p>We used four major analytic strategies to investigate the potential role of family background, community social resources, and academic preparation in explaining rural-nonrural differences in postsecondary educational attainment. First, to examine unadjusted rural-nonrural differences in family background, community social resources, and academic preparation, we conducted univariate linear, logistic, and multinomial regression for each of the independent variables, depending on their scales, with a set of dummy variables for rurality (i.e., rural [reference group], suburban, and urban).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002831211416344">7</xref></sup> Second, given the dichotomous measure of college enrollment, we conducted logistic regression to investigate sources of rural-nonrural differences in the likelihood of being enrolled in college (vs. no college enrollment) 8 years after high school graduation (as of 2000) with the total sample. Given the four categories of college degree attainment (i.e., no college enrollment, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, and no college degree attainment), we next performed multinomial logistic regression to examine sources of rural-nonrural differences in the likelihood of earning different types of college degrees with the pooled sample. For the logistic and multinomial logistic regression, we estimated five models. The first model added a set of dummy variables for rurality with the control variables (Model 1). Subsequently, we entered the socioeconomic variables (Model 2), family composition and social resource variables (Model 3), community social resource variables (Model 4), and academic preparation variables (Model 5). The aim was to determine the extent that each set of independent variables explained variation in entering and completing college. We examined log-likelihood statistics<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002831211416344">8</xref></sup> and pseudo (McFadden’s) <italic>R</italic>-squared<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002831211416344">9</xref></sup> to assess overall fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211416344">Agresti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211416344">Long &amp; Freese, 2006</xref>). Finally, we conducted logistic and multinomial logistic regression for the rural, suburban, and urban samples, separately. The aim was to examine variation in the relations between the independent variables and postsecondary educational attainment by rurality.</p>

<p>We employed the <italic>ice</italic> option in Stata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831211416344">Royston, 2004</xref>) to impute missing data for the independent variables. The percentage of missing data imputed for each independent variable is reported in Appendix A. There was no missing data for our dependent variables because we restricted the analytic sample to students who had valid postsecondary transcript information. We generated five imputed data sets and then averaged the coefficients and standard errors using the <italic>mim</italic> option in Stata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831211416344">Royston, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Results</title>
<p>Our first analyses examined rural-nonrural differences in family background, community social resources, and academic preparation in high school (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211416344">Table 1</xref>). Results showed disparities in socioeconomic background between rural and nonrural students. With respect to parental education, for example, the percentage of parents having a bachelor’s degree was 20% among rural students, while the corresponding rates were 34% and 36% among suburban and urban students, respectively. In addition, the proportion of parents expecting their child to have a bachelor’s degree or higher was significantly lower among rural (70%) than suburban (80%) and urban (84%) samples. Furthermore, rural students (63%) were less likely than suburban students (68%) to come from two-parent families. Also, parents of rural students (<italic>M</italic> = 2.50) less frequently discussed academic work with their children than did parents of suburban students (<italic>M</italic> = 2.55).</p>
<p>A different picture was apparent for community social resources. Parents of rural students were more likely than parents of suburban and urban students to communicate with (<italic>M</italic> = 1.88 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 1.71 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 1.70) and know (<italic>M</italic> = 2.40 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 2.20 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 2.16) the parents of their child’s friends. In addition, rural students (<italic>M</italic> = 3.43) more frequently participated in religious services than suburban students (<italic>M</italic> = 3.09). In terms of academic preparation in high school, rural students (<italic>M</italic> = 49.56) had lower standardized test scores than their suburban counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 55.02). In addition, rural (<italic>M</italic> = 2.77) students were significantly less likely than suburban (<italic>M</italic> = 3.09) and urban (<italic>M</italic> = 3.27) students to take rigorous courses. In sum, there were significant rural-nonrural differences in background characteristics and academic preparation that largely favored suburban and urban students, but community social resources were generally higher among rural students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002831211416344">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rural-Nonrural Differences in College Enrollment: Logistic Regression</title>
<p>The second set of analyses investigated rural-nonrural differences in college enrollment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211416344">Table 2</xref> presents the odds ratios (OR) from the logistic regression predicting the likelihood of entering college. An odds ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable is associated with an increased likelihood of college enrollment, while a value less than 1.0 indicates a decreased likelihood. While accounting for the control variables (not shown), Model 1 demonstrated a significant difference in college enrollment between rural and urban students (OR = 1.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Urban students were approximately 74% (= [1.74 – 1.00 × 100%]) more likely than rural students to be enrolled in college. No significant differences between rural and suburban students were evident.</p>

<p>The inclusion of socioeconomic background in Model 2 explained an additional 15% of variance in college enrollment. After socioeconomic background was added, the significant rural-urban difference in college enrollment was no longer evident. The inclusion of the family composition and social resource variables in Model 3 explained an additional 11% of the variance in college enrollment. Both family composition and social resources predicted college enrollment. In Model 4, the community social resource variables were added. These variables explained a modest amount of additional variance (0.4%), with only student church attendance significantly predicting the likelihood of college enrollment (OR = 1.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The introduction of the academic preparation variables in Model 5 increased by approximately 10% the amount of explained variance in the likelihood of entering college. The academic preparation variables were significantly related to the likelihood of college enrollment. Across Models 3, 4, and 5, the variables that were previously entered typically remained significant, but their predictive value decreased. The one exception to this pattern was student church attendance, which was no longer a significant predictor of college enrollment when the academic preparation variables were added. In sum, the observed rural-nonrural difference in college enrollment was largely attributable to rural-nonrural differences in socioeconomic and demographic background.</p>

<p>Model 3 added the family composition and social resource variables. These factors explained approximately 8% of additional variance. All of the family composition and social resource variables significantly predicted the likelihood of college degree attainment, particularly for bachelor’s degree attainment. Model 4 introduced community social resource, and these variables explained a modest amount of additional variance (0.5%). The following community social resource variables significantly predicted bachelor’s degree completion: parents’ reports of communication with the parents of their child’s friends and student’s reports of church attendance. Adding the academic preparation variables in Model 5 explained an additional 10% of variation in college degree attainment. All of the academic preparation variables significantly predicted college degree attainment. Across Models 3, 4, and 5, the variables previously entered again remained significant, but their predictive value decreased. In contrast to college enrollment, the community social resource variables that were predictive in Model 4 continued to modestly predict bachelor’s degree attainment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), even after the academic preparation variables were added. In sum, like college enrollment, the observed significant rural-nonrural difference in college degree attainment disappeared when socioeconomic background was controlled.</p>

<title>Variation in the Role of Precollege Characteristics in Postsecondary Educational Attainment by Rurality</title>
<p>The final set of analyses assessed variation in the role of precollege factors in predicting college enrollment and degree attainment. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831211416344">Table 4</xref> showed variation in the role of precollege factors in college enrollment by rurality. Specifically, family income was found to predict college enrollment only for urban students. By contrast, family structure predicted college enrollment only for rural students, whereas the number of siblings predicted only for suburban students. In addition, student church attendance was significantly related to college enrollment only for rural students. Curriculum intensity positively predicted college enrollment for all students, but its relation was stronger among suburban than rural students (<italic>t</italic> = 1.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>

<p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831211416344">Table 5</xref> also indicated variation in the role of precollege factors in college degree attainment by rurality. Specifically, family income predicted bachelor’s degree attainment for rural and urban students but did not predict for suburban students. A two-parent family structure positively predicted associate’s degree attainment among rural students but not among suburban and urban students. The degree that parents reported knowing the parents of their child’s friends was positively related to bachelor’s degree attainment only among rural students, and this relation was stronger among rural than suburban students (<italic>t</italic> = 2.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In addition, the student self-reported church attendance predicted bachelor’s degree attainment only for rural students. Yet curriculum intensity had a positive relation with associate’s degree attainment for suburban and urban students but not for rural students. In sum, the extent to which precollege factors predicted college enrollment and degree attainment varied by rurality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study contributes to previous research on rural-nonrural disparities in educational attainment in several important ways. First, research that has used large-scale, longitudinal data to examine the existence of the rural-nonrural gap in postsecondary educational attainment is limited. Most prior research has focused mainly on college enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211416344">Hu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>), without examining the disparities in the college completion of students from different geographic locations. As a result, less is known about rural-nonrural disparities in college degree completion beyond college enrollment. Using longitudinal data from NELS, we addressed these limitations by investigating rural-nonrural differences in college enrollment as well as degree completion. Additionally, most prior research on rural-nonrural disparities in educational attainment has relied on the rural disadvantage perspective, arguing that rural parents and schools invest fewer resources in their children’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211416344">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211416344">Roscigno et al., 2006</xref>). This approach, however, has ignored other features of rural families, schools, and communities that may collectively facilitate educational attainment. In this study, we addressed this lack of attention by considering the added value of community social resources.</p>
<p>On one hand, the results showed that rural students had a higher level of community social resources compared to nonrural students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211416344">Table 2</xref> and Appendix B in online version of journal). In turn, rural students benefited from these community social resources, as indicated by a small but significant increase in the likelihood of college degree attainment, especially bachelor’s degree completion, even after controlling for individual family background, demographic background, and academic preparation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831211416344">Table 5</xref>). While offering evidence against the rural disadvantage argument, the rural advantage in community social resources may reflect the strong kinship bonds and the close social ties among families and religious institutions in rural communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211416344">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211416344">Crockett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211416344">Elder &amp; Conger, 2000</xref>). The finding of the higher level of community social resources in rural than in nonrural settings are consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211416344">Israel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211416344">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211416344">Sun et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the results confirmed that rural students lagged behind suburban and urban counterparts in college enrollment and degree attainment largely because of their lower socioeconomic background (Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211416344">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831211416344">3</xref>). When compared to urban and rural samples, rural youth may face more serious socioeconomic challenges in attending college and earning a degree. Furthermore, the results showed that rural parents, when compared with nonrural parents, had lower levels of educational expectations for, and involvement in, their children’s education. Parental educational expectations and academic discussions were positive predictors of college enrollment and degree attainment, even after academic preparation was included in the models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831211416344">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831211416344">5</xref>). While supporting the rural disadvantage perspective, this finding related to the significant role of family social resources highlights additional challenges facing rural youth with respect to postsecondary educational attainment. In that regard, the importance of the modest but significant positive relation of role community social resources to postsecondary educational attainment should not be underestimated. School and community resources may play an especially important role in future educational and occupational attainment when youth experience economic hardship and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831211416344">Flora &amp; Flora, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831211416344">Irvin, Meece, Byun, Farmer, &amp; Hutchins, in press</xref>). In sum, our findings provide a more comprehensive picture of the complexity of the role of rurality in shaping postsecondary educational attainment.</p>
<sec id="section21-0002831211416344">
<title>Limitations of the Study and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>The present study has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. First, our study investigated a limited number of variables to help explain rural-nonrural differences in postsecondary educational attainment. A review of literature suggests that other school and community characteristics may shape rural-nonrural differences in postsecondary educational attainment. For example, prior research found that local job availability was significantly related to college attendance beyond the individual and family factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211416344">Gibbs, 1998</xref>). Prior research also has suggested that college proximity is positively linked to college enrollment of youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831211416344">Turley, 2009</xref>). Therefore, future studies investigating the role of the socioeconomic and geographic context can further our understanding of the rural-nonrural disparities in postsecondary educational attainment.</p>
<p>Second, this study focused primarily on college enrollment and degree completion. Accordingly, we did not fully examine the specific pathways by which students achieve their postsecondary education goals and how these pathways might differ by rurality. While documenting the increasing complexity of college enrollment patterns, recent research suggests that pathways differ by students’ socioeconomic and demographic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211416344">Goldrick-Rab &amp; Pfeffer, 2009</xref>). Rural students may differ from nonrural students in terms of pathways they take for postsecondary education, but little is known about rural-nonrural differences in pathways to college degree attainment. Future studies investigating possible rural-nonrural differences in students’ college pathways and experiences may increase our understanding of the complex college degree attainment by rurality.</p>
<p>Third, this study examined postsecondary educational attainment of U.S. high school seniors in 1994 from the NELS data. Over the past decade, the rate of rural high school graduates enrolling in college has dramatically increased. For example, in 2003, approximately 35% of rural high school graduates attended a 4-year college, while approximately 42% did so in 2007, showing a nearly 7% increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831211416344">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2010</xref>). During the same period (between 2003 and 2007), 4-year college attendance rates of high school graduates increased by approximately 4% in urban areas and by approximately 1% in suburban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831211416344">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2010</xref>). Therefore, by using data that follow a more recent cohort of high school students (e.g., Educational Longitudinal Study), future studies should shed light on recent trends in rural-nonrural disparities in postsecondary educational attainment.</p>
<p>Last, as noted earlier, our measure of rurality was based on the NCES’s trichotomy—rural, suburban, urban—but this measure may not fully capture variability among families, schools, and communities within each geographic location. This data limitation has always been the case for research relying on the national database created by the NCES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831211416344">Coladarci, 2007</xref>). Several rural researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831211416344">Brown &amp; Schafft, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211416344">C. B. Howley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211416344">Theobald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831211416344">Truscott &amp; Truscott, 2005</xref>) have called for alternative views on the definition of rurality. The traditional classification schemes of schools based on their geographic position (especially rural vs. urban dichotomy) only minimally address the critical educational challenges of postsecondary educational attainment for rural and urban youth. Future efforts are needed to develop alternative measures of rurality and collect representative data that can better address diversity in rural and nonrural settings.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that students whose college degree attainment was incomplete within the data collection timeframe (i.e., 8 years after high school graduation) may eventually earn a college degree, although it may take them a number of years to do so. Given that these students are then likely to be counted as college completers, our estimates of the level of postsecondary educational attainment may be subject to change, depending on the time span of any longitudinal study carried out in the future. A future longitudinal study with a longer time span is needed to better understand the complex patterns of college persistence and completion by rurality.</p>
