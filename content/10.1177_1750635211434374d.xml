<p>Regardless of one’s opinions about the term ‘Arab Spring’, it has certainly reinvigorated discussions concerning online activism. Miriyam Aouragh’s research on Palestine is therefore very timely, and offers an anthropological exploration of the internet’s impact on Palestinian identity and mobility. She argues that the internet has provided a limited yet important tool for overcoming the immobility that is very much a part of the Palestinian condition. Furthermore, Aouragh stresses how the ‘internet influences the process of nation-state formation and shapes collective identity’, both through the communicative process itself, and the actual content of the communications that take place (p. 230). Through the internet, Palestinians in both the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and the diaspora are able to reunite, overcoming the geographical and political barriers imposed upon them by their forced displacement.</p>
<p>Miriyam Aouragh is not an armchair critic, and her research in the region was punctuated by activism, itself galvanised by the post 9/11 milieu, which included the 2002 Intifada. Her political stance does not, however, detrimentally impact the work itself, which is both in-depth and thorough. The fieldwork was undertaken over a period of 4 years across 13 different sites in Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan. Crucially, Aouragh’s visits to Palestine included trips to both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank – worthy of mention due to the notable difference in conditions faced by residents of the OPT. The quality of Aouragh’s research is not only evident in its scope, but also in the extensiveness of her ethnography, which explores how offline factors influence the online. Indeed, one of the book’s key strengths is chapter 6, which looks at how Palestinians inside and outside the OPT use internet cafes and how these cafes capture the ‘interconnections between virtual and everyday life’ (p. 226).</p>
<p>In addition to providing reflexive insight to the research project itself, chapter 1 underpins the book by defining the historical context that has formed the Palestinian diaspora. This historical context is important for Aouragh’s theoretical framework, which rightly argues that the ‘Middle East demands its own framework for understanding the implications of the internet’ (p. 28). This is especially true of Palestine, which lacks the territorial autonomy enjoyed by many western nations on whose systems the works of important scholars like Habermas are based. Thus Aouragh’s research acknowledges the need to de-essentialise the internet and see instead how it is employed by local communities in specific geographical and temporal contexts.</p>
<p>Aouragh’s examination of the online/offline nexus is developed in chapter 2, which discusses the importance of the materiality of the internet and how this is particularly pertinent in the context of occupation. Her thorough narrative of the evolution of Internet Communication Technologies in Palestine illustrates the contradiction that revolves around the dichotomy of empowerment and control, a dyad that frames much of the Palestinian experience with the internet. Aouragh touches on this theme throughout the book, and states how the virtual mobility afforded by the internet to Palestinians in the OPT is often dependent on Israeli ‘benevolence’. Indeed, this benevolence comes at a price, and Israelis can of course use the internet to monitor Palestinians – a point Aouragh mentions but doesn’t explore in great depth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Aouragh argues that not only does the internet provide an opportunity to partially overcome the physical barriers placed by Israel, but also informational boundaries. By facilitating communication between those in the diaspora and the OPT, the internet enables Palestinians to exchange information, texts and images related to Palestinian culture, history and identity. Aouragh mentions how the most popular images downloaded were of the pre-1948 period, ‘those of the 1948 and 1967 exoduses, and then pictures of the new Intifada’ (p. 130). This, she argues, illustrates the capacity of the internet to reconnect Palestinians with their history while also contributing to the narrative of Palestinian national identity formed within a context of forced mobility, violence and occupation. In support of her assertion that the nation-state is still relevant, Aouragh emphasises that virtual mobility serves to augment rather than replace the Palestinians’ desire for a physical/territorial place.</p>
<p>In the final, and perhaps most interesting chapter, Aouragh sets out findings from her ethnographic study of internet cafes in Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan. The insights are fascinating, and highlight not only the significance of internet cafes for the Palestinian disapora, but also the issues of access based on factors such as location, class, gender and Islam. In a particularly interesting example, Aouragh discusses the actions of a local sheikh in Lebanon, who suggested that internet cafes should behave in accordance with Islamic values in order that women too could use them without stigmatisation. It is through numerous examples like this that Aouragh highlights the relevance of the offline/online juxtaposition. Such invaluable empirical insights illustrate how both Palestine and Palestinian culture are reproduced online, an effect that serves to highlight the relevance of social constructivism and thus emphasise the need for further, region-specific case studies.</p>
<p>While Aouragh’s book is an important addition to literature on transnationalism in general, it also examines the vital role the internet plays during times of conflict and crisis. This is especially pertinent to Palestine, where conflict and anti-colonial resistance are themselves part of the national identity, and are consequently reproduced in Palestine’s online presence. As Aouragh argues, the internet is a global and local stage that allows Palestinians to narrate their own unmediated history while asserting themselves in a global context, rehumanising their cause in the face of pro-Zionist media opposition. It is precisely this analysis of the internet as a technology that allows for horizontal communication that makes Aouragh’s book so pertinent in the context of the Arab Spring. Having said that, <italic>Palestine Online</italic> should not just be read by those interested in communications, but by cultural geographers and Middle East scholars alike.</p>
