<p>Asian sand dust (ASD) is a natural phenomenon originating from the deserts of China and Mongolia. It has caused extensive damage to the social economies of Korea, Japan, and North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439011">1</xref></sup> ASD is composed of many pollutants, especially particulate matter less than 10 µm in diameter (PM10), which represents 53% to 71% of ASD. PM10 can reach the lower respiratory tract, causing respiratory tract disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439011">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439011"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439011">4</xref></sup> Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ASD events are associated with symptom aggravation in asthmatic patients and increased daily mortality in South Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439011">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439011">6</xref></sup> Lei et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439011">7</xref></sup> found increased numbers of white blood cells in the serum and increased inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice exposed to ASD, suggesting that ASD can cause pulmonary inflammation and lung damage.</p>
<p>Although many studies have reported that ASD influences allergic inflammation in mice, few studies have focused on mucus production induced by ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439011">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439011">9</xref></sup> Mucus plays a crucial role in protecting the airways by capturing bacteria and particulate matter and by maintaining the humidity of the airway.

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0194599812439011">
<title>Study Protocol</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gachon Medical School, Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Korea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812439011">
<title>Preparation of Particulates</title>
<p>ASD was collected from air dust at 500 L/min for 6 hours per day using a high-volume sampler (HV500F; Sibata, Soka, Japan) with a PM2.5 filter pack, during ASD warnings issued by the Korean Meteorological Association. The dust-covered filter paper was removed from the air sampler and cut into pieces, which were placed in a 10-mL tube containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The tube contents were mixed using a vortexer, the pieces of wet filter paper were removed, and the remaining solution was passed through a filter with 10-µm pores to collect PM10. The PM10 was weighed, suspended by sonication (5 × 30 seconds at 3-5 W), and distributed into 1.5-mL tubes. The samples were sterilized in an autoclave at 121°C for 15 minutes and stored at –20°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812439011">
<title>Analysis of ASD Components</title>
<p>The concentration of each element in ASD was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Optima 5300 DV; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Elan DRE II; Perkin-Elmer). The concentration of endotoxin was determined using a quantitative chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000; Lonza, Walkersville, Maryland) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812439011">
<title>Cell Culture and Stimulation</title>
<p>NCI-H292 human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia) were plated at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 8-well plates and incubated in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 25 mM HEPES at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 2 to 3 days, the cells reached 90% confluence and were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hours. The serum-free medium was removed, the cells were washed, and 2 mL of RPMI medium containing the prepared PM10 (hereafter referred to as ASD) at a concentration of 0, 10, 100, 250, or 500 µg/mL were added to respective wells. After the cells were incubated for 24 hours, the supernatant was collected. As a positive control, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/mL) was added to the serum-free medium for 1 hour prior to incubation. As a negative control, only serum-free medium was added.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599812439011">
<title>Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Gibco, Grand Island, New York/) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For cDNA synthesis, total RNA (2 µg), Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Maryland), 5× reverse transcription buffer, 10 mM dNTPs, RNase inhibitor, and random hexamer primer in a final volume of 20 µL were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. PCR amplification was performed in a 50-µL reaction volume containing cDNA, 10× PCR reaction buffer, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM dNTPs, and a <italic>MUC5AC</italic> primer set (forward, 5′-TCCGGCCTCATCTTCTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTTGGGCACTGGTGCTG-3′) or a <italic>GAPDH</italic> primer set (forward, 5′-GTGGATATTGTTGCCATCAATGACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCCCAGCCTTCATGGTGGT-3′). The PCR conditions were denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 minutes, 55°C for 30 minutes, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products (10 µL) were analyzed on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0194599812439011">
<title>MTT Assay</title>
<p>Cell viability was assessed by the MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. NCI-H292 cells were cultured with various concentrations of the prepared ASD and washed with PBS. Then, 100 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were added to each well, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. The MTT solution was removed, 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. The absorbance at 492 nm was measured with a spectrometer. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812439011">
<title>Allergic Murine Model</title>
<p>Forty female BALB/c mice (6 weeks of age) were purchased (Central Lab, Animal Inc, Seoul, Korea), and all mice were checked for infections. This study adhered to the Gachon University Animal Research guidelines. The mice were divided equally among 4 groups: saline, ASD, ovalbumin (OVA), and ASD+OVA groups (n = 10 in each group). The mice in the saline group were exposed to 1 mL of normal saline via a nebulizer (Omron, Tokyo, Japan) for 15 minutes each day for 7 days. The mice in the ASD group were exposed to 10 mg of ASD in 1 mL of normal saline via a nebulizer for 15 minutes each day for 7 days.</p>
<p>The other 2 groups were used to develop the allergic murine model. To induce systemic sensitization, the abdominal cavity of each mouse was injected with 300 µL of normal saline containing 25 µg of OVA (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) and 1 mg of Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> gel (Alum; Pierce Chemical Co, Rockford, Illinois) on days 1, 7, and 14. The systemically sensitized mice were locally exposed to 5 mL of 2% OVA for 30 min 4 times per day, starting on day 21. Local sensitization was performed in an acrylic box (40 × 40 × 30) connected to the nebulizer through a hole in its side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812439011"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>ASD Stimulation in an Allergic Murine Model</title>
<p>The sensitized mice were divided into the OVA (n = 10) and OVA+ASD (n = 10) groups. The OVA group of sensitized mice were exposed to 5 mL of 2% OVA for 30 minutes once every other day to sustain the sensitized state. The mice in the OVA+ASD group were exposed to 5 mL of 2% OVA plus 1 mL of normal saline containing 10 mg of ASD for 30 minutes per day for 1 or 2 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812439011">
<title>Extraction of Nasal Specimen</title>
<p>On the day of sacrifice, the head of each mouse was harvested and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours. The specimens were decalcified in a decalcifying reagent (Decalcified II; Surgipath Medical Industries Inc, Richmond, Illinois) for 5 days and sectioned from behind the upper incisor to 2 mm in front of the incisive papilla of the hard palate. The sections were embedded in paraffin, and the paraffin block was cut at intervals of 4 µm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812439011">
<title>Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining</title>
<p>To determine the degree of inflammation, nasal mucosal specimens were stained with hematoxylin for 45 seconds, washed, and then stained with eosin for 20 seconds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812439011">
<title>Periodic Acid Schiff staining</title>
<p>To evaluate the production of mucus glycoproteins, NCI-H292 cells or nasal mucosal specimens were incubated with periodic acid for 5 minutes at 4°C, washed with distilled water, and incubated with Schiff’s reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes, followed by staining with hematoxylin for 3 minutes. The average number of Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)–positive NCI-H292 cells was determined after counting 10 different fields under a microscope at 200× magnification. The ratio of PAS-positive cells to total epithelial cells in the nasal mucosal epithelial layer was determined under a microscope at 100× magnification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812439011">
<title>Immunohistochemical Staining</title>
<p>NCI-H292 cells or nasal specimens were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against human MUC5AC (Neomarker Co, Fremont, California) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:200 for 90 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, respectively, followed by incubation with goat antimouse immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase and 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The primary antibody was omitted for the controls. The average number of immunopositive cells among total NCI-H292 cells was calculated after counting 10 different fields under a microscope at 200× magnification. The ratio of immunopositive cells to total epithelial cells in the nasal mucosal epithelial layer was determined under a microscope at 100× magnification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0194599812439011">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The differences between 2 samples of NCI-H292 cells were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Pathological results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 10.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Values of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 indicated significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that <italic>MUC5AC</italic> expression and PAS staining were increased in NCI-H292 cells and in nasal epithelial cells after exposure to ASD. As the concentration of ASD particulate matter increased, the expression of <italic>MUC5AC</italic> mRNA increased in NCI-H292 cells, suggesting that the concentration of particulate matter may be directly related to increased mucus secretion. The decrease in cell viability observed at 500 µg/mL ASD indicates that cell cytotoxicity developed at this ASD level.</p>
<p>Many stimuli and mechanisms, including bacterial and viral infections, allergic asthma, nasal polyps, cigarette smoke, mechanical stimulation, and inhalation materials, induce mucus hypersecretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439011">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439011">16</xref></sup> However, the mechanism of ASD-induced mucus secretion is not known. ASD consists of particles that range in size from 0.1 to 20 µm, which includes fine particles of less than 2.5 µm and ultrafine particles of less than 0.1 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439011">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812439011">17</xref></sup> Titanium dioxide, a representative ultrafine particle, has been shown to cause many diseases after it is phagocytosed by macrophages. This finding suggests that ASD not only worsens disease states but also causes changes, adaptations, and developments in respiratory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812439011">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Donaldson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812439011">18</xref></sup> reported that ASD consists of crustal elements and ionic components such as Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>. ASD may play a role in activating mucus secretion because it contains toxins such as lipopolysaccharide and heavy metals. However, Park et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812439011">19</xref></sup> proposed that the concentrations of toxins and microbes in ASD are not sufficient to cause disease. Diesel exhaust particulate, 90% of which is ultrafine particles, induces respiratory symptoms such as sputum and cough, and allergic responses are increased in allergic patients with elevated IgE levels after prolonged exposure to diesel exhaust particulate. Although it appears that ASD PM10 may be related to mucus secretion through inflammatory responses in NCI-H292 cells, additional studies are warranted.</p>
<p>The significantly higher number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa of OVA+ASD mice at 1 and 2 weeks postexposure to ASD in the present study suggests that ASD activated allergic inflammation in the nasal epithelium. Previous studies have proposed that ASD enhances the infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes into the airway and increases goblet cell proliferation in the bronchial epithelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439011">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439011">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812439011">20</xref></sup> ASD and SiO<sub>2</sub> act synergistically to increase the levels of eosinophil-relevant cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-5 and monocyte chemotactic protein 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812439011">21</xref></sup> This result indicates that allergic inflammation due to ASD may be attributable to its component mineral elements, mainly SiO<sub>2</sub>. In the present study, the number of cells positive for MUC5AC and TGF-α was significantly increased in the OVA+ASD mice, implying that ASD-stimulated MUC5AC secretion is associated with increased TGF-α. TGF-α is a ligand of epidermal growth factor receptor, which increases MUC5AC production and induces mucosal secretion through goblet cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812439011">22</xref></sup> MUC5AC is rarely expressed in healthy epithelium, but it is highly expressed in asthma and polyposis. Based on these results, it is conceivable that MUC5AC is involved in mucus production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812439011">23</xref></sup> In the present study, as the duration of exposure time to ASD increased, the production of MUC5AC and TGF-α also increased. It is presumed that allergic reactions may be increased with prolonged exposure to allergy-triggering factors such as ASD.</p>
<p>The Korean Meteorological Administration has established an Asian Dust Warning System, and advisories are issued when the hourly averaged dust (PM10) concentration is expected to exceed 400 µm/m<sup>2</sup> for longer than 2 hours. In our experiments, the total amount of sand dust inhaled by mice exposed to 10 mg/mL ASD was very similar to the total amount inhaled by humans in an atmosphere with 400 µm/m<sup>2</sup> ASD for 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439011">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812439011">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of the present study show that ASD can induce mucus production in NCI-H292 cells and in nasal epithelial cells. However, this study did not address the mechanism by which PM10 activates inflammatory reactions in these cells or the elements of ASD that cause mucus secretion. Further studies are needed to clarify these issues.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that ASD, a type of air pollutant in East Asia, can induce mucin production in human respiratory epithelial cells (NCI-H292 cells) and can induce mucin production in murine nasal epithelial cells by activating allergic inflammation. These results suggest that ASD can aggravate airway disease by activating inflammatory reactions through increased mucus secretion.</p>
