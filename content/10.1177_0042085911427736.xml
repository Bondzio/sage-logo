<abstract>
<p>This qualitative multisite case study examined how three high schools within one large urban district supported ninth-grade students’ needs through interdisciplinary teaming. Data collected during the 2006-2007 school year included observations, interviews, and archival evidence of 67 participants. Findings suggest teacher communication as a result of teaming may provide the teacher support and individualized student attention necessary to foster a family-like ninth-grade environment that meets student and teacher needs. School personnel reported more benefits of teaming for teachers and students than students did. Issues with implementation limited how well teaming was able to meet student needs.</p>

<p>As students advance through the K-12 educational system, schooling often becomes increasingly impersonal and developmentally unresponsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2001</xref>). Traditionally organized secondary schools are not developmentally responsive environments for all adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427736">National Association of Secondary School Principals [NASSP], 2006</xref>). Responsive high school environments that support students’ needs are purposefully organized to personalize the learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911427736">Cotton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner, Seitsinger, Brand, Burns, &amp; Bolton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427736">George, McEwin, &amp; Jenkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427736">International Center for Leadership in Education [ICLE], 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427736">Sammon, 2007</xref>).

<title>Adolescents Basic and Developmental Needs</title>
<p>The self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>) and stage-environment fit theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427736">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>) suggest that adolescents have basic and developmental needs that must be met within the school environment to foster healthy development and learning. According to the self-determination theory, humans have basic psychological needs, including the need for relatedness, competence, and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). Relatedness involves developing a sense of security and connection within a larger social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427736">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427736">Urdan &amp; Schoenfelder, 2006</xref>). Competence involves feeling able to successfully interact in one’s social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>). Competence is a part of effective functioning, a noteworthy element in the development of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427736">Urdan &amp; Schoenfelder, 2006</xref>). Autonomy includes the ability to self-regulate and the perception of being in control of one’s actions and achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427736">Urdan &amp; Schoenfelder, 2006</xref>). The fulfillment of such needs helps students attain self-regulation, motivation, and personal well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to basic needs, students have unique developmental needs that ought to be met within the school environment. According to the stage-environment fit theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427736">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>), adolescents may experience a mismatch between their developmental needs and the opportunities provided within their school environment. This developmental mismatch, if unaddressed, has the potential to produce negative academic, personal, and behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427736">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles (2004)</xref>, the organization of the school environment must be modified to fit students’ developmental needs:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Individuals have changing emotional, cognitive, and social needs and personal goals as they mature . . . schools need to change in developmentally appropriate ways if they are to provide the kind of social context that will continue to motivate students’ interest and engagement as the students mature. (pp. 125-126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The need for a school environment to meet students’ developmental needs is especially critical as they make the transition from one school to another. To promote meaningful learning and healthy adolescent development during school transitions, it is essential that the receiving school foster an environment responsive to the needs of incoming students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>). When combined, these interconnected theoretical frameworks guided the examination of how interdisciplinary teaming may create a ninth-grade environment responsive to students’ needs. Healthy adolescent development and meaningful learning occurs best when schools foster an environment that creates opportunities for students’ needs to be met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427736">Urdan &amp; Schoenfelder, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The Need for a Developmentally Responsive School Environment for Ninth-Grade Students</title>
<p>Secondary schools tend to be large and impersonal places. Approximately 70% of American high schools are classified as “large schools” servicing over 1,000 students, with half of these schools educating more than 1,500 students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911427736">Dejong &amp; Locker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911427736">U.S. Department of Education Office of Vocation and Adult Education, 2007</xref>). Such schools are not typically organized with students’ developmental needs in mind. Often, secondary schools are organized in a more traditional nature, including departmentalization, ability grouping, teacher-centered pedagogy, and strict student discipline and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427736">NASSP, 2006</xref>). Such large, traditional, and impersonal schools may result in a mismatch between students’ needs and their school environments that can lead to increased difficulties when students make the transition from one school to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427736">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Many students experience difficulties during the middle-to-high-school transition. Research reports that after the transition, students can experience a decrease in the quality of their school environment, including lower personal functioning; issues with self-esteem and depression; and increases in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and disconnection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911427736">Barber &amp; Olsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters &amp; Kerr, 2001</xref>). Disciplinary problems tend to escalate while attendance, academic performance, and motivation decline after the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427736">Queen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085911427736">Roderick &amp; Camburn, 1996</xref>). The transition to high school is especially hard as students’ friendships are disrupted during the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427736">Queen, 2002</xref>). An unsuccessful transition to high school increases the likelihood that students will drop out as many make the decision whether to remain in or quit school within the first weeks of ninth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911427736">Hertzog &amp; Morgan, 1999</xref>) and 6% of all dropouts leave school by their 10th-grade year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911427736">Mizelle, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Developmentally Responsive Ninth-Grade Environments</title>
<p>Personalizing the ninth-grade school environment may ease the transition into a large high school. Known as a “place and structure for ‘newcomers’ to transition to the school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427736">ICLE, 2004</xref>, p. 25), the freshman academy is a unique type of small learning community (SLC) designed specifically for ninth-grade students. Freshman academies foster a personalized setting by rearranging teachers and students into smaller groups where students receive a specialized program designed to support their interpersonal and academic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911427736">Comprehensive School Reform Quality Center, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427736">Fields, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427736">Sammon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911427736">Southern Regional Education Board, 2002</xref>). Freshman academy structures include interdisciplinary teams with common planning, proximity of team classrooms, developmentally appropriate curriculum and teaching strategies, ninth-grade-only support personnel, academic and support services, eighth-to-ninth-grade transition programs, and freshman transition courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427736">Fields, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427736">Sammon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085911427736">U.S. Department of Education, 2001</xref>). The focus of this article is on one freshman academy structure—interdisciplinary teaming.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary team consists of a group of teachers from various subject areas and the students they share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427736">Erb &amp; Stevenson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers, Mertens, &amp; Mulhall, 1999</xref>). Ideally, teams have between 2-5 teachers and 125 or fewer students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Team classrooms are often located in close proximity to one another and teachers are giving common planning time to meet throughout the week. During common planning, teachers have the opportunity to collaborate to create consistent rules, procedures, and intervention strategies; coordinate a career-focused rigorous curriculum; synchronize assessments and other assignments; cater instruction to student needs; create interdisciplinary lessons; organize team-wide activities; discuss student needs; hold student interventions; and engage parents in the education process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427736">Fields, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427736">George et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teaming has the potential to create a more personal, supportive learning environment for students and teachers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson and Davis (2000)</xref>, “teams provide a psychological home within the school that helps reduce the stress of isolation and anonymity” (p. 125). Teaming fosters a sense of family where students and teachers respect and support one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427736">Boyer &amp; Bishop, 2004</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">National Middle School Association [NMSA] (2010)</xref>, “The team is the foundation for a strong learning community characterized by a sense of family. Students and teachers on the team become well acquainted, feel safe, respected, and supported, and are encouraged to take intellectual risks” (p. 31).</p>
<p>Teachers experience numerous benefits from being paired with colleagues on a team. Interdisciplinary teaming allows teachers to form a collaborative work group that supports personal and professional needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Due to increases in professional contact and communication, teaming may decrease teachers’ feelings of isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911427736">Mills, Powell, &amp; Pollack, 1992</xref>) and may increase their sense of professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427736">Gatewood, Cline, Green, &amp; Harris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427736">Pounder, 1999</xref>), collegiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427736">Laven, 1992</xref>), and teaching efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427736">Erb &amp; Stevenson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427736">Pounder, 1999</xref>). Teachers also report more positive perceptions of school/work climate as a result of being teamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427736">Walsh &amp; Shay, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers are better equipped to meet students’ needs when teachers work as a team and support one another. Teachers who work in teams report an increase in knowledge about students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427736">Pounder, 1999</xref>). Teaming affords teachers opportunities to foster positive relationships with students and support their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Team teachers are more likely to hold higher student expectations, communicate such expectations, offer more challenging instruction, and teach students in engaging ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For students, teaming creates opportunities to establish a deep sense of community, create stable relationships and deep bonds with teachers and classmates, and become affiliated with a peer group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427736">Boyer &amp; Bishop, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911427736">George &amp; Alexander, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427736">Powell, 1993</xref>). Teaming increases the possibility for a more personalized educational experience that provides high school students with a sense of connection, belonging, competence, autonomy, and engagement in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427736">Fields, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427736">Sammon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although interdisciplinary teaming is a “signature component” of middle school organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">NMSA, 2010</xref>, p. 31), recent high school reform initiatives are implementing interdisciplinary teaming to complement and/or replace traditional departmentalization. However, there is a gap in the literature on the outcomes of interdisciplinary teaming and other developmentally responsive reform efforts at the high school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters &amp; Kerr, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters and Kerr’s (2001)</xref> quantitative study addressed this deficiency in the research by investigating how organizational reform initiatives known to increase ninth-grade students’ sense of membership within the school community, including SLCs and interdisciplinary teaming, may meet their needs and the impact of such efforts. Legters and Kerr found that 26.6% of all Maryland high schools organized their ninth-grade students and teachers into interdisciplinary teams; however, less than 10% of these schools implemented teaming at a high level. They found large, high-poverty, and high-minority high schools implemented interdisciplinary teaming at a much higher rate than large, advantaged high schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters &amp; Kerr, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative studies focusing on how interdisciplinary teaming may meet high school students’ needs are needed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters and Kerr (2001)</xref> call for additional studies that investigate exactly how high schools are implementing organizational reform initiatives, including interdisciplinary teaming, “A more complete understanding of how schools are implementing practices would require visiting schools, talking to members of the school community, and comparing different modes of implementation in different contexts across a number of schools” (pp. 20-21). In a recent qualitative case study that investigated teaming at the ninth-grade level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085911427736">Yisrael (2008)</xref> found that meetings held during common planning time provided teachers the opportunity to lesson plan, schedule conferences, discuss individual students, and support one another. Teaming created opportunities for teachers to support one another and talk with one another about personal feelings and concerns as well as teaching successes and struggles. Findings from Yisrael’s study suggest that the supportive atmosphere fostered as a result of teaming had a positive impact on high school teachers’ morale and their ability to be effective. Although this case study is informative and adds a qualitative perspective to the literature on teaming at the ninth-grade level, it does not look at the implementation of teaming across multiple schools and how teaming may meet the basic and developmental needs of students who are entering high school. In an effort to address the gap in the literature and to respond to Legters and Kerr call, the present article takes a qualitative multisite case study examination of exactly how interdisciplinary teaming may create a ninth-grade environment that meets the needs of ninth-grade students.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate how three high schools within one large, urban school district utilized ninth-grade interdisciplinary teaming within their freshman academy in an effort to create a developmentally responsive ninth-grade environment that supported students’ basic and developmental needs. The central research question was, “How might interdisciplinary teaming create a developmentally responsive environment that meets ninth-grade students’ basic and developmental needs?” In addition to the central question, subquestions included, “What were the perceptions of ninth-grade students/teachers/administrators regarding interdisciplinary teaming?” “How did team teachers utilize interdisciplinary teaming to help meet the needs of their students?” and “How did interdisciplinary teaming influence the school/classroom environment?” Data for this study were part of a 2006-2007 investigation of how freshman academies helped students make a developmentally responsive transition into high school by personalizing the ninth-grade experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911427736">Kmiec, 2007</xref>). Highlighting the perceptions of those most intimately involved in interdisciplinary teaming within each freshman academy, the present article focuses primarily on how interdisciplinary teaming created a family-like environment that supported ninth-grade students’ needs.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>The three schools highlighted in this study are located in a large, urban, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse school district in the southeastern United States. At the time of data collection, this district was one of the top 10 largest school districts in the nation with more than 200 schools that serviced over 190,000 students. Prior to implementing SLCs, each large high school organized its faculty and students in a more traditional manner, including departmentalization of teachers and ability grouping of students. During the 2002-2003 school year, the district applied for and received a federally funded implementation grant to put into operation SLCs in four large, diverse high schools in need of reform. According to the district, these schools needed to increase student achievement, academic rigor, and student retention as well as improve school culture and climate. The school district received a total of 4 years of federal funding for this reform initiative. Implementation began during the 2003-2004 school year. At the time of data collection (2006-2007 school year), three schools that were part of the 2002-2003 federal SLC implementation grant were still classified by the district as fully functioning SLCs with an active freshman academy that included interdisciplinary teaming. All three of these schools participated in this study.</p>
<p>As a result of the 2002-2003 SLC implementation grant, Westshore, Diaz, and Seminole High Schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085911427736">1</xref></sup> were rearranged into SLCs that included one freshman academy SLC at each school site. All freshman academies implemented interdisciplinary teaming. Because interdisciplinary teaming consists of multiple teachers from different disciplines who share similar students, the entire organization of ninth-grade students and the faculty that teach ninth-grade classes changed. During the time of data collection, both Diaz and Seminole’s freshman academy were organized into four ninth-grade interdisciplinary teams and Westshore was organized into three ninth-grade interdisciplinary teams. At each school site, teams consisted of 4-6 teachers. Each of the three interdisciplinary teams at Westshore were made up of six teachers, including one English, science, mathematics, social studies, transition course, and elective teacher. At Diaz, all four ninth-grade teams consisted of at least one English, science, mathematics, and social studies/freshman transition course teacher. At Seminole, all four teacher teams were comprised of one English, science, social studies, transition course, and, less frequently, a mathematics teacher. Teachers did not select their team; administration at each school site selected the teachers they believed were best suited to work together on a ninth-grade team. At Diaz, team teachers’ classrooms were located in close physical proximity to one another. Proximity was not implemented at Westshore or Seminole.</p>
<p>Westshore, operating on a 4 × 4 block schedule, achieved approximately 90%-95% purity (common students shared by a teacher team) for the first semester, dropping thereafter. Diaz and Seminole, both operating on a traditional seven-period schedule, reported lower percentages of purity for the first two marking periods (approximately 60% for Diaz and 40% for Seminole), with percentages dropping during the second semester. Although difficult to determine the exact number of students per team at each school due to lack of purity, the range was between 110 and 175 students (approximately 175 at Westshore, 110 at Diaz, and 160 at Seminole). Teams were not completely pure throughout the school year due to scheduling difficulties that resulted from a large number of students needing to be cross-teamed for advanced and/or remedial courses, specialty courses, and the need to arrange for team teachers to have the same period off for common planning. Team purity dropped during the second semester due to semester-long classes that resulted in a schedule change halfway through the year As a result of hand scheduling, much of their freshman class, Westshore was able to maintain a higher degree of purity than Diaz and Seminole who used scheduling software to create students’ schedules.</p>
<p>All team teachers had common planning time during the school day. Teachers at Westshore and Diaz originally met as an interdisciplinary team during common planning biweekly and Seminole’s teachers convened on a weekly basis. Teachers from all three schools met less frequently as the year progressed due to a decrease in the number of common students after the spring semester began and the need to use their planning period to focus on other teaching-related issues.</p>
<p>Supportive actions were taken to help maximize the effectiveness of the SLC initiative. A consultant was hired to offer professional development in an effort to enrich teachers’ understanding of SLCs, freshman academies, and teaming. Additionally, at least one SLC coordinator was hired at each school site to help with the daily operation of SLCs and one ninth-grade team teacher at each school served as the freshman-led teacher for all teams in the freshman academy.</p>

<title>Identification of Participants</title>
<p>This study utilized purposeful sampling to select participating schools and participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427736">Merriam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911427736">Patton, 2002</xref>). All high schools were large, low socioeconomic, high-minority schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085911427736">Table 1</xref>) that were part of the original 2002-2003 SLC implementation grant that were earmarked by the school district as in need of reform. At the time of data collection, these schools had active freshman academy SLCs with interdisciplinary teams. The district-level SLC coordinator was asked to participate. All site-based administrators, site-based freshman academy support personnel, and freshman academy team teachers were asked to participate. At each school site, the site-based administrator assigned one teacher per team who had the most team students to assist with the student-recruitment process. The researcher attended these team classrooms to meet with as many team students as possible to explain the study and distribute parental informed consent forms. Sixty-seven participants intimately involved in the daily operation of each freshman academy and ninth-grade teams agreed to participate, including five site-based administrators, four site-based SLC coordinators, three freshman lead teachers, 33 freshman academy team teachers, one district-level SLC director, and 21 freshman academy students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085911427736">Table 2</xref> for a detailed break down of participants by school). All participants, including parents/guardians of students, signed informed consent forms. Students also granted verbal affirmation prior to participating. Pseudonyms were used in place of school and participant names to increase confidentiality.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Conducted during the 2006-2007 school year, this study utilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427736">Merriam’s (2009)</xref> qualitative case-study methodology grounded in the self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>) and the stage-environment fit theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427736">Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427736">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>). Case study methodology was selected because of its usefulness when studying a single entity in context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427736">Stake, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085911427736">Yin, 2003</xref>) that results in a theme-based description of the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911427736">Creswell, 2007</xref>) and for its ability to answer “how” questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085911427736">Yin, 2003</xref>). A multisite case study design was selected in an effort to improve the ability to generalize the findings and enhance the impact of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085911427736">Yin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A qualitative investigation of this nature must take place in an authentic context, include the participant perspectives, and involve numerous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427736">Hatch, 2002</xref>). This investigation consisted of 40 hours of data collection that included 13 focus group interviews (177 pages of typed transcription), 12 individual interviews (126 pages of typed transcription), 22 classroom observations (77 pages of hand-written field notes), one district level SLC meeting observation (five pages of hand-written field notes), and a large collection of archival data. Using multiple data sources aids triangulation, helping to ensure that the findings are a true representation of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085911427736">Yin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Site-based administrators and those involved in overseeing the freshman academy at each school participated in one leadership focus-group interview. Additionally, all freshman academy teacher teams at each school were asked to participate in one focus-group interview (two out of the three teams at Westshore, three out of the four teams at Diaz, and two out of the four teams at Seminole participated). Scheduling conflicts between team teachers limited the number of teams that were interviewed. Additionally, a group of ninth-grade students at each school (nine students at Westshore, three students at Diaz, and nine students at Seminole) each participated in one focus group interview.</p>
<p>In addition to focus-group interviews, 12 semistructured individual interviews were conducted. The school district SLC director was interviewed to gain insight on the district-level perspective. Each school principal, SLC coordinator, and freshman lead teacher were interviewed at least one time to elaborate on archival evidence and follow up on data gathered during focus-group interviews and classroom observations.</p>
<p>Semistructured interview protocols guided all focus group and individual interviews. For example, the researcher asked students, “Describe your team to me” and “How has teaming affected your ninth-grade year?” Sample teacher questions included, “Describe an instance when teaming allowed you to support students needs in a way you were not able to do before teaming” and “How has teaming affected your ability to effectively teach your students?” Sample administrator and site-based coordinator questions included, “Elaborate on the professional development offered to support interdisciplinary teaming at the ninth-grade level?” and “How are ninth-grade interdisciplinary teacher teams determined?” All interviews were audiotaped and completely transcribed.</p>
<p>A total of 23 observations were conducted. Two classroom observations per team were conducted for a total of 22 team classroom observations. Additionally, one district-level SLC meeting was observed. Field notes were taken during each observation that included as much concrete data as possible with no generalizations or personal interpretations. After each observation, personal reflections were recorded in a research journal in an effort to keep personal biases separate from the data.</p>
<p>Archival data were collected to help with triangulation, including mission statements, lesson plans, team-related materials, and handouts from freshman academy events. In an effort to minimize the effects that subjectivity might have on the research and to help enhance trustworthiness and dependability, all participants were given the opportunity to read their interview transcriptions to make sure that it accurately captured their perceptions, peer reviews of the data collection and analysis process were conducted to check for inconsistencies, a research journal was kept and consulted to make sure all information was being reportedly accurately and not being influenced by personal biases, and analyzed data was used to help inform the ongoing data-collection process.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The present study utilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427736">Hatch’s (2002)</xref> inductive approach to data analysis, whereby, through the process of looking for patterns in data, general statements regarding the phenomena and theories that may emerge within its context can be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427736">Hatch, 2002</xref>). Hatch’s inductive-analysis method was selected because of its potential to work within numerous qualitative paradigms, including constructivism, capability to handle large data sets, and ability to allow participants’ stories to emerge from the data. Inductive analysis involves a series of steps that begins with reading and rereading the data and separating the data into analyzable parts, known as “frames of analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427736">Hatch, 2002</xref>). Frames of analysis place parameters on what data needs careful examination. The frames were then further examined and separated into domains or pieces of data that had a relationship with one another. With the primary research question serving as a guide, domains were reanalyzed across all three sites into relationships and elements of the relationship that helped answer the research question (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042085911427736">Figure 1</xref>). Domains were checked to ensure evidence existed to merit inclusion and disconfirming data were reviewed. In an effort to uncover the theme of the present study, the researcher examined the domains as a whole by asking the question, “What does all this mean?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427736">Hatch, 2002</xref>, p. 173). Increased teacher communication as a result of interdisciplinary teaming may provide the teacher support and individualized student attention necessary to foster a family-like ninth-grade environment that meets the needs of students and their teachers emerged as the theme of the present study. Lack of pure student–teacher teams and efforts made to endorse teaming served as implementation issues that influenced how well interdisciplinary teaming created a developmentally responsive family-like ninth-grade environment. Furthermore, there appeared to be some confusion between exactly who had their needs met and benefited most from interdisciplinary teaming. Although school personnel believed that teaming produced a responsive environment that met the needs of both students and teachers, students reported little benefit to teaming as implemented at Westshore, Diaz, and Seminole. Last, excerpts from the data that supported the study’s findings were selected for inclusion in this manuscript.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Findings indicate interdisciplinary teaming may create a family-like ninth-grade environment that helped meet the needs of ninth-grade teachers and, to a lesser degree, ninth-grade students. In examining the data, two developmentally responsive family-like relationships were identified across all three schools: team–teacher and team teacher–student (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042085911427736">Figure 1</xref>). Within each relationship, a major element helped to promote the developmentally responsive family-like relationship. Teacher support as a result of interdisciplinary teaming emerged as a salient element of the interdisciplinary team–teacher relationship. Individualized student attention as a result of having a team of teachers served as a major element in the team teacher–student relationship. Found throughout both relationships, communication between team teachers emerged as a major element in supporting the team–teacher and team teacher–student relationships. Findings unique to each school, including Diaz’s use of proximity of ninth-grade team classrooms, Seminole’s larger school-wide SLC structure, and Westshore’s Freshman Focus program, all influenced how interdisciplinary teaming created a developmentally responsive environment that met ninth-grade students’ needs, Although teaming helped to support teachers’ needs, teaming was not as successful in supporting the basic and developmental needs of ninth-grade students. The lack of fully implementing the teaming concept, including the creation of pure teams and efforts to promote teaming, limited the extent interdisciplinary teaming created a developmentally responsive family-like ninth-grade environment that supported ninth-grade students’ needs.</p>

<title>Interdisciplinary Team-to-Teacher Relationship: Teacher Support That Promotes a Family-Like Ninth-Grade Environment</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s nice to talk to other teachers. Even just to vent sometimes about a kid or a situation. It does create a community. And we’ve had it happen before. I’ll tell Mr. Cruz [fellow team teacher] about an issue I’m having with a kid and he will talk to them in class and the kid will be like “how did you know that?” It’s nice to know that you have a team of teachers behind you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the previous quote, Mrs. Smith, a team teacher at Diaz, reflected on the support she received from fellow teammates as result of interdisciplinary teaming. In line with the literature on interdisciplinary teaming, teachers and school leaders in this study reported interdisciplinary teaming and team meetings during common planning helped to create a family-like environment where teachers communicated with, related to, and supported one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427736">Erb &amp; Stevenson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427736">Laven, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">NMSA, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427736">Pounder, 1999</xref>). This family-like environment supported teachers’ basic psychological needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). Also noted in the literature on teaming, positive team-to-teacher interaction helped increase the cohesiveness of school faculty and led to positive changes in school climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427736">Walsh &amp; Shay, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Teaming afforded teachers the opportunity to communicate with teachers who they otherwise may not talk to in a traditional, departmentalized high school structure. An increase in teacher communication across departments created an enhanced sense of security and connection to a group of colleagues within the school environment. As a result of interdisciplinary teaming with a common planning period, teachers reported meeting fellow colleagues, many who were long-time faculty members, for the very first time. As Mrs. Matingly, a team teacher at Seminole explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because of the team I’ve met her [fellow team teacher] daughter, her daughter’s family, and I got to see that Mr. Wren [another fellow team teacher] isn’t as scary as I thought he was. He really has a great personality and he’s very involved and I think that I got over, “I’m a social studies teacher and I must interact with social studies.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teaming helped remove the unspoken rule that teachers must only associate with colleagues in their academic discipline. During site-based observations at all three schools, the researcher witnessed team teachers from various disciplines eating together at lunch and talking with one another in the halls. Although not pervasive across all three schools, ninth-grade team personnel at Diaz believed that the close physical proximity of team classrooms helped foster increased teacher communication and encouraged daily interaction across disciplines. As Mr. Hanes, Diaz’s SLC co-coordinator explained, “There are teachers that had [before teaming and proximity of classrooms] rooms side-by-side that said good morning to each other and that was the extent of it. Now when they walk out in the hall, they are standing side by side.”</p>
<p>This hallway camaraderie was witnessed at Diaz during school observations.</p>
<p>Team teachers gathered during team meetings to converse about fellow students, class lessons and assignments, upcoming school-wide events, and their personal lives. While on site conducting classroom observations at all three schools, the researcher observed team teachers eliciting advice about individual student issues, assisting in the creation and improvement of lessons, supporting team teachers in-class activities by attending their lesson, covering classes for one another, and planning after-school social events together. All these acts may help support teachers’ basic needs for relatedness to colleagues, competence within their social environment, and opportunities to express their teaching capabilities to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers believed teaming aided the development of a true sense of community that led to positive changes in the school climate, noted byproducts of interdisciplinary teaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427736">Walsh &amp; Shay, 1993</xref>). As Mr. Bandery, Westshore’s SLC coordinator stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I saw this year a teacher who had been here for ten years and a teacher in a different department for twenty years meet for the first time. I see teachers now quite frequently talking, whether it’s just talking or talking about students, but talking in the halls and that’s the climate shift that we’re looking for and beginning to see.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An increase in team teacher talk fostered a teacher support network that encouraged teacher cohesiveness and positive changes in the school climate. As a result of being a member of an interdisciplinary team within a freshman academy, team teachers described the school climate as “more cohesive,” “supportive,” and “family-like.” However, lack of common students on each team was noted as a major limitation to the extent team teachers could support one another.</p>
<p>Although teachers reported the above-listed benefits of teaming and common planning, they also expressed that their teams did not have enough students in common to optimally reap all the potential benefits associated with teaming and shared planning. As Mrs. Honors, a team teacher at Seminole stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we come here [team meeting] and we do meet because we do have a common planning period, it does not mean that Mr. Kurts [another freshman team teacher] and I have any kids in common. Or a lot of times you go through the list and you might have one student. That has been an issue . . . So, the whole gist of what we’re actually suppose to be able to do doesn’t always work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This lack of purity reportedly hampered teachers’ ability to maximize opportunities to communicate with colleagues in an effort to meet teacher as well as student needs.</p>

<sec id="section12-0042085911427736">
<title>Interdisciplinary Teaming-to-Student Relationship: Individualized Attention That Promotes a Family-Like Ninth-Grade Environment</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We come to our team meeting every other week and we say, “Hey, Johnny’s having problems in my class.” “What’s going on?” We would go back and his homeroom teacher would say, “Hey, Ms. Potter said you are not doing so hot in her computer class. What’s going on?” And it was that, “How’d you hear that? What?” And we still do that. They’re like, “How do you know that?” So the team as far as from that, definitely the structure of the teams was very nice in that aspect.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above-listed quote from Ms. Potter, a team teacher at Westshore, illustrates how team teachers communicated their concerns to one another regarding common students and how individual teachers expressed care and concern to students as a result of such conversations. School personnel believed that the increase in team teacher communication helped to nurture a caring and supportive team teacher–student relationship. When team teachers who share similar ninth-grade students talked to one another, they were able to see each common student as a whole child with unique needs, a noted result of teaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">NMSA, 2010</xref>). Teachers became more informed and better able to provide students with the individualized attention necessary to meet their needs, increasing their sense of competence in this area. Holding conversations about individual students helped team teachers get to know and foster caring relationships as well as implement team interventions. As a result, teachers positioned themselves to help students develop a sense of connection and belonging to the team. However, the lack of pure student–teacher teams limited the extent teaming fostered a deep sense of relatedness for students, including developing a sense of connection to team teachers and fellow peers. Furthermore, by not promoting the teaming concept to students, opportunities to create a developmentally responsive family-like ninth-grade environment were limited.</p>
<sec id="section13-0042085911427736">
<title>Get to know and foster caring relationships</title>
<p>Team teachers reported continuously talking about common students throughout the school day and beyond (e.g., common planning, before school, class changes, after school, and during class). The researcher was witness to such conversations during school visits. Teachers reported that these conversations helped them get to know and develop a more holistic understanding of each student, including his or her unique academic, social, emotional, and personal needs, As Mrs. Nottings, Diaz’s SLC co-coordinator explained, “Instead of just worrying about your third period class, you start to see the kid as a whole maybe because you know that they failed their science test and that they got a D on their Algebra I test.” Teachers were more competent in their ability to meet students’ basic and developmental needs when they were afforded the opportunity to know their students more completely.</p>
<p>Meaningful individual relationships between teachers and students can develop when teachers have a more thorough understanding of students and their needs. Research suggests that teaming helps teachers get to know their students well and aids in the promotion of positive relationships with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">NMSA, 2010</xref>). Teachers reported eliciting advice from teammates on how to develop meaningful connections with students they had in common. As Mr. Benard, Diaz’s freshman lead teacher stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I really think it [interdisciplinary teaming] helps foster the relationship because sometimes I can say to Mrs. Smith, a teacher here, “I am having problems with so and so. How is he doing?” And I can find that the student had a wonderful idea or a wonderful grade in Mrs. Smith’s class and I might want to build off that or mention that to the student, “Hey, I heard about that, or you did well in that class.” So that it is like a family atmosphere type of thing where we keep all the positive and negative things among ourselves and try to work out our own problems.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers believed that through such conversations a sense of family was fostered. Acting as a family, teachers reported numerous instances when they helped one another. School personnel frequently shared stories about how a certain team teacher who had a good relationship with a student helped a fellow team teacher by intervening on his or her behalf. As Mr. Bandery shared:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the great things about the team concept, usually without exception, one of the teachers forms a bond with the student. So whenever other teachers are struggling or there’s a personality conflict or whatever, there’s one teacher on the team that can say, “Okay, I’ll deal with it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At each school site, team teachers mentioned instances when they spoke to a student for another team teacher and served as a moderator between a student and fellow colleague. Team teachers provided support for their teammates autonomy by validating their expertise as a teacher when talking or working with a student.</p>
<p>An increase in teacher communication as a result of interdisciplinary teaming also afforded teachers the opportunity to express care and concern to individual students. As Mrs. Wilkinson, Seminole’s freshman lead teacher shared:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The one thing that we found was most successful was just having teachers talk to each other. And the teacher going, “Ms. So and So said you didn’t do too well on your English test,” And they’re like, “What? You talk to her?” Knowing that people are talking about them is huge.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers reported instances when they united as a team to express care and concern for students as a collective. As Mrs. Kantry and Mrs. Smith, two team teachers from Diaz shared:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ms. Kantry:</speaker>
<p>We have one mutual student, Mr. R, who was out for two days, and I’m freaking out because I’m thinking that the kid has been deported . . . this is a kid we all have. He’s a good kid . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mrs. Smith:</speaker>
<p>And he has perfect attendance. And he missed two days. We came over and said, “Have you seen Mr. R?” “No, let me go ask Mrs. Cruz [another team teacher]. Have you seen Mr. R?” And nobody’s seen him and we all know that he is here illegally.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ms. Kantry:</speaker>
<p>And he was like, “I was sick.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mrs. Smith:</speaker>
<p>But I tell you what, he realized that day how much we all cared about him.</p>
</speech>
<p>Although not common across all three schools, personnel at Diaz believed proximity of team classrooms provided opportunities for team teachers to communicate and express care and concern for the students they share. During an interview, Mr. Hanes, Diaz’s SLC co-coordinator, explained typical conversations he witnessed between team teachers during class interchanges:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s like “Johnny just failed my science test. What are you doing with him right now in freshman transition class?” “Well there is nothing that he can’t miss so take him right back in there and have him retake that test right now.” There’s been a lot more of that that goes on with the concept [teaming and it has worked.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teaming created opportunities for teachers to work together to show care, affection, and concern both individually and collectively as a group. Teaming also generated opportunities for students to receive such caring messages from teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427736">Noddings (2005)</xref> asserts that the need to be taken care of is a universal characteristic and that everyone wants to receive care. Because of the increase in team teacher talk about individual students, teachers were able to acquire a more complete understanding of, develop meaningful relationships with, and show care and concern for team students. However, the lack of common students on each team limited the opportunities for team teachers to get to know each student well, nurture a deep sense of connection, and express care collectively as a group. Not one student reported that teaming created a family-like environment where they received attention and care from their team teachers. Rather, students spoke of individual teachers that fostered meaningful caring student–teacher relationships who made them feel more comfortable and connected. As students from Westshore shared:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Darren:</speaker>
<p>She told us, “If you don’t feel comfortable you can come to me,” so we did.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>So there was a comfort level there?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Evan:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Darren:</speaker>
<p>Part of our team.</p>
</speech>
<p>Such supportive individual teacher–student relationships allowed students to feel cared for and to have their needs for connection and belonging satisfied within a school community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427736">Solomon, Battistich, Kim, &amp; Watson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Unique to Westshore, the supportive relationships and community of care that reportedly evolved stemmed from another freshman academy SLC structure, Freshman Focus program, a series of ninth-grade transition courses and its teachers, not interdisciplinary teaming or team teachers as a collective. Students at Westshore did not recognize their interdisciplinary teams at all; the only community and supportive relationships between students and teachers they recognized was what developed as a result of the Freshman Focus program (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911427736">Ellerbrock &amp; Kiefer, 2010</xref>, for a review).</p>

<sec id="section14-0042085911427736">
<title>Team interventions</title>
<p>Increased teacher communication as a result of teaming appeared to make it easier for teachers to spot students in need who otherwise might be overlooked in a more traditional high school environment. Team teachers reported holding individual students accountable for their actions, no longer letting them go unnoticed. As Mr. Broadaway, Seminole’s principal shared, “It’s just a lot of those kids, you know, we use that expression, they fall through the cracks. They like to remain anonymous. Well, you can’t be anonymous.” Teaming created a structure whereby student anonymity and lack of accountability were no longer options. Teachers wanted students to clearly receive the message that they matter and will be supported. As Mrs. Hillington, Seminole’s SLC coordinator stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>That’s one thing I saw develop over the years was accountability. The kids knew they were going to be held accountable, people knew their name, and they were going to be reported to somebody. If they were having an issue whether it be academic, emotional, physical, whatever it might be there was a support network there for them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Team teachers reported that they were able to support and hold students accountable for their actions by implementing team interventions during common planning. Team interventions, made up of team teachers, the student, support staff, and frequently, parents, took the place of more formalized disciplinary actions. By having a support system in place, school personnel intervened to help students get back on track in a nonthreatening and supportive manner. An autonomy-supportive act, this type of intervention has the potential to help students become responsible for their own behaviors, learning, and achievement while providing the supports necessary to boost their competence.</p>
<p>Teachers believed such interventions sent a clear message to students that people at school cared about and supported them. As Mrs. Matingly, a team teacher from Seminole stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We might only have one teacher that had this student on the team but the kid walks in with seven faces they don’t recognize and they’re like, “Why am I here?” and we said, “Because you’re failing five of your seven classes. We want to know why.” We had one girl tell us that she was pregnant. We had one girl tell us that she got suspended and she couldn’t make up the work. At least they came in and saw seven teachers that said, “We know you’re not doing well.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The lack of pure student–teacher teams limited the extent such interventions where able to include each student’s actual teacher. However, as the previous quote illustrated, teachers understood the value of holding such interventions and were willing to help.</p>
<p>Although conversations among teacher teams promoted individualized student attention, teachers attributed the lack of purity as limiting their ability to provide students with opportunities to meet their needs, including students’ need to form a connection to team teachers and fellow teammates. When asked why teams were not completely pure, Mr. Brommel, principal of Diaz stated, “The whole teaming thing is a scheduling nightmare!” Leadership found it difficult to place all ninth-grade students on pure interdisciplinary teams due to students entering high school with various ability levels, specialty courses, semester courses, and arranging for team teachers to have the same period off for common planning. As Mr. Brommel, principal of Diaz shared:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First of all, you get them [students] into as many like core classes within the team . . . The second thing is you have to make sure that all those teachers are off the same period and that’s where the scheduling nightmare comes in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers did not believe students understood they were actually on a team. As Mrs. Smith, a team teacher from Diaz explained, “They don’t know they are on a team. These kids don’t know they are on team A or team B. We’re team D. Our kids don’t know they are on team D.” When students were asked to describe their team, they responded with comments like, “what’s that?” For example, during a focus group interview, students at Westshore articulate their confusion regarding their ninth-grade team:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Describe your freshman team?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Monica:</speaker>
<p>Freshman team?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Do you know what I’m talking about?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Monica:</speaker>
<p>You mean freshman class?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katie:</speaker>
<p>You mean our whole class?</p>
</speech>
<p>Students at all three schools were unable to clearly explain their ninth-grade team. Unique to Seminole, in addition to being part of a freshman academy and interdisciplinary team, students were also part of a larger, school-wide academic SLC. This caused much confusion for Seminole students, as they were unable to differentiate between their academic SLC and their ninth grade interdisciplinary team.</p>
<p>Although no students in this study recognized being a member of a ninth-grade interdisciplinary team, students across all three schools did acknowledge having multiple classes with the same peers. As students from Diaz explained:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mika:</speaker>
<p>For my first period it’s always the same group of people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bruce:</speaker>
<p>It’s like a group of fish going to the same place.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mika:</speaker>
<p>It’s the same people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Cameron:</speaker>
<p>Most of my 7th period is in my 5th period class right now.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mika:</speaker>
<p>I always count in my head how many people are in my next class.</p>
</speech>
<p>Students also attested to the advantages of having the same students in multiple classes:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Cameron:</speaker>
<p>You can go over homework in one class and copy notes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mika:</speaker>
<p>Like me and his [Bruce’s] brother, we were in the freshman transition class last semester which was fifth period and we had sixth period together. So, whenever we needed help for fifth period, we would give it to each other in sixth period.</p>
</speech>
<p>Despite not recognizing that they were teamed, students did express an understanding of what it meant to be on a team, referring to a team as “a little family” and “a little fraternity.” For students, like Cierra from Seminole, being on a team meant more than sharing a group of teachers sharing a similar group of students. Reflecting back to middle school, being on a team meant being a family, “A little family, a little fraternity. Like, it sounds weird but you got to know the people on your team and it was fun.” Another student from Seminole, Carey, compared her past teaming experiences with her current situation, “Last year, you could tell this group is a team and this group is a team. Now it’s just like there’s no team.” Students from each school openly expressed the desire to have more emphasis placed on teaming at the ninth-grade level, making reference to how much they valued teaming in middle school and how their needs for relatedness are not being met by their high school and ninth-grade teachers. As Erica, a student from Seminole shared:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You don’t have like a purpose [in high school]. In eighth grade, you come to school and you are like, “Oh, I’m on this team. I have friends and I have fun and I have teachers that care about me.” And its like, “This is school.” And then you come to high school and it’s like nobody respects you. You’re like the lowest on the totem pole.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For students, teaming provides a sense of identity. Without teaming, students perceive their sense of identity and purpose as lost.</p>
<p>Teachers attributed the lack of common students as the reason for not promoting teaming, telling students they were on a team, creating a team identity, or engaging in team-related activities. Students and teachers did not report a single instance where they met to engage in any team-related event, activity, or intervention. Although teachers openly expressed regrets for not organizing team-related activities to help unite students and increase their sense of belonging and connectedness to the team, they also stressed the necessity for teams to be completely pure for such efforts to be worthwhile. As Mrs. Honors, a team teacher at Seminole shared, “I feel it could have more of an influence if the kids felt that they were a little more united as a group . . . There’s never been anything done to try to make them feel united as a group.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article attempts to address <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427736">Legters and Kerr (2001)</xref> call for additional studies that investigate exactly how high school organizational reform efforts, including interdisciplinary teaming, are being implemented. By taking a qualitative, multisite case study examination of how interdisciplinary teaming creates a ninth-grade environment that meets the needs of students, findings from this study suggest that two developmentally responsive family-like relationships may help to create an environment that meets the needs of ninth-grade students and their teachers. Team teacher communication helped to support the interdisciplinary team–teacher and team teacher–student relationships that promoted a family-like ninth-grade environment. Interdisciplinary teaming fostered the collegial support necessary to fulfill team teacher needs, including the need for support from colleagues, relatedness, autonomy, and connection within the work environment. Teaming helped these teachers nurture individual student relationships where they felt more competent to meet students’ needs and where students may experience a sense of relatedness and connection to the team. Two major conclusions matriculated from this study. First, school personnel perceived interdisciplinary teaming as more beneficial to both themselves and students than students actually perceived. Second, implementation issues, including the absence of pure teams and lack of effort made to promote teaming, limited the extent interdisciplinary teaming actually created a family-like ninth-grade environment that supported students’ needs.</p>
<p>Although such conclusions are informative and provide valuable insight, the current study is not without limitations. This study does not include the perceptions of students, administrators, teachers, and district-level personnel not directly involved with ninth-grade interdisciplinary teams at each school site. This study does not suggest that all interdisciplinary teams organize and operate exactly like the three schools used in this study or that personnel and students at other high schools utilizing interdisciplinary teaming share the same perceptions as those found in this study. As qualitative research is limited by its lack of representativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427736">Merriam, 2009</xref>), this study does not suggest that all interdisciplinary teams produce results similar to the three schools highlighted in this study. Additionally, data were collected during the last year of the 4 years each school received the SLC implementation grant, providing only a snapshot of how interdisciplinary teaming may create a family-like ninth-grade environment. Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al. (2007)</xref> remind us that “creating teams is not a goal in itself but one element in the strategy for transforming the social–developmental aspects of schools to create ‘small, personalized communities for learning” (p. 216). Interdisciplinary teaming is just one element in fostering a developmentally responsive ninth-grade environment. Despite such limitations, by providing rich, thick descriptions from the voices of those personally involved, this study presents a detailed picture of how three high schools within one large, urban school district utilize ninth-grade interdisciplinary teaming within their freshman academies in an effort to create a family-like ninth-grade environment where the basic and developmental needs of ninth-grade students and their teachers may be met.</p>
<p>The first conclusion is that school personnel were more favorable of and reported more benefits to interdisciplinary teaming for both students and themselves than students actually reported. There appeared to be a substantial disconnect between how school personnel perceived the needs of students and teachers were being met by interdisciplinary teaming and how students perceived, experienced, and actually had their needs fulfilled by teaming. Teachers’ needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy were met through an increase in teacher communication as a result of teaming and team meetings during common planning. In addition, school personnel at Diaz also attributed the increase in teacher communication to close proximity of team classrooms. Team teachers believed teaming was beneficial to students but admitted that the lack of purity was a major problem. Students, however, reported that individual teachers and other SLC structures (i.e., Freshman Focus program at Westshore), not teaming or a group of their teachers, helped to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Teaming promoted an increase in teacher talk that resulted in numerous benefits for teachers. Teacher talk helped to reduce the sense of isolation and promote teacher cohesiveness, teacher professionalism, and a positive school climate. These findings are well supported in teaming literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427736">Gatewood et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427736">Flowers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911427736">Mills et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427736">Pounder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427736">Walsh &amp; Shay, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085911427736">Yisrael, 2008</xref>). Additionally, research suggests that increases in teacher communication and collaboration are more common in schools that institutionalize interdisciplinary teaming, such as the schools highlighted in this study, compared to nonteam-based schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085911427736">Supovitz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Teacher talk may have also created opportunities for quality student–teacher relationships to form. Supportive student–teacher relationships built on trust, care, and respect encourages positive development of students and helps to meet their needs for feeling known, cared for, and a part of a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911427736">Erb &amp; Doda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427736">Nodding, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427736">Urdan &amp; Schoenfelder, 2006</xref>). Teachers play a large role in fostering such relationships that encourage healthy development for students, In this study, school personnel reported instances where they believed students noticed that team teachers talked about them, their academic needs, progress in other classes, and spoke to other teachers on their behalf. Personnel believed students benefited from select team teachers fostering positive relationships with select students and talking to those students on the team’s behalf, noted in the literature as a common teaming practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427736">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Research suggests that teachers, either individually or as a group, who foster relationships and express care can provide the socioemotional support that can enhance feelings of belonging and encourage school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911427736">Roeser, Midgley, &amp; Urdan, 1996</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427736">Noddings (2005)</xref> reminds us that students must receive the message of care in order to complete the student-to-teacher caring relationship, “No matter how hard teachers try to care, if the caring is not received by students, the claim ‘they don’t care’ has some validity” (p. 15).</p>
<p>Students in this study did not verify any of the benefits teachers believed they received as a result of an increase in teacher talk. Students did not report any knowledge of being on an interdisciplinary team of teachers and students or that they had team teachers who talked about them and their needs. Students did acknowledge individual teachers who fostered supportive student–teacher relationships that reportedly helped to meet their needs, however, they did not make the connection between these teachers and interdisciplinary teaming. It is important to note that students, the intended benefactors of interdisciplinary teaming and the SLC freshman academy initiative, did not notice any perceived increase in teacher talk about students or attest to any quality teacher–student relationships beyond what might be found in a more traditional high school with a few caring teachers.</p>
<p>Team meetings during common planning where teachers could talk to one another reportedly helped to meet their needs and may also have the potential to support needs of individual students. Common planning time is designed to benefit both students and teachers as these meetings should center on student issues as well as needs and concerns of team teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427736">NMSA, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085911427736">Yisrael, 2008</xref>). Specifically, students may benefit from the individualized attention team meetings afford and may encourage students to take autonomy over their actions and regulate their behavior. Students in this study did not report an understanding that their teachers met to talk about them at team meetings.</p>
<p>Student interventions held during common planning allowed team teachers the opportunity to communicate care and concern to students and hold students accountable for their actions. Such interventions are commonplace in SLCs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427736">Fields (2005)</xref> suggests that sound SLCs identify students at risk of possible failure early in the school year and include a pyramid of interventions created by the ninth-grade team. Team-wide student interventions may help team teachers support the needs of their students as a collective by encouraging students to regulate their own behavior, a basic psychological need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). Not one student in this study mentioned attending a student intervention or had knowledge that such interventions were taking place.</p>
<p>Although students did not discuss as many benefits from interdisciplinary teaming as teachers thought or personally experienced themselves, it may be important to think about the effects of interdisciplinary teaming on high school teachers and how teaming influences their ability to assist ninth-grade students. As the findings from this study suggest, meeting teachers’ basic needs through having the support of a team of teachers and increased communication boosted teachers’ self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</xref>) and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085911427736">Yisrael, 2008</xref>). Teacher benefits received from teaming at the high school level may in turn help to meet the needs and have positive academic, social, and personal effects on students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al., 2007</xref>). However, students in the current study did not attest to such benefits.</p>
<p>The second conclusion is that the extent interdisciplinary teaming was able to create a family-like ninth-grade school environment that met students’ needs was hindered by the lack of complete implementation of the teaming concept, including pure student–teacher teams and efforts to promote teaming. Students at all three schools did not recognize being organized into ninth-grade interdisciplinary teams at all; they only recognized a select group of teachers who supported them during their ninth-grade year. This finding echoes research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427736">Armstead, Bessell, Sembiante, and Pacheco Plaza (2010)</xref> who found that ninth-grade students who were a part of a freshman academy were completely unaware of belonging to a SLC, freshman academy, or a team due to poor implementation. In this current investigation, personnel attributed the inability to recognize being teamed to inadequate scheduling of pure student–teacher teams. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085911427736">Rottier (2002)</xref>, scheduling conflicts along with the cost to train teachers are the major reasons why schools have difficulty implementing interdisciplinary teams.</p>
<p>The lack of common students on each team served as the major reason team teachers did not place emphasis on explaining the teaming structure to students or engaging them in any team-related bonding activities. The lack of completely pure student–teacher teams along with poor promotion of teaming served as implementation issues that further limited how well teaming was able to meet students’ basic and developmental needs and provide a developmentally responsive school environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427736">Felner et al. (2007)</xref> addresses the effects of poor implementation of teaming:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is also important to understand that in cases where schools attempt to implement these [teaming] structures but do them poorly (e.g., implement one/two short common planning times per week), they may either have no effect or even lead to some negative impacts, especially on teacher attitudes. (p. 217)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such poor implementation did not foster developmentally responsive environments that thoroughly supported students’ needs, especially the need for relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427736">Eccles, 2004</xref>). It is difficult to meet students’ needs when the teaming structure designed to support their needs is not thoroughly implemented. For students, teaming at Westshore, Diaz, and Seminole may not be all that different from the traditional high school organizational structure where they have many similar classes together due to being grouped by ability.</p>
<p>It is important to note that reform initiatives, such as freshman academy SLCs with interdisciplinary teaming, must be implemented according to their intended design. Noncompliance to the intended purpose and design may jeopardize the integrity of such initiatives and limit the possibility of producing the intended benefits. Westshore, Diaz, and Seminole did not adhere, and therefore, jeopardized the freshman academy SLC initiative by both failing to fully and appropriately implement interdisciplinary teaming.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study extends our understanding of how interdisciplinary teaming may create a family-like ninth-grade environment that meets the basic and developmental needs of ninth-grade students and their teachers. Data from this study suggest a substantial variance between how ninth-grade team teachers and ninth-grade students perceived and benefited from interdisciplinary teaming. Students at Westshore, Diaz, and Seminole did not know they belonged to an interdisciplinary team and received very little from interdisciplinary teaming as it was implemented at these schools. The lack of completely pure student–teacher teams and efforts made to promote teaming were implementation issues that ultimately resulted in the inability for teaming to thoroughly meet students’ basic and developmental needs, especially the need for relatedness, belonging to a group, and being a valued member of a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427736">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). Reform initiatives, such as freshman academy SLCs with interdisciplinary teaming, must be completely implemented, clearly articulated to students, and monitored closely to ensure students’ needs are being met for teaming to truly foster a family-like environment.</p>
<p>Additional qualitative investigations that examine high schools with fully implemented interdisciplinary teams that meet the basic and developmental needs of their students are needed. Qualitative studies that examine the lived experiences of students as they experience the transition from middle school into a freshman academy with interdisciplinary teaming are necessary to further understand this complex period in young adolescents’ lives. Longitudinal research is also needed to examine the long-term effects interdisciplinary teaming may have on meeting students’ basic and developmental needs throughout the secondary school experience and beyond.</p>
