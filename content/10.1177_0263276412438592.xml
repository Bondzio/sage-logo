<abstract>
<p>In a time in which an exuberant, trans-classical, non-trivial machine culture redesigns terminologies, remodels logics, produces new evidence, and reorganizes semantic resources, a new, neocybernetic regime of truth is taking shape. Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann’s redescription of European rationality, especially the media- and machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann’s account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann’s history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and Günther, Luhmann’s oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century’s epochal technological shift of meaning.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the entire world is a nontrivial machine. (Heinz von Foerster)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Non-triviality is fascinating, and this fascination has its own – fascinating – history. What I would like to show is that the term ‘non-trivial’, originally introduced by Heinz von Foerster in the context of machine theory, is located at the centre of a historically highly significant narrative of self-description which arose in response to the grand technological transformations of the 20th century. The principal feature of this self-description is the translation of the increasingly cybernetic aspect of all domains of being into a new, theoretically advanced semantic register. Niklas Luhmann, whose work represents a grandiose concretion of this narrative, was right to claim that our self-descriptions were still under the spell of semantic registers and linguistic frames inherited from our ancestors, hence his effort to elaborate a new terminology and a set of conceptual innovations more appropriate for describing the complexities of modernity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2005</xref>: 11). We have, however, long since assimilated a new semantic register. It arises from our media-technological, that is, cybernetic condition; it determines our conceptual experiences; and it is, I am afraid to say, in large part to blame for our techno-scientific dogmatism. It may be as necessary for us to distance ourselves from it as it was (according to Luhmann) necessary to discard the semantic and conceptual regimes bequeathed to us by an older Europe.</p>
<p>If Hans Blumenberg was correct to assume that ‘[e]very epoch invents its imaginary standpoints, from which it thinks that it can bring its characteristic type of knowledge to its most advantageous execution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276412438592">Blumenberg, 1987</xref>: 43), then it cannot be a matter of thought embodying and occupying the imaginary standpoint of its own epoch but, more critically, of discerning, probing and determining its current dogmas. In our case, the evidence of cybernetics and the existence in a cybernetic world, above all the evidence of being under neocybernetic conditions, has turned into our epoch’s imaginary standpoint. Strangely enough, this occurs in some of the most advanced and transgressive discursive contributions. To a considerable extent the resources of current social self-descriptions are shaped by neocybernetics. Bruce Clarke and Mark Hansen have captured the immense range and virulence of neocybernetic concepts and images:<disp-quote>
<p>Some of the most important theoretical and critical conversations going on today in the cognitive sciences, chaos and complexity studies, and social systems theory stem from neocybernetic notions of self-organization, emergence, and autopoiesis. A growing body of scholarly work is rethinking the shape and evolution of the relations among science, technology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, history, literature, and the arts through neocybernetic terms. Expanding the initial interdisciplinary framework connecting the natural and human sciences with information technologies, recent thinkers, such as Michel Serres, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Isabelle Stengers, have deployed neocybernetic discourse extensively and transformatively. Neocybernetic discourse is central to current historical, interpretative, and theoretical investigations using concepts such as narrative, medium, assemblage, information, noise, network and communication to remap the territory of knowledge with reference to the operational boundaries of systems and environments. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412438592">Clarke and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 5–6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following I would like to examine and question the history of the fascination exerted by non-triviality, especially as it appears in Luhmann’s work. This undertaking, I believe, could be an important step toward understanding the genesis and shape of the linguistic and conceptual fixation outlined above. The question is whether this particular discourse (with its underlying epochal imaginary constructs) is at all able to observe what contemporary media theory increasingly describes in eco-technological terms of atmospheric media, ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, etc., or whether we need a categorically different conceptual politics – one not rooted in cybernetic and systemic techno-scientific regimes – to give a feasible account of our present techno-medial situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412438592">1</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412438592"><title>The Fascination with the Non-trivial Machine: Luhmann and the Cybernetic Imaginary</title>
<p>‘Science’, in the words of Niklas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, ‘is without a doubt a recursively operating system’ (1990: 275)</xref>. A footnote supporting this claim reveals science to be a specific type of machine: ‘In Heinz von Foerster’s sense: a non-trivial machine’ (1990: 275).</p>
<p>At first glance the note simply serves to clarify a conceptual proposition, yet on closer inspection it turns out to be nothing less than an implicit historico-philosophical theorem that governs Luhmann’s analysis of science and indeed his entire oeuvre. Systems theory – this is the crux of Luhmann’s historical teleology that shapes the very core of his understanding not only of science but of all social systems – operates at the behest of the history of rationality itself. After all, both the plane of immanence on which Luhmann’s concepts circulate and the environment in which they gain consistency are characterized by a fascination with the non-trivial machine. The latter is nothing less than the principal protagonist in his account of the evolution of European rationality, which at this point in time has reached its latest incarnation in the shape of systems theory. Maybe Luhmann’s entire theory design is an integral component of the ongoing fascination exerted by the non-trivial machine, under the spell of which he attempted an emphatic new description of the occidental as the gradual assertion of non-trivial rationality. According to this redescription, the distinctive features of occidental rationality arise not from its origins but from the birth of non-trivial machines and associated types of logic that exhibit a new form of rationality. In order to discern its pivotal elements it is therefore not necessary to go all the way back to ancient geometricians or pre-Socratic philosophers, but only to the grand non-trivial rupture that started to emerge around 1900.</p>
<p>Of course the punchline of any history of fascination including this one is that it keeps its subjects in the dark. From today’s vantage point, that is, from a certain distance Luhmann’s history of rationality, so intoxicated by non-triviality, assumes the shape of a powerful historical projection generated by an enthusiasm for cybernetic machines. It is characteristic not only of Luhmann’s own historical self-perception but also of those of many other contemporaries of the cybernetic age, especially of the protagonists of second-order cybernetics. Despite the comprehensive shift toward technological conditions in the course of which the ostracized technical object, which until then had marked the absence of all meaning, moved into the centre of a new culture of meaning – despite, in other words, the basic development that, following Scott Lash, can be described as the ascendancy of technological forms of life and thought (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412438592">Lash, 2002</xref>: 13–25) – Luhmann ignored the degree to which his work and his very contemporaneity were as such conditioned by a historic machine change. Although he continued, in a very characteristic fashion, to reflect on the media-technological foundations that shape the various forms of rationality and, more importantly, the genesis and rise of modern rationality, he did not analyse and discuss the degree to which his <italic>own</italic> theory and his <italic>own</italic> narrative of the history of reason were indebted to the history of machines. In terms of the history of fascination under discussion here, Luhmann’s systems theory is the purest, most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what I have called the 20th-century’s epochal technological shift of meaning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412438592">Hörl, 2010</xref>). At the risk of over-simplifying matters, let me phrase this as concisely as possible: Luhmann’s theory, no doubt, conceptually incorporates the massive technological transformation it depends on. The problem is its denial of this very dependence. The theory fully registers and reacts to the momentous technological change, yet it represses the fact that it was <italic>itself</italic> conditioned by this change. We therefore need to reconstruct and explicate Luhmann’s implicit history of rationality in order to reveal what it denies, for precisely this denial constitutes the most volatile aspect of his account. What will become evident is the degree to which the many descriptions, displaying an eagerness to engage figures of non-triviality, regardless of all they may illuminate and uncover, are part of a cybernetic imaginary that conceals as much as it reveals.</p>
<p>The distinction between trivial and non-trivial machines is one of Heinz von Foerster’s most lasting conceptual contributions to cybernetic discourse. Introduced in the 1970 essay ‘Molecular Ethology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412438592">von Foerster and Poerksen, 2002</xref>: 133–68), as part of his critique of the adaptionist behaviourism of early cybernetics, this frequently invoked distinction was as important to von Foerster’s epistemological and ethical arguments as it was to the subsequent elaboration of what came to be known as second-order cybernetics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276412438592">Schmidt, 1996</xref>: 385ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412438592">Brier, 2005</xref>). Luhmann left no doubt about its significance: ‘Von Foerster’s distinction between trivial (reliable) and non-trivial (unreliable) machines is now a frequent quote. All higher forms of life, consciousness and social communication systems are non-trivial machines. This led to a second-order cybernetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1997b</xref>: 362).</p>
<p>However, we should first take note of the fact that von Foerster is dealing with conceptual rather than actual machines. Unlike other cybernetic pioneers such as Grey Walter, Ross Ashby, Norbert Wiener, or Stafford Beer, von Foerster never built any physical machines (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412438592">Glanville, 2007</xref>). To him ‘[t]he term “machine” represents an abstract framework for speaking about input and output relationships and rules of transformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412438592">von Foerster and Poerksen, 2002</xref>: 53). In a decisive move, these relationships and rules and transformations are embodied each in their own way by two fundamentally different types of machine: trivial and non-trivial. The former is ‘characterized by a one-to-one relationship between its “input” (stimulus, cause) and its output (response, effect)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412438592">von Foerster, 2003</xref>: 208). ‘This invariant relationship’ – following Alan Turing, its logical-mathematical properties rather than its physical embodiment – ‘is “the machine’” (2003: 208). Given that this relationship is once and for all determined, von Foerster also refers to it as a determinist and, from the point of view of an external observer, completely predictable system.</p>
<p>By contrast, non-trivial machines are ‘quite different creatures’. The input-output relation is described as ‘not invariant’ because it is determined by ‘the machine’s previous output. In other words, its previous steps determine its present reactions’ (2003: 208). Owing to this recursive structure the complex behaviour of non-trivial machines, though synthetically determined, renders them in principle, or at least in practice, analytical non-predictable systems.</p>
<p>For von Foerster the two machine types embodied corresponding epistemological programmes that modeled cognitive relationships as either trivial or non-trivial. Orthodox epistemology was deemed trivial since it was based on the assumption of a sovereign subject capable of a complete analytical determination of a strictly separate object as part of an exhaustive description of the world. Non-trivial epistemology, which according to von Foerster was still in its infancy and in need of future elaboration, was by contrast characterized by a revocation of the primacy of this idealized classical observer epistemology. Its point of departure was the conceptualization of the world as a complex network of non-trivial machines of which the observer was always already a part. The classical or first-order observer was replaced by a multitude of second-order observers. Cognition turned from classical representation into a never-ending process of recursive computation that generates descriptions of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412438592">von Foerster, 2003</xref>: 211–27). Elaborating a general <italic>epistemology of non-trivial machines</italic> became the principal goal of von Foerster’s second-order research program (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412438592">Brier, 2005</xref>: 363).</p>
<p>Although von Foerster’s trivial/non-trivial distinction was a strictly systematic affair, it came with a latent historical index. After all, what this distinction entailed only became fully apparent with the arrival of recursively operating machines like Ashby’s homeostat, the research into neuronal networks, and the introduction of computing machines designed to produce non-expected results. It was, strictly speaking, the arrival of non-trivial machines that demanded an epistemological overhaul in the course of which the trivial understanding of the world was replaced by the non-trivial understanding of understanding.</p>
<p>Following in von Foerster’s footsteps, Luhmann – who throughout his oeuvre frequently refers to von Foerster – champions non-trivial machines as the model and epitome of a new form of rationality and gives an historic twist to von Foerster’s systematic distinction as well as to the non-trivial epistemology it entails: he uses the latter to furnish a historical diagnosis according to which we already inhabit the world of those different creatures. While he makes no mention of any technological underpinning, Luhmann deciphers – at least between the lines – modernity, and his own present in particular, as a <italic>transition from a trivial to a non-trivial attitude</italic> and thus the most decisive event in the history of occidental rationality since its Greek inception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276412438592">2</xref></sup> Luhmann views himself as a protagonist in a grand transformation of attitude that leaves Greece behind and appears to be nothing less than the key event in the history of occidental rationalism, marked by the rise of cybernetics and the shift from the trivial world of the first to the non-trivial world of the second observer. Luhmann turns this transformation of attitude embodied by the new cybernetic machines into a veritable metamorphosis of rationality that appears as the very signature of modernity. His theory project amounts to an apologetics for this transformation – even though, characteristically, it remained silent about its technological conditions.</p>
<p>In a peculiar recapitulation of late 19th-century sociology (and in odd harmony with Heidegger’s cybernetics-inspired obituary), Luhmann’s theory of science, which came equipped with all the heft of a new culture of science and machines, intoned a farewell to philosophy. The latter was no more than a guardian of the antiquated trivial epistemology which – and this is a core element of the fascination exerted by non-trivial machines – had apparently already been demolished by second-order cybernetics. But Luhmann, the Latinist with a passion for Roman law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1987: 130</xref>), went a step further and demanded that in line with the end of philosophy we also bid farewell to Greece, the glorified mother country of all trivial theory. This vast theoretical and discursive project of leaving behind both philosophy and Greece, a departure from venerable European concepts of thought and understanding, constitutes the basic feature of Luhmann’s research programme. Shaped by contemporary technological conditions, Luhmann was struggling, as it were, to arrive at a historically and systematically viable account of the shock administered by the momentous change of machines. The latter fueled his revision, indeed his denial of the well known early history of theory, which in his eyes amounted to a mere prehistory. Backed by the facts and proofs of a non-trivial cultural revolution of science and technology, Luhmann adopted an anti-philosophical stance from which Germany has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>In the hard anti-philosophical politics of knowledge that shape the mood and thrust of Luhmann’s history of rationality, the non-trivial machine does not merely function as the central model of a post-philosophical epistemology. It is above all the carrier of post-ontological aspirations that fuel Luhmann’s own work as well as the whole techno-scientific optimism of the second half of the 20th century. ‘The dominant attitude of Old Europe’, Luhmann laconically concludes his grand investigation, ‘can be described with the term ontology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438592">1997a</xref>: 895). Ontology was said to be ‘the result’ of an inimitably plausible, that is, trivial, ‘mode of observation that starts with the distinction between being and non-being and from which all other distinctions follow’ (1997a: 895).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276412438592">3</xref></sup> It was the core ingredient of the trivial machinery, its enduring cognitive distillate and principal tagline for a trivial understanding of the world whose time had long since expired under advanced technological conditions. This verdict was reserved for all ontological assertions that professed to be more than Quinian worlds of reference, or that claimed to amount to more than either the implicit ontological consequences of our conceptual schemata or the unavoidable residue of our theoretical frameworks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276412438592">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A certain anti-ontological affect may already have been at work in the techno-scientific self-promotion campaigns and the increased importance of epistemological questions in the late 19th century, but it did not gain full force until the arrival of our current technological conditions, above all in the shape of the new cybernetic paradigm. Basic terms like complexity, emergence, recursion, structural coupling, operational closure, and autopoiesis, to name the major passwords of non-triviality that still enjoy wide circulation today, were seen not only as epistemic facts evoked by a new culture of machines but also as an expression of ineluctable epistemological facts that remain out of reach of any trivial ontology lacking sufficient complexity. The breathless forays directed against all alleged primary evidence produced by trivial world understanding as well as against any desire for ontology, which upon closer inspection appear to be rear-guard actions undertaken in the wake of new cybernetic evidence, belong to the very core of Luhmann’s theoretical oeuvre. His anti-ontology is firmly rooted in the unquestioned discursive presuppositions of his cybernetic, or rather neocybernetic age. Non-trivial rationality is, as it were, the form of the cybernetic age. At least, this is, in my opinion, the implicit punchline of Luhmann’s diagnostic self-understanding.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412438592"><title>Machinic Deconstructions of Ontology</title>
<p>To return to Luhmann’s argument, to speak of a basic recursivity of science is to indicate a ‘very simple matter with far-reaching consequences’. It is simple because ‘recursivity … in general refers (for instance, in mathematics) to the repeated application of operations to the result of similar preceding operations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1990</xref>: 275). When we describe science as a system, the notion of recursivity implies that despite indisputable structural couplings with its environment, science remains operationally closed. In other words, down to its very foundations, science is ‘the result of its own operations’ (1990: 273), since ‘the system only recognizes its own operations as occasions for changing its own states’ (1990: 277). Recursive operations reveal science as a prime example for the modern autonomy of function. Viewed as a recursive system science performs and embodies the basic modern demand for an ‘autonomy of separate functional areas’ enabled and enforced by ‘[m]odern society’s form of differentiation’, which is itself ‘accomplished by the differentiation of certain operationally closed, autopoietic systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 63).</p>
<p>According to Luhmann, the recursive system called science appears to behave exactly like a non-trivial machine. It finds itself in a given ‘historically determined initial state’ and operates in a ‘past-dependent’ and ‘structure-determined’ manner that by virtue of its complexity and selective connectivity is open to the future and non-predictable. In other words, the science machine ‘finds itself in exactly that state (and in no other) which it has reached by way of its own operations. The transformations from state to state presuppose structures determining which state can be reached without the system breaking apart (that is, without a disintegration of the relationship to its environment)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1990</xref>: 279).</p>
<p>These structural features are particularly important for the specific temporality that characterizes the recursive operations of the science machine. The beginning or origin of a problem and an utterance, we are told, may ‘soon be forgotten’ (1990: 272), that is, lost in recursive loops. What is ultimately important for the operations of the non-trivial science machine is that ‘in any given situation’, regardless of how things may have been before, it can ‘<italic>reactualize</italic> the history of the system’ (1990: 274; emphasis added) with the help of a specific code – namely, the distinction between true and false. According to Luhmann, this ability to reactualize is to be literally understood as an originary reactualization in the sense of an essential supplementarity. It stands behind the evolutionary process of science. Regardless of its initial state, science should at any given point in time be able to reactualize its own history in order to mobilize it for selective connective operations. Feedbacks, recursive fallbacks, and even anticipations are always at work in the operation of the science machine (1990: 559). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann speaks in this context of ‘recursive evolution’ (1990: 280)</xref>. ‘Science’, he pointedly writes with reference to Heinz von Foerster, ‘is a historical machine that with every change of state becomes another machine’ (1990: 284).</p>
<p>Reactualization, the temporal mode of recursion, is said to not only characterize the evolution of the science machine but also, and especially, the temporality of its scientific coding operations. This specific temporality enables an autonomous history of science as a system that operates at a certain remove from the world. As we shall see, it also provides the basis for the historicity of science, locating it within the history of rationality. According to Luhmann, these coding operations facilitate a departure from the object, interrupting the real presence of whatever happens to appear. As a result, the time of science came to be seen as a ‘self-emergent form of the determination of meaning’ no longer linked to an ‘ontological scheme’ that stuck to the presence of things and merely repeated the trivial everyday experience of the ‘presence of the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1990</xref>: 261). According to this model, the meaning of the non-trivial science machine resides in its destruction of the trivial meaning of the world. It does away with the intrusive quotidian relationships to things that ontological world explications are said to perpetuate. After all, ‘ontology is (in comparison to everything we nowadays undertake in physics and logic) much closer to the quotidian verisimilitude – but more beautiful, festive and reflective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1997a</xref>: 912). Science, then, is a process of reactualization characterized by an essentially non-ontological relationship to the world – especially if you, like Luhmann, consider all ontology to be a metaphysics of presence. In Luhmann’s reading science appears as a massive counter-ontological offensive that foils all naïve and originary fixations on being and presence and instead proceeds to lead the way out of the ontological cave. With their significant interruption of the direct relationship between thought and being that is said to be the basic configuration of the ontological approaches to the world, scientific coding operations always remain incomplete and subject to open systemic history. The core of the never-ending task of science was to bring about a radical de-ontologizing of our relationship to the world and thus to produce distance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276412438592">5</xref></sup> Science, then, is not just one of many non-trivial machines (according to Luhmann all social systems are such machines). The grand severance of ontological word references and the expulsion of presentist metaphysics it brings about (a diagnosis, incidentally, that moves Luhmann into close proximity to Bachelard) ensures that science fulfils a special – to be precise, de-trivializing – function in the history of rationality.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412438592"><title>Cyberneticizing Husserl: On the Birth of the Non-trivial Attitude</title>
<p>The science machine’s never-ending task of de-ontologizing, which constitutes its first non-trivial aspect, was also placed in the far more comprehensive framework of a history of rationality in order to provide a historical marker for the appearance and function of non-triviality as such. Science was not only deemed to be an essential part of the process of modernization that brings about the transfer from trivial to non-trivial conditions. It also had to modernize itself by removing all its intrinsic, increasingly antiquated trivial conceptualizations. One of the main goals of this auto-modernization was to raise <italic>de iure</italic> the traditional epistemological understanding stemming from a philosophical idea of science to the complex level of the contemporary conditions on which the autonomous functional system science was <italic>de facto</italic> already operating. This meant first and foremost that science had to rid itself of all possible ontological inscriptions and become a pure theory devoid of all explicit and implicit statements on the being of something. Luhmann viewed the conceptualization of a non-trivial science machine as a valid and timely ‘post-ontological option’ (1990: 280).</p>
<p>Under complex modern conditions it no longer appeared possible to adhere to the obsolete, deeply traditional, and ontologically oriented approaches of science by furnishing a ‘description of the world as an object given to (or “standing opposed to”) the observer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 71) – as it had behooved <italic>theoria</italic> since the time of the Greeks. ‘Science can no longer comprehend itself as a representation of the world as it is’, Luhmann continued, ‘and must therefore retract its claim of instructing others about the world. It achieves an exploration of possible constructions that can be inscribed in the world and, in so doing, function as forms, that is, produce a difference’ (2002a: 71).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276412438592">6</xref></sup> In other words, science ‘must refrain from defining the world for society’ (2002a: 63) and from depicting the world as such. Instead it had to dismantle all ‘primary evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">1990</xref>: 328), the evidence of observable objects and a describable world as well as the evidence of the obsolete theoretical attitude that insists on a privileged observation. Science had to advance, as it were, against its own Greek <italic>ur-</italic>scene.</p>
<p>This demand for an expulsion of the profoundly trivial spirit from the sciences was supported by a powerful construct derived from the history of rationality. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, the ‘discontent over the modern culture of knowledge’ (1990: 328)</xref> that had emerged since the beginning of the 20th century – for instance, in complaints about the loss of reference, the waning of experience or the disappearance of the life-world – was merely an expression of a not yet understood change of attitude. It arose from the scientifically supported transformation of being from a pre-modern trivial, mono-contextural world to the conditions of a non-trivial, polycontextural world. Especially in the intense engagement with Husserl’s critique of science on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the latter’s Viennese lecture on sciences, Luhmann highlighted the new non-trivial conditions that mandated a departure from Old European ways of thinking. The new state of science, which according to Luhmann had long since superseded the ‘communicative situation’ underlying Husserl’s diagnosis of a European spirit threatened by technology, was described as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The natural sciences, from physics to biology, have become self-reflexive. They are concerned with objects that observe themselves … The fiction of a reality that exists free of cognition already had to be given up with Heisenberg; and if such a reality does exist, it does not display any qualities to which an observation could latch on … For the time being, let us merely note that for such cognitions, contrary to what Husserl maintained, <italic>Geist</italic> is not necessary. Rather, they arise out of the universalization of projects of cognition in the natural sciences, and hence out of a program that compels autologies, self-applications – or that remains incomplete in its world-intention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 36)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The autological departure from the last great figure of the observer, the transcendental subject of intuition equipped with its own world-intentionality, which had received a massive boost from Heisenberg’s discovery of the problems associated with the observer, appeared to be part of the modern shift into polycontexturality:<disp-quote>
<p>Modern society is a polycentric, polycontextural system. It applies completely different codes, completely different ‘frames’, completely different principal distinctions according to whether it describes itself from the standpoint of religion or the standpoint of science, from the standpoint of law or the standpoint of politics, from the standpoint of pedagogy or the standpoint of economics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 52)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Though he makes no mention of the new technological conditions in the shape of a/the non-trivial culture of machines, Luhmann asserts that the transition to polycontextural configurations of observation and meaning enforces a shift from a trivial to a non-trivial mindset.</p>
<p>The changed situation that separates Luhmann’s clarifications of the new epistemological conditions from Husserl’s diagnosis of a crisis becomes most apparent in the context of the re-evaluation and reconceptualization of that pivotal event in the history of rationality that had been on Husserl’s mind when, in the 1930s, he attempted to employ his notion of the life-world to recast the sciences. As is known, Husserl reconstructed the rise of ‘a <italic>new sort of attitude</italic> of individuals toward their surrounding world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412438592">Husserl, 1970</xref>: 276) that took place in the sixth and seventh century BC in Greece. He described the significant change of attitude which altered the ‘spiritual shape of Europe’ (1970: 289) and which was now said to be threatened by the modern processes of technologization and formalization. Husserl spoke of the birth of a ‘theoretical attitude’. He saw it as the origin of an ideality that now, faced with a critical loss of meaning to technological procedures and a momentous shift of meaning, was more relevant than ever. ‘With the first conception of ideas’ that occurred back then, ‘man gradually becomes a new man’ (1970: 277).</p>
<p>‘Humanity’ – this was the basis of the argument – ‘in its historical situation, always lives under some attitude or other. Its life has its norm-style and, in reference to this, a constant historicity of development’ (1970: 280). The ‘norm-style of human existence’, which Husserl took to be a ‘first type of historicity’, was the so-called ‘natural primordial attitude of original natural life’ that appeared to be ‘naïvely, straightforwardly directed at the world’ (1970: 281). Though present as a ‘universal horizon’, the world was not ‘thematic as such’ (1970: 281). It is only when the theoretical attitude replaces the natural and introduces a new style of existence that ‘[m]an becomes gripped by the passion of a world-view and world-knowledge’ and turns into ‘a nonparticipating spectator, surveyor of the world; he becomes a philosopher’ (1970: 285). To ‘strive for and bring about <italic>theōria</italic> and nothing but <italic>theōria</italic>’ (1970: 280) was for Husserl the main slogan of the new program of ‘world-knowledge through pure, universal seeing’ (1970: 285).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276412438592">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412438592">Husserl, ‘the outbreak of the theoretical attitude’ (1970: 285)</xref> did not only give rise to a ‘new cognitive stance’ but also to a ‘far-reaching transformation of the whole praxis of human existence’ (1970: 287). Philosophy was assigned an ‘archontic’ function which it was now, in the crisis of rationality around and after 1900, once again called to fulfil. Ever since the momentous Greek transformation philosophy had acted as the guardian of the theoretical attitude. In Husserl’s eyes, its very platonic present-day task lay in the reflection on and remembrance of that <italic>ur</italic>-scene of the sciences. The latter were to reside under the roof of philosophy and no place else. This was the initial program of philosophy as a ‘universal science’ that now, in the face of foundational crises, was to be reactivated using phenomenological means. The ‘completely new beginning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412438592">Husserl, 1970</xref>: 239) Husserl called for in the 1920s proved to be a repetition of the beginning of all <italic>theoria.</italic></p>
<p>In a peculiar way, Luhmann’s reconstruction of the history of rationality reconfigures Husserl’s historically sweeping, though evidently obsolete, doctrine of attitude. The early spectator theory employed by Husserl – despite the fact that ‘already in his time it had little chance of a future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 54) – to counter the technologically induced crisis of reason proved to be hopelessly antiquated in the age of non-trivial machines and their inscrutable complexity. In Luhmann’s eyes the range of that comprehensive change of attitude which Husserl, faced with the whole non-idealist technological mobilization, had so emphatically conjured up was pretty limited. The Greek transformation was at best the beginning of a long-lasting process of change that, as a history of European rationality, only hit its home stretch in the 20th century. The birth of the theoretical attitude had occurred, as it were, within the horizon of the trivial attitude and its characteristic observer position. It was the new autonomy of the sciences – that is, their exodus from the world of philosophical spectators that had restricted them to trivial world observations – and above all the invention of the non-trivial machine that brought about a truly dramatic change of attitude. Husserl may have highlighted an important occurrence in the history of rationality, but for Luhmann the pivotal event was not the onset of the theoretical but <italic>the onset of the non-trivial attitude</italic>. Its immediate offspring was systems theory. And this, precisely, was Luhmann’s chief concern: to transform a theoretical attitude still bound to trivial acts of observation in such a way that it would give birth to a wholly un-Greek, non-trivial <italic>theoria</italic>.</p>
<p>Luhmann’s theory project, especially its remarkable take on the history of rationality, clearly fell in line with Husserl’s ambitious renewal venture. The guiding interest behind the systems-theoretical reformulation of the phenomenological project, however, no longer entailed a return to the beginning but a search ‘for a form in which the unconditional theoretical interest accepted under the name of philosophy can be continued in the face of changed conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 37). The goal, in Luhmann’s trenchant formulation, was to introduce ‘Husserl’s intuition of theory into a completely different “lifeworld’” (2002a: 56) – a technological and thoroughly cybernetic lifeworld, no less, shaped by non-trivial machines. <italic>Epoché</italic> now stood for the bracketing of all trivial preconceptions of thought such as subject, spirit and, in particular, all the obsolete figures of ontological world descriptions. Intentionality now was the name for ‘the form in which consciousness carries out its operations’ (2002a: 44) and had to be described in terms of self- and hetero-reference. And lifeworld, according to Luhmann one of the century’s most consequential neologisms, now referred to the irreducible ‘referential context of all familiar condensates of meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1986</xref>: 182). The lifeworld distinction of familiar versus unfamiliar appeared to be ‘the oldest, most primitive and primordial difference because it pertains to <italic>any</italic> given distinction’, yet under polycontextural conditions it was no longer possible to fall back on ‘the distinction familiar vs. non-familiar as if it were a distinction, let alone a foundational one’ (1986: 186; emphasis added).</p>
<p>The clarity of Luhmann’s motto left nothing to be desired: ‘[T]ranscendental philosophy [has to be described] anew by the modern means of the theory of self-referential systems or by means of second order cybernetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">2002a</xref>: 59). In other words, a contemporary theory design had to be on par with the non-trivial attitude. The brand names embodying this new attitude included ‘formal calculus; second-order cybernetics; the theory of closed, “autopoietic” systems; or radical constructivism’ (2002a: 53). And rather than residing under the roof of a philosophy that acted as a universal science, they originated from mathematics, biology, neurophysiology, automata theory, linguistics – in short, from a whole array of theories that, starting in the 1950s, emerged from under the new roof of first- and especially second-order cybernetics and that, in the very way they operated, condensed the form of non-trivial rationality.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276412438592"><title>Exits from the Cave: Observing Technology</title>
<p>Luhmann relentlessly pursued a distancing from tradition that appeared to correspond to the new conditions. One of his most concise reckonings is the essay ‘European Rationality’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276412438592">8</xref></sup> Arguably Luhmann’s most beautiful and precise treatise on the end of philosophy, it locates all ontology as antiquated messages from the Old European world of trivial observations. It is no more than a remnant and a survival of a long vanished stage of European rationality which remained tied to a history of observers.</p>
<p>‘The history of European rationality can be described as the history of the dissolution of a rationality continuum that had connected the observer in the world with the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 23). For Luhmann, the assumption of a convergence of thought and being, which had sustained ontology from Parmenides all the way to Heidegger (that is, the occidental Parmenidian variations, as Heidegger himself observed), was at the very core of the early European, initially Greek belief in a continuum of rationality ‘that always already merged thought and being in a common origin’ (1990: 321). The structural increase in complexity, that is, the loss of the ‘parallel views of a unified world’ (1998: 28) and the corresponding increase of observer positions, was said to have rendered untenable the notion of a privileged point of ontological world observation that allowed for a unifying, certain and binding perception of being. The privileged philosophical observer of being from bygone trivial days, who like Husserl assumed that ‘anybody can see what I see’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412438592">Husserl, 1989: 77</xref>), was replaced by the observer of an observer as the bearer of the new, non-trivial attitude. He appears as the central conceptual persona in the age of non-trivial machines; on his shoulders rests the renunciation – so characteristic of the epistemological politics of systems theory – of the philosophical-ontological assumption that we can see and survey the world.</p>
<p>As Luhmann was able to gather from the work of the cyberneticist Gotthard Günther, the two-valued ontological guiding distinction between thought and being or being and non-being did not only manifest itself in the classical two-valued logic as the principal instrument of trivial world description. Together with the two-valued logic it also found expression in a pre-modern, that is to say archaic and stratified, formation of society whose residues, Luhmann claimed, still cling to us in the shape of interminable two-valued and above all ontological world descriptions:<disp-quote>
<p>Historically, we can see a distinct correlation between the traditional assumption of an ontologically describable world – that is, a world describable with the aid of the distinction between being and nonbeing – and a two-valued logical instrument. This assumes a society in which differences between different world and social descriptions are not all that great and can be decided from incontrovertible reference points from the top or the center of the system. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 28)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Whatever non-trivial theoretical intuition it may have possessed from time to time, philosophy was burdened by its trivial ontological inheritance. In addition, it appeared to be nothing less than a pre-modern instrument of power, as indicated by its systematic handling of distinctions. It consistently displayed a preference for distinctions with inbuilt asymmetry that allow ‘the person who has the positive side of the distinction at his or her disposal [to] make him- or herself master of both sides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 39). Subject to polycontextural conditions, however, ontology could be no more than a remnant from the age of ‘the principle of a universally valid rationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 24) when it still seemed ‘self-evident that all observers have to be observed in the same way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 26). Without the agreed-upon condition ‘that the world is the same for all observers and that it can be determined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 26), Luhmann argued, there was no possibility of a consistent and meaningful discourse on being, that is, no ontology.</p>
<p>Thus the end of the two-valued ontological world rationalization was supposed to culminate in the ‘shift from “what” questions to “how” questions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 26). From the point of view of a systems theory informed by second-order cybernetics, the general transformation from philosophical questions of essence that did not for a second doubt the continuum of thought and being and the complete determinability of the latter, to a drift into an age of relational questions of complexity and indeterminacy that are part of the domain of sociology, revealed the ongoing dissolution of the continuum of rationality. Ontology, in short, was to Luhmann the theoretically most potent and enduring figure of trivial world narration. To quote Heinz von Foerster, it basically belonged to the ‘great love affair of Western culture for trivial machines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412438592">von Foerster, 2003</xref>: 310). It was, as it were, the pre-modern school of trivialization whose time was coming to an end as science came to doubt its love. Ontology – and with it philosophy – appeared as trivial fates of rationality.</p>
<p>This, in any case, is the systems-theoretical version of the end of ontology. By giving rise to complexity and securing the final disappearance of a unified observer perspective, the history of European rationality disposed of ontology itself as the first major European form of rationality. The end of ontology therefore appeared as an originally European event. The very term ‘Europe’ was to refer to the gradual dismantling of the ontological world view, that is to say, the dismantling of its own origins in the Greek hell of triviality. As Luhmann would have it, the signature of Europe was its auto-deconstructive constitution, for though Europe may have ensured the mastery of the trivial world view – that was, so to speak, the meaning of the grand European semantics – ‘only Europe has [also] brought forth worldwide social descriptions that reflect the experience of a radical, structural, transformation of society since the late Middle Ages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1998</xref>: 22) and thus abolish its own origins.</p>
<p>If philosophy, that old European institution, was to have any future at all, it had to leave behind all forms of ontological thought and terminate the hegemonic discourse politics it had pursued since early European days: ‘Critique – that only means, anymore, observing observations, describing descriptions from a standpoint that is itself observable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002a</xref>: 37). Above all it had striven for ‘a subtler language … that functions even under polycontextural conditions’ (2002a: 53). There was, Luhmann argued, strictly speaking no alternative to the new critical emphasis on ‘redescriptions of descriptions’ that refrain from all conclusive formulas. They ‘rank among the characteristic features of the modern descriptions of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438592">2002a</xref>: 59) that correspond to the intellectual habitus of modern societies. ‘[T]he continual new description of redescriptions’ was the only option for a society that was no longer willing to cling to old descriptions, but instead perceived ‘the prospect of further new descriptions of its own concepts as its future’ (2002a: 60). <italic>Redescription</italic> – that is the new epistemological password in the age of non-triviality and the new form of European meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276412438592">9</xref></sup> However, this new intellectual style consisting of ongoing description should not be confused with thinking.</p>
<p>Luhmann claimed that, unlike philosophy, modern science had already left the world of the first observer behind. Science, conceived as a recursive system, pointed toward a post-ontological form of world description that corresponded to the complex world of the second observer which followed the dissolution of the rationality continuum. The only thing missing was to give full epistemological credit to this form, even against the resistance of orthodox, ontologically fixated cognitive relations. Precisely this expulsion of all apparitions of trivial thought appeared to be the order of the day and, in particular, that of systems theory. Or, in Heinz von Foerster’s own words: ‘The task at hand is: de-trivialization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412438592">von Foerster, 1984</xref>: 13). The crossover from a world of direct observations which relied on unproblematic distinctions and simply focused on <italic>what</italic> was being distinguished rather than <italic>how</italic> these operations were performed, to one in which observations are observed, that is, to observing one’s own operations of distinctions and indications and thereby doing away with any reference to outside, external conditions, or a supporting world – this crossover appeared to be in line with the history of rationality by representing the immediate consequence of the shift from a monocontextural to the plural constitution of a polycontextural world. Spencer Brown’s logic of re-entry, which took the basic act of observation to be the operative unity of distinction and indication, marked the spot where Europe, or the process of Europeanization, was to come round to itself. ‘It could be’, Luhmann wrote in what amounts to a fundamental historico-philosophical statement, ‘that the central question of European rationality is hidden in the re-entry of the form into the form’ (1998: 32). The logic of re-entry models recursive operations, and Luhmann’s entire history of occidental rationality was geared toward their appearance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must note in passing that Luhmann, too, did not escape the long reach of Old European ontology and its metaphysical program. On the contrary, he remained firmly in its grip: In one vital regard Luhmann’s non-trivial program is subject to the ‘Platonism effect’ described by Derrida as the grand generator of occidental metaphysics. Derrida identified the interruption of ‘the communication between two opposing values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412438592">Derrida, 1981</xref>: 98) of a difference as the core of Plato’s philosophical politics, that ever since has determined the occidental handling of differences. He further emphasized that within the network of oppositions that organize the regime of Platonism as well as Plato’s own text, one specific opposition is assigned a privileged structural significance. In order for the opposing values to be opposed in the first place and initiate the strict regime of opposition, ‘each of these terms must be simply external to the other, which means that one of these oppositions (the opposition between inside and outside) must already be accredited as the matrix of all possible opposition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412438592">Derrida, 1981</xref>: 103). Precisely this Platonic matrix of inside and outside is celebrated by Luhmann as the great post-ontological option that moves us into ‘a different’, no longer old, European ontological world:<disp-quote>
<p>In ontologically altogether implausible fashion the primary distinction between being and non-being is replaced by the distinction between inside and outside or that between the self-reference and hetero-reference of the observer. According to this new version there first of all needs to be an observer present before he can draw the distinction between being and non-being. But there is no metaphysical or logical rule for the choice of primary distinction, there are only socio-historical plausibilities, among them a modern interest in de-ontologizing the world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1997a</xref>: 911)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Ever since Plato the ‘ontologically altogether implausible’ distinction between inside and outside, which under current non-trivial conditions assumes the rank of a ‘primary distinction’, resulted in an ostracization of the technical as the merely external, with all the associated negative ascriptions of exteriority such as death, artificiality, absence of creativity, and lack of knowledge. Philosophy was shaped by this exteriorizing marginalization; it was the very core of the traditional philosophical politics of – more precisely, <italic>against</italic> – technology. Granted, Luhmann’s inside/outside distinction is <italic>operative</italic> rather than substantial – and, following George Spencer-Brown, it allows for a switching of sides – but it nonetheless remains a rigorous, impermeable distinction (otherwise concepts like structural coupling would make little sense). Maybe Luhmann’s prominent use of this central distinction, which served to marginalize the technical object, highlights a certain forgetfulness of the technical that secretly ties him to Old European semantics. Indeed, one of the more significant features of Luhmann’s theory is the fact that technology, in particular digital technology, is always, so to speak, an outsider. In systems-theoretical terms, however, technology is not just the outside of a given system, it is external to system-environment couplings. It is indifferent, that is to say, it is part of that side which forms the environment of systems but is unable to irritate them and trigger internal processes of self-determination (though it is capable of destroying systems) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412438592">Esposito, 2001</xref>: 242).</p>
<p>No doubt the question concerning technology and its forgetting in Luhmann’s oeuvre requires an extensive analysis. To what extent does his observation of technology re-enact the occidental marginalization of the technical? Indeed, where exactly is the current, contemporary question concerning technology located within Luhmann’s theory edifice? In light of ubiquitous computerization and the network-based emergence of intelligent environments, which increasingly undermine the distinction between machines and media and give rise to the possibility of a structural coupling of computers and cognition, these questions are not only of great importance to systems theory and its future design but also serve to foreground the foundational importance of non-trivial machines for that theory’s conceptual apparatus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0263276412438592">10</xref></sup> Without addressing these issues, any attempt to deal with the history of fascination exerted by non-triviality remains incomplete. Such an analysis, however, will have to be conducted elsewhere. But to provide a few hints: On the one hand, Luhmann insists on abandoning the ‘traditional notion of technology linked to know-how, performance and decision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1997a</xref>: 527). He emphasizes that ‘notions of technology that operate by way of opposing themselves to nature or spirit are no longer of any help’ (1997a: 535). Equally obsolete are attempts to contrast ‘technology and reason or technology and “lifeworld”, and so on’ (1997a: 522). Instead, Luhmann maintains that ‘changing the concept … [should] open up the possibility of seeing new connections’ (1997a: 529). The statement that ‘the evolution of technology’ is followed by ‘a directly corresponding structure of rationality’ (1997a: 519) seems to indicate that he was at least in part aware of the fact that the non-trivial attitude is grounded in changes in machine history as well as in the changing meanings of the technical itself. In view of the proliferation of non-trivial machines, this statement could have been an opportune point of departure for the reformulating of the question concerning technology in ways which challenge traditional, pre-technological descriptive semantics and maybe even go beyond the obsolete understanding of technology itself. Ideally, this question should have been on a level with the latest stage of technological evolution. Yet despite all attempts to pull clear from tradition, Luhmann’s description of technology remains caught in a bygone dogmatic view. Though technology is supposed to enable ‘a coupling of completely heterogeneous elements’ (1997a: 526), it is seen as a ‘rigid (as opposed to loose) coupling’ (1997a: 526). Ultimately, technology refers first and foremost to ‘technical systems’ characterized by ‘causal closure and that … only in certain respects react to environmental inputs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002b</xref>: 95). Despite all the talk about the evolution of technology and the corresponding renunciation of traditional concepts, Luhmann in final analysis invokes the old mechanical notion of technology as a determined, closed machine – an approach that has its roots in a bygone stage of technological evolution. Compare, for example, the many residues of traditional descriptions of technology in Luhmann with Gilbert Simondon’s far more radical evolutionary theory of the technical object which he had been advancing since the late 1950s. Luhmann retains concepts that originated prior to the 20th century, while Simondon’s work focuses on the new age of technical ensembles, open machines, open objects and nets characterized by growing margins of indeterminacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412438592">Simondon, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412438592">2006</xref>).</p></sec>

<p>Luhmann’s attempt to locate – if not hypostasize – the non-trivial attitude in the history of rationality was indebted to a philosophical mentor who had abandoned the camp of poets and thinkers and crossed over to cybernetics: Gotthard Günther. Luhmann probably referred to him – as well as to Heinz von Foerster, who collaborated with Günther at the Biological Computer Laboratory in Urbana<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276412438592">11</xref></sup> – when it came to the scientific alignment of his own post-trivial project. Günther must count as the great philosophical actor of the non-trivial shift, who unlike Luhmann did not conceal the <italic>conditio technologica</italic> of this transformation. He had been concerned with the possible metaphysical significance of the machine-technical revolution as far back as the early 1950s. Günther’s work on the formal and ontological consequences of this transformation reveal the technological shift of meaning that is also evident in Luhmann’s project, though even in the case of Günther it still appears, in the words of Klaus Heinrich, to be a history of fascination with its share of blindness and infatuation. More than others, Günther was under the influence of and transfixed by the new machine which he, however, called <italic>trans-classical</italic> rather than non-trivial. Günther was the first to conceptualize the impact of the new recursively operating cybernetic machines including, first and foremost, the computer on the history of rationality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276412438592">12</xref></sup> Basing himself increasingly on a ‘hard’ machine-theoretical and calculatory foundation, he sought to overcome the long-standing ontological tradition of Western thought – and this is precisely why Luhmann was so passionately interested in Günther’s discussion of polyvalence and polycontexturality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276412438592">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Günther repeatedly described what he called the transition from a classical to a non-classical age and the dawn of a new sense of the world. The guiding difference classical/trans-classical that structured his perception of epochs was based on a solid machine-theoretical foundation. First, in 1952, Günther pinpointed the difference between the Archimedean-classical and the ‘trans-classical or non-Archimedean machine’:<disp-quote>
<p>In the course of technological development man has conceived of two radically different types of machine. The first is the classical-archimedean machine whose purpose is to produce work. It has been joined by the idea of a second machine from which we expect information rather than work. The ‘first’ machine was designed in analogy to the human arm (and hand), the second is expected to be a technological reproduction of the human brain. For only the brain processes information. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412438592">Günther, 1976</xref>: 96)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The new type of machine that ‘has never been there before in the human history of technology’ (1976: 94), and whose origins were just about to become apparent in the birth of cybernetics, was not only poised to shake ‘the sense of the world determined by classical ontology’ (1976: 99). With it, Günther also saw the dawn of a ‘new culture’ and a ‘new idea of science’, even a ‘new occidental man who no longer identifies with the pure forms of classical thought’ (1976: 114). In the wake of the new machine the human condition of being itself appeared to have been changed to a degree that matched the transformation from a primitive level consciousness to that of a high culture.</p>
<p>This metaphysically oriented machine-theoretical observation served to inspire the Hegelian Günther. It provided the basis for the configuration made up of the distinction between classical/trans-classical logic, ontology, science and culture in general that came to characterize Günther’s work on the transformation of the fundamental metaphysical stance associated with the second machine. Starting in the 1950s his comprehensive formal studies on trans-classical calculus were time and again accompanied by a technologically grounded theory of culture that differentiated between one-, two- and many-valued cultures. The meaning of a culture was said to depend mainly on its technological meaning, which was lowered, as it were, into its symbolic order, its worldview and its basic operating procedures and modes of thought, and that, historically speaking, proceeded from primitive tools to classical and on to trans-classical machines.</p>
<p>One-valued cultures were said to be characterized by an archaic state of consciousness in which the latter merges with its environment and does not achieve any separation between soul and thing or subject and object. Primitive tools, Günther argued, revealed this ambivalent structure as well as the unstable form of primitive consciousness in as far as they were ‘half nature and half mind’, that is, ‘materially part of a natural context’ and yet at the same time ‘an artificial form defined by its purpose’ (1976: 92). Only when tools became autonomous and were completely separated from the natural context as well as from the spirit and intention of their creators – and this, Günther pointed out, is the primary meaning of the history of technology – can we speak of the birth of the pure object, of an objective being in the strong machine sense. ‘A machine is nothing but a tool that within certain boundaries has become autonomous’ (1976: 93). The appearance of the machine, therefore, marks a significant rupture. The autonomy of technology was said to create the consciousness of classical two-valued high cultures whose operations were based on machines rather than on tools and that introduced the regime of traditional ontological oppositions, first and foremost that between dead object and live subject. Günther emphasized that in the psychic realm of a dualist culture only that was regarded as subjective and ‘psychic’ which ‘had to be understood in <italic>non</italic>-machinic and <italic>non</italic>-mechanical fashion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412438592">Günther, 1980</xref>: 223). The classical machine shaped the classical regime of meaning to the core. This first machine culture allegedly found its formal expression in the strictly two-valued difference machine known as Aristotelian logic, that is, in its corresponding dualist onto-metaphysics that operated with two values, being and non-being. Furthermore, the classical machine also inaugurated and implemented the long-lasting classical observer along with the associated world of observation.</p>
<p>Supported ‘by new technological means’, trans-classical machines are said to push the formative central ‘boundary between Ego and World ever further back into the background of subjectivity’ and ‘attribute ever more of what emerges from that background to the objective world of things’. Günther had in mind no more and no less than a cultural cleansing brought about by the spirit of the new machine. As he put it, the ‘business of cybernetics’ consisted in ‘demythologizing’ the general classical regime of meaning and its principal mythologem, the distinction between nature and mind, subject and object. Formally this corresponded to a departure from the long-lasting Aristotelian world of the observer that had arisen around the classical machine. A shift in the meaning of machines was said to entail a shift in the meaning of logic away from a two-valued system of propositions that focused on objective being toward a trans-classical calculus of complex self-reflexive processes. According to Günther, the crux of the matter was that the trans-classical machine promotes a truly technological shift of meaning, that is to say, a synchronized shift of technical and logical meaning, and pointed the way out of the classical onto-metaphysical frame of reference.</p>
<p>Already in Günther’s case the predicted exodus from the ‘enclosure of classical thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412438592">Günther, 1978</xref>: viii) on the basis of trans-classical machines amounted to secession from Greece – a philosophical break-up with Athens that Günther’s close reader Luhmann is sure to have noted. Günther, too, saw this as a decisive turning point in the history of rationality, a ‘historical change of climate’ of such magnitude that it equaled the original Greek events. In the first instance the technological shift of meaning revealed to him ‘that the domain of rationality defined by classical axiomatics was surprisingly narrow. Much, much narrower than hitherto assumed’ (1978: viii). The main point was that the conceptualization of rationality and its opposite was to be determined by the machinic realm that characterized cultural and indeed psychic conditions. Günther viewed the destruction of classical axiomatics brought about by the trans-classical machine primarily as a comprehensive ‘correction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412438592">Günther, 1980</xref>: 225) of patterns of rationality that were taken for granted and that, incorrectly, were considered either ineluctable or only to be exceeded at the price of descending into irrationality. Günther already disposed of a machine-based account of the history of rationality that Luhmann completed in grand style, albeit oblivious of all technology.</p>
<p>Günther subsequently tried to advance beyond historical speculations by attempting a calculus-based move into the trans-classical domains of rationality, especially with the help of his logical theory of morphogrammatics and polycontexturality. Beyond Greece, Günther realized, it was no longer a matter of thinking but of computing. In the context of the history of fascination, the crucial point was that the trans-classical machine was explicitly awarded the rank of a ‘mind prosthesis’ which<disp-quote>
<p>reveals problems whose mere existence remains inaccessible to any type of natural thinking unassisted by technology. It is an essential part of natural consciousness not yet supported by cybernetic mind prostheses that it cannot address certain psychic questions simply because it is unaware of the domain of reality in which these questions emerge. (1980: 231)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Günther’s entire transformation theory was sparked by the appearance of the trans-classical machine. As opposed to classical machines they were prostheses in a new sense, that is, no longer organ or body prostheses but nooprostheses modeled on the most complex of all trans-classical machines, the human brain. But when talking about the history of fascination exerted by non-classical machines, we always have to keep in mind that in the case of Günther and Luhmann (and, not to forget, von Foerster) something is suppressed: a mode of thinking that eludes both trivial and non-trivial thought processes – in the words of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari a ‘non-thinking thinking’, as it were, a thinking beyond cognition and recognition.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0263276412438592"><title>Conclusion: Questioning the Neocybernetic Regime of Truth</title>
<p>We have merely touched upon the still unwritten history of the fascination of the trans-classical and the non-trivial machine, as it reveals itself especially in Luhmann’s occidental recursions. Ultimately, it is part and parcel of a process that, in the words of the French mechanologist Gilbert Simondon, may be described as the majorization of the technical object. The latter no longer appears as an object of utility circumscribed by the metaphysical register of a trans-technical or merely instrumental reason; rather, by gaining independence it enforces a fundamental revision of the order of things, of the interpretations of the world and self, and even of our basic understanding of rationality and thinking itself. In terms of this history of fascination, Luhmann’s history of rationality is – despite all the fascinating perspectives it enables – a phantasmal deposit of the great structural transformation of meaning in the course of which the technical object sheds its status as the ostracized object of meaning, located at the zero point of meaning and acting as the embodiment of non-meaning, and instead turns into an exponent of an entirely new constellation of meaning by moving into the very centre of the cultural production of meaning. The process reveals how after an extended period of technophobia the theoretical attitude experiences a technological shock, as a result of which its self-description falls under the spell of the technical object while simultaneously denying it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276412438592">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘Great moments of technological innovation’, Bernard Stiegler writes, ‘are moments of suspension. In its development, the technics that interrupts one state of things imposes another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412438592">Derrida and Stiegler, 2002</xref>: 149). Under technological conditions it is critical to understand the virulence of the technical object and this moment of suspension, to grasp the force exerted by it and take note of the epistemic folds and political strategies it produces. It is critical that we do not simply replace old evidences with new ones which are then regarded as the fate of discourse and rationality. Yet this is precisely what, to a considerable extent, Luhmann’s politics of knowledge as well as his construction of the history of rationality and, especially, his anti-philosophical and anti-ontological strategy and narrative, do.</p>
<p>The <italic>epoché</italic> demanded of us does not involve, as Luhmann claimed, the bracketing of metaphysics. After the destruction of object-centred ontology brought about by Heidegger, Deleuze, Derrida and, finally, Nancy’s co-existential ontology, as well as by the process ontology of Whitehead and others, this is no longer our most pressing problem. Trivial ontology, which Luhmann, backed by a vast history of rationality, decried as an absolutist bastion, was already in his days nothing but a projection of a certain politics of knowledge. The <italic>epoché</italic> called for today involves the bracketing of cybernetic presumptions and their uncritically accepted basic terms – fateful terms that have inaugurated an entire cybernetic (more precisely, neocybernetic) regime of truth. Be it as theory or technology, the spreading ‘cybernetic hypothesis’ has a firm grip on our conceptual politics and self-descriptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412438592"><italic>Tiqqun</italic>, 2001</xref>). It may be necessary to bracket (though not eliminate, avoid or delete), among others, terms like complexity, emergence, autopoiesis, coupling and recursions, all of which characterize the form of non-trivial rationality. Instead we need to find non-technological terms to describe our technological condition.</p></sec>

<fn id="fn1-0263276412438592"><label>1</label><p>I recently edited a media-theoretical collection featuring a broad array of new conceptual attempts to illuminate our techno-medial situation, especially with a view towards a more general ecological perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412438592">Hörl, 2011</xref>). Mark Hansen in particular has provided several descriptions of the new media-technological environment, be it by explicitly appropriating established cybernetic semantics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412438592">Hansen, 2009</xref>) or, as in his most recent contribution, by decisively distancing himself from it (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438592">Hansen, 2011</xref>). In this context see also Luciana Parisi’s attempt to reformulate the eco-technological situation beyond the cybernetic imaginary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412438592">Parisi, 2009</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-0263276412438592"><label>2</label><p>I am indebted to a reviewer who pointed me to an important passage in which Luhmann in passing mentions the technological basis for his use of the term ‘machine’ (‘data-processing machines’). However, in a significant gesture Luhmann immediately adds that this appropriation of the term constitutes a ‘relatively harmless linguistic usage’ as long as it remains clear ‘that this is not a reference to trivial machines, which in completely unchanging ways keep transforming input into output, but to non-trivial machines executing recursive operations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1990</xref>: 402).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-0263276412438592"><label>3</label><p>Elsewhere Luhmann provided an even more succinct definition of the trivial condition of all ontology: ‘In our usage of the term, ontology refers to a pattern of observation, that is, a mode of observation based on the distinction between being and non-being. This implies first and foremost that the distinction between being and non-being is and always remains dependent on an antecedent operative separation between observation (or observer) and observed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1997a</xref>: 896).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-0263276412438592"><label>4</label><p>See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412438592">Quine (1961</xref>: 1–19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276412438592">1969: 26–68)</xref>. I am indebted to Elena Esposito, who after reading an early draft of this essay pointed out that Luhmann, of course, had no objections to a relativistic ontology à la Quine. On the contrary, he considered it all but indispensable and restricted his opposition to the absolute, if not absolutist, metaphysical ontology based on the distinction between being and non-being. This is no doubt correct. Even though Luhmann for the main part only spoke of ontology, his criticism was primarily directed at onto-metaphysics. Yet the question arises whether this distinction between absolute and relative ontology is sufficient when it comes to marking the entire ontological problem, and whether there are not other forms of ontological thought that Luhmann always already misses out on.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-0263276412438592"><label>5</label><p>According to Luhmann, the temporality of science is in accord with modern structures of temporalization (on the replacement of the presentist Old European semantics of time by modern temporal consciousness see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1980</xref>: 235–300). Beyond mere chronology, Luhmann conceives of time primarily as a system time produced by the temporalizing of complexity, more precisely, as a dimension of determining meaning and managing complexity. Increasingly complex societies, Luhmann argues, have to ‘further temporalize their complexity and expand their time horizons, they even have to change their concepts of time … because it becomes increasingly inevitable to order complexity in sequence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 1980</xref>: 256). For this reason there exists a strong ‘correlation between social evolution and the structures of temporal consciousness’ (1990: 248). Hence Luhmann’s systems theory can be viewed as an attempt at a fundamental sociology that succeeds an allegedly antiquated fundamental ontology.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn9-0263276412438592"><label>9</label><p>Geophilosophically speaking, however, we should note that redescription represents a watchword of American pragmatism and of Richard Rorty in particular, who (following John Dewey) used it to move beyond observer theory and metaphysical formulas of closure, which he thought indispensable for developing a philosophy that remains open to the future. The concept of redescription, including the theory of non-closure it contains, goes back to Charles Sanders Peirce’s processual sign theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412438592">Hampe, 2006</xref>: 53–75, esp. 60ff.).</p></fn>

In the context of Luhmann’s own perception of the non-trivial shift as focusing on the appearance of the conceptual figure of the observer, Günther is mentioned immediately after von Foerster and even before Maturana (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412438592">Luhmann, 2002b</xref>: 64).</p></fn>
