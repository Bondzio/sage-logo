<abstract>
<p>Emotional and behavioral problems assessed with the <italic>Child Behavior Checklist</italic> (CBCL) were analyzed from 2,739 Dutch children referred to Families First (FF) or Intensive Family Treatment (IFT) from 1999 to 2008, to examine time trends. From the year 2004 onward, six of the eight CBCL-syndrome scales yielded significant decreases from the reference year, 1999. Analyses of statistical interactions indicated that on some scales in later years, younger children and boys scored lower than in 1999, and children referred to FF showed more delinquent behaviors in later years compared with in 1999; whereas, children referred to IFT showed less delinquent behavior than in 1999. These results might be explained by structural changes in the Dutch youth care system, by a huge growth of the number of treated children, by an incident in Dutch youth care, and also by the introduction of new methods of home-based treatment for delinquent youth. An implication of the current results is to consider home-based services more seriously as an alternative for out-of-home placement.</p>

<p>It is a commonly held belief in clinical practice and society as a whole that emotional and behavioral problems of children and adolescents are worsening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611417626">Collishaw, Maughan, Goodman, &amp; Pickles, 2004</xref>). According to this belief, young people today are more troubled by these problems than those in the past. Some studies indeed have found a substantial increase of problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611417626">Collishaw et al., 2004</xref>), but other studies found only minor increases, and few have even found decreases in such problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426611417626">Achenbach, Dumenci, &amp; Rescorla, 2002</xref>). One of the major problems in conducting time-trend research is the use of different assessment instruments. A number of studies used parent and teacher rating scales that have well-established psychometric properties. We will review these studies to examine more conclusive answers.</p>
<p>Verhulst and his colleagues used the <italic>Child Behavior Checklist</italic> (CBCL) and the <italic>Teacher’s Report Form</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611417626">Achenbach, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426611417626">1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426611417626">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>) to assess emotional and behavioral problems of children and adolescents in the Netherlands at different time intervals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426611417626">Verhulst, Van der Ende, and Rietbergen (1997)</xref> found no evidence for strong time trends in parent and teacher reports in a normal 4- to 18-year-old Dutch sample over a period of 10 years (1983–1993). Ten years later, a small increase in parental reports of 6- to 16-year-old Dutch children’s internalizing problems over a period of 20 years was found (1983–2003); however, virtually no increase in teachers’ reports of child problems were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426611417626">Tick, Van der Ende, &amp; Verhulst, 2007</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611417626">Tick, Van der Ende, Koot, and Verhulst (2007)</xref> found decreases on anxious/depressed, internalizing, and total problems in parent reports of 2- and 3-year-old children over a 14-year period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426611417626">Tick, Van der Ende, and Verhulst (2008)</xref> reported mixed results for a sample of 11- to 18-year old normal Dutch adolescents from 1993 to 2003. For boys, some decreases were found, mostly concerning behavioral problems, whereas for girls, some increases appeared in emotional and behavioral problems.</p>
<p>In the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426611417626">Achenbach, Dumenci, and Rescorla (2003)</xref> reported an increase in behavior problems of 7- to 16-year-olds between 1976 and 1989 but reported a decrease in the following 10-year period (1989–1999). In addition, teacher reports showed a worsening of the problems of 11- to 18-years-olds between 1976 and 1989 and a decline between 1989 and 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426611417626">Achenbach et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies have used the Rutter Scales that also gave rise to the <italic>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</italic> (SDQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426611417626">Goodman, 1997</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611417626">Collishaw et al. (2004)</xref> reported results that indicated a substantial increase in adolescent conduct problems over a 25-year period in Great Britain (1974–1999). These authors also found evidence for an increase in emotional problems and mixed evidence for hyperactive behavior. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426611417626">Sourander, Niemelä, Santalahti, Helenius, and Piha (2008)</xref> did not find a significant increase in parent- and teacher-reported behavior problems of 8-year-olds with the Rutter scales in Finland over a 16-year period (1989–2005). Finally, a general review of time trends in children’s and adolescents’ mental disorders by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426611417626">Maughan, Iervolino, and Collishaw (2005)</xref>, using the SDQ, revealed an increase in externalizing problems of adolescents between the late 1970s and the 1980s followed by a decline in the 1990s in the United States. Maughan et al. also noted a small increase in depressive symptoms at the end of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above mentioned results, the answer is still unclear. Of the nine studies, two reported an increase in emotional and behavioral problems over the years, two studies reported no time trends or minor trends, one study reported a decrease, one study reported a decrease for boys and an increase for girls, and three studies reported an increase followed by a decrease during following time periods. Based on these mixed findings, it could be suggested that gender and year of assessment play a role in behavioral time trends. All studies point to methodological weaknesses, which make it difficult to provide conclusive answers. For instance, changing definitions of diagnostic criteria, differences in assessment methods, and variations in official reporting practice may add to inconclusive results. There is also a consensus that to measure changes in problems, similar samples are needed such as using the same assessment procedures over time intervals that are long enough for time trends to take place.</p>
<p>The aforementioned studies pertain to normal population samples. It is striking that studies with samples from a clinical population are scarce; such studies are important for clinicians and policy makers. Information about decreases or increases in referral problems may help in adjusting treatment and policies to changing needs. In an unpublished study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611417626">Veerman and Ten Brink (1998)</xref> reported a slight increase in total problems measured with the CBCL in a Dutch clinic population of residentially and day-treated children with a mean age of 8 years during the years 1986 to 1996. According to their observations, externalizing problems and high scores on the subscales—Delinquent Behavior and Aggressive Behavior—seemed responsible for that increase. In addition, in the Netherlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426611417626">Vegter, Veerman, and De Meyer (2011)</xref> found no increase on any of the scales of the CBCL in a 4- to 18-year-old outpatient population referred for mental health services over a period of 6 years (1999–2005); however, they did find a decrease in social problems during these years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426611417626">Starling, Rey, and Simpson (2004)</xref> investigated parental and self-reports, using the CBCL and Youth Self-Report, of an Australian adolescent clinic cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 4,495). Results revealed that, among others, there were no increases on the Anxious/Depressed subscale over a 21-year period (1966–1986).</p>
<p>Overall, problems of referred children seem to stay relatively stable over time. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426611417626">Duppong Hurley et al. (2009)</xref> reported an increase of psychiatric diagnoses at admission for children in residential care in the United States from 2004 to 2005 compared with 1995 to 1996, with particular regard to disruptive behavior. However, no standardized questionnaires were used; therefore, it is difficult to compare these findings with the previous studies.</p>
<p>The present study examined 10-year time trends in emotional and behavioral problems of children referred to the youth care system in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2008. The main objective was to detect time trends and to study the influence of gender, age, and type of treatment. Many studies to date have rather long intervals between measurement occasions, varying from 6 to 21 years. These long intervals may obscure variations in the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems over the years. To detect these changes, the present study analyzed annual measures.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1063426611417626">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were Dutch youth, aged 4 to 18 years, referred to two types of home-based services offered by three youth care agencies in three provinces in the North and East of the Netherlands: Families First (FF) and Intensive Family Treatment (IFT). FF is an intensive short-term intervention lasting 4 to 6 weeks for families dealing with an acute crisis caused by problematic living conditions such as parenting problems, the parents’ personal problems, behavior problems of the child(ren), parent–child interaction problems, financial problems, and housing problems. Due to these issues, one or more children in the family are at risk to be placed out of home; the goal is to prevent this from occurring. The Dutch FF is modeled after the American Homebuilders model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426611417626">Kinney, Haapala, &amp; Booth, 1991</xref>). Services encompass a range of activities such as case management, education, skill building, cognitive-behavior therapy, and concrete services. In a review of the Washington State Institute for Public Policy programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611417626">Lee, Aos, &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>), programs of the homebuilders were judged to be effective in preventing out-of-home placement. A quasiexperimental Dutch study did show that a year after treatment, 76% of the children live at home, and also child problems and parenting stress decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611417626">Veerman, De Kemp, Ten Brink, Slot, &amp; Scholte, 2003</xref>). IFT is a family-based service offered to families with parenting issues or families with several severe problems (characterized as multiproblem families). Often the removal of a child is perceived as imminent, but the families are not in crisis. IFT was modeled after the Dutch FF program; however, IFT was allowed to last longer (about 6 months); therefore, services are delivered with less intensity. Dutch research showed that child problems and parenting stress significantly decreased during treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611417626">Veerman, De Meyer, &amp; Roosma, 2007</xref>), but there are no figures about the prevention of out-of-home placements. On the basis of anecdotal evidence, it is estimated that the number of children living at home is about the same as with FF.</p>
<p>Part of the treatment of both home-based programs was the use of standardized checklists for parents to rate the nature and severity of child behavior problems and parenting stress. Results of individual checklists were discussed with the parents and were used to set goals and to evaluate treatment progress. In the present study, the data of the checklist for child problem behaviors gathered in the years 1999 until 2008 were used to answer the research questions. Every family which completed at least one checklist at the social worker’s first visit in the given time period was included in the present study. To guarantee the independence of the data, only one checklist per family was allowed; therefore, the checklist filled out for the first admitted child was selected. Furthermore, the checklist filled out by the mother figure was preferred above the checklist filled out by the father figure when both parents had filled out the checklist. The rationale here was that usually the mother figure was the primary caretaker.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 3,650 families referred to the home-based services at the three youth care agencies during 1999 to 2008, 2,739 families of which one of the parents filled out the checklist participated, which gives a participant rate of 75%; 1,482 participants were boys (<italic>M</italic> age = 10 years and 9 months; the mean age of the referred girls was 12 years exactly). Of the referred families, 1,328 were admitted to FF and 1,411 to IFT. Nonresponse was due to families that were admitted to care but that withdrew before the start of the treatment, due to early breakdowns, due to language problems of non-Dutch families, or due to family workers who forgot to administer the checklist. Early breakdowns were caused by families who withdrew from treatment within 3 days after the start of FF and within 6 weeks after the start of IFT. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426611417626">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution of the participants over the two types of treatment and the three participating agencies.</p>

<title>Instrument</title>
<p>As part of the treatment, parents filled out the Dutch translation of the CBCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426611417626">Verhulst, Van der Ende, &amp; Koot, 1996</xref>). The CBCL measures the parent’s perception of competence of the child and his or her emotional and behavioral problems. Only the problem section was used in the present study, which consists of 120 items on problem behaviors occurring during the preceding 6 months of admittance to care. These items cover eight behavioral syndromes, also called narrow-band syndromes: Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior. The first three syndromes are part of the broad-band scale, internalizing problems; the last two scales are part of externalizing problems. The <italic>Total Problem Scale</italic> is an index of all reported problems. Every problem item is scored on a 3-point Likert-type scale: 0 = <italic>completely not true</italic>, 1 = <italic>somewhat or sometimes true</italic>, and 2 = <italic>obviously or often true</italic>. The CBCL has good psychometric properties and is used in numerous population and clinical studies. The reliability coefficients (α) of the eight syndrome scales in the present study ranged from .67 for Thought Problems to .90 for Aggressive Behavior. As the two broad-band scales and the total problem score summarize the information of the narrow-band scale more globally, we will focus our analyses on the latter. Data were collected with two different CBCL versions, the 1991 and the 2001 versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611417626">Achenbach, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426611417626">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>). From the item scores of the 2001 version, the syndrome scales of 1991 were computed and translated into <italic>T</italic>-scores based on the Dutch norms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426611417626">Verhulst et al. (1996)</xref>. The computation of the 1991 scales from the 2001 CBCL items was possible because all the items that were part of the 1991 syndrome scales were also part of the 2001 version. To compute the scales the other way around was not possible because the 2001 version contains new constructed items, which are part of the 2001 syndrome scales but not part of the 1991 version.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1063426611417626">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>With the home-based treatment of the three participating agencies, it is a standard procedure to ask parents to complete the CBCL at the first visit of the social worker at the parent’s home. When the parents filled out the CBCL, the social worker collects the list and takes care of further processing of the data. The next time the social worker visits the parents, he or she discusses the results of the CBCL and sets treatment goals in consultation with the parents. Usually, these treatment goals are deduced from the most salient item scores and scale scores of the CBCL. After being processed at the agencies, the data were sent to the researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1063426611417626">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>We used the CBCL <italic>T</italic>-scores for the current analyses. According to the pre-2001 versions of the American and Dutch manuals, narrow-band scales <italic>T</italic>-scores below 67 were classified as normal scores, <italic>T</italic>-scores between 67 and 70 were classified as borderline range scores, and <italic>T</italic>-scores greater than 70 were classified as clinical range scores. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze time trends and interactions with age, gender, and type of treatment. Separate analyses were conducted on the <italic>T</italic>-scores of the eight narrow-band scales of the CBCL as dependent variables. Year, age, gender, and treatment served as the independent variables. In the analyses, dummy variables were created for the years 2000 to 2008, whereas the year 1999 served as the reference group (Code 0). Age, gender, and treatment were also coded as dummy variables; younger children (4–11), girls, and IFT served as the reference groups (Code 0). For each dependent variable, we computed several hierarchical OLS regression. In the first analysis, we entered the nine dummy variables for the years 2000 to 2008. This allowed us to estimate the influence of year. Next, the interactions between age, gender, treatment, and year were analyzed. This was done by entering each of these factors in three separate analyses as a main factor in a second step, after the dummies for year were entered in the first step (this step was the same for the three analyses). Although our interest did not lie in the impact of these main factors, this step was necessary to enter the interaction terms in the third step. In this third step, depending on the preceding main factor, the interactions of year and age, year and gender, or year and treatment were entered. To keep the family-wise error rate under control and maintain power, a <italic>p</italic> value ≤ .01 was chosen to denote a statistically significant effect.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Before we did the analyses to answer the research question, we looked at the correlation pattern of the eight CBCL-syndrome scales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426611417626">Table 2</xref>). As expected, most of the scales had at least small to medium correlations (range = .20–.50) with each other. Moreover, scales that theoretically and clinically go together (for instance Withdrawn and Anxious/Depressed, or Delinquent Behavior and Aggressive Behavior) had the largest correlations (&gt; .60).</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426611417626">Table 3</xref>, the mean <italic>T</italic>-scores and standard deviations of the eight CBCL-syndrome scales are presented for the year 1999 (the reference group). For all other years, the <italic>B</italic> coefficients are presented, which represent the deviation in <italic>T</italic>-score points from the mean score of the reference group. On a descriptive level, it can be noted that, except for somatic complaints, the mean score on all scales were in the borderline range. The mean for Aggressive Behavior was, in fact, in the clinical range. These are typical scores of a clinical sample. Looking at the coefficients, it can be noted that on six of the eight syndrome scales from the year 2004 onward, significant deviations from the year 1999 appeared. This was most striking for the subscales Anxious/Depressed (all years from 2004 onward) and Social Problems (4 years out of 5 years from 2004 onward). On the Withdrawn subscale, 3 years differed significantly from 1999; on the subscale Attention Problems, 2 years differed significantly from 1999; and on the subscales Thought Problems and Aggressive Behavior, 1 year differed significantly from 1999. All these significant time trends indicate lower scores in later years. Somatic Complaints and Delinquent Behavior did not yield any significant deviations from 1999. As said before, the <italic>B</italic> coefficients are deviations in <italic>T</italic>-score points from the reference year (1999). When we divide these coefficients by the standard deviations of the 1999 scores (see the first row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426611417626">Table 3</xref>), we get an impression of the effect sizes (ESs). All of these standard deviations approached the standard deviation of the normal population, which is 10 points. Dividing the significant coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426611417626">Table 3</xref> (superscripts) by 10, we can see that all but one of the ESs lies between 0.20 and 0.50, which denotes a small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426611417626">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Only the deviation in 2008 on the Aggressive Behavior scale was in the medium range (0.50–0.80).</p>

<p>A total of 13 significant main effects were found for gender, age, and treatment. These effects pertain to the whole sample of the years 1999 to 2008 and are of little interest for the present research questions. As stated in the “Analyses” section, calculation of these effects was a necessary step for calculating the interaction effects we were interested in. Therefore, we have indicated these effects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426611417626">Table 3</xref> but do not discuss them in the text.</p>
<p>A total of 15 significant interactions with year were found. Seven year-by-age interactions appeared on the Withdrawn and Aggressive Behavior Scales. On the Withdrawn Scale, in 2001, 2005, and 2007, younger children scored about 5 to 6 <italic>T</italic>-score points (≈half <italic>SD</italic>) lower than in 1999, whereas, older children scored 1 to 2 <italic>T</italic>-score points lower or higher in these years. The same held for aggressive behavior results during the years 2005 to 2008. Six year-by-treatment interactions appeared on the Delinquent Behavior scale, indicating that in 2001, 2003, and 2005 to 2008, FF produced higher scores (about 2 to 4 <italic>T</italic>-score points) compared with in 1999, whereas during these years IFT produced lower scores compared with 1999 (about 2 to 4 <italic>T</italic>-score points). Finally, two year-by-gender interactions were found. In 2004, boys scored 6 <italic>T</italic>-score points lower on the Anxious/Depressed scale compared with in 1999 and girls scored about the same in both years; on Thought Problems in 2000, boys scored about 4 points lower compared with the 1999 scores, whereas girls scored 3 points higher. Except for the interactions with age on the Withdrawn scale, all these deviations were again indications of small effects (ES &lt; 0.50). The interactions with age on the Withdrawn scale were of medium ES.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, the results of the current study indicated a decrease in the severity of children’s behavior problems as reported by the parents of children referred to home-based services in three provinces of the Netherlands from 1999 to 2008. On three of the eight CBCL narrow-band scales, Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, and Social Problems, a statistically significant decline in scores began in 2004 and remained at about the same level until 2008. On two other scales, interaction effects of year-by-treatment and year-by-age appeared. Compared with 1999, children admitted to IFT showed fewer problems on the Delinquent Behavior scale in 2001 and 2003 and from 2005 to 2008 compared with children admitted to FF. Similar results were also seen on the Aggressive Behavior Scale, as the scores of younger children declined from 2005, whereas, the scores of the older children on this scale remained roughly the same over time. On the three remaining scales, results for Somatic Complaints, Thought Problems, and Attention Problems indicated no or minor changes from 1999 to 2008. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426611417626">Cohen’s (1992)</xref> classification, almost all significant deviations from the reference year denoted a small effect.</p>
<p>These findings correspond with a number of previous studies, for instance those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426611417626">Achenbach et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426611417626">2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611417626">Tick, Van der Ende, Koot, &amp; Verhulst, (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426611417626">Sourander et al. (2008)</xref>, which reported data from nonreferred youngsters, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426611417626">Vegter et al. (2011)</xref>, which reported data from an outpatient group. In these studies, decreases over time were also found. However, the current results are not in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611417626">Collishaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611417626">Tick, Van der Ende, &amp; Verhulst, 2007</xref>) that reported small to moderate increases in behavioral problems in the general population or with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611417626">Veerman and Ten Brink (1998)</xref> who reported a small increase in problems of children in residential and day-treatment centers.</p>
<p>In general, the main trend is unmistakable; behavioral problems of children and adolescents referred to home-based treatment are not worsening, in fact, our results suggest a reduction in problems of several behavioral syndromes. Although the ESs were small, they were consistent on several CBCL scales from 2004 onward. There are a number of developments in Dutch youth care that may be responsible for this effect. First, the Dutch youth care system underwent many structural changes during the first decade of this century, culminating in a revision of the Law on Youth Care, which became operative on January 1, 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426611417626">Nederlands Jeugdinstituut, 2010</xref>). One of the key features of this law was the introduction of a Youth Care Agency (YCA) in all of the 12 Dutch provinces and three major urban regions. This agency functions as the access point to the youth care system as youth and their parents can approach the YCA on their own accord or can be referred by professionals such as general practitioners, social workers, or teachers. Workers in the agency assess requests for assistance and determine what type of care (if any) is required. The YCA has provided the Dutch youth care system with a front door, behind which there is access to home-based, day, residential, and foster care, as the main forms of treatment, which are provided by youth care institutions. Prior to the enactment of the new law, these institutions decided which children and families received which kind of treatment; after the enactment of the law, the YCAs took over this responsibility. Although the 15 YCAs formally began in 2005, their actual establishment started a number of years before. During this period and especially after their formal start, all YCAs were engaged in improving the quality of their decisions by adopting clear and efficient procedures in which risk assessment played a central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426611417626">MOgroep, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426611417626">Ordina, 2005</xref>). In particular, cases with severe behavior problems may have been examined more carefully and, as a result, this may be the reason why these cases were referred to more intensive forms of treatment such as foster care or residential care rather than home-based services.</p>
<p>Second, during the first decade of this century, referrals to youth care experienced an increase. According to the Dutch Social and Cultural Plan Bureau of 1999, our reference year, approximately 40,000 children and adolescents used one of the four main forms of youth care (home-based treatment, day treatment, foster care, or residential care); in 2008, this number increased to more than 80,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611417626">Stevens et al., 2009</xref>). This significant growth may have placed more pressure on the workers in the new YCAs to do a good job or, alternatively, to make no mistakes. The figures of the Dutch Social and Cultural Plan Bureau also indicated that, during the period of our study, the number of youth in day and residential treatment remained consistent, whereas, the number of youth in foster care rose from about 12,500 to 19,500. The number of children receiving home-based treatment showed the most rapid growth and, in 2008, this number was 7 times higher compared with in 1999 (about 6,000 in 1999 compared with almost 40,000 in 2008). Together, with the new decision procedures previously mentioned, this increasing number of cases may have reinforced YCA workers’ attitude to examine cases with severe behavior problems more carefully and, consequently, refer a number of these children to services other than home-based services. Thus, the home-based treatments likely became the preferred choice for youth with less severe problems.</p>
<p>Third, in 2004, the Dutch society was startled by the “Savanna case” (see the internet article about this case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611417626">Edemariam, 2008</xref>). Savanna, a 3-year-old girl was found dead in the boot of a car after having been abused and neglected by her mother. Social workers of YCA had known the child was at risk but failed to act. For the first time in the history of Dutch law, a social worker was charged in criminal court for negligence leading to grievous bodily harm. In response, the court decided the death was not the guardian’s fault; however, the judge censured her for believing her own findings were more important than the findings of others. Youth care services in the Netherlands now recognize two periods: before Savanna and after Savanna. Workers of the YCA who, under the new youth care law, must decide which kind of treatment should be provided, have become afraid to make the wrong decision and, when in doubt, err on the side of caution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611417626">Edemariam (2008)</xref>, who interviewed a number of spokespersons from Dutch youth care agencies, provided anecdotal evidence for this hypothesis. One of her spokespersons said, “The trend has become that it is better to place a child into care than to take any risk whatsoever,” and another said, “Better safe than sorry is the trend now . . . , the emphasis on the safety of the child is more than it was before.”</p>
<p>Fourth, new family treatments, including Multisystem Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, and Intensive Family Therapy for First Offenders, have been introduced into the Dutch youth care system. These interventions are aimed at helping families with a child at risk for delinquency or who actively show signs of such behavioral problems. It might be that, in the overcrowded youth care system of the Netherlands, these new family treatments came just in time to assist families and children with delinquency problems. In particular, it could be that children with these problems are no longer referred to IFT, which may be one explanation for the year-by-treatment interaction effect on the Delinquent Behavior scale.</p>
<p>Taken together, these developments may have been responsible for youth care workers referring cases with more severe behavior problems to more intensive forms of care, particularly foster care. The very existence of the YCA and the development of standardized assessment procedures, including risk analysis, may have increased the awareness of YCA workers concerning the safety of their cases, which in turn would have led them to exercise restraint with referrals to home-based services. The rapid increase in the number of new cases as well as the Savanna case may have also reinforced this attitude. In addition, new family treatments may have functioned as an “outlet” to refer youth with more severe behavioral or delinquency problems. As a result of these developments, during the second half of our research period, youth who were referred to home-based treatment did demonstrate fewer problems compared with previous years.</p>
<p>A strength of the present study was the use of annual intervals for data collection, which made it possible to outline the rise and fall of the severity of behavior problems over a period of 10 years. Had we collected only the beginning and the endpoints, the break in 2004 would not have been clear. However, this study also has limitations. Specifically, the sample focused on a specific type of intervention in youth care (home-based services) and was therefore not representative of the Dutch youth care system in general. Although it is interesting to note that, in another sample (children admitted for outpatient mental health services), the same trend was revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426611417626">Vegter et al., 2011</xref>), this study covered only two points in time (1999 and 2005). Being located in the North and East regions of the Netherlands, the sample was also not completely representative of home-based services throughout the country. In addition, we did not incorporate other demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or family composition because the home-based services did not systematically record this information; therefore, this information was missing in many cases. In future time-trend studies, these variables should be incorporated to further explain increases or decreases in behavior problems. Another limitation in this study was that we only gathered information from the parents as teacher reports, social worker reports, and self-reports were not systematically collected by the home-based services. In addition, <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> classifications were not available. Due to this missing information, we had no way of knowing whether the reports from other informants revealed the same trends.</p>
<p>It is difficult to draw firm policy implications based on the time trends found in this study. The Dutch youth care system seems to cope well with the increasing number of children, which makes an appeal to care. However, if it is true that, in the Netherlands, after 2004, YCA workers became hesitant to refer clients to home-based services because of imminent risks that may not be sufficiently substantiated, then it is time for them to refresh their knowledge of home-based alternatives and consider this effective service more seriously.</p>
