<p>Counselors are regularly confronted with children and adolescents who reside in violent or potentially violent living environments. In this article, safety plans are presented as a tool that counselors can use to promote the safety of children living in unsafe family situations. Ethics-related counseling issues that should be considered when counseling children living in violent living homes are also discussed. A case example is provided to illuminate the presented concepts.</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that children who have been involved with, or assessed by, a child protective agency are being monitored, and are likely in safe environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448833">Callister, 2002</xref>). The reality is that many children often continue to live in, or are returned to, living environments that have the potential for serious violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448833">Castelino, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448833">Black, Trocmй, Fallon, and MacLaurin (2008)</xref> found that only 10% of children who were exposed to and experienced some form of maltreatment were placed in out-of-home care settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448833">Black et al. (2008)</xref> concluded that a majority of cases involving child exposure to violence are closed with no removal from the home and with a limited focus by social services—or other helpers—on safety planning efforts.</p>
<p>Since most child homicides are perpetrated by children’s family members, children in living circumstances with violent family members are particularly at risk. Data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System suggests that in 2008, four to five children were killed each day secondary to child abuse or neglect, and parents were responsible for 71% of these fatalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448833">Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2010</xref>). The magnitude and frequency of child homicides suggest that especially when working with children living in potentially violent environments, children’s safety should not be taken for granted, and counselors should be vigilant in assessing and encouraging safety.</p>
<p>In addition to the risk of childhood homicide, children living in potentially violent environments often come in the cross fire of domestic violence between the adults living within the home. Domestic violence or intimate partner violence (IPV) involves the abusive behaviors by one or both partners in an intimate relationship (i.e., marriage, dating, family, or cohabitation) living with in the child’s environment. These abusive behaviors between partners can include physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, and financial abuse. IPV has significant impacts on children and correlates with eventual child homicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448833">Hartley, 2004</xref>). Higher rates of child neglect and abuse are also associated with IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448833">Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448833">Hartley, 2004</xref>). Rates of co-occurrence of IPV and child maltreatment range from 30% to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448833">Appel &amp; Holden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448833">Edleson, 1999</xref>). Also, the more severe the IPV, the more severe perpetrated child abuse is by both the father and the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712448833">Jouriles &amp; LeCompte, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448833">Jouriles &amp; Norwood, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>That the impacts of IPV on children are so significant are especially concerning in light of the high rates of IPV in the U.S. families. It is estimated that in the United States, 10 million children witness IPV each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712448833">McFarlane, Groff, O’Brien, &amp; Watson, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066480712448833">Rodriguez (2006)</xref> noted that in families with IPV, 50% of that violence is also perpetrated directly on children or when children are present. Statistics from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066480712448833">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2000)</xref> indicate that 53.5% of children who are exposed to maltreatment and violence are victims of neglect and 22.7% are victims of physical abuse, and these are only the reported cases.</p>
<p>Child abuse and exposure to IPV has significant short- and long-term consequences for children. IPV psychologically affects children and increases the likelihood they will enter counseling secondary to experiencing the enduring long-term impacts that this type of violence can invite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448833">American Psychological Association [APA], 1996</xref>). Abuse and neglect can impact a child’s physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development. Common issues children may experience include depression, low self-esteem, and withdrawal, as well as rebellion, hyperactivity, and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448833">Black, Trocmй, Fallon, &amp; MacLaurin, 2008</xref>). Children exposed to violence often demonstrate more aggression, insecure attachments, and higher rates of psychopathology and posttraumatic stress disorder than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448833">Ernst, Weiss, &amp; Enright-Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448833">Kolbo, Blakely, &amp; Engleman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448833">McIntosh, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased risk of psychological problems associated with child abuse, witnessing IPV, and removal from one’s home increases the likelihood that these child victims will become consumers of counseling services. Because mental health counselors often encounter children living in violent homes, their ability to facilitate children’s safety, and accurately assess the potential for further violence is “a required professional ability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448833">Elbogen, 2002</xref>, p. 591). Despite the fact that counselors regularly counsel children and adolescents who are living in violent, or potentially violent, circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448833">Douglas &amp; Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712448833">Horton &amp; Cruise, 1997</xref>), no professional literature provides suggestions on how counselors or other mental health providers can facilitate and encourage the safety of children in these potentially unsafe environments.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to bridge this gap and contribute to the development of the literature base that might help educate counselors about the multiple issues associated with promoting children’s safety. In addition to counseling children who are living in potentially violent circumstances, counselors may find themselves involved in family reunification planning and may need resources to support their efforts to create a safe and comfortable environment for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448833">Castelino, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is important that discussions of this topic occur within the professional literature and in counselor training programs. This article provides a discussion of the important child safety-related ethical considerations and suggests the use of safety plans in promoting the safety of children living in violent homes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712448833">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>There are a variety of safety-related ethical issues associated with counseling children who live in violent or potentially violent families. Ethics issues related to mandated reporting, client advocacy, client confidentiality, and counselor countertransference should all be considered when working with children in violent families. In this section, these ethics issues will be briefly reviewed.</p>
<p>First, counselors have a mandatory duty to report child abuse or neglect to an independent social service agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448833">Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2010</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448833">Black et al. (2008)</xref> found that the majority of cases that involve child abuse and/or child exposure to domestic violence do not result in the removal of the child from the home. After an initial report of abuse, it is important to continually monitor for changes in the child’s living circumstances. If an additional circumstance, such as abuse or neglect, presents itself in the future, the counselor must make an additional report to the social services agency appointed in that particular state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448833">Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448833">Black et al. (2008)</xref> found that it is much more likely that the child will be removed from a violent home when additional reports are factored in. As such, regardless of the child welfare system’s follow-up on an initial report, counselors should not be dissuaded from reporting new instances of suspected abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>Despite counselors’ efforts to report and rectify violent living situations, some counselors may witness institutional discrimination against their client and as such they may need to address inadequate responses and any other witnessed injustices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448833">American Counseling Association [ACA], 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066480712448833">Waugh &amp; Bonner, 2002</xref>). Perceived discrimination could be based upon clients’ race, gender, or socioeconomic status, and it is the counselors’ ethical obligation to advocate for their clients while still maintaining the clients’ right to privacy and privileged communication. Counselors should use their best judgment to determine the appropriate course of action when faced with such barriers.</p>
<p>Counselors also must be aware that even though the violation of confidentiality is justified, often ramifications will occur after a report is filed. While some children may express validation and relief, more often a child will present incongruent emotions and feelings, sometimes expressing resentment and anger toward the counselor for upsetting the family’s homeostasis. In addition to the child’s incongruent reactions, caregivers often have significant reactions that can severely threaten or even permanently sever the therapeutic alliance. A counselor must fully explain to the child and caregivers that reporting childhood abuse and neglect is a required duty of a professional counselor. As many caregivers who live with children in violent environments often avoid seeking help for their children for fear that their children will be removed from the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448833">Douglas &amp; Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448833">Hartley, 2004</xref>), counselors must provide clear and candid communication throughout the process.</p>
<p>To more thoroughly facilitate collaboration with caregivers, counselors need to educate the client and caregivers on the risks and overlap between IPV and child abuse and neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448833">Lewis, 2003</xref>). Early on in the counseling process, counselors needs to present children and caregivers with the limits of confidentiality, as well as accurate information related to the consequences of reporting and the impact reporting has on the therapeutic alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448833">Lewis, 2003</xref>). Providing the client with clear, accurate information, empowers clients and caregivers as they now have an educated and informed understanding of the issues and realistic consequences associated with mandated reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448833">Lewis, 2003</xref>). If appropriate, the counselor can also engage the client and caregivers in a collaborative, transparent reporting process by providing the option of the caregiver reporting abuse with the counselor, or the counselor making the report in the presence of the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448833">Lewis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In exercising a counselor’s judgment in reporting cases of abuse, counselors must be acutely aware of possible countertransference reactions. Counselors may be more or less sensitive to the needs of their clients based upon their own past experiences of domestic violence or abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448833">Iliffe &amp; Steed, 2000</xref>). Counselors should actively gauge and monitor for appropriate levels of involvement, and regularly seek supervisor or peer supervision to monitor their reactions to clients who are in violent living situations.</p>
<p>The laws and rules that govern professional counselors must always be taken into account when working with this population. Ethics concepts related to balancing autonomy and confidentiality, and a duty to protect should also be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448833">Lewis, 2003</xref>). The sterility and finality of written laws and ethics must be translated with a sensitive understanding of childhood development, familial relationships, and above all else, a child’s safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448833">Douglas &amp; Walsh, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1066480712448833">
<title>Safety Plans</title>
<p>If children are left in a potentially unsafe environment, counselor’s have an obligation to enhance their safety. Underage children do not have the power to leave their home environments and counselors play an integral part in aiding in enhancing their safety. Counselors should not assume that just because the caregiver’s safety needs have been met but that the child’s safety needs are also being met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066480712448833">Waugh &amp; Bonner, 2002</xref>). Even if the caregiver is actively working to improve the environment, the counselor can also empower the young client to work toward securing his or her own safety.</p>
<sec id="section3-1066480712448833">
<title>Importance of Safety Planning</title>
<p>Beyond a counselor’s duty to report suspected child maltreatment, counselors’ top priority must be to ensure clients’ safety. After securing basic physiological needs, safety must be obtained before any secondary needs of the client can be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448833">Maslow, 1943</xref>). Removal from the home would certainly achieve the goal of safety, but as has been established, this is not always an option. Although it has been postulated that removing children from an unsafe environment may be detrimental to the children’s mental health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448833">Davidson-Arad (2005)</xref> found that children’s quality of life often improves after being removed from an unfit environment. However, the resources required to remove children from all potentially violent homes are insufficient. Additionally, many caregivers and parents work diligently to improve the child’s living environment and are capable of providing an appropriate home, and removal is not always appropriate.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448833">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref>, children left in potentially violent environments can use emotion-focused or physical-focused coping skills. Emotion-focused coping strategies include ignoring the violence, playing loud music, and utilizing expressive therapy outlets. Physical-focused coping strategies (i.e., reporting the perpetrator to authorities, fighting back at the perpetrator, switching the attention from their parental victim to themselves, and fleeing to a safe place) promote a more active approach to dealing with violent environments. There are benefits to each of these strategies, but there are also significant setbacks to each. Passive strategies do not empower the client and are associated with higher levels of mental health problems; active strategies may be dangerous and even life threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448833">Kerig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712448833">Overlien &amp; Hydйn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative and empowering approach to helping children cope with violence in the home is client safety planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448833">Kress, Protivnak, &amp; Sadlak, 2008</xref>). Safety planning involves having children develop a detailed plan that can be used to enhance safety. Safety planning allows clients to take a dynamic and powerful role in their own safety and is not focused solely on the use of physical or emotional coping skills.</p>

<title>Developing Safety Plans</title>
<sec id="section5-1066480712448833">
<title>Foundations of safety plans</title>
<p>When safety planning with children and adolescents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448833">Goodkind, Sullivan, and Bybee (2004)</xref> suggest it is helpful for clients to have a knowledgeable person who can offer support and encouragement. The young client’s counselor can act as this primary source of support, but contact information for others who can be available when the client is not in session can prove to be useful. For example, it is helpful to provide young clients with a number for a help hotline, the local police, and other resources they can contact in an emergency or in any time of tribulation. The counselor might also role-play or process with the client situations in which it may be necessary to call the police. Additionally, it is important the client understands that he or she is not responsible for caregivers’ safety, and personal safety should be the priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448833">The Peel Committee Against Woman Abuse, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The next step in developing a safety plan is to help the client identify a safe alternative location, should the environment become violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448833">Goodkind, Sullivan, &amp; Bybee, 2004</xref>). The client should identify a safe place to which he or she can retreat, both in and outside of the home. In the home, a room in the house, preferably with a telephone and lock, should be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448833">The Peel Committee Against Woman Abuse, 2006</xref>). Finally, it is helpful to develop an escape plan so that the client can quietly move away from the violent environment without being noticed and/or escalating the violence.</p>
<p>The next step in the creation of a safety plan includes making provisions to aid the client in fleeing to a safe emergency location, should it ever become necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448833">Goodkind et al., 2004</xref>). A list of important phone numbers and possibly a cellular phone (i.e., an inexpensive prepaid phone) should also be placed somewhere accessible for these emergency situations. Processing how to get to the safe space and any potential struggles or issues that may emerge in transport to the safe place may be helpful.</p>
<p>After the safety plan has been developed, it will be necessary to discuss the use of this safety plan and all that it entails. Processing with the client when he or she should call a help hotline or a case worker, and when it would be necessary to call the police may be helpful. It may also be helpful to role-play a potentially violent situation and have the client practice utilizing the predetermined escape plan.</p>
<p>It is also essential that counselors help children deal with their trauma symptoms associated with domestic violence as failure to do so may impede a child’s ability to respond effectively to violent situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448833">Skybo &amp; Polivka, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448833">Skybo and Polivka (2006)</xref> suggest a health promotion model for professionals to use for childhood violence prevention. In this model, counselors try to improve their client’s coping skills and teach conflict resolution. Counselors should work to develop coping skills by reducing trauma-related fear and anxiety, increasing physical and emotional control, restoring social connections, and modeling stress management and relaxation strategies (e.g., self-talk and self-direction). With regard to conflict resolution, counselors should try to improve communication techniques and problem solving. Development of coping and conflict resolution skills could potentially help clients detect violence and prevent injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448833">Skybo &amp; Polivka, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing a support network is a final, yet very important, step for children in potentially violent environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712448833">Shim &amp; Haight, 2006</xref>). It is beneficial to provide clients with the opportunity to form bonds with other children in similar situations and realize they are not alone in their struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712448833">Overlien &amp; Hydйn, 2009</xref>). Children who participate in organizations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America have increased academic performance, improved family and peer relations, and decreased gang activity and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448833">Skybo &amp; Polivka, 2006</xref>). Clients without a support network are more likely to feel marginalized and will not reap the various tangible and intangible benefits associated with the normalizing factor of human connectedness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480712448833">
<title>Safety planning with young children</title>
<p>As previously stated, it is important for counselors to ensure that a safety plan is developmentally appropriate. When creating the safety plan, the counselor should take into consideration the age and level of cognitive functioning of the client to ensure that the child is able to understand and implement the safety plan appropriately.</p>
<p>Examples of specifics to be taken into consideration include the child’s ability to use the phone, ability to recognize numbers to be able to dial for help, and their ability to reach necessary items in the home such as the telephone and door locks. Especially with young children, it is important to role-play calling an emergency number and what they will say when they call the emergency numbers. Developing short requests and phrases that can be used in these situations may be most helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448833">The Peel Committee Against Woman Abuse, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Play is a developmentally appropriate means of working with children that can be integrated into the development of safety plans with younger children. Play is generally effective with children up to late elementary school ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480712448833">Ogawa, 2004</xref>). Through play, children can communicate and express emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448833">Association for Play Therapy, 2012</xref>). More importantly, play can help children develop problem-solving skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448833">Association for Play Therapy, 2012</xref>), which is a main aim in safety planning. Additionally, play comes naturally to children and it allows them to express themselves in a nonthreatening manner and manage crises more so than traditional talk therapy approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066480712448833">Orton, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Miller, Howell, Hunter, and Graham-Bermann’s (2012) research suggested that even after a safety-focused intervention, children had difficulty verbally expressing safety skills. Their findings suggest it is important for counselors to communicate with younger children in ways that they can best understand and implement the information; talk therapy alone may not be the most effective method. An additional benefit to play is that it may provide a method to gauge a child’s understanding of the safety plan and ability to implement the safety plan.</p>
<p>Play can be integrated into the counseling though the use of any type of toys. These toys can serve as a medium to role-play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448833">Oaklander, 1988</xref>) or to practice safety planning skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712448833">Miller et al. (2012)</xref> also suggested that puppets can be used by children to act out different types of safety (i.e., fire safety and school safety) and enhance their ability to respond in these situations. Group leaders might use puppets to act out a violent situation with the children acting out safe responses. Action figures might also be used by counselors in safety planning. Finally, it may be beneficial to include items such as dolls and dollhouses as these toys tend to serve as symbols of family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066480712448833">Orton, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the consequences of young children using safety planning strategies have not been studied. Since each situation is unique, counselors should discuss what plan of action will be most beneficial for the child in various circumstances. Counselors can also collaborate with family members, educators, social service workers, and community agencies in order to develop a more complete, beneficial plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448833">Keys, Bemak, Carpenter, &amp; King-Sears, 1998</xref>). In the following section, a brief case study application that integrates some of the material presented in this article is provided.</p>

<title>Case Study Application</title>
<p>Bryant, a 13-year-old African American male, presents with his mother to a local outpatient counseling facility. Bryant has been having aggressive outbursts and experiencing intense irritability. His mother discusses that their home situation has been turbulent and chaotic. Bryant’s mother does not connect that Bryant’s behavior may be connected to their chaotic living situation. Over several sessions, the counselor forms a therapeutic alliance with Bryant.</p>
<p>The counselor begins to surmise that Bryant is depressed and his home life is more than just tumultuous and chaotic but is also hostile, aggressive, and potentially unsafe. Bryant has witnessed his stepfather attacking his mother, and his stepfather has also beaten him on several recent occasions. Armed with Bryant’s self-report and his mother’s confirmation, the counselor contacts social services and reports these events. Weeks pass by, and after a brief investigation Bryant is not removed from the home; children’s services closes the case. It appears to the counselor that nothing seems to come from the mandated report. The counselor ascertains that these abusive events have not ceased and another report is made to social services. The counselor follows up with children’s services and they state that they have assessed the situation again and do not believe the child is in imminent risk; the case was closed this time however with a recommendation that the mother seek counseling, and both parents attend parenting classes.</p>
<p>As soon as the counselor becomes aware of the violence in the home, the counselor has a conversation regarding safety with Bryant and his mom and helps Bryant develop a safety plan he can apply should he feel unsafe. As a part of this plan, Bryant identifies a neighbor’s house as a place he can go to get away from his stepfather should he feel unsafe. The counselor encourages the mom to inform the neighbor that Bryant may be coming over if he feels unsafe and asks that the neighbor contact the police if there is loud noise or a disturbance noted at the home at any time. Additionally, Bryant identifies individuals within his support system he can trust and call upon if he is feeling unsafe. He talks about an aunt who lives two blocks away from his home who has always been supportive. The counselor then recommends that Bryant create a password that he can use with his aunt, neighbor, or mom if he is in danger and cannot get out of the situation. Bryant’s mom is encouraged to inform the neighbor and aunt of the code word. The counselor explains that in situations where Bryant does not feel safe he needs to contact an adult and not a friend as these are situations in which adults are better able to facilitate safety. The counselor talks with Bryant and his mother and determines what items in the house are unsafe. Bryant’s mother agrees to remove their gun from the home. The counselor works with Bryant and his mother to develop and identify escape routes that can be used in different situations. With guidance from the counselor, Bryant and his mother identify times when the stepfather is more likely to become violent (i.e., when he is drinking and after getting home from work) so that Bryant can be aware and remove himself from the area when situations begin to develop. Bryant constructs an accessible container in which he packs some money, and some copies of identification card and he agrees to leave this at his aunt’s house. Bryant also makes sure he knows the local emergency numbers. The counselor educates Bryant and his mother about the importance of not keeping written emergency plans in locations that the stepfather can find them as this could trigger the stepfather to respond negatively.</p>
<p>Bryant states that he is beginning to feel more stable and less anxious because he has a safety plan. The counselor is able to help Bryant feel safer, and provide him with a sense of empowerment in an otherwise overwhelming situation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the counselor recommends Bryant increase his support system outside of his family by becoming involved in the local Big Brother program. With the counselor’s assistance, Bryant becomes aware of a local drop in center for teens that can provide him with support and assistances in times of need.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article provides an overview of how counselors can promote the safety of children living in violent or potentially violent families. Important child safety-related ethical considerations such as mandated reporting, client advocacy, counselor countertransference, and the use of safety plans to promote the safety of children were addressed. Of the topics addressed, most important is the issue of counselors and mandated reporting. If after a thorough assessment it is determined that a child is in a violent or potentially violent situation, the counselor has a responsibility to adhere to reporting mandates. Counselors need to become familiar with their state laws regarding the mandated reporting of child abuse and neglect as legal requirements may differ between states.</p>
<p>Counselors also have a responsibility to work with clients to create a safety plan. The safety plan should be specific and conveyed in a manner that is developmentally appropriate for the client. Additionally, safety plans should include resources for the child such as local hotlines and telephone numbers for the local police, and safe escape routes, should violence erupt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448833">Goodkind et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a safety plan is created, it is the counselor’s responsibility to continually assess the child’s environment for safety and to review the plan on a regular basis with the child and a safe caregiver. It is important for counselors to monitor for amendments that may be needed to enhance the original safety plan. Examples of changes that may need to occur are when a person of support for the child is no longer available, or if the child relocates and needs to learn a new address/telephone number. Additionally, the counselor should be aware of transition times when amendments to the safety plan may be necessary. Example of times when a safety plan adjustment may be required include a parent being placed in jail and then released, a temporary protective order being lifted, or if a new individual is moving in or out of the household.</p>
<p>Counselors should not work in isolation when working with children living in violent environments. Counselors should regularly engage in supervision and consultation regarding the safety of children. Finally, it is important that counselors maintain thorough documentation of all assessments completed, mandated reports made, as well as copies of safety plans created with clients.</p>
<p>Future research might explore the effectiveness of children using safety strategies and which strategies are most beneficial in keeping children living in violent homes safe. Because there is no research available on this topic, initially, qualitative research which examines counselors’ experiences in helping clients develop safety plans may be of value. Related to this, qualitative research which investigates clients’ experiences with developing and using safety plans may also be helpful.</p>
