<abstract>
<p>We describe a case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), seen on B-mode sonography, confirmed with the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and demonstrated on computed tomography (CT). RCC in ADPKD is described but is rare, no more frequent than in the general population, although often sought on imaging. CEUS may be used in patients with ADPKD when a complicating carcinoma is suspected on the B-mode examination in lieu of imaging strategies that use nephrotoxic contrast agents.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742271X13498539" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coexistence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a renal cyst in the same kidney has been reported in only 1–2% of cases of RCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742271X13498539">1</xref></sup> The prevalence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is estimated at 12 million worldwide, with the life-time risk of developing an RCC reportedly &lt;1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742271X13498539">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742271X13498539">3</xref></sup> Ultrasonography is the most frequently used imaging technique in the assessment of patients with ADPKD, as ultrasonography is relatively inexpensive and widely available. The differentiation between a complex renal cyst and RCC is often difficult; surveillance in ADPKD is largely directed to the change in cyst size, cyst haemorrhage or infection as a cause for any new symptoms. Early detection of an RCC would improve prognosis, although this is a rare development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742271X13498539">4</xref></sup> Once a tumour is thought present, characterization is normally performed with contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), with the disadvantage of significant risk in ADPKD, where there is often fragile or impaired renal function. The ability to confidently identify the development of an RCC in ADPKD patients, so that only the most appropriate patients move forward to staging CT is desirable. Microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is particularly valuable in evaluating the vascularization of indeterminate renal lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742271X13498539">5</xref></sup> although it is not currently recommended for the full characterization of these lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742271X13498539">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a CEUS examination would be particularly useful in ADPKD disease, where impaired renal function or the risk of impending renal failure makes a confident sonographic diagnosis important.</p>
<p>We illustrate a case of a patient with ADPKD and end-stage renal failure, who had an indeterminate mass in the left kidney, where the use of CEUS expedited the clinical management.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1742271X13498539" sec-type="cases"><title>Case history</title>
<p>A 54-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease, secondary to ADPKD, complained of intermittent left upper quadrant pain of several months duration. A sonographic examination was performed as part of the clinical investigation. The initial B-mode ultrasound examination demonstrated multiple bilateral renal cysts of varying size, in keeping with ADPKD. On the left, the site of clinical symptoms, a heterogeneously echogenic mass measuring 3.2 cm × 3.7 cm was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742271X13498539">Figure 1</xref>) with an increase in the colour Doppler signal suggesting a vascular component to this abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742271X13498539">Figure 2</xref>). The patient underwent a CEUS examination using the standard Department protocol. Using a S2000 (Acuson Siemens, Mountain View, CA) and a 4 MHz curvilinear transducer, SonoVue™ 2.4 mL (Bracco SpA, Milan) was injected as microbubble contrast. Using the CPS™ (Cadence Contrast Pulse Sequencing, Mountain View, CA) low Mechanical Index technique, the left renal abnormality was imaged in real-time to demonstrate a highly arterialized tumour with early demonstration of a ‘malignant’ type of vascular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742271X13498539">Figure 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742271X13498539">b</xref>)). The tumour started to “wash-out” after one minute 30 seconds, but with continuing increased enhancement relative to background renal parenchyma, at three minutes following administration of the microbubble contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742271X13498539">Figure 3(c)</xref>). A diagnosis of a probable malignant tumour, most likely an RCC was raised. The patient proceeded to a contrast-enhanced CT, both to confirm the diagnosis and to stage the possible malignant disease. The CT examination confirmed the vascular tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1742271X13498539">Figure 4</xref>), and there was no evidence of local or distant tumour spread. Urological surgical referral was undertaken; a left sided nephrectomy was performed. Histology confirmed a clear cell papillary RCC confined to the kidney. This recently described tumour, considered a low-grade RCC, is normally clinically indolent and considered a distinct entity in the spectrum of renal tumours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742271X13498539">7</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec3-1742271X13498539" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present case demonstrates the utility of the use of CEUS in ascertaining the nature of a focal renal abnormality in patients, who would have increased morbidity associated with contrast agents used in CT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Although CEUS is not accurate in ascertaining the exact nature of renal lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742271X13498539">6</xref></sup> in this case, the ability to demonstrate the malignant, persistent arterialization allowed confident further management. The compromise to renal function in a patient with ADPKD, following a contrast-enhanced CT, is deemed a justifiable risk, once the probable diagnosis is established. A CEUS examination in the face of multiple cysts of different morphology in a patient with ADPKD can be used to select those patients, who warrant further imaging investigations, without any compromise to renal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742271X13498539">6</xref></sup> Microbubble contrast agents have no renal toxicity and have a proven safety record.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742271X13498539">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742271X13498539">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>ADPKD is the most common cystic renal disease, seen in 1:500–1000, but an RCC is rare in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742271X13498539">1</xref></sup> The prevalence of the ADPKD gene is 1:1000 and the age-adjusted incidence of RCC is 3–5/100,000/year in the general population. Therefore, the chance of both conditions occurring in the same individual would be remote, unless there is a genetic pre-disposition to developing an RCC with the underlying ADPKD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742271X13498539">4</xref></sup> Walters and Brasch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742271X13498539">10</xref></sup> first described RCC occurring in ADPKD in 1934, with only a further 50 cases reported since, the majority with a unilateral RCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742271X13498539">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742271X13498539">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742271X13498539">4</xref></sup> The general opinion is that there is no association of RCC with underlying ADPKD, although a recent retrospective review of surgical specimens demonstrated 11/89 (12.4%) prevalence of renal tumours (all either clear cell or tubopapillary carcinomas).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742271X13498539">11</xref></sup> The age of presentation of an RCC in ADPKD is lower, fever is a more common presenting symptom and RCC in ADPKD is more often concurrently bilateral, multi-centric and sarcomatoid in type, than in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742271X13498539">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742271X13498539">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742271X13498539">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Invariably in ADPKD, the presence of an RCC is detected on ultrasonography, with limited ability to fully characterise the abnormality. Further imaging with CT is usually undertaken, with arterial hypervascularity on contrast enhanced CT regarded as evidence of an RCC. The absolute Hounsfield Unit of the abnormality will normally ascertain the presence of fat to establish benign entities such as an angiomyolipoma. Information on blood flow is therefore essential in diagnosing renal lesions and in this respect, CEUS would be a diagnostic option for diagnosis, primarily to avoid the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents, if there is uncertainty of the sonographic diagnosis. B-mode ultrasound is not accurate at detecting and characterizing renal masses, particularly if the lesion is small (&lt;10 mm) and does not distort the renal contour, but even CT has difficult detecting lesions smaller than 5 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742271X13498539">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Detection of any type of focal renal lesion is improved with CEUS, with some authors reporting detection rates comparable to CT for all lesion sizes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742271X13498539">14</xref></sup> Characterization of a focal, solid renal lesion with CEUS may be problematic, with much overlap in the appearances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742271X13498539">5</xref></sup> Normally on CEUS, a malignant lesion would be expected to be hyper-enhancing, but there is overlap with a benign angiomyolipoma, and furthermore, the differentiation between different types of RCC is not currently feasible with CEUS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742271X13498539">5</xref></sup> Although there are suggestions that the typical angiomyolipoma shows less contrast enhancement than the typical clear cell RCC with CEUS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742271X13498539">15</xref></sup> it is important to image with CT to ascertain fat content of a typical angiomyolipoma. A useful characteristic of imaging renal lesions is to ascertain the presence of enhancing areas in complex cysts, in order to detect potential malignant cystic renal tumours. This is an area where the use of CEUS has been successful and may lead to a more sensitive Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses than current CT parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742271X13498539">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742271X13498539">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most useful aspect in the present case was to identify the lesion as vascular, requiring further imaging. The most useful characteristic of any focal renal lesion investigated with CEUS would be absence of enhancement, suggesting a benign abnormality, such as a cyst containing debris or an infarction and therefore excluding a lesion that needs further imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742271X13498539">6</xref></sup> This is an important consideration in ADPKD, where a tumour may be mistaken for a complex cyst affected by bleeding, degenerated blood clot, proteinaceous debris, and infection.</p>
<p>This case illustrates the use of CEUS in clearly establishing the nature of a vascular mass in the kidney of a patient with ADPKD, where RCC is a rare but important complication. Vitally, RCC is no more common in the ADPKD patient than in the general population, with recourse to nephrotoxic imaging, in this vulnerable group, potentially deferred by the use of CEUS in characterizing indeterminate renal lesions. Although the tumour was relatively large in the current study, the use in determining the nature of a small incidental lesion in the polycystic kidney is evident. This will allow the examiner to be confident in the diagnosis, not just to confirm an abnormality, but more importantly, to disregard the non-cancerous lesion.</p>
