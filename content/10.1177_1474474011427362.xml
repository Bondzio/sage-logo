<abstract>
<p>While Madagascar had long been known in England as a position on the world map, it was first widely and popularly dramatized as a place within stories of the English pirate Henry Every. A genealogy of Every fictions, appearing in London between about 1709 and into the 1720s, played in various and curious ways upon the rumours of this community. <italic>The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery, the Famous English Pirate, (rais’d from a Cabbin-Boy to a King) now in Possession of Madagascar</italic> (<italic>circa</italic> 1709) was the first of these fictions. This article retrieves <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> from its mere position within a range of literary, political, and historical narratives, and aims to discover what might be yielded by more closely attending to the raw and sophisticated geographical and legal terms in which Every initially became a literary legend. Analysing the central story of piracy in these terms, this article draws out the anonymous author’s suggestive and astute concern with the state-like behaviours and powers of ‘Merchants’. It argues, however, that the questioning politics of state-legitimacy that are pursued in the central narrative must be read within a sharp awareness of the intricate framing structures of the text, and more specifically, the ‘editor’s’ wry address to the prerogative of the reader, and mocking engagement with the conventions of geographical knowledge. Joining a consideration of the authenticity of state behaviour to a questioning of the authenticity of texts and forms of knowledge, <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> must be finally read as promoting critical reading as an act of significant political importance in the first decade of the 18th century.</p>

<p>While Madagascar had long been known in England as a position on the world map, it was first widely and popularly dramatized as a place within stories of the English pirate Henry Every, his crew and associates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474474011427362">1</xref></sup> It was to the region of Madagascar that they escaped following their most infamous exploit in 1695, and it was this situation of retreat – more, indeed, than the act of piracy itself – that captured the imagination of English writers of fiction over the following three decades. As Joel Baer has traced, talk of a fabulously wealthy pirate community living on or just offshore Madagascar had reached such a pitch by 1708 that plans to repatriate the pirates – and more crucially, their wealth – were being proposed to the House of Commons as a means to pay national debts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474474011427362">2</xref></sup> A genealogy of Every fictions appearing in London between about 1709 and into the 1720s played in various and curious ways upon the wilder rumours and less certain knowledge of this community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474474011427362">3</xref></sup> <italic>The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery, the Famous</italic> English <italic>Pirate, (raised from a Cabbin-Boy to a King) now in Possession of Madagascar (circa</italic> 1709<italic>)</italic> was the first of these fictions. However, literary critical approaches to this text have tended to be directed and flattened by another form of myth-making.</p>
<p>In the view of P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens, the eagerness with which scholars have attributed texts to Daniel Defoe has created a mythical canon, ‘a remarkably strange and not very satisfactory construction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474474011427362">4</xref></sup> In their <italic>Defoe De-Attributions</italic>, they list 252 items for which they doubt there is sufficient evidence of Defoe’s authorship. Among these are <italic>The King of Pyrates: Being an Account of the Famous Enterprises of Captain Avery</italic> (1720) and <italic>A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates</italic> (1724–1726), a two volume compendium of pirate biographies purportedly by ‘Captain Charles Johnson’, featuring a chapter on Every, and figuring him in the lives of other pirates. Furbank and Owens’s brusque arguments are measured and convincing, but their book has not led to much relief. In 2002, a boutique publication of <italic>The King of Pirates</italic> – with a forward by the well known historian Peter Ackroyd – was published as authored by Daniel Defoe; and <italic>A General History</italic> is still commonly cited as both by Defoe and as sole evidence of the biographical facts of many famous pirates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474474011427362">5</xref></sup> Even accomplished historians of piracy turn to this text, not just to evidence the wild popularity of pirate stories in the early 18th century, but as a source of fact. Attribution to Defoe does not appear to have undermined the status of <italic>A General History</italic>, which is perverse, given Defoe’s famed wit in presenting fiction as fact.</p>
<p>The two ‘Defoe’ texts are both clearly informed by two earlier fictions featuring Every: the short pamphlet that is the central subject of this article (<italic>circa</italic> 1709), and a play entitled <italic>The Successful Pyrate</italic> (1713). While these have not been attributed to him, their part in the telling of literary history has also been in the canonization of Defoe. The pamphlet and the play are read as the source texts for <italic>The King of Pyrates</italic>, and <italic>The King of Pyrates</italic> is itself primarily read as a precursor text. This fiction is constructed by Defoe scholars as ‘a proleptic sketch’ towards his much longer novel, <italic>The Life, Adventures and Pyracies of the Famous Captain Singleton</italic> (1720).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474474011427362">6</xref></sup> While <italic>Singleton</italic> imagines an encounter between the narrator/protagonist and Every, Singleton himself is most intensively read as a fictionalized version of Every.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474474011427362">7</xref></sup> However, this hereditary of texts leading up to Defoe’s novel does not situate it as the most prized object of literary scholarship. <italic>Singleton</italic> is itself most persistently read as Defoe’s crude first attempt at the novel of criminal biography, which reached most celebrated form in <italic>Moll Flanders</italic> two years later. In other words, all the early Every texts have been somewhat inexorably underestimated by a literary critical establishment in pursuit of Defoe’s greater accomplishments.</p>
<p>This article seeks to read the very first of the Every texts – <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> – as more than literary evidence of Defoe’s knowledge and development as a writer, and more broadly to recuperate it from its mere position in a range of further political, historical and legal narratives concerned with Every. It aims to discover what might be yielded by closely attending to the raw and sophisticated geographical and legal terms through which Every initially became a literary legend in <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic>. Indeed, that it is highly self-aware in its rawness as well as its sophistications is one of the intriguing characteristics of the text. This knowingness is both expressed and enabled by the multiple framing devices that structure – and make up nearly a quarter – of the piece.</p>
<p><italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> begins, as was common at the time, with a title that merges into a short summary of the text. Below this seventeen line title-summary, the central narrative is bracketed by ‘The PREFACE’ and a ‘faithful and true Account’ of Madagascar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474474011427362">8</xref></sup> But both the preface and the closing description are offered all too forcefully and rhetorically as evidencing the truth of the central narrative. These framing sections most fully explicate a playful editor as the probable author of the whole piece. This does not, however, read as a crude literary device badly handled. Whether, where and by whom <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> was read as fact or fiction, or as earnest or mocking, is a moot point: there is no doubt that the framing-play around authorship and truth – around ownership and forms of knowledge – is a central part of the complex literary quality and political grip of the text. Given the politics of writing, printing, bookselling, reading and generic convention in London in the first decade of the 18th century, the text invites connections between the central story of distant piracy, and local concerns about the authenticity of texts and knowledge.</p>
<p>Adrian Johns identifies the mid-17th century as the moment in which ‘piracy’ came to be used as a term to refer to ‘intellectual purloining’. Where he finds no evidence of its usage at the beginning of the century, by the end of the century the idea of intellectual ‘piracy suddenly appears everywhere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474474011427362">9</xref></sup> In Johns’s analysis, the rise of the term marks a convergence between,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Major transformations in the social place of knowledge, in politics, and in economic practice…. They met at just the point when the new craft of printing was giving rise to the first powerful claims on behalf of a literate public to judge issues of common interest. Precisely when authorship took on a mantle of public authority, through the crafts of the printed book, its violation came to be seen as a paramount transgression – as an offense against the common good akin to the crime of the… pirate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474474011427362">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Johns identifies the high and even bloody political stakes of intellectual property in the second half of the 17th century through the anecdote famously told by St Augustine (and traceable back to Cicero), in which Alexander the Great addresses a pirate: ‘What is your idea, in infesting the sea?’ And the pirate answered, with uninhibited insolence, ‘The same as yours, in infesting the earth! But because I do it with a tiny craft, I am called a pirate: because you do it with a navy, you are called an emperor’. Tracking the wide deployment of this story in various and divergent political arguments in the second half of the 17th century – ‘once one is aware of it, one sees it everywhere in the politics of the period’ – Johns grounds its circulation in its use by an ‘old Cavalier’, Richard Atkyns, who referenced it to notorious effect in arguing his right to exercise a patent to publish certain texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474474011427362">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patents in this period were pure privileges granted by the Crown, and superseded the usual ‘flexible, subtle, confidential, and for the most part consensual’ registration of copyright at the Stationer’s Hall in London.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474474011427362">12</xref></sup> As the legal right to print was recognized as an increasingly significant political power in a situation of rapidly democratizing literacy, so the Crown’s prerogative to control that right became ever more fraught and symbolic of the argument over the limits of royal power, the broader shape of the constitution, and the proper means of promoting the liberty of the (reader-)citizen more generally. (In Atkyn’s awkward analogy, the Company of Stationers is the Alexander figure who more ferociously robs the world of an intellectual property that the Cavalier would protect).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474474011427362">13</xref></sup> While Atkyns succeeded in his argument under a Restoration government, Johns points out that in the wake of the 1688 revolution, ‘the idea that the medium [of print] itself was the property of the Crown, which might administer it through a caste of gentleman patentees, employing printers as their servants, came to seem outlandish’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474474011427362">14</xref></sup> This decline in the royal patent, however, was also accompanied by a general falling into chaos of the formal and informal copyright regime (which in Johns’s analysis was not remedied by the ‘confused and unsettled’ Act of Anne 1709, famed as the first ever copyright law, and which came into force in 1710),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474474011427362">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was in these years of no property – between 1695 and 1710 [from Every’s infamous Act of piracy and the publication <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic>] – that piracy really became an everyday concept for London’s writers and readers. Suddenly it was being referred to everywhere, in poetry, newspapers, novels, ballads, correspondence, and essays… A major reason for this, of course, was that attention was riveted on struggles with real, seagoing pirates….<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474474011427362">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evoking ‘the rampant terminology of pirates’ in the streets and coffee houses of this time, Johns defines a period in which ‘People found themselves living amid countless experiments in authenticity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474474011427362">17</xref></sup> The language of piracy signifies a cultural political atmosphere in which the legitimacy of texts was part of a broader discourse around – a complex pursuit and critique of – the legitimacy of knowledge. It was into this atmosphere that <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> was published.</p>
<p>The central narrative of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> is presented as having been ‘faithfully extracted from’ the journal of ‘Adrian Van Broeck, a Dutch Gentleman’ who is captured by Avery’s men, taken to their small island stronghold just off Madagascar, and there invited by Avery to ‘Share in his new erected Government’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474474011427362">18</xref></sup> Van Broeck accepts in order to save himself, but later deciding – in the words of the preface – that he can no longer ‘brook an Abode amongst this Nest of Thieves’, he takes a captured ‘English East-India Man’ and sails safely to Batavia. The editor’s opening protestations of the truth of the extract are – within the conventions of the time, and Defoe’s work is a touchstone here – both intent enough to convince, and florid enough to signal that the whole text is a hoax:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As Prefaces are necessary, where the Credit of any Memoir is liable to be call’d in Question, so it may not be improper to give the Reader one at this Juncture, who, from the many Impositions of this Nature, will be apt to Suspend his Believe concerning Things so remotely transacted, and Persons so obscure and imperceptible in their Practice. Who is this pretended Author, what made his escape from Madagascar? says one. How comes he to be let into the Captain’s inmost Secrets? crys another…. every Reader takes a Priviledge in censuring what he buys, which is really his own by that Purchase, and hits him a Kick in the Britch, to make him exercise his <italic>Faculty of Feeling</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474474011427362">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With these statements, the text plays to the reading public identified by Johns: a public with a voracious interest in textual legitimacy, steeped in a sophisticated discourse that was attuned to the legality of the languages of both piracy and ‘Priviledge’. Apparently intent on convincing the reader that the narrative they are about to read is ‘true’, the editor is, in the same textual breath, directing the reader to take ‘a Priviledge’: to claim their own patent over the text in the act of reading and make of it what they will. As the text progresses, it become clear that the continuities and tensions between the political valences of its various parts – the title, the preface, the journal extract, the concluding description of the physical, cultural and economic geography of Madagascar – disallow anything but a critical approach and the exercise of such a ‘Priviledge’. More precisely, the literary representations of geography and law through which the central text moves both plot and atmosphere seems to endorse a position that is more finally deflected and diminished by the wariness of the framing parts. To begin to understand <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> in this way is to read it not just into piratical currents of early 18th-century public life, but against more recent and dominant trends in political usage of the early Every texts.</p>
<p>An exuberant approach to issues of textual legitimacy, apparently exceeding that of the early 18th century, is a striking characteristic of the reception history of the Every texts outside the discipline of literary studies. The myth of Madagascar’s English pirates has founded a persistent narrative that is characterized by a determination to believe in the community as a radically alternative social or political formation. Within this discourse, both the historical accuracy and literary qualities of all the 18th century fictions are curiously irrelevant. More specifically, this approach to the Every fictions privileges <italic>A General History</italic>, and in so doing over-determines the finer meanings of the precursor fictions. The prevailing attitude is that <italic>A General History</italic> is an amalgamation of fact and fiction: some of the chapters are ‘true’, some ‘false’, and disagreement continues as to which are which. That the author knowingly deploys categorical notions of fact and fiction is a surprisingly slight part of the discussions around the book, although it is most fully and starkly revealed in the relationship of the Every chapter to other sections of the book. <italic>A General History</italic> presents Every as a greedy egomaniac, the founder of a draconian monarchy doomed to failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474474011427362">20</xref></sup> Of course, this representation is as fanciful as all the successful versions of Every that the author pretends to be undermining by taking on a high rhetorical tone of historical correction. But this tone is important, as it structures Every’s story as an authenticating counterpoint to the story of the entirely fictional Captain Misson. Johnson describes this pirate as a great revolutionary and founder of a utopian ‘Libertalia’: providing the name and ‘history’ that lends most to the tenacious narratives of an alternative libertarian community of Madagascar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474474011427362">21</xref></sup> So in this round-about way, the earlier Every fictions are both side-lined and valued as a-historical political evidence. This narrative emerges in various genres: it runs through Jan Rogoziński’s vision of intensely egalitarian and cross-cultural harmony in <italic>Honor Among Thieves: Captain Kidd, Henry Every, and the Pirate Democracy in the Indian Ocean</italic> (2000); it is found in Kevin Rushby’s pop adventure-travelogue <italic>Hunting Pirate Heaven</italic> (2001), where the search for material evidence and local oral histories of a pirate community is couched in a familiar evocation of a once-idyllic, but now ruined and marginalized landscape; and it also grounds Hakim Bey’s cult political manifesto <italic>The Temporary Autonomous Zone</italic> (1985), which offers both a past and future vision of a shifting network of social formations ‘living consciously outside the law’ and ‘freed from all political control’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474474011427362">22</xref></sup> In this account, the pirates present an ideal and historically real ‘enclave’ of ‘total liberty’: a community in which ‘rescued slaves, natives and even traditional enemies such as the Portuguese were all invited to join as equals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474474011427362">23</xref></sup> Bey’s manifesto owes something to William Burrough’s inscription of the Madagascar pirates as a permissive community of pilgrimage and truth in his novels <italic>Cities of the Red Night</italic> (1981) and <italic>Ghost of Chance</italic> (1991). The impassioned and convoluted registers of this tradition – not to mention a growing multitude of piracy websites – could be deflected and subdued by drawing the Every fictions into a tougher generic tradition of literary island utopias (as always already or always potentially dystopias). But this risks another mode of historical diffusion, and would gloss the mode of correction directly invited by the text in its more precise relationship to the genre of geography.</p>
<p>In his <italic>Enlightenment geography: the political languages of British geography, 1650-1850</italic>, Robert Mayhew recuperates the regular meaning of geography, before it became a distinctive discipline in the mid-19th century. He argues that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Geography was defined very tightly in 17th- and 18th-century Britain: geography was the verbal and mathematical description of the earth; it was a scientific subject, but not in the modern sense [‘science as knowledge… as opposed to science as “certainty grounded on demonstration”’]; it was restricted in its spatial scale to general discussions of the earth as a whole [‘Geography books… were mainly vast compendia, gazetteers or dictionaries’]; it was distinguished from travel writing by its ordered and detached presentation of evidence; it was created by textual collation rather than fieldwork; and its conventional contents interwove it with political discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474474011427362">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Working from Mayhew, <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> can be seen to rely upon, self-consciously deploy, but also (arguably) mock the currency and conventions of geography of the time. The addendum seems, all too fervently, to be a description drawn from, or striving for entry into, such a geographical compendium. That we are apparently going to be offered an accurate and exhaustive description of the place is signified by the genealogy of names with which the afterword begins: <italic>St Lawrence</italic> under the Portuguese, <italic>Dauphine’s Island</italic> under the French, <italic>the Menuthias</italic> of <italic>Ptolemy</italic>, and the <italic>Cerne-Aethiopia</italic> of <italic>Pliny</italic>. But a brief and vague description – falling far short of the accurate measures and locations given in the central narrative itself, and certainly available in geographies of the time – of size (it is ‘80 or 100’ leagues in ‘Breadth’) and location (‘under the Torrid zone’) follows. The rest of the description is a mix of opinion (the island has ‘the best and purest Water in the World’), of exaggeration (‘Most Sorts of precious Stones are to be found in their Rivers’), spurious deduction within the knowledge of the time (‘The Natives are of two sorts, black and white; the latter, by their Names and Custom, seem to be of <italic>Jewish</italic> Extract’), compelling rumour of the sort circulating about various locations beyond Europe (we are told live babies are buried with their dead mothers), and general, randomly ordered, partly-accurate descriptions of ‘the air’, the variety of trees, the structures of towns and governance, the ‘barbarity’ of the languages, and – repeatedly – the commodities and abundant resources of the island.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474474011427362">25</xref></sup> The description ends with a strident call to ‘our Superiors’ to either defeat or pardon the pirates in order to take ‘Possession’ of ‘a Country that… abounds with so many useful Commodities’. This would ensure that ‘the <italic>British</italic> Arms’ will ‘shine with as great a Lustre in <italic>Africa</italic>, as they have lately done in <italic>Europe</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474474011427362">26</xref></sup> Read in light of this emphatic call to the recently constituted ‘<italic>Great Britain</italic>’, it is tempting to understand the whole pamphlet as a work of open and pragmatic propaganda, designed to encourage action with or against the pirates in pursuit of Britain’s imperial expansion.</p>
<p>Working upon his detailed research establishing that ‘it was fact that persons claiming to represent [Every] had appeared at several European courts and were prepared to negotiate alliances; it was fact that from 1705 to 1709, English and Scottish authorities were tempted to consider seriously the proposals of Madagascar’s pirate-diplomats’, Joel Baer concludes that <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> ‘was probably designed to influence negotiations with the pirates’, and convince the government to take some action, diplomatic or military.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474474011427362">27</xref></sup> However, the text offers a far more intricately structured narrative than is necessary to achieve this end, and a more complex narrative tone than suits such a purpose. Read as a mock-up of the conventions of geography, the addendum can be understood as a critique of the potential and actual political complicities of the genre as a whole, and indeed the very idea of authentic knowledge that such geography privileges. If the preface does, as I have argued, exhort critical reading as the highest and most legitimate form of textual ownership, then the addendum can be understood as clearly making itself available to the acuities of this ‘Priviledge’. Further, the bulk of the text – the central narrative apparently extracted from Van Broeck’s diary – involves an often sly, but increasingly fundamental, questioning of the legitimacy of structures of power and governance that belies an easy reading of the text as establishing Britain’s right to imperial expansion. (While arguably the text may be cynically encouraging expansion without right, this argument is also deflected by the particular ideas of state articulated by the text.) This is broadly apparent in the general lineaments of the central plotlines, and more sharply evident in the text’s clear apprehension of the pirate as a friable legal category.</p>
<p>Turning first to the plot, a notable amount of text is devoted to the parallel early careers of Avery and his father. We are told that the father started his life as a seaman ‘in the Service of the Crown… but meeting with little Encouragement… he betook himself to the Merchants, under whom, by his prudent and careful Demeanor, he got a competent Estate, and the Reputation of a very able Sea-man’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474474011427362">28</xref></sup> Pages three to five are almost entirely devoted to detailing the course by which Avery himself rises up in service of the Crown, but how when – through a series of personal disasters – ‘his Fortunes being lost, his former Favours were vanish’d also’, he is unfairly demoted by the Admiralty, and subsequently determines to turn to ‘the Merchants’. In this service, he is,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Look’d upon… as a lucky and bold Commander, his Courage had been try’d upon several Occasions, and his Conduct been render’d irreproachable… as all his Behaviour was with as much Gallantry as could be expected from the most resolute Sailor on the Ocean.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474474011427362">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like his father, he is underestimated by the Crown, but receives full recognition and success in the service of trade. The importance of this career pattern within the meaning of the text is flagged in the title, which headlines Avery’s ‘serving the Government on Board the Resolution and Nonsuch Men of War’ and ‘The Reasons why he quitted that Service for that of the Merchants’. Further, the editor tells us that our central, neutrally Dutch interlocutor, Van Broeck, ‘after a very liberal Education at Leyden, apply’d himself, as Men of the best Fashion in <italic>Holland</italic> do, to the Business of Trade’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474474011427362">30</xref></sup> The weight given these particular details seems at first perplexing, but the political valence of this emphasis finally consolidates in a notable moment on page 14. Here we are told that Avery applies, not to England, but ‘to the English Company trading to the East Indies’ for a pardon. Explicitly lending the Company one of the most central and exclusive powers of a state – that to pardon a criminal offence – the fiction offers a diminishing idea of the power of the British nation-state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474474011427362">31</xref></sup> Given the trajectory of the men’s careers, the narrative appears to easily assume and approve the ascendency of the Merchant Company over the Crown. This is a reading that is bolstered by – and which also potentially expands – recent work on the significance of the real Every to the history and status of the British East India Company.</p>
<p>The significance of Every’s singularly bold act of piracy of 1695 within the history of trade, and to the development of ideas of state, colonial geography and international law has been astutely argued in some recent scholarship. In Philip J. Stern’s article on the detailed turns in policy and personnel by which the BEIC began to look and act ‘remarkably like a state’, it plays both a historically key and key symbolic part.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474474011427362">32</xref></sup> In 1695, Every captured two Mughal Ships (the wealth-laden <italic>Ganji-i-Sawai</italic> and its escort, the <italic>Fateh Muhammed</italic>): the Mughal held the Company responsible, and trade was halted. Rioters along India’s ports called for the expulsion of the Company; the Company called the House of Lords to take action against Every and his men: and the Emperor Aurangzeb called for the Company – in consort with other European powers – to provide convoys to protect his ships. In Stern’s reading, the Company’s president at Surat came to see this, not as a crisis, but as ‘a golden opportunity… the convoys represented not so much an imposition as a natural extension of the Company’s power, asserting a form of sovereignty over the sea lanes and, remarkably, over Mughal ships and subjects as well’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474474011427362">33</xref></sup> Every’s infamous act of piracy enabled the Company to both behave more like a state, and more fully and consciously consider itself as a state. Stern goes on to track the Company’s creation of forms of citizenship, jurisdiction and assumption of institutional immortality that belie the dominant ‘trade-to-empire’ historiography that he sees as still enthralled to Macaulay’s famous characterization of the company as ‘mere traders, ignorant of general politics, ignorant of the peculiarities of the empire which has strangely become subject to them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474474011427362">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bringing the emphasis of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> together with Stern’s thesis, the fiction reads less as a recognition of the imperial rights of the British Crown than of the Company State. But what the fiction significantly adds to the story of the Company’s ascendency via the Every debacle is a sense, not only of state-like power acquired through a combination of opportunism and capital, but of a longer, deeper and ethical right to power that derives from the affiliation of generations of British seamen-citizens. This reading is extended through the text’s more intensive engagement with the foundations and legitimacy of structures of governance, and the crucial moments in which they mature into – and decline from – a legal state. This trajectory is followed through Avery’s career from ‘a Cabbin Boy’ to ‘a Commander’ to a Pirate to a ‘Chief, with such a Power as the Doges or Dukes of <italic>Venice</italic>’ and finally to ‘a Pitch of Sovereignty not any way inferior to the greatest Potentates’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474474011427362">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stern’s reading of the effect of Every’s plundering of the Mughal ships takes part in a broader debate about the role of pirates in the expansion of European law and European ideas of international law. Tracing the political and legal debate that led to the 1700 ‘Act for the More Effectual Suppression of Piracy’, P. Bradley Nutting gestures to Every’s capture of the Mughal’s ships as a critical event. This is to acknowledge Every as a significant prompt in the making of laws that strove towards a ‘statutory consolidation’ that would bring administrative coherence to the procedures for enforcing laws across colonial territories (although Nutting’s article points more fully to the ultimately piecemeal and compromised nature of these efforts).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474474011427362">36</xref></sup> This understanding of the role of piracy is broadened by Lauren Benton in her <italic>Law and Geography in European Empires</italic> (2010), in which she offers the thesis that ‘by the middle decades of the 18th century, a global maritime culture had produced a diversification of ocean regulatory spheres. Oddly, regional differentiation developed out of the effects of mutual influence and circulating legal practices’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474474011427362">37</xref></sup> Every’s capture of the Mughal ships figures as an early and exemplary moment in these new formations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474474011427362">38</xref></sup> In Benton’s analysis, the reactions and resolutions that followed the capture were significant in generating an Indian Ocean ‘regulatory order that relied more on interimperial negotiation than on a connected network of legal forums and naval enforcers’: and, she indicates, the more formal courts and enforcement practices that emerged in the Atlantic in the early decades of the 18th century also resulted, in part, from this same event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474474011427362">39</xref></sup> And this is not the only way in which Benton perceives piracy as generating and extending the reach of the law. In her work, the European pirate of the late 17th century also appears as a subtle performer of laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474474011427362">40</xref></sup> Far from indulging in his own recklessness, Benton sees him anxiously and loudly proclaiming his actions as – albeit marginally – within the law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474474011427362">41</xref></sup> Knowingly exploiting the fine distinction between privateering – the state sanctioned plundering of foreign ships so recently favoured by Britain – and piracy, Benton’s pirates adamantly if precariously insist on their own lawfulness: and in so doing, facilitate both the imposition of European law on further geographies, and the regionalization of that law. ‘Pirates strain not to break the law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474474011427362">42</xref></sup> This is a vivid point. By violently asserting their legitimacy in their very moments of action and locations of escape, the European pirates like Every appear as vanguards in the creation of what Benton describes as the ‘corridors’ – the slim geographies – of law through which European empires shaped and asserted power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474474011427362">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In focusing on pirates as often surprisingly knowledgeable about the law, Benton’s thesis in some ways continues the work of Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Redicker. But she more fundamentally diverges from their iconic Marxist reading of the rise of European piracy in the second half of the 17th and first decades of the 18th century. In Linebaugh and Redicker’s understanding, the European pirate culture of this period emerged in political resistance to the depredations and poverty of the life of the regular sailor aboard merchant and naval ships. Linebaugh and Redicker admire piratical structures of governance, and emphasize evidence of detailed rules ensuring justice and equality. Their analysis both celebrates and adumbrates the image of the pirate as lawless brigand: they see the pirate ship and pirate culture as an organization that proves the moral failures and illegitimacy of the modern European state under capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474474011427362">44</xref></sup> Where Benton perceives dogged performance of laws of state, Linebaugh and Rediker see a tough refutation of given regimes. The fictional rendering of Every’s life in The <italic>Life and Adventures</italic> carries a visceral sense of the ambiguities between these two accounts of piratical posturing.</p>
<p>The central narrative of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> turns from summary description to a fuller and more material evocation of place and moment when it reaches Madagascar. The (entirely fictional) story of how Avery, now a successful mariner, is deceived, ruined and embittered by the woman he loves, determines to become a pirate, and through elaborate subterfuge, manages to steal a ship out of London, is briskly told (and the politically and legally problematic act of mutiny that marks the beginning of the real story of Every is smoothly avoided). He sails this ship to the ‘Indian Sea’, where he captures and plunders the Mughal ship, and sails for Madagascar:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474474011427362">45</xref></sup> ‘They were no sooner in Sight of the Island, but whole Troops of Inhabitants came down to the shore, in order to take a Survey of the Ship’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474474011427362">46</xref></sup> At this point, the story-telling slows down and gathers more detail. We are offered what seems a typical moment of first encounter, although the narrative immediately undercuts this by describing the Madagascan people almost exclusively in terms of European state structures, and as having probably had some interaction with Europeans in the past. The ‘King’ has a ‘Prime Minister of State’, ‘Officers of State’, an ‘Army’ and a ‘Court’. After their initial – and highly formal – encounter, Avery retreats to,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Bay on the East Side of this Island, in 15 Degrees 30 Minutes South Latitude, which was large and capacious, and unexpos’d to the Fury of the most tempestuous Weather. Towards the Bottom of it lies a small Island about ten Miles in Circumference, whose Land round it being high and woody, makes a sure Protection for all Vessels which anchor’d beneath.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474474011427362">47</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This imagines the pirates on the island of Sainte Marie just off the North East coast of Madagascar (in the other 18th century Every fictions, the pirates are variously imagined on Sainte Marie, Madagascar itself, and the island of Johanna much farther North-West in the Comoros). There they await the King’s messenger. When he is called back onto the main island, ‘the two Potentates (for we must after this Interview, share the Government of this Side of the World between them) entere’d into a perpetual Alliance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474474011427362">48</xref></sup> In Benton’s terms, Avery is here imagined as performing his lawfulness within given structures and customs, taking part in the indirect means by which England expanded its legal geographies. However, the island off Madagascar is also figured as the site in which he pursues a different and more egalitarian rule of law, first dividing the landed plunder ‘according to the Law of Pirates, who, tho’ they make it their Business to prey on Persons of a different Life and Conversation, yet among themselves observe the strictest Rules of Justice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474474011427362">49</xref></sup> But that Avery’s establishment on the island is, finally, neither a radical formation nor a convincing performance of hegemonic lawfulness is given by the range of deliberately oxymoronic, casual, and doubtful terms in which the pirates are described as understanding that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Bulwarks and Artillery were not able to preserve this piratical Government, without Laws and Institutions necessary for its Well-being and Continuance, several new Customs and Ordinances were propos’d, and consented to by the Generality of the Rovers conducive as they imagin’d necessary for the Preservation of their new State and Avery was with abundance of Ceremony chosen and confirmed in the Dignity of their Chief, with such a Power as the Doges or Dukes of Venice and Genoa are now possess’d of.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474474011427362">50</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That the ‘Chief’ is also a ‘Doge’ of what is described – in a close flurry of rhetoric – as a ‘Republick of Pirates’, a ‘new-modell’d Government’, and a ‘new structur’d Commonwealth’ seems to deliberately confuse and mock the pretensions of the pirates to both established and new forms of state legitimacy. This is not, however, all that the text yields. This mockery of their island posturing is part of the text’s farther-reaching engagement with the distinction of the pirate at the more fundamental level of natural law.</p>
<p>The definition of piracy has always been an unusually political point of law. In his authoritative account of the <italic>Law of Piracy</italic> (1988), Alfred P. Rubin clarifies that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Piracy to the Romans was a descriptive noun for the practices of a… people whose views of law and intercommunity relations… had become an obstacle to Roman trade and inconsistent with Roman views of the world order under Roman hegemony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474474011427362">51</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Piracy has also always been a term of imperial art, and no-where is this more intricately if unsurprisingly revealed than in the legal and political narratives that surrounded the trial of Every’s crew. While Every himself was never captured and his fate remains unconfirmed – although not un-mythologized – six of his crew were brought to trial at the Old Bailey in 1696. When the jury failed to convict them of piracy on account of their capture of the <italic>Ganj-i-Sawai</italic> and the <italic>Fateh Muhammed</italic>, another trial was swiftly arranged. The men were again tried for piracy, this time for the taking of the <italic>Charles II</italic> in 1693 – on which they were employed, Every as first mate – which they renamed the <italic>Fancy</italic>, and used to capture the Mughal ships. The jury delivered the ‘correct’ verdict, and the men were executed. Rubin refers to the case, Rex v. Dawson, as ‘the one most frequently quoted [in UK law] for its charge to a grand jury defining “piracy”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474474011427362">52</xref></sup> With an intimation of perplexity, he concludes that ‘presumably it has been so often cited because so broad’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474474011427362">53</xref></sup> And indeed, while this may be the case, and as Rubin attests, the full breadth of its definition of piracy had no precedent and has not in fact generated a wider precedent. While the application and enforcement of the law of piracy has always been intractably complex, by the early modern period across Europe it was essentially defined as an attack by one ship on another ship, motivated only by private-gain, conducted without the license of a state: a definition that is consolidated in the current UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474474011427362">54</xref></sup> Mutiny (not to mention Terrorism) was and is a different crime, but one that is specifically comprehended in the Rex v. Dawson definition: ‘Now piracy is only a sea-term for robbery… If any mariners of any ship shall violently dispossess the master, and afterwards carry away the ship itself, or any of the goods, or tackle, apparel or furniture, with a felonious intention… this is also piracy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474474011427362">55</xref></sup> As Douglass R. Burgess points out in his exploration of the historical significance of the trial, it was of the highest political importance that the attack on the Mughal ships should lead to widely publicized convictions for piracy. Burgess tracks the turns by which due process was obscured and the law stretched in pursuit of this aim, although he is most interested in the trial record itself as evidence of a newly emerging practice of state: ‘the publication of the piracy trials of Henry Every’s crew provides an early example of media manipulation on a grand scale’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474474011427362">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Burgess’s reading, ‘the trial’s stated purpose was to do justice to the victims of Every’s crime: the Great Mughal and his people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474474011427362">57</xref></sup> However, it is not in these terms that the trial record most forcefully promotes an image of England’s new intolerance of piracy. Indeed, the trial record more dismisses and obscures than acknowledges the Mughal ‘and his people’ as the victims of the crime. In his opening address to the Jury, the King’s Council states that the taking of the <italic>Ganj-i-Sawai</italic> is,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Like to be the most pernicious in its consequences, especially as to Trade, considering the Power of the great Mogull, and the natural Inclination of the Indians to Revenge… for suffer Pirates, and the Commerce of the World must cease, which this Nation has deservedly so great a share in, and reaps such mighty advantage by: And if they shall go away unpunished… the consequence may be… the total Loss of the Indian Trade, and thereby, the impoverishment of this Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474474011427362">58</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The crime is most abhorrent as an act against the English trader and consumer. Where piracy may once have been tolerated as promoting England’s power and trading advantage, the trial record, keying the nation as the most important victim of piracy, declares that this is not the case in the closing decades of the 17th century. (In Nutting’s analysis, this message is perhaps most forcefully aimed at a constituency of distant colonial administrators in the habit of treating pirates with leniency, and is delivered through the efforts – in the closing years of the 18th century – of various statutory measures aimed at consolidating the law across territories.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474474011427362">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Piracy as a term of common and statutory law may always have been exceptionally vulnerable to political agendas, particularly in the late 17th and early 18th centuries as conventions of maritime encounter were settling into patterns that served the consolidation of a regime of nation-states. This is demonstrated by the trials of Every’s men. But the pirate is also a more abstract figure that has long haunted the fringes and defined the limits of legal theory. As a term of legal theoretical art, a pirate is an absolute out-law. In ancient and modern definition, he and occasionally she is someone who operates outside all laws and the laws of everyone. The pirate is, in Cicero’s well-known formulation, ‘the enemy of all’. But the etymology of the word ‘pirate’ is still a matter of debate. One dominant idea is that it derives from the Greek verb <italic>peiraō</italic>, meaning ‘to test’, to try’, or ‘to put to proof’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474474011427362">60</xref></sup> This derivation is evocative, and resonates through recent scholarly comprehensions of Every as a figure whose actions proved structures of governance and legal geographies. It also emphasizes that it is the pirate’s close proximity-to rather than distance-from the law that has compelled so many legal theorists. This is a particularly acute point in the development of modern theses of natural law.</p>
<p>By the early 18th century, a secular language of natural law was a prominent and mature feature of public and intellectual life in Britain. Thomas Hobbes’s <italic>The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic</italic> was published in 1650, and <italic>Leviathan</italic> in 1651: and John Locke’s <italic>Questions Concerning the Law of Nature</italic> was published in 1664. Heavily informing the arguments of Hobbes and Locke is the work of Hugo Grotius (between the last of the 16th and early decades of the 17th century) and Alberico Gentili (in the first decades of the 16th century), who are still commonly cited by historians, lawyers and philosophers as the founding father of international and human rights law. Discourse on the law of piracy is still fundamentally structured by the differences between the positivist ideas of Gentili and Grotius’s later natural law thesis. For both writers, Cicero’s declaration that the pirate is the enemy of all, and that normal laws of war therefore cannot apply to pirates, is a fundamental principle of international law. They are never a legitimate combatant, and so can never legitimately take life or property. For Gentili, any seizure of life or property not authorized by a sovereign state is piracy: and a sovereign state exists by virtue of being recognized by other sovereign states. As Rubin glosses Gentili’s thesis,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No degree of political organization or goal could make a ‘rebel’ into a lawful combatant or require the application of the laws of war to the struggle against the rebel army. A tool of enormous power was placed in the hands of ‘sovereigns’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474474011427362">61</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Grotius, however, the definition between pirates and states is far more uncertain. For the natural law thinker, the difference is not determined by the practice of other states in giving or withholding recognition: it is yielded by the nature of the community itself. A pirate takes life and property in pursuit of private gain, and a community is piratical if this is its purpose. But in Grotius’s thinking, a community has the capacity to become a sovereign state when it is formed for a range of other peaceful political and social purposes. It follows that if the purpose of the community shifts, then a pirate community may become a state. As Rubin glosses this aspect of Grotius’s thesis, ‘a “transformation” [<italic>mutatio</italic>] may take place with regard to individual chieftains of brigand bands [<italic>praedonum ducibus</italic>] who become “lawful chiefs” [<italic>justi duces</italic>] in some cases, and also to whole communities by mere evolution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1474474011427362">62</xref></sup> There are other, much debated, differences between the Gentili and Grotius on the lineaments of international law, and on the crucial place of pirates within/without this legal scheme. But it is the potential legal capacity of the pirate community to naturally metamorphose into a nation and act as a state that seems to have compelled the writer of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic>. And as for Grotius, the writer’s exploration of the principles of natural law is heavily determined by the physical nature of oceanic geographies. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1474474011427362">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>After first arriving in his retreat off Madagascar and having established relations with the Island ‘Potentates’, Avery sets sail ‘for the neighbouring Isles, which lay contiguous, and interspers’d in those Seas, not far from one another, some which were of dangerous Access, others afforded convenient Harbours, but all of ‘em in general were found to abound with most Necessaries of Life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1474474011427362">64</xref></sup> The location of his stronghold is identified later in the text as ‘the Aethiopian Sea’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1474474011427362">65</xref></sup> It is, then, a different oceanic geography from the site – ‘the Indian Sea’ – in which he and his men attacked the Mughal ships. In his work on the changing conventions of global hydrography, Martin Lewis describes how, in the early modern period, it was common ‘to conceptualize certain “seas” or even “oceans” as segments of water situated off an eponymous area of land, rather than, as modern geography has it, distinct bodies of water partially separated from other waters by intervening lands’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1474474011427362">66</xref></sup> By the early 1700s,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many, if not most, European cartographers had come to depict named oceans not as distinct basins but as stretches of water linking one basin to another…. We are so accustomed to viewing ocean basins as given features of global geography that it seems almost perverse to delimit sea space in accordance with intervening lands… But the ocean-arc concept is not without its virtues. When considering oceans not as physical units but rather as spaces of human activity, ocean arcs can elucidate patterns obscured in the basin schema… One could argue that as Atlantic-based slave and plantation economies extended to Réunion and Mauritius, they effectively carved out an ‘Ethiopian Ocean’ that did indeed stretch from the (modern) South Atlantic to the Mascarene Islands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1474474011427362">67</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> evidences this emerging economic and legal configuration. In doing so, it offers a narrative that apparently mediates between the ideas of Gentili and Grotius. Madagascar is certainly not presented as a politically and legally isolated haven of alternative social structures, but is rather positioned as part of a thriving network of trading islands and states that conform to Grotius’s vision of a natural law of nations. Establishing the pirates on a small island off the coast rather than on mainland Madagascar allows the narrative to position them as smoothly entering and embedding themselves in this natural, regional order: Madagascar is not envisioned as an island off East Africa, but as the largest of a regional group of connected trading posts and recognizable state structures that is partly connected to, but significantly disconnected from, the ‘Indian Seas’ in which the BEIC was ascendant. However, the curious weight given to the evocation of the Madagascan state indicates that Avery needs the recognition of another fully-fledged Sovereign in order to establish his own recognizable government. This narrative pursues Gentili’s ideas that a polity can only be a state through a custom of recognition. So the author of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> seems to use regional hydrography to recognize both positive and natural law theories of state interaction. This has the effect of legitimating the comic ease and speed with which Avery forms his new state, not out of a long national or autochthonous history, but more through physical location within regional patterns of trade and negotiation. However, the final third of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> tracks an expansion of Avery’s modest position over, not just the pirates, but Madagascar as a whole. This final part carries a note of inevitability, indicating that each political and legal shift is a necessary part of a natural process. But it also carries a note of increasing disapproval and derision that undermines this process as given by a morally sound law of nature.</p>
<p>Following his investiture as ‘Doge’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1474474011427362">68</xref></sup> an attempted coup by a French pirate who has been welcomed into the ‘Commonwealth’ threatens the ‘Constitution’. The coup is swiftly quashed, and the narrator notes that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As Plots are for the Use and Confirmation of Governments, when unsuccessful, so was this highly to the Advantage of the Captain and his new Dignity;… the great Council of the Island agreed, one and all, to pass such wholesome Acts in his Favour, as rais’d him to a Pitch of Sovereignty not any ways inferior to the greatest Potentates… he saw himself invested with a Power as despotick as one of the most arbitrary Principles could wish for, or the highest Ambition could have in View.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1474474011427362">69</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The effect here is curious. The structure of the narrative indicates that the uprising is necessary to the full maturing of a strong government, realized in the King-making of Avery. The narrative at this point can be read as baldly Hobbesian: a group of pirates – the epitome and very definition of self-interested men – agreeing to subject themselves to a strong state in order to maximize and protect their own ends. This is emphatically the perspective of the later fiction, <italic>The King of Pirates</italic>, in which all sense of personal relationship and geographical apprehension is defeated by hard, intricate and boring accounts of the agreements and laws by which the men protect themselves against one another, or contrive to act together only to ensure individual gain. In that fiction, the pirate ship, the sea, and Madagascar are all obscured by the foregrounding of men protecting their treasure chests. However, while <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> is also remarkably short on scenes of sympathy, it does not succumb to such a reductive vision.</p>
<p>The tone of <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> is less dully accepting than cynical in its final vision of governance. The final three paragraphs of Avery’s story tell of how,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He had nothing short of the Regal Authority, but a Right to exercise it… he not only coin’d Money with his own Impress upon it, but took him the Stile, in his Edicts and Declarations, that is to be made use of by Sovereign Princes… to gratify his Ambition by not having any Thing like a Competitor, [he] wag’d War with the King of the Country, that so handsomely receiv’d him at his first coming to it, and having reduc’d him, makes him now live under the Denomination of a Subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1474474011427362">70</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense here is that Avery has exceeded and distorted the Grotian natural order in which he first so smoothly moved. On the other hand, the inevitability of Avery’s ascendency suggests that it is in the nature of man to so exceed and distort such orders: he had nothing short of ‘Authority’ but ‘Right’. However, the universality and inevitability of this idea is undercut by the large amount of text that is given to the telling of Avery’s essential and growing character. This does not limit the argument to the individual man, but nuances the text’s critique of its final object: the trading company.</p>
<p>In giving Avery a story in which he is born to loving parents ‘noted for their Industry, than their birth’, brought up by an aunt who ‘surpassed the Mother (if it were possible) in Tokens of Affection’, Avery is presented as an infant of ‘a very forward Genius’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1474474011427362">71</xref></sup> Under this careful attention, he becomes both a ‘daring and commanding’ and ‘tyrannical’ child: ‘Obedience to his Superiors, was as little consonant to his Character, as a moderate and obliging Behaviour to his Inferiors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1474474011427362">72</xref></sup> Avery goes to sea at the age of eleven, and proves himself in various situations aboard a number of ships: the narrative increasingly uses terms of courage, prudence and justice to describe his developing character as he moves from the navy into merchant service and then into piracy. He is portrayed as becoming a natural and charismatic leader of men, who ‘without the least Uneasiness, had the Art of gaining the Affections of the Mariners, and shewing his Authority, without weakening their Inclinations for his having the Exercise of it’: he is admired for his ‘strong natural judgment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1474474011427362">73</xref></sup> This promise is only partly diverted by his faithless wife, and this personal betrayal is portrayed as the contingent event which turns him to piracy and returns him to his charismatic – but also potentially tyrannical and childish – nature. That he later marries the captured granddaughter of the Mogul (one of the probable fictions that has become an embedded aspect of the historical story of the capture of the <italic>Ganj-i-Sawai</italic>) ‘not without her Consent’ and ‘after the Custom of those Foreigners’ not only redeems his earlier marriage and softens the lawlessness of his capture of the Mogul’s ship, but it binds his ascendency to the dynasties of the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1474474011427362">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>In telling the story of an island monarch, it is at some level hard not to read <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> as speaking to Britain’s fragile constitution in the early 18th century. Located on an island offshore, the text allows a metaphorical reading in which Madagascar stands not for Britain (as it does explicitly in the shrunken, stage-sized, conquered Madagascar of <italic>The Successful Pyrate</italic>) but for Europe: it is explicitly figured as a site of different peoples and multiple states. However, this characterization of Madagascar is not encouraged by the text. As the analysis above has indicated, ‘the state’ that is most present and significantly contingent in the text; that is articulated in the central narrative as nurturing generations of men, as a source of pardon, as a rescuer, as a proximate threat and competitor is not the British Crown, but the Company. As a critique of the proper and natural limits of a state’s growth, it is to this body politic that <italic>The Life and Adventures</italic> seems to be directed. Returning to the parable of Alexander and the Pirate, the question becomes whether the text supports the legitimacy of the pirate, or the illegitimacy of the company’s pretensions to power. That the text is highly aware of the rhetorical switches through which the legal linguistics of piracy operates is not just suggested by the high circulation of this parable – as indicated by Johns – and by the parallels between parable and text. This awareness is clearly explicated when Avery is described not – via Cicero’s classic legal definition – as ‘the enemy of all’, but in the recognition that ‘all the World were his Enemies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1474474011427362">75</xref></sup> Less a fiery pirate than an embattled founder of state, the text seems to endorse a Grotian vision of natural law.</p>
<p>Read allegorically, the telling of Avery’s personal biography can be understood as a confirmation – limited and endorsed under natural law and by the nature of men – of the shifty parallel legitimacies of traders and pirates to become constitutional states (if not unfettered monarchs). However, returning to the frame narrative – the prefatory acknowledgement of the Reader and the warning mockery of conventional knowledge at the end – the central narrative must be read more cautiously. Or at least, the central narrative must be read as offering the story for critique rather than as a piece of propaganda. If even natural law yields high power to trader-pirates and pirate-traders, then perhaps only the Reader is left as a morally certain holder of property: ‘every Reader takes a Priviledge in censuring what he buys, which is really his own by that purchase’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1474474011427362">76</xref></sup></p>
