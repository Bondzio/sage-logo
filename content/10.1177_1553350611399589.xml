<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An estimated 100 million indwelling urethral catheters are sold worldwide on an annual basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611399589">1</xref></sup> Approximately 25% of patients cared for in acute-care hospitals will have an indwelling catheter at some point during their hospital admission, and 7% of nursing home residents are managed by long-term indwelling catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611399589">2</xref></sup> The choice and availability of these catheters in both the hospital and community settings is often determined by catheter cost and hospital preferences rather than evidence based.</p>
<p>Unlike an external urinary drainage system such as condom catheter, an indwelling catheter is an invasive device and is associated with significant complications ranging from catheter-related urinary tract infections to encrustation, balloon malfunction and trauma with urethritis, false passage, erosion and stricture, as well as bladder spasms or risk of bladder malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611399589">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611399589"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611399589">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clean intermittent catheterization is the preferred option in patients with chronic urinary retention because of fewer complications associated with long-term catheterization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611399589">2</xref></sup> Many patients with acute urinary retention, however, often only require short-term urinary catheterization. Having a urinary catheter in situ incurs potential problems such as bacteriuria, encrustation, urethritis, or urethral stricture. When the catheter balloon is deflated, it creases and ridges resulting in the phenomenon of balloon cuffing. Often these catheters cuffing lead to catheter entrapment and pain on removal. At present, there is minimal research into the phenomenon of balloon cuffing that occurs following deflation of catheter balloon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611399589">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although several expert propositions into the deflation methods have been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611399589">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611399589">6</xref></sup> there is no published literature on the direct comparison of these suggested methods. This study aims to determine whether different methods of balloon deflation, exposure to different urine media, and the types of urinary catheters play a significant role in catheter balloon cuffing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350611399589" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Method and Materials</title>
<p>Four commonly used 100% silicone material catheters namely Bardex (Bard, Covington, GA), Bard-Lubri-Sil (Bard, Covington, GA), Argyle (Tyco, Argyle, NY), and Releen (Coloplast, Mount Waverley, Australia) as well as hydrogel-coated latex catheter Biocath (Bard, Covington, GA) were funded by the respective pharmaceutical companies and tested during this study. Ten milliliters of sterile water was used to inflate the urinary catheter balloon. These urinary catheters were immersed in either a solution of sterile urine or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>–inoculated urine media at a constant temperature of 37°C for 1, 14, and 28 days. The <italic>E coli</italic> inoculated media were prepared and cultured in brain heart infusion broth; incubated, retested, and/or replaced at day 14 and 28 to ensure &gt;10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units of bacteria per milliliter (CFU/mL) in the urine culture media. A total of 300 urinary catheters were prepared for different duration of exposure to sterile and <italic>E coli</italic>–inoculated media. During each study interval time, a total of 20 urinary catheters from each designated material type would be deflated with the 4 different methods: 5 catheters were deflated using active deflation of balloon (rapid deflation of balloon within 5 seconds); 5 catheters with passive deflation (very slow active deflation over 30 seconds); 5 catheters with passive autodeflation by attaching an empty syringe to the balloon inflow channel to allow for gentle autodeflation; and 5 catheters with excision of the balloon inflow channel. The amount of water aspirated from the balloon channel was also recorded.</p>
<p>Objective catheter balloon cuffing was assessed by dragging the deflated catheter balloon over a plate of agar 10 times at 5cm/s to determine if the catheter cuff cause scratch mark on the agar plate. As none of the urinary catheter cuff caused significant destruction of the agar plate irrespective of the degree of catheter balloon cuffing, the degree of scratching on the agar plate was classified as “superficial” if there was surface abrasion only and “deep” if the scratch resulted in fissuring of the agar plate. On the other hand, subjective assessment of urinary catheter cuffing was performed by 3 independent observers who were blinded to the types of catheters, urine media, and catheter deflation methods. A total of 3 runs of test were performed with the mean value recorded. The catheter balloon cuffing was measured using a designated scale of 0 to 5 with 0 showing no balloon cuffing on naked eyes and 5 with severe balloon cuffing causing significant scratch on agar plate. These scores were later converted into percentages score (0%, no cuffing; 20%, minor cuffing of catheter balloon; 40%, moderate cuffing of catheter balloon; 60%, significant cuffing of catheter balloon; 80%, significant cuffing with superficial scratches on agar plate; and 100%, significant cuffing with deep scratches on agar plate) to facilitate further statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Windows SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) manager program to determine whether the types of catheters tested, time of immersion in urine media, different methods of catheter deflation, and presence of infected urine affect the likelihood of balloon cuffing. A linear regression model analysis was conducted to evaluate if any of the factors played a significant role in catheter balloon cuffing.</p>

<title>Catheter Balloons Volume Loss</title>
<p>Following immersion in different types of urine media, it appeared that all catheter balloons lose some volume during the duration of study. The greatest amount of volume loss was with Bardex by almost 15% decrease in water balloon to 8.5 mL and least in Releen catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611399589">Figure 1</xref>). The presence of infected urine media appeared to have a greater effect on catheter balloon water diffusion although this was not significant when compared with sterile urine (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<title>Types of Catheter</title>
<p>Bardex, Argyle, and Biocath showed greater degree of catheter balloon cuffing than Bard-Lubri-Sil and Releen (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Bardex catheter exhibited the most significant amount of balloon cuffing (at 100%) by day 28, and this was more pronounced in the infected urine media.

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Foley first described a self-retaining balloon catheter for hemostasis after prostatectomy in 1929; which was later modified for bladder drainage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611399589">7</xref></sup> Although the basic design of Foley catheter remained similar, many different materials have been used. Catheters for longer term use are currently manufactured from either latex, coated with hydrogel or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or silicone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611399589">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The latex Foley catheters, including those coated with PTFE or hydrogel, are considered as soft catheters whereas the all-silicone catheter is more rigid in nature. PTFE- or hydrogel-coated catheters were introduced in an effort to improve the surface smoothness of catheters and provide insulation for the urethra against latex thereby reducing the risk of latex reaction in sensitive patients as well as reducing inflammatory changes to urethral mucosa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611399589">8</xref></sup> These coated latex catheters were thought to have lesser rate of water absorption as compared with silicone catheters, which are more prone to slow balloon deflation due to water diffusion through the balloon membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611399589">9</xref></sup> Latex catheters have been associated with a higher rate of encrustation and outflow blockage as it swells up with water absorption. On the other hand, silicone catheters have larger lumen than those made of latex; these larger diameter silicone catheters may delay encrustation and catheter blockage by reducing the deposition of protein and mucous on catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611399589">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies examining catheters after removal have revealed that the self-retaining balloons had not deflated to their original shape but had formed a “cuff” around the catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611399589">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611399589">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611399589"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611399589">11</xref></sup> These creases or ridges on the deflated balloon surfaces can cause some resistance to withdrawal where the cuff catches onto the soft tissue within the urethra, preventing smooth removal of the catheter and causing discomfort to the patients. Forceful removal of a catheter that has been entrapped due to balloon cuffing can result in extensive urethral trauma. In vitro assessment using quantitative technique on suprapubic profilometry readings on urinary catheters by Parkin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611399589">10</xref></sup> confirmed an increased resistance to catheters withdrawal because of the formation of a cuff on deflation of the balloon.</p>
<p>There are several hypotheses on balloon cuffing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611399589">10</xref></sup> First, the type of fluid used to inflate the balloon can potentially increase the cuffing risk; normal saline can crystallize around the balloon making deflation and removal difficult and traumatic. Second, it may be the result of inherent differences in the material properties of silicone compared with latex. It has been reported that silicone catheters are at greater risk for developing a cuff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611399589">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611399589">10</xref></sup> Further explanation of cuffing can be attributed to the different manufacturing process of the catheter; whether the balloon was fashioned as an integrated part or separate part of the catheter. As the catheter is being removed, the detrusor muscle may be stimulated causing the bladder wall to contract and tighten its hold on the catheter. This leads to concertina effect by pushing the deflated balloon toward the catheter tip resulting in ridges or creases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611399589">11</xref></sup> In addition, most patients usually tense up during catheter removal, and this aggravates the detrusor stimulation. The manner in which the fluid is aspirated from the catheter balloon itself could also contribute to cuffing phenomenon through suction pressure leading to uneven balloon deflation.</p>
<p>The amount of research into the phenomenon of catheter balloon cuffing is limited. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective comparative study that investigated the interaction between time, types of catheters, and balloon deflation methods on catheter balloon cuffing. Although the authors agree that more objective methods such as scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis should be used to analyze the ultrastructural changes that occur with catheter cuffing, this study was not designed to evaluate trauma to urethral lumen and/or risk of urethral stricture. Parkin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611399589">10</xref></sup> demonstrated in a clinical audit that there was a strong correlation between subjective assessments of urinary catheter balloon cuffing and the retention rates of catheters as well as subsequent painful removal of urinary catheters. Urinary catheters such as Bard-Lubri-Sil and Releen have shown lesser catheter balloon cuffing and could be attributed to better manufacturing process. Although the presence of infected urine appears to increase the rate of balloon cuffing; this is often difficult to prevent given bacteruria is common after 24 hours of bladder catheterization.</p>
<p>In the current health care system, the cost-effectiveness of certain procedures is often taken into account prior to guideline implementation. This study was not set out to perform a cost-analysis impact of frequent urinary catheter change on patient comfort level. Although it may not be economical for more frequent catheter change and that pain experienced during catheter removal is usually temporary, any means to minimize balloon cuffing can improve the quality of care in patients with long term urinary catheterization. This study shows the use of PTFE- or hydrogel-coated catheters and passive autodeflation or the excision of catheter balloon inflow channel should be advocated to avoid significant catheter cuffing.</p>
<p>There are other parameters that may be associated with cuffing, which was not investigated in this study, such as the different urine biochemical parameters, whether catheter is on continuous free drainage or periodic intermittent drainage with a catheter valve, as well as the bladder mucosa–catheter material in vivo interaction could potentially interrelate and play a role to this cuffing phenomenon. This study does not aim to provide all the answers to the phenomenon of catheter balloon cuffing but rather attempts to highlight some of the more commonly identifiable factors in catheter balloon cuffing.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Catheter cuffing is a common phenomenon with catheter removal, which causes pain and potential trauma to many male patients. This in vitro analysis demonstrated significant differences in variables such as the duration of catheterization, different deflation methods and types of catheters.
