<abstract>
<p>This article examines the impact of party system change in Germany on the role, status and power of the two catch-all parties (CDU/CSU and SPD) in the light of the 2009 federal election. It argues that party system change has had a paradoxical impact. On the one hand, the decline in the overall catch-all vote undermines the two parties’ integrative function. On the other, the presence of three small parties (FDP, Greens, Left Party) means that, with the possible exception of the Greens, no single small party has the potential to be ‘kingmaker’ and, because of their relative positions in ideological space, neither can they act in concert to extract concessions from the two catch-all parties. Thus, despite the impressive performance of the FDP in the 2009 federal election and the electoral meltdown suffered by the SPD, in office-seeking terms the catch-all parties are currently less vulnerable to small party threats of defection to alternative coalitions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘We have achieved our electoral goal’ declared incumbent Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on the evening of the 27 September 2009 federal election in Germany. But, considering that her right-of-centre Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Christian Social Union (CSU) partners had only gained 33.8 percent of the popular vote, down 1.4 percent on an already disappointing performance in the previous federal election in 2005, and far from the mid-to high forties that the CDU/CSU enjoyed in the 1980s, for some observers Merkel’s triumphalism rang a little hollow. On the other hand, the CDU/CSU’s electoral goals of exit from the deeply unpopular Grand Coalition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810386841">Saalfeld, 2009</xref>) and the replacement of its erstwhile coalition partners the left-of-centre Social Democrats with the economically liberal Free Democrats (FDP) were achieved. And the CDU/CSU could take satisfaction in avoiding the electoral meltdown experienced by the SPD, which only won 23 percent of the vote, down 11.2 percent from 2005 and a long way from its best electoral performance of 45.8 percent in 1972.</p>
<p>Analyses of the 2009 federal election demonstrate that the SPD suffered a haemorrhage of support to the Left Party (on 11.9 percent, up from 8.7 percent in 2005), the Greens (on 10.7 percent, up from 8.1 percent in 2005) and the resurgent FDP (on 14.6 percent, significantly up from 9.8 percent in 2005). In addition, many former SPD voters failed to vote at all and it was estimated that, taking voter exchange and falling overall turnout into account, the SPD had ‘lost’ 10 million voters since 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810386841">Albrecht, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810386841">Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, 2009</xref>). Thus, the SPD is now presented with a multidimensional strategic dilemma. If it is to regain power in the future, it is not sufficient just to tack to the left or to the centre to regain support; it must in effect widen its appeal to the left, the centre and to the non-voters who, albeit from a low base, are becoming an increasingly significant element within the German electorate. This is not an easy task, but neither is it impossible.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810386841">Table 1</xref>
 gives the full results of the 2009 and 2005 federal elections and the percentage changes between them. Niedermayer asserts that we have seen the emergence in the Federal Republic of a ‘fluid party system’ (2006), while, elsewhere, it has been argued that this new configuration is the result of four factors: first, a decline in the overall vote and seat-share for the CDU/CSU and SPD; second, an increased level of fragmentation in the party system; third, a skew in the party system to the left that has shifted the position of the median legislator away from the FDP; and, fourth, the emergence of a new territorial cleavage associated with German Unification (Lees, 2008). Of these four features, the steady decline in the overall vote-share of the CDU/CSU and SPD – Germany’s catch-all parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810386841">Kirchheimer, 1966</xref>) – has prompted the most alarm. This is because, in the context of the Federal Republic, the German variant of the catch-all parties, the ‘Volksparteien’ (‘People’s parties’) are regarded as performing a key integrative function that is linked to the stability and legitimacy of the democratic order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810386841">Smith, 1986</xref>).</p>

<p>In the light of the 2009 federal election, this article assesses the impact of the changes noted above on the role, status and relative power of the two Volksparteien and argues that their decline in vote-share has had a paradoxical impact. On the one hand, the decline in the overall Volkspartei vote undermines their integrative function. On the other hand, the article argues that, in purely instrumental terms – and notwithstanding the current parlous position of the SPD – changes to the composition and dynamics of the German party system have the potential to enhance the strategic position of the two big Volksparteien in terms of the process of coalition formation. Thus, whereas in the 1960s and 1970s the two catch-all parties were forced to bargain with the liberal FDP, which often acted as the ‘kingmaker’ within the party system, the subsequent emergence of the left-libertarian/ecological Greens and the more orthodox left-wing PDS (subsequently the Left Party) means that, with the possible exception of the Greens (a possibility discussed later in the article), no single small party can be kingmaker. Moreover, because of their relative positions in ideological space, the small parties cannot readily act in concert to extract concessions from the two Volksparteien. Thus, this article makes the counter-intuitive claim that, even in the context of an undoubtedly impressive electoral performance by the FDP, the Volksparteien are currently less vulnerable to threats of a decisive defection by one small party to an alternative coalition.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is structured as follows. In the next section, I map out party system change over the past 30 years, with an emphasis on the four types of change described above. Following this, I analyse the new strategic environment generated by these changes and develop my argument about why these are to the advantage of the two Volksparteien. I then pursue these themes and make three key points. First, despite its current parliamentary strength, the longer term structural position of the FDP within the German party system remains significantly weaker than it was in the past. Second, given the existence of self-restrictions imposed by political parties on real-world coalition games, it is possible (but by no means certain) that in the future the Greens might act as kingmaker within a restricted set of coalition options. Third, that a key factor in determining the shape of future coalition games will be the performance of the SPD and that its current poor performance is clearly reversible in the medium term. The article concludes with a summary of the arguments and some suggestions for further research.</p>

<title>Party system change in the Federal Republic</title>
<p>In Germany, the cleavage conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810386841">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>) that persist today, albeit in a modified fashion, are those of class and religion. The class cleavage has been ameliorated through post-war prosperity and the development of welfare capitalism and, as a result, social class alone is no longer a reliable predictor of voter preferences unless buttressed by trade union membership. The weakened class cleavage remains cross-cut by a persistent confessional cleavage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810386841">Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, 1976–2005</xref>) and the impact of both are modified through electoral dealignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810386841">Padgett, 1993</xref>; after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810386841">Converse and Valen et al., 1971</xref>) and also as a result of the emergence of the associated but analytically distinct phenomenon of post-materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810386841">Dalton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810386841">Flanagan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810386841">Inglehart, 1990</xref>). The impact of these changes was amplified by German Unification in 1990 and was reflected in the four features of party system change noted above.</p>
<p>Starting with the first feature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810386841">Figure 1</xref>
 tracks the overall share of the second vote won by the two Volksparteien at federal elections since 1949. The data demonstrate four distinct features. First, although the two parties only won 60.2 percent of the total vote in 1949, their combined share of the vote rose steadily over subsequent elections, reflecting their success as agents of political integration in a polity that, prior to 1949, had only limited experience of democracy during the Weimar Republic period and had just emerged from 16 years of dictatorship, war, defeat and foreign occupation. Second, over the eight elections from 1961 through to 1987, the Volksparteien consistently won over 80 percent of the vote and, in 1976, even managed to gain 91.2 percent of the vote. This reflects the relatively high levels of system legitimacy and associated voter satisfaction that were one of the fruits of the economic miracle that came to define the former West Germany. Third, from the early 1990s onwards, we see a slippage in the overall share of the Volkspartei vote. The slippage was initially modest, but in the 2005 federal election the two parties’ vote-share fell to 69.4 percent and, in the 2009 federal election, it reached an all-time low of 56.8 percent. As will be discussed later in this article, such a low figure, if repeated in subsequent elections, would place the Volkspartei model under considerable pressure in terms of the normative and integrative roles that the two parties are expected to perform and which are central to their own sense of place within the German political settlement. Finally, and moving on from the last point, in as far as we can discriminate between the two Volksparteien in performing these functions, the CDU/CSU has clearly been more successful than the SPD in commanding a dominant share of the vote. With the exceptions of the 1972 and 1998 federal elections, in which the SPD’s share of the vote (45.8 and 40.9 percent, respectively) exceeded that of the CDU/CSU (44.9 and 35.1 percent), the SPD has been a weaker electoral force than its centre-right competitor.<sup>

</fig>
<p>Moving on to the second feature, the rise and subsequent decline in the Volkspartei vote is reflected in patterns of party system fragmentation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810386841">Figure 2</xref>
 presents Herfindahl–Hirschman Indices (HHIs) for the German party system over the period 1949 to 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068810386841">2</xref>
</sup> On a scale of 0 (total fragmentation) to 1 (one-party rule), the mean HHI for the period is 0.38, with a high point of party system fragmentation (0.25) in 1949 followed by a period of ongoing consolidation leading to a high point of cohesion (0.45) in 1969. Such high levels of cohesion remained following the 1972 (0.43), 1976 (0.43), 1980 (0.41) and 1983 (0.40) elections. The data then demonstrate a modest increase in fragmentation in the 1987 election (0.36), but the immediate impact of unification was in fact a small increase in levels of cohesion (0.38) following the first all-German federal election in 1990. Subsequently, however, the data reveal slightly higher levels of fragmentation in the 1994 (0.34) and 1998 (0.34) elections, before the 2002 election (0.36) resulted in an increase in levels of cohesion. This trend accelerated in the 2005 (0.29) and 2009 (0.25) elections.</p>

</fig>
<p>In terms of the third feature, we can nevertheless identify a clear leftward shift along the dominant left–right ideological axis of the German party system. As has already been touched upon, the development of the German party system since 1949 has two clear phases. First, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810386841">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810386841">2</xref> demonstrate, we can see a 30-year period of ongoing party system concentration, in which the party system is dominated by the two big Volksparteien. Second, despite the fact that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810386841">Figure 2</xref> showed no huge changes in overall levels of party system fragmentation at this point, we can identify a phase in which two systemic junctures saw new political actors entering the party system, leading to a shift in the centre of gravity within it towards the political left. The first of these junctures took place in 1983, with the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens; the second took place in the federal election of 1990, following Unification, in which the PDS – the successors to the ruling party in the German Democratic Republic – established itself in the new all-German Bundestag. As discussed later in this article, during the period of party system concentration the FDP occupied a median position on the left–right axis within the legislature and therefore acted as kingmaker within the party system. However, the entry of the Greens and PDS into the legislature shifted the median legislator to the left and undermined the FDP’s kingmaker role.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068810386841">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In terms of the fourth feature, although the increase in party system fragmentation and leftward shift in the party system starts before unification, the emergence of a clear territorial cleavage within the party system is a direct result of the coming together of the two Germanys. As a result, up until at least a decade and a half after unification, there were two very distinct types of party system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810386841">Lees, 2005</xref>). In most of the old federal states there was a four-party system, made up of the Greens, SPD, CDU/CSU and FDP. By contrast, in most of the new federal states there was a three-party system made up of the PDS, SPD and CDU. However, in so far as we can extrapolate from recent state parliament elections, the distinction between old and new federal states is slowly becoming less clear-cut. Of particular note is the manner in which, following the re-branding of the PDS and its merger with the Electoral Alternative for Social Justice (WASG), the newly established Left Party made limited inroads into party systems in old federal states such as Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse and Lower Saxony, thus blurring the east–west divide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1354068810386841">
<title>The changing strategic environment</title>
<p>In the 1970s, when the Volksparteien vote peaked, the West German party system was held in high regard for its cohesion, generated by two ‘balanced clusters’ of the incumbent SPD–FDP coalition (which lasted from 1969 to 1982) and the CDU/CSU in opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810386841">Smith, 1979</xref>: 135). Prior to 1966, and again after 1982, the polarity of this balance was reversed and the CDU/CSU–FDP coalition faced an SPD opposition. For a brief period from 1966 to 1969 a surplus majority Grand Coalition held office but, until the electoral arithmetic following the 2005 federal election forced a reprise, the Grand Coalition option was not a preferred one for any of the mainstream political parties.</p>
<p>The ‘triangular’ party system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810386841">Pappi, 1984</xref>) of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s allowed for competition and cooperation along one of three issue dimensions. First, as had been the case in the period up until 1966 and again from 1982 to 1998, the CDU/CSU and FDP could cooperate along the dimension of ‘bourgeois issues’ such as economic growth and prosperity. Second, as during the period 1969–82, the SPD and FDP could cooperate along the ‘social–liberal’ dimension of individual and collective rights. Finally, as during the Grand Coalition of 1966–69, the SPD and CDU/CSU were able to cooperate along the ‘corporatist’ dimension, based on consensual policy-making and the cooption of the social partners. But, putting this latter suboptimal solution to one side, the default coalition arrangement was one of the two Volksparteien in coalition with the FDP, the core function of which, despite the absence of significant and socially grounded electoral support, was to act as the ‘kingmaker’ or pivot party within the system. Interestingly, however, even within this relatively consensual system, political parties imposed self-restrictions on their coalition options – ruling out particular coalition options before federal elections for programmatic reasons. Thus, in Rikerian terms, coalition outcomes were not always ‘minimum winning’ coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810386841">Riker, 1962</xref>) but rather – such as when CDU/CSU–FDP coalitions formed in 1961, 1965 and 1982 – ‘minimal winners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810386841">von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944</xref>) in that alternative SPD–FDP coalitions were mathematically feasible in all three instances and would have had smaller majorities. However, the key point here is that during this period, with the exception of the period of the Grand Coalition between 1966 and 1969, the FDP was decisive within all real-world coalition outcomes. The FDP’s leverage was based on the credible threat or even, as was the case in 1982 when the FDP brought down an incumbent SPD–FDP coalition, the reality of defection from the coalition and the formation of an alternative coalition with the other Volkspartei. The reality was, despite the pretensions of the Volksparteien as catch-all parties to express the political will of the people, the ability to exercise that will in government was in the hands of a party elected by less than 10 percent of the population.</p>
<p>The extent of the FDP’s kingmaker function during this period is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354068810386841">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1354068810386841">4</xref>
. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354068810386841">Figure 3</xref> sets out the number of minimal winning coalitions and coalitions with ‘swing’ following German federal elections over the period 1949 to 2009. The concept of a coalition with swing is derived from Power Index analysis and describes the number of coalitions in which a party is able to transform a winning into a losing coalition by its defection from a coalition (or vice-versa). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354068810386841">Figure 3</xref> reconfirms the extent to which the German party system was consolidated over the post-war period. Thus, following the first federal election in 1949, there were 26 minimal winning coalitions and 197 coalitions with swing, yet, by 1961, this had reduced to three minimal winners and three coalitions with swing: the classic triangular party system of the Pappi model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1354068810386841">Figure 4</xref> sets out the standardized Banzhaf scores for the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP over the same period.

<p>However, the entry of the Greens into the Bundestag in 1983, followed by the PDS in 1990, undermined the FDP’s kingmaker role. The arrival of the Greens increased the number of minimal winning coalitions to four and the number of coalitions with swing to seven. German unification, and the emergence of the PDS, further fragmented the German party system; with 4 minimal winners and 14 coalitions with swing following the first all-German election in 1990 (this pattern was repeated in the 1994 and 1998 elections). The 2002 election produced a distribution of party weights that, interestingly, reduced the number of minimal winners to three and the number of coalitions with swing to 12, but in the 2005 election the number of minimal winners increased to 7, although the number of coalitions with swing remained at 12. Following the 2009 election, the number of minimal winners reduced to 4, but the number of coalitions with swing increased to 14. Thus, although the number of potential minimal winning outcomes is only slightly higher than during the period of the triangular party system of the 1960s and 1970s, the number of coalitions with swing has increased more than fourfold. Moreover, although the number of coalitions with swing has reduced over the last two federal elections, 12 coalitions with swing is a long way from the three outcomes available in the years of the triangular party system. And, crucially, the FDP no longer controls all of the possible minimal connected winners. Similarly, the Banzhaf indices of the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP have fluctuated in the new party political environment generated by the entry of the Greens and PDS/Left Party. Thus, with the entry of the Greens in 1983, the CDU/CSU’s score rose to 0.5, while those of the SPD and FDP fell to 0.1667 (incidentally, the same score as the Greens). These respective Banzhaf scores were replicated in the 1987 and 1994 federal elections, but the overall pattern since 1983 has been one of trendless fluctuation, with both Volksparteien occasionally enjoying Banzhaf scores of 0.5: far higher than in the supposed high point of Volkspartei power in the 1970s. The scores following the 2009 elections are CDU/CSU 0.5, SPD 0.1667 and FDP 0.1667 (Greens 0 and Left Party 0.1667).</p>
<p>Beyond purely office-seeking criteria, the FDP’s former kingmaker function has been further eroded in policy terms by its loss of the median legislator on the dominant left–right axis within the Bundestag. This has been accompanied by the FDP’s own clear re-positioning on the bourgeois side of the party system. The impact of these changes is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810386841">Table 2</xref>
, which shows that the SPD ‘owned’ the left–right median legislator following the 1998, 2002 and 2005 elections, and this median position then passed to the CDU/CSU following the 2009 elections. Thus, following the last four federal elections, one of the two Volksparteien has been ‘Mparty’, without which no ideologically connected majority coalition on the left–right dimension can form, and this should make that party decisive in any coalition game. Moreover, because of the size of the two Volksparteien, since 1998 one of them has also owned the left–right median legislator within the coalition, making it ‘MpartyK’. Given that policy positions should theoretically fall within the interstices of the preference curves of the median legislator in the parliament and median legislator within the coalition, it is assumed that the MpartyK will be decisive in intra-coalition negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810386841">de Swaan, 1973</xref>). Because of its size and the ideological range of the coalitions in which it took part, the FDP never succeeded in being both Mparty and MpartyK. Now, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810386841">Table 2</xref> demonstrates, even the FDP’s structural monopoly as Mparty is very much a thing of the past.</p>

<p>As a result of these developments, Germany now has a genuinely multiparty system in which three smaller parties are able to find niche positions within it. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810386841">Niedermayer’s (2006)</xref> observation, the consensual triangular dynamic of the old Pappi model has been replaced by a more fluid configuration, structured by a still-dominant left–right ideological axis cross-cut by a secondary libertarian–authoritarian axis (Lees, 2008). This second axis is analytically relevant in that it allows the construction of three distinct issue dimensions around which coalition programmes can be categorized (see below). However, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810386841">Table 2</xref> demonstrates, real-world coalition options in the current multiparty environment still tend to be connected along the dominant left–right axis.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1354068810386841">Figure 5</xref>
 sets out the two ideological axes and the three issue dimensions touched upon above. One of these, the corporatist issue dimension, remains from the old Pappi model and provided the context for the Grand Coalition of 2005 to 2009. (Interestingly, this corporatist dimension also potentially encompasses cooperation between the SPD and Left Party, if they were ever to cooperate at the federal level.) Second, there is the possibility of cooperation between the CDU and FDP or, less orthodox in nature, the CDU, FDP and Greens, along the bourgeois issue dimension. This bourgeois issue dimension is the context for the formation of the CDU/CSU–FDP coalition following the 2009 federal election. Third, the ‘new politics’ dimension allows for cooperation between the SPD and Greens, or the SPD, Greens and Left Party. It should be noted that the old ‘social liberal’ issue dimension, which provided the context for cooperation between the SPD and FDP, has been neutralized for the time being by the FDP’s strategic repositioning within the party system and the self-restrictions imposed by political parties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068810386841">5</xref>
</sup> Given these restrictions, the current dynamics of the German party system allows for six politically feasible coalition options: the Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU–SPD); Black–Yellow (CDU/CSU – FDP); Black – Green (CDU/CSU–Greens); ‘Jamaica’ (CDU/CSU – FDP – Greens); Red – Green (SPD – Greens); and Red – Red – Green (SPD – Left Party – Greens). Three other plausible coalition options – Social–Liberal (SPD – FDP); Red–Red (SPD – Left Party) and ‘Traffic Light’ (SPD – Greens – FDP) – are excluded in the context of the 2009 federal election because of self-restrictions imposed by the political parties on the coalition game. However, there is no a priori reason to assume that these three options will remain outside the restricted set of coalition options in the future.</p>

<title>The strategic environment in 2009</title>
<p>As already noted, the Grand Coalition of 2005–09 was a surplus majority coalition. During this period of surplus majority rule, there was a marked difference in the fortunes of the two Volksparteien, with opinion polls showing a slow but steady haemorrhage of support away from the SPD while support for the CDU/CSU remained relatively stable. The two parties entered government with similar levels of support and throughout the early months of the coalition this remained the case, with the CDU/CSU enjoying ratings of 37 percent and the SPD polling a respectable 35 percent. However, by the start of 2006 opinion poll ratings for the two began to diverge and, by April 2006, the CDU/CSU was polling 42 percent, while the SPD had dropped to 31 percent. From that point, support for the two Volksparteien as expressed in opinion polls fluctuated but, in the months preceding the 2009 federal election, the SPD’s performance deteriorated further with the party polling just 23 percent by August 2009, compared to 37 percent for the CDU/CSU. Over the entire period since the 2005 federal election, the CDU/CSU’s mean support has been 38.4 percent, compared with 29.3 percent for the SPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810386841">Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of why the SPD’s support dropped so dramatically is beyond the scope of this article. With hindsight, however, it is clear that the end of the Schröder era in 2005 had profound consequences for the centre–left in Germany. These consequences were threefold. First, the SPD found it exceptionally hard to move on, leading to an internal leadership vacuum and three changes of leader since 2005. Second, it encouraged the emergence and consolidation of a more potent competitor on the SPD’s left flank. The Left Party works explicitly to mobilize those individuals within the electorate who might previously have considered themselves natural SPD voters but felt disenfranchised by Schröder’s Hartz IV supply-side reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810386841">Hough et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810386841">Olsen, 2007</xref>). Thus, over the period from 2005, the Left Party enjoyed a mean poll rating of just over 9 percent. Third, it cast a long shadow over the Greens. Despite four years in opposition, the Greens continued to grapple with the consequences of decisions taken by the Schröder government that undermined the Greens’ image as a pacifist, emancipatory, party, alienated much of their core support and left the party searching for a new and distinct policy programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810386841">Blühdorn, 2009</xref>). As a result, the Greens were the least well supported major party in opinion polls over the period 2005 to 2009, with a mean support of just under 9 percent (although in the month preceding the 2009 federal election this support rose to 12 percent).</p>
<p>All three factors noted above had an impact on the dynamics of party competition, but the key development was undoubtedly the remarkable rise in support for the FDP in the run-up to the 2009 federal election. The party enjoyed a mean poll rating of just under 10 percent over the period from 2005, making it the most popular of the small parties, and it consistently polled between 13 and 15 percent from January to September 2009. As a result of the subsequent electoral performance, the Black–Yellow coalition option (with 342 seats; a surplus majority of 30) presented the CDU/CSU with the most benign configuration of office-seeking and policy-oriented payoffs. Nevertheless, the CDU/CSU also had other options available to it, including of course a re-constitution of the Grand Coalition (with a surplus majority of 83).</p>
<p>The structural advantage enjoyed by the CDU/CSU was reflected in the coalition negotiations between the CDU/CSU and FDP following the 2009 federal election. Guido Westerwelle, the leader of the FDP, entered negotiations adamant that the party would not compromise on key priorities such as revision of the tax system (suggesting (€35 billion of tax cuts), supply-side reforms, and a reorientation of the social insurance system towards individual provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810386841">Schiedermann, 2009</xref>). However, Merkel’s public declaration that she wanted to be ‘Chancellor of all Germans’ and her parallel courting of German labour unions was widely interpreted as an assertion of the CDU/CSU’s position as coalition <italic>formateur</italic>. The subsequent negotiation process took place against the backdrop of rival briefings and disinformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810386841">Hawley, 2009</xref>) and, when the coalition agreement was eventually signed on 24 October 2009, it was regarded as more of a continuation of Merkel’s centrist strategy than any great reformist break with the past. A detailed analysis of the coalition agreement is beyond the scope of this article, but in terms of the (1) distribution of ministerial portfolios and (2) programmatic commitments, the CDU/CSU had reined in the FDP’s ambitions. Thus, of a total of 16 posts (including that of Chancellor), the FDP received five portfolios.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354068810386841">6</xref>
</sup> As would be expected with a junior coalition partner, this is a slight mathematical over-representation of FDP ministers within the cabinet compared with the party’s parliamentary size (5 portfolios from 93 parliamentarians compared with the CDU/CSU’s 12 portfolios from 249), but does not represent a significant improvement on, for instance, the Greens’ shares of portfolios in the 1998–2005 Schröder governments. Nor, in the context of the German political system in which, first, guidelines competence is exercised by the Chancellor and, second, European Union policy is led from outside the Foreign Ministry, is the Foreign Minister’s portfolio as important as might be assumed. Moreover, the FDP’s key proposal – the desired (€35 billion of tax cuts – was trimmed to (€24 billion and other contentious FDP proposals, although agreed to in principle, were no more than vague future commitments subject to future review (Bundesregierung, 2009). The net effect of the coalition agreement was to lock the FDP into a government programme that was no more than weakly reformist and from which a decisive defection, not least because of the German constitutional requirement for a ‘constructive vote of no confidence’ to depose an incumbent Chancellor, would be hard to accomplish and fraught with political costs.</p>
<p>The defection of the FDP from the Black–Yellow coalition cannot be ruled out in the medium term of course; but neither can the possibility that the problems of coalition management described above might compel the CDU–CSU to consider its future coalition options as well. One alternative is a return to the Grand Coalition, although, as already noted, this would normally involve a surplus majority. A more intriguing option would be for the CDU–CSU to seek to form a two-party coalition with the Greens (the Black–Green option) or a three-party coalition with the Greens and FDP (the Jamaica option). At the time of writing, these are purely speculative options at the federal level, but it is important to note that a Black–Green coalition was in power in the German city-state of Hamburg from 2008 to 2010 and was also discussed in the run-up to the May 2010 state election in Germany’s largest state of North Rhine-Westphalia (in the event the Greens entered government as the junior partner in a minority Red–Green coalition with the SPD). In addition, a Jamaica coalition has been in power in the small western German state of Saarland since October 2009 as an alternative to the appointment of a minority SPD government that would have been supported by the Left Party. If these coalition arrangements prove to be successful at the state level, there is no reason to rule out an attempt to constitute one of them at the federal level in the future.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068810386841">7</xref>
</sup> Given the position of the Greens along the dominant left–right axis and their ability to cooperate along both the bourgeois and new politics issue dimensions, such a development would greatly enhance the relative leverage of the Greens within future coalition games and might even confer on them kingmaker status. Crucially, however, the increase in the number of political parties within the party system means that such a kingmaker role would be contingent on particular electoral outcomes and the subsequent distribution of party weights, rather than the more structurally embedded position that the FDP enjoyed in the three-party dynamic that characterized the German party system from the 1960s until the 1980s.</p>
<p>And what of the SPD? There is a consensus that the party’s miserable performance in the 2009 federal election is not a one-off event, but rather part of a longer-term trend dating back to at least 1998. An early analysis provided by the SPD-affiliated Friedrich Ebert Stiftung attributes this long-term decline to ‘a loss of trust between the majority of Germans who embrace social democratic ideals and the SPD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810386841">Albrecht, 2009</xref>: 2), which was aggravated by a poor electoral strategy and a weak Chancellor candidate in the 2010 federal elections. The report argued that electors were in broad agreement with key aspects of the SPD’s programme, such as introduction of the minimum wage, the phase-out of nuclear energy and tighter regulation of the financial markets, but this did not translate into active support for the party. The report went on to assert that the reason for the failure to mobilize the SPD’s potential electorate was down to its overly technocratic nature, leading to a lack of emotional appeal to core working-class voters, a loss of credibility due to reversals in its unpopular Hartz IV labour market reforms and, related to this, the process of ‘rhetorical social democratization’ undergone by the CDU/CSU under Chancellor Merkel’s leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810386841">Albrecht, 2009</xref>: 3), which has left the SPD struggling to regain the initiative as its right of centre competitor occupies the electoral middle-ground.</p>
<p>If this analysis is correct, then there are reasons for hope as well as despair for SPD strategists. Although it will be an uphill task to win back the 10 million voters who have deserted the party since 1998, the fact that the polls suggest the substance of SPD policy positions is popular with voters means that the SPD does not need to undergo the kind of ideological left–right struggle suffered by, for example, the UK Labour Party after 1979. What it will require, however, is a generational change in the party leadership and this has been acknowledged through the appointment of Sigmar Gabriel, from the party’s right wing, as Party Chairman and Andrea Nahles, on the left, as General Secretary. It will also, given the new reality of a genuinely multiparty system, require the SPD to reconsider its policy of non-cooperation with the Left Party at the federal level. Party insiders are now engaged with these issues, which is a positive sign that the SPD is cognizant of the need for change. The issue of engagement with the Left Party, however, is difficult for the SPD and there is no consensus on this matter within the party. Whatever the outcome of this process of renewal, the SPD is now, arguably, at a tipping point. Any further slippage in the party’s core vote at future federal elections could consign it to the ranks of the smaller parties, leaving the CDU/CSU as the sole catch-all party, occupying the centre-ground as Mparty and with multiple coalition options at its disposal. Such an outcome would have profound consequences for the ability of the German party system to generate ‘responsible’ government outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has described how, after a period of consolidation, the last three decades has seen the German party system undergo four types of change. First, there has been an overall decline in the overall vote and seat-share for the two Volksparteien. Second, there has been an increased level of fragmentation in the party system. Third, the emergence of the Greens and then the PDS led to a skew to the left in the party system that has shifted the position of the median legislator. As a result, the FDP is no longer decisive in the coalition game. Fourth, we have seen the emergence of a new territorial cleavage associated with German Unification, although this seems to be less salient than it was in the years immediately after unification. All of these changes have to some extent had an impact on party competition and in particular the role, status and relative power of the two German catch-all parties.</p>
<p>However, the article demonstrates that these changes have had a paradoxical impact. On the one hand, it is clear that the normative/constitutional role of the Volksparteien as catch-all parties has been weakened. This is clearly not a desirable outcome in a polity that for reasons of history and geopolitics sets great store by high levels of system legitimacy. For this reason, it is clear that the analysis and addressing of the underlying causes of the decline in the Volkspartei vote is a significant topic for further research. On the other hand, if we put the constitutional roles of the catch-all parties to one side and simply regard them as the kind of ‘normal’ office-seeking parties to be found in all advanced democracies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068810386841">8</xref>
</sup> then in many ways their strategic positions have been enhanced by the changes described in this article. Thus, as described, the presence within the legislature of the FDP, Greens and Left Party rather than just the FDP means that at present no single small party can be kingmaker across all feasible coalition options and that they are less vulnerable to small party threats of a decisive defection to an alternative coalition. Even the FDP, despite a highly impressive electoral performance, has found in its coalition negotiations and subsequent return to government with the CDU/CSU that it has not regained its kingmaker status and there is no prospect of the reconstitution of the Pappi model.</p>

The HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm operating within the market and then summing the resulting scores. HHIs normally range from 0 to 1000 and the HHI increases as the number of firms in a market decreases and the disparity in their size increases. Conversely, HHIs approach zero under conditions in which large numbers of firms of roughly equal size operate. I use a scale of 0–1 rather than 0–1000 in this figure.</p>

<p>In a recent briefing paper for the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Paterson and Sloam observe that in the 1998, 2002 and 2005 federal elections the combined SPD–Green–PDS/Left Party vote remained quite stable between 51 and 53 percent of the total vote. In the 2009 federal election, the share of the vote won by these three parties fell below 50 percent for the first time since the 1994 federal election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810386841">Paterson and Sloam, 2009</xref>).</p>
