<p>We do not see the initials R&amp;D very often these days, and in the past they were more associated with industrial output than with educational reform. But what is the purpose of R if it is not linked to D? The aim of research is to improve our understanding of the existing situation so that we can shape its future development more effectively, make it better fit for purpose. In practice, however, most educational R is carried out long after the D is over, much too late to influence deeply embedded decisions.</p>
<p>International education has been around long enough to have acquired a well documented history (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240912467407">Sylvester, 2005</xref>). We are fully aware of the key events, institutions, and people that have shaped its remarkable progress from a niche activity to something approaching a worldwide movement. The research challenge of the 20th century was to bridge the unusually large epistemological gap between ‘doing’ international education and ‘knowing’ what international education actually was. Therefore many of the research questions (often posed and pondered by practitioners) were designed to knit together theory and practice. For example:</p>
<list id="list1-1475240912467407" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Can we describe the key concepts of international education that set it apart from other categories of education?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is ‘international-mindedness’ one such concept and, if so, what does it mean in practice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In what cultural environment does international education seem to grow the strongest roots?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which administrative structures give it the best support in schools?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What pedagogic style is the most effective in achieving its goals?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Such questions required an analysis of the accumulated experience of the best part of a hundred years and they helped us to describe, if not actually to define, what we understand by international education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240912467407">Hayden et al., 2007</xref>). Now it is time to move on with new thinking, fresh ideas and reformulated approaches for the 21st century. How can we make better use of the study of what <italic>has been</italic> to suggest what <italic>might be</italic>, encouraging the construction of new questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912467407">Walker, 2011a</xref>) to help us to reflect more effectively on the needs of a deeply troubled planet? Let me give some examples of the kind of issue that might contribute to a research agenda of the future.</p>
<p>I think we need no further persuasion that the historic connection between international education and international schools has been untied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912467407">Hayden and Thompson, 1995</xref>). International education was born and raised in international schools and its current development remains strongly associated with these institutions but there are many examples, not least but not only in the USA, of international education flourishing in a national environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912467407">Carber, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>If international education is deemed to be a ‘good thing’, an appropriate experience for the 21st-century citizen, then access to it should not be restricted to the privileged few who are able to attend international schools (often quite briefly) or expensive independent schools. But the development of international education within state systems has been poorly researched. Can it be reconciled with, or even enhanced by, a strong national curriculum? Can a system designed to promote a national culture embrace educational practices developed in very different cultural environments as McKenzie proposes in this volume? What has happened to the 1974 UNESCO commitment (renewed in 1994) that Hill reminds us about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912467407">UNESCO, 1974</xref>)? How will the curriculum gate-keepers – examination boards and universities, for example – respond to the introduction of an international dimension to a national curriculum?</p>
<p>A second vein of international education that has been exhaustively mined is that of ‘culture’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912467407">van Oord, 2005</xref>). Researchers have explored different definitions of culture, asked why a group’s culture is so significant, wondered if one can ever stand comfortably in different cultural shoes, and even invented a Third Culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912467407">Hayden, 2006</xref>) for globally mobile students. The concepts of cultural awareness, understanding and empathy lie at the heart of international education and they have been explored from many different perspectives. But there is another side to the culture coin which is largely absent from the research literature on international education: the concept of universal values translated into a commitment to certain basic human rights. I am reminded of a conversation with an alumnus of a distinguished international school who paid generous tribute to the quality of his education. ‘But’, he added, ‘I left the school with a burden of tolerance.’ No one had helped him to draw a line between the acceptable and the unacceptable.</p>
<p>That line is put into place and maintained by human rights, but how many schools encourage their students to debate the status and validity of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), or the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), or the function of the International Criminal Court in The Hague (founded in 2002)? How many students are aware of the conflict in their own country between national legislation (if it exists – and Bates reminds us here how many people are marginalized, ‘struggling to access the constitutional guarantees proclaimed by the state’) and international conventions on human rights? UNESCO’s declaration of 1974 lists ‘awareness not only of the rights but also of the duties incumbent upon individuals, social groups and nations towards each other’ as one of the major objectives of an international education, and it is not unreasonable to look to researchers for some answers to these questions.</p>
<p>Yet this raises an uncomfortable problem that has worried international educators since the earliest days: is international education really international or is it built upon a set of values – such as the universal entitlement to certain basic human rights – that are associated with the Western Enlightenment and not necessarily shared, or at least not prioritized in the same way, by those whose long and rich cultural traditions stem from different origins? ‘There are roads from antiquity that don’t necessarily end up in the Renaissance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912467407">Adichie, 2012</xref>) and the time has come to study the development of international education in non-Western environments. Is international education perceived as a passport to the West or does it try to speak in a different, distinctive way to the whole world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240912467407">Walker, 2011b</xref>)?</p>
<p>Let me introduce my next proposal with an interesting statistic: one in five articles published in the first 10 volumes of the <italic>Journal of Research in International Education</italic> (which contain some 150 articles in total) uses the words ‘International Baccalaureate’ (IB) in its title and many more make reference to the IB in the content of the articles themselves. It seems that for many working in the field, international education is not merely exemplified by the IB but is synonymous with it, with the influential IB Learner Profile providing its Ten Commandments. The IB was certainly the first organization to translate international ambitions into a deliverable and assessable K-12 curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912467407">Hill, 2010</xref>), but it is no longer alone. Other examples – some international variants of national curriculums, others free-standing – are now well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240912467407">Snowball, 2012</xref>) yet fail to attract the researcher’s attention. This cannot be a healthy situation since, as Tate observes, ‘The diversity of our world means that a ‘one size fits all’ model of international education is impossible.’ What do these different programmes have in common, in terms of the values they are promoting, their curricular content and structure, and their styles of pedagogy?</p>
<p>International education has always been associated with an imaginative pedagogy, encouraging a variety of teaching and learning styles that often put the student at the centre of classroom activity. The International School of Geneva, for example, was closely linked in the 1920s to the New Education movement whose pioneers included Froebel and Montessori, with its origins reaching back to that great citizen of Geneva, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose tricentenary we have celebrated in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240912467407">Walker, 2011c</xref>). International education therefore offers a potentially fertile test bed for the study of different styles of learning. Community service, for example, has always been an important feature of international education, often absorbing a significant amount of the school’s resource in terms of its organization. Yet little has been written about its learning benefits – for the school as well as for the student. In another area of international education, ambitious claims are made for the advantages of a bilingual education in terms of its enhancement of cultural awareness and its positive impact on the student’s wider learning. Both of these claims deserve deeper investigation. Popular international simulations like the Model United Nations appear to offer practical opportunities for the development of the skills of negotiation and compromise, but their effectiveness remains largely unexamined.</p>
<p>Cambridge notes the lack of research into the pedagogy of international education and offers a model, derived from Bernstein, on which it might be constructed. A broadly agreed understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and skills to be shared by different published programmes of international education would bring an additional benefit because their subsequent evaluation would carry much more weight than if the IB alone remained the arbiter of acceptable practice.</p>
<p>And what does the future hold for the development of new techniques of learning in international education? Surely it will exploit in every possible way the development of on-line learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240912467407">Perrault and Fabian, 2012</xref>) and the mushrooming of social networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240912467407">James, 2008</xref>), which remains largely unexplored as an educational tool. The opportunity to forge contacts across the world both within and outside the context of the formal curriculum is exciting, but it is also threatening because it can bypass the traditional gate-keeper of learning, the teacher.</p>
<p>So to my concluding research question, which is very simple to pose, but far from simple to answer: Does any of it work? Does an international education, as we understand it, achieve any of its ambitious goals and help young people to become internationally minded, culturally sensitive, active citizens, ‘aware of the increasing global interdependence between peoples and nations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912467407">UNESCO, 1974</xref>: 2)? For the purposes of evaluation the over-arching aim of ‘making the world a better place’ has, unsurprisingly, been dissected into its more digestible component parts: appreciating world literature, learning languages, taking part in community service, planning research projects, and so on, all developed within a broad and balanced curriculum. This appears to satisfy the immediate users of the product we describe as international education, namely the universities, but where is the evidence that it all adds up to an experience which helps to build a better world?</p>
<p>Despite the formidable problems, we must have the courage to face up to this challenge using every possible means at our disposal, from individual case studies to ambitious longitudinal studies. The initial results will be patchy, partial and unlikely to persuade the fiercest critics but we must persevere because, at the moment, what we do is too precariously balanced upon an act of faith – and that cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>Here then are some snapshot examples of articles that I would like to be asked to peer-review for <italic>JRIE</italic> in the months and years ahead:</p>
<list id="list2-1475240912467407" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An inner-city primary school in the UK introduces an international dimension to its curriculum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An international school in Africa uses resolutions and decisions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to explore the rights of women.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A school in China collaborates with the IB as it reviews and revises the IB Learner Profile.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A group of schools in India adopts Oxfam’s programme Education for Global Citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240912467407">2006</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A US high school extends the community service element of the IB CAS programme to all its senior students.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A comprehensive study is made of all the available instruments that claim to measure ‘international-mindedness’.</p></list-item></list>
<p>International education is growing at a rapid pace. Thanks to the work of the past decade, researchers are now in a position to help to shape the future as well as to describe the past.</p>
