      <abstract>
        <p>This article shows how a corpus-linguistic approach to transfer based on Jarvis (2000),
          Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008) and Mougeon, Nadasdi, and Rehner (2005) can help to disentangle
          internal and external explanations in language variation and change. The focus of the
          study is on grammatical collocations (Granger &amp; Paquot, 2008) such as <italic>chercher
            après</italic> ‘to search for’ and verb-particle constructions (VPCs) such as
            <italic>recevoir dehors</italic> ‘to get out’ in Brussels French. The occurrence of such
          patterns in Romance varieties is often linked to contact with Germanic varieties, in which
          VPCs are common. This article discusses the syntactic and semantic properties of both
          types of constructions and argue they are to be considered as replications of grammatical
          use patterns (Heine &amp; Kuteva, 2005) from the contact language, the regional variety of
          Dutch. Proof for covert transfer from Dutch is found through a detailed comparison of the
          frequency of the patterns in a range of spoken and written corpora.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>This article aims to show, in the first place, that it is possible to disentangle the role
        of internal and external factors in language change if a corpus-linguistic approach is taken
        and a comparison is made of the frequency of the phenomena under study in a variety of
        corpora. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911403213">Jarvis (2000</xref>, p. 246)
        points out that L1 transfer is too often treated as a ‘you-know-it-when-you-see-it’
        phenomenon, and calls for more methodological rigour in the study of transfer, as this may
        help to resolve the rather unsettling amount of confusion in the field surrounding the role
        of transfer in L2 acquisition. The second aim of this study is to bring together approaches
        from different fields to the study of this issue. Researchers in second language acquisition
        and contact-induced language variation and change both often address the issue of transfer
        without being aware of either the methods that are being followed or the results that were
        obtained in each other’s field. It is particularly interesting that researchers from both
        fields have called for a more rigorous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911403213">Jarvis, 2000</xref>) or more adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon, Nadasdi, &amp; Rehner, 2005</xref>) approach to the
        study of transfer and have proposed very similar solutions to the issue of what constitutes
        evidence for this phenomenon (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367006911403213">Table
          1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911403213">Jarvis and Pavlenko
          (2008)</xref> propose that three kinds of evidence are needed in arguing the case for
        transfer: intralinguistic homogeneity (to what extent learners with the same L1 behave in a
        uniform manner when using L2); intergroup heterogeneity (to what extent learners with
        different L1s perform in a different way in the L2); and crosslinguistic performance
        congruity (the learners’ use of some L2 feature parallels their use of that feature in
        L1).</p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>This approach is similar to the steps that researchers in the field of language variation
        and change recommend taking if one wants to argue that an innovative feature in a contact
        variety is the result of intersystemic contact (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367006911403213">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al. (2005)</xref> argue that, in step 1,
        researchers should establish whether there is equivalence between the productions of the
        speakers in both languages, which corresponds to Jarvis and Pavlenko’s third criterion. In
        step 2 alternative explanations such as overgeneralization or regularization are explored
        and in step 3 a comparison with data from other sources is made. These two steps in the
        process are covered by Jarvis and Pavlenko’s second criterion (intergroup
        heterogeneity).</p>
      <p>In step 4, Mougeon et al. recommend studying whether or not the distribution of an
        innovation is linearly correlated with the level of contact with the source language. If so,
        this is an argument in favour of transfer-based explanations, even though the authors point
        out that this correlation may be much weaker if variants are widely used in the recipient
        language speech community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911403213">Jarvis and
          Pavlenko (2008)</xref> do not discuss this issue in great detail but mention the fact that
        individual variation in knowledge of or contact with the source language can be a reason for
        low levels of intragroup homogeneity among recipient language users. This is not likely to
        be the case if the feature has undergone a process of diffusion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al., 2005</xref>, p. 104).</p>
      <p>The approach sketched above is used in this article in the analysis of grammatical
        collocations such as <italic>regarder après</italic> ‘look for’ or <italic>chercher
          après</italic> ‘look for’ in Brussels French, the variety of French spoken in
            Brussels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367006911403213">1</xref></sup> The term
          <sc>grammatical collocation</sc> is borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911403213">Granger and Paquot (2008</xref>, p. 33), who distinguish
        lexical collocations, which consist of two lexical words, such as <italic>strong
          tea</italic> or <italic>dispel fear</italic>, from grammatical collocations, which are
        made up of a lexical word and a grammatical word, e.g. <italic>aim at</italic> or
          <italic>afraid that</italic>.</p>
      <p>Prior to the discussion about the source of the constructions under study, I aim to clarify
        whether the second element in the collocations (<italic>après</italic> ‘after’, <italic>(en
          de)hors de</italic> ‘out (of)’ and <italic>en bas (de)</italic> ‘down’) is a preposition,
        an adverb or a particle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367006911403213">Talmy
          (1985)</xref> uses the term ‘satellite’ for particles that are part of phrasal verbs in,
        for example, English, as well as for the separable and inseparable prefixes found in the
        Germanic languages. With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367006911403213">Talmy
          (1985</xref>, p. 102) I assume that prepositions are to be distinguished from satellites,
        because prepositions disappear when the complement is omitted, but satellites remain in
        place. As Talmy shows, in <italic>I ran out of the house</italic>, for example,
          <italic>ran</italic> is followed by the satellite <italic>out</italic> as well as the
        preposition <italic>of</italic>, but the satellite <italic>out</italic> can also appear
        alone, as in <italic>he ran out</italic>. He notes that the verb root together with its
        satellites forms a constituent in its own right, the ‘verb complex’. Other authors use the
        term verb-particle construction (VPC). As the term ‘particles’ is more widely used than
        ‘satellites’ among researchers in the field, I prefer to use the former.</p>
      <p>The key question I focus on in this article is to what extent the constructions under study
        are characteristic for this variety of French only or more commonly found in other varieties
        of French, and whether there is evidence for any influence from Dutch in these
        constructions. Comparing <italic>isolated</italic> examples from different periods in the
        history of French or from different speakers is not helpful, because these provide us only
        with a confusing range of structures, but not with criteria that can help decide whether
        internal or external explanations are most plausible. New light can be thrown on the issue
        if we adopt a corpus-linguistic approach, making a comparison of the frequency of the
        phenomena in different corpora along the lines of the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911403213">Jarvis (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911403213">Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al. (2005)</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transfer will be assumed to have played a role in the occurrence of these structures in
        Brussels French, if the patterns</p>
      <list id="list1-1367006911403213" list-type="alpha-lower">
        <list-item>
          <p>are widespread among the target group of bilingual speakers in Brussels and not an
            isolated incident (intragroup homogeneity);</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>are more frequent in the variety of French used by Dutch–French bilinguals than among
            varieties of French that are not currently in contact with a Germanic language or are in
            less direct contact with Dutch, such as varieties of Belgian French from Wallonia
            (intergroup heterogeneity);</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>are a common feature in the performance of source language speakers, i.e. Dutch

        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>This does not mean that transfer is the <italic>only</italic> reason: the occurrence of a
        particular grammatical collocation may well be the result of multiple causation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367006911403213">Thomason &amp; Kaufman, 1988</xref>): i.e.
        transfer and internal causes can contribute together to the emergence or diffusion of a
        pattern (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367006911403213">Heine &amp; Kuteva,
          2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The structure of the article is as follows. First I introduce a number of key concepts of
        contact-induced change and transfer (section 2). The next section (3) deals with the
        criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367006911403213">Jackendoff (2002</xref>) uses
        to distinguish prepositions and particles, and these are subsequently applied to the
        constructions found in Brussels French, with a view to establish whether they are VPCs or
        not. In section 4 the focus is on VPCs in Romance–Germanic contact situations. Section 5
        presents an overview of the methodology and section 6 focuses on the results of the analyses
        of different data sets. Section 7 offers a discussion and a conclusion.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-1367006911403213">
      <title>2. Contact-induced change, transfer and replication</title>
      <p>For the purposes of the present article, contact-induced change is defined as ‘the adoption
        of a structural feature into a language as a result of some level of bilingualism in the
        history of the relevant speech community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367006911403213">Matras &amp; Sakel, 2007</xref>, p. 1). Following Grosjean
        (this issue), we consider the occurrence of a grammatical collocation to be an example of
          <sc>transfer</sc> if it can be shown that it is static in that it represents a permanent
        trace of one language on the other, and not a dynamic phenomenon which is linked to
            processing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367006911403213">2</xref></sup> For the
        latter Grosjean proposes to use the term <sc>interference</sc>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367006911403213">Sharwood Smith and Kellerman (1986</xref>, p. 1) use the
        term transfer in a similar way to refer to the ‘processes that lead to the incorporation of
        elements from one language into another’.</p>
      <p>The distinction between <sc>overt</sc> and <sc>covert transfer</sc> is also relevant for
        the current article. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al.
          (2005</xref>, p. 102) reserve the former for qualitative developments in the recipient
        language, whereas the latter consists only in a quantitative development, namely a marked
        increase in the frequency of a feature. Whether or not the Brussels French collocations
        represent a case of overt or of covert transfer will need to be established through a
        thorough comparison with a range of sources.</p>
      <p>As I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367006911403213">Treffers-Daller, 1999</xref>), the influence of Dutch on Brussels French manifests itself
        mainly in the use of reinterpreted and/or restructured French words, and much less in the
        importation of Dutch language forms. This is to be expected as the influence from Dutch on
        French is the result of a process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367006911403213">Thomason and Kaufman (1988</xref>, p. 115) call <sc>interference through shift</sc>. It
        is therefore unlikely that Dutch prepositions or adverbs are imported into Brussels French
        collocations, but the structural patterns in which <italic>après</italic>,
          <italic>dehors</italic> and <italic>en bas</italic> occur are potentially copied from
        Dutch. This contrast is clearly captured in the distinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367006911403213">Matras and Sakel (2004)</xref> make between <sc>matter

        recipient language is not entirely new in most cases: it often builds on some structure that
        is present in the source language but constitutes only a minor use pattern. Through the
        process of replication this minor use pattern then becomes a major use pattern. It is
        entirely possible that this is also the case in the collocations under study here, and for
        this reason it is very important to include historical data in the analysis.</p>

        <disp-quote>
          <p>. . . an accented element which is formally (and, often, semantically) related to a

        that the class of particles is for the most part homophonous with prepositions, but suggests
        there are clear criteria to distinguish the two. First of all, with intransitive verbs, the
        particle can serve as the only complement, as in (1), but this is not possible with
        prepositions such as <italic>from</italic>, as (2) illustrates. Prepositions can of course
        be left stranded at the end of the sentence, when the complement has been moved, as in
        (3):</p>

      </p>
      <p>With transitive verbs, the particle can appear on either side of the complement, as in
        (4a/b), but prepositions can only appear on the left, as (5a/b) illustrate:</p>

      <p>When they appear on the left of the complement, particles look like prepositions, but
        several tests show that they are different. Thus, cleft constructions are possible with PPs
        (6a) but not with particles and their complements (6b). Similarly, wh-movement with pied
        piping is possible with PPs, as we can see in (7a), but not with particles and their

      <p>While the properties of VPCs in the Germanic languages are well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367006911403213">Booij, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367006911403213">2010</xref>), far less attention has been paid to such
        constructions in the Romance languages, which are often assumed not to possess VPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367006911403213">Dufresne, Dupuis, &amp; Tremblay,

        characteristics of the constructions under study here, but more details about the historical
        development of the distinction between prefixes, prepositions and (adverbial) particles in

        are stress-timed whereas French is a syllable-timed language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367006911403213">Abercrombie, 1967</xref>), it is unlikely that the stress
        patterns associated with particles in the Germanic languages and the Romance languages are
        the same.</p>
      <p>In Brussels French prepositions can be combined with a variety of verbs in ways that are
        not attested in dictionaries of Standard French, such as the <italic>Trésor de la langue
          française informatisé</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlf.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlf.htm</ext-link>).

        210) notes that verbs which are transitive in metropolitan French are sometimes accompanied
        by prepositions, as in <italic>chercher après</italic> ‘to look for’, and that prepositions
        are also used as adverbs more often in Brussels French than in French as spoken in
            France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367006911403213">3</xref></sup> In this
        present study the focus is on collocations of verbs with <italic>après</italic> ‘after’,
          <italic>en bas (de)</italic> ‘down’ and (<italic>en) (de)hors (de)</italic> ‘out of’,
        which are often argued to be transferred from Dutch (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens Beardsmore, 1971</xref>), because VPCs are very
        common in Germanic languages. The Dutch translation equivalents <italic>zoeken naar</italic>
        ‘to look for’ and <italic>naar beneden vallen</italic> or <italic>neervallen</italic> ‘to
        fall down’ from my Brussels French corpus are often seen as sources for the Brussels French
        constructions in (8a/b) and (9a/b). These examples show that <italic>après</italic> and
          <italic>en bas</italic> can be used in different ways. In (8a) preposition
          <italic>après</italic> is followed by a complement, but in (8b) there is no overt
        complement:</p>

      <p>In (9a) <italic>en bas de</italic> can be seen as a compound preposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367006911403213">Jones, 1996</xref>) or if one uses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367006911403213">Talmy’s (1985)</xref> framework, as a
        sequence of the satellite (particle) <italic>en bas</italic> ‘down’ and the preposition
          <italic>de</italic> ‘of’. In (9b) it is an adverbial phrase which does not take a
        complement:</p>

      </p>
      <p>Examples (10a) and (10b) are clearly different from each other in that

        there is a wide range of verbs with separable prefixes such as <italic>uit-vallen</italic>
        ‘to fall out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367006911403213">Booij, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367006911403213">2010</xref>), which could have formed the

      <p>The first question that needs to be answered is whether or not the structures under study
        here constitute examples of verb-particle constructions. The results of the tests proposed
        by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367006911403213">Jackendoff (2002</xref>) show that
        most constructions under study here are not VPCs, because they allow for clefting and
        wh-movement with pied piping (11–13). This indicates that in these constructions
          <italic>après</italic>, <italic>(en de) hors (de)</italic> and <italic>en bas de</italic>
        are best seen as prepositions or adverbs, and not as particles:</p>

      <p>Although we have just seen that <italic>en bas</italic> it is not a particle, it is

      <p>By contrast, we find <italic>après</italic> only to the left of its complement, as can be

        In examples such as (17) <italic>après</italic> is a stranded preposition because the dative

      <p>If <italic>dehors</italic> is used in combination with <italic>sortir</italic> ‘to go out’
        (see 18), it only appears to the left. In combinations with other verbs, such as

        discussion of example 20):</p>

      <p>There are, however, also other combinations with <italic>après</italic>,

          (1971)</xref> notes that <italic>en bas</italic> can be combined with a range of verbs,
        such as <italic>payer en bas</italic> ‘to pay off’, <italic>secouer en bas</italic> ‘to
        shake off’ and <italic>couper en bas</italic> ‘to cut off’. Collocations with
          <italic>dehors</italic> include <italic>chercher dehors</italic> ‘search out, take out’
        and <italic>couper dehors</italic> ‘to cut out’. While on the surface <italic>en
          bas</italic> in (19) resembles a preposition, it cannot be moved to the front in a cleft

      <p>It is possible to separate <italic>après</italic> from the verb, as in (21), where two PPs,
          <italic>dans le bois</italic> ‘in the forest’ and <italic>avec son chien</italic> ‘with
        his dog’, appear between the verb <italic>chercher</italic> and the preposition

      </p>
      <p>While the issue cannot be explored in much detail here, the word order in (21) is not
        common in metropolitan French. In French from France adjuncts such as <italic>dans le
          bois</italic> ‘in the forest’ and <italic>avec son chien</italic> ‘with his dog’ normally
        follow the direct object <italic>sa grenouille</italic> ‘his frog’ or a prepositional phrase
        which is closely linked to the verb, such as <italic>après sa grenouille</italic> ‘after his
        frog’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911403213">Judge &amp; Healey, 1985</xref>,
        p. 403; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367006911403213">Magnus, 2007</xref>,
        for further details on the contrasts between Dutch and French word order). Therefore
        speakers of metropolitan French would probably prefer the word order given in (21a):</p>
      <p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>(21a) <italic>Il va même</italic>
            <bold><italic>chercher (après)</italic></bold>
            <italic>sa grenouille dans le bois avec son chien</italic>.</p>
          <p>  ‘He even goes looking for his frog in the forest with his dog.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>It is possible that the word order in (21) is influenced by Brussels Dutch, which allows
        for the insertion of several adjuncts before the preposition which forms a collocation with
        the verb. The word orders in (21b) and (21c) are both possible in Dutch:</p>
      <p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>(21b) <italic>Hij</italic>
            <bold><italic>zoekt</italic></bold>
            <italic>zelfs in het bos met zijn hond</italic>
            <bold><italic>naar</italic></bold>
            <italic>de kikker</italic>.</p>
          <p>  ‘He even looks in the forest with his dog for the frog.’</p>
          <p>(21c) <italic>Hij</italic>
            <bold><italic>zoekt</italic></bold>
            <italic>zelfs met zijn hond in het bos</italic>

            <italic>de kikker</italic>.</p>
          <p>  ‘He even looks with his dog in the forest for the frog.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>A few words also need to be said about the semantics of the constructions. The collocations
        form lexicalized patterns, i.e. a particular meaning is found to be in regular association
        with this construction. The meanings of Brussels French collocations such as <italic>payer
          en bas</italic> ‘to pay off’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens
          Beardsmore, 1971</xref>, p. 262) or <italic>recevoir dehors</italic> ‘to get out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367006911403213">De Vriendt, 2004</xref>, p. 34) are not very
        transparent to speakers unfamiliar with this variety of French and can often only be
        understood by those familiar with the Dutch translation equivalents.</p>
      <p>The addition of <italic>après</italic> (whether used as a preposition or as an adverb) to
          <italic>courir</italic> in (21) changes the meaning of the verb from ‘run’ to
        ‘pursue/chase’ and <italic>crier après</italic> means ‘to call (for)’, which is different
        from <italic>crier</italic> ‘to cry’. In both cases, there is a more formal equivalent for
        these verbs, namely <italic>poursuivre</italic> ‘pursue/chase’ and <italic>appeler</italic>
        ‘to call (for)’. The addition of <italic>après</italic> also changes the subcategorization
        frame of the verb so that it can be used in combination with an object (<italic>courir après
          quelqu’un/quelque chose</italic> ‘to run after someone/something’; <italic>crier après
          quelqu’un/quelque chose</italic> ‘to call for someone/something’).</p>
      <p>The addition of <italic>en bas (de)</italic> to the path verb <italic>tomber</italic> as in
        (20a/b) appears to be redundant, but as one reviewer has pointed out, the expression
          <italic>en bas</italic> adds a precision to the meaning of the verb: it can be functional
        in some contexts, as for example <italic>descendre en bas</italic> can be used to refer to
        going down to the ground floor as opposed to going down to the first floor of a
        building.</p>

      <title>4. Verb-particle constructions in Romance–Germanic contact situations</title>
      <p>While verb-particle constructions are commonly found in Germanic languages, there is some
        evidence for their existence in Romance languages too. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911403213">Iacobini and Masini (2006</xref>, p. 169) show that VPCs
        such as <italic>andare dentro</italic> ‘to go in’ (which are used alongside the synthetic
        synonym <italic>entrar</italic> ‘to enter’) are very popular in Italian, in particular in
        informal speech. The popularity of VPCs may be due to the fact that more meanings can be
        expressed with the VPCs than with the synthetic forms: there are no synthetic alternatives,
        for example, for <italic>andare appresso/dietro</italic> ‘to go behind’ and <italic>andare
          lontano</italic> ‘to go far’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911403213">Iacobini
          &amp; Masini, 2006</xref>, p. 168). In addition, many of the prefixes found in
        alternative, synthetic constructions are no longer productive. The authors strongly argue
        against what they call ‘the Germanic Hypothesis’ and claim this is a language-internal
        development; although it appears to be the case that the phenomenon is particularly popular
        in dialects in the North. Iacobini and Masini admit that in Alpine dialects the phenomenon
        may have been ‘strengthened by contact with modern German’ (p. 165) but insist it is a
        language-internal development. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide any quantitative
        evidence for their case, even though a detailed comparison of different corpora could
        provide further evidence in favour (or against) this claim. The development itself is
        interesting because the VPCs represent a departure from the perspective of the typology
        proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367006911403213">Talmy (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367006911403213">2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367006911403213">Slobin (2004)</xref>, according to which Romance languages

        linked to the verb. In Italian VPCs path is expressed in a satellite. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367006911403213">Beavers, Levin, and Tham (2010)</xref> have

          (1999)</xref> dispute the Germanic origin of these constructions, and claim that both
        prefixation and particles are of Indo-European origin. In Old French aspectual or locative
        prefixes were highly productive, but this is no longer the case in modern French (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367006911403213">Dufresne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367006911403213">Foulet, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367006911403213">Kopecka, 2006</xref>). Particles such as
          <italic>sus</italic> ‘up’ or <italic>jus</italic> ‘down’ could be used to modify the
        meaning of a verb in Old French, but structures such as <italic>descendre jus/aval</italic>
        ‘descend downwards’ and <italic>monter sus/amont</italic> ‘climb upwards’ have disappeared
        as well. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367006911403213">Foulet
          (1946</xref>, p. 60) it is in particular in redundant constructions such as the two last
        examples that contact with Germanic varieties can be assumed, which is interesting if one
        believes with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367006911403213">Trudgill (2004)</xref>
        that increased redundancy can be one of the effects of long-term bilingualism. However, as
        we have seen in section 3, the grammatical collocations under study here are not always or
        not entirely redundant (e.g. <italic>tomber en bas</italic>).</p>
      <p>In modern French, just like in Italian, verbal prefixes which originate in Latin or Greek
        can encode path: in <italic>ac-courir</italic> ‘to run to’ and <italic>s’é-couler</italic>
        ‘to flow out’, for example, the prefix adds the notion of path to the verb root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367006911403213">Kopecka, 2006</xref>, p. 89), but these
        forms are lexicalized and in many cases not very transparent. It is also possible to use a
        deictic verb such as <italic>aller</italic> in combination with a preposition such as
          <italic>hors</italic> ‘out’ as in <italic>elle va hors de la maison</italic> ‘she goes out
        of the house’ or in combination with an adverb such as <italic>dehors</italic> ‘out’, as in
          <italic>elle va (en/au) dehors</italic> ‘she goes out(side)’, but the path verb
          <italic>sortir</italic> ‘to leave’, as in <italic>elle sort (de la maison)</italic> ‘she
        leaves (the house)’ is used much more frequently for these purposes. A quick search on the
        French webcorpus of Sketchengine (over 126 million words) shows that combinations of
          <italic>aller</italic> + <italic>dehors</italic> get only 43 hits, but
          <italic>sortir</italic> gets 39,590 hits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367006911403213">6</xref></sup> This confirms the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367006911403213">Hickmann (2006</xref>, p. 296), who found
        that French adults prefer to encode path in the verb and French children learn the typical
        ways of expressing motion very quickly from the age of three onwards. French children rarely
        use satellites to express path although there are some differences between adults and
        children with particular items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911403213">Hickmann
          &amp; Hendriks, 2006</xref>, p. 122). British learners of French as a second language, on
        the other hand, regularly make use of deictic verbs combined with prepositions or path
        satellites as a means to express motion, possibly because they transfer L1 patterns into
        French, or because these constructions are somehow perceived to be simpler or more
        transparent than path verbs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367006911403213">Schlyter

        comparison with native speakers of French who prefer to use verbs which conflate motion and

        French verbs (including but not limited to verbs of motion) to produce structures such as

          Brent, Bélanger, &amp; Cicocki, 1980</xref>). According to Mougeon (personal
        communication) the differences in the usage of <italic>back</italic> in Canadian French are
        linked to differences in normative pressures. In communities with prolonged contact with

        In the Acadian French variety, which is often referred to as Chiac, verb-particle
        constructions most often consist of an English verb and an English particle, as in (14a),

        of a French verb with a Dutch particle such as in <italic>aller terug</italic> ‘to go back’
        is not attested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367006911403213">7</xref></sup> In

        variety is the dominant one in Canada, whereas in Brussels the Romance variety is dominant,
        may in part explain the differences between the outcome of language contact between these
        two situations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367006911403213">Treffers-Daller, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1367006911403213">Tremblay (2005</xref>, p.
        263), in some varieties of French (for example Quebec French) grammatical collocations can
        be found which consist of a French verb and a French preposition/adverb, such as
          <italic>monter en haut</italic> ‘to go up’, <italic>descendre en bas</italic> ‘to go
        down’, <italic>se lever debout</italic> ‘to get up’, <italic>mettre bas</italic> ‘to put
        down’ and <italic>jeter bas</italic> ‘to throw down’. Interestingly, some of the
        prepositions mentioned here are redundant, and the constructions resemble those found in
        Brussels French and those mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367006911403213">Gsell (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367006911403213">Jaberg

        (1981)</xref>. These authors only give examples of combinations of Romance particles with
        Romance verbs (pattern replication) along the Romance/Germanic language border, but do not
        bring up any cases of the importation of Germanic particles (matter replication) into the
        Romance languages. In most of the contact situations under study the Romance language is the
        dominant variety, which may explain why the results are similar to what we find in Brussels,
        but different from those in Canada, where matter replication is found too, at least in some
        varieties. Normative pressures may well play a role too in the frequency with which matter
        and pattern replication is found in the other bilingual communities, but this is beyond the
        scope of the current article.</p>

      <p>The data studied here come from a variety of sources. In order to maximize the
        comparability of the data across groups of informants, a story telling task was used to
        elicit semi-spontaneous data. The frog story <italic>Frog where are you?</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367006911403213">Mayer, 1969</xref>) was chosen for this
        purpose, because it forms a good source of information for the description of motion, and
        many collocations under study here involve motion verbs. The story has also been used by a
        wide range of researchers in the field of L1 and L2 acquisition. The data from Dutch–French
        bilinguals (<italic>N</italic> = 25) were collected in 2006 in Anderlecht, one of the 19
        municipalities of the Brussels Region, situated in the southwest of the agglomeration. Among
        these informants, 16 can be classified as balanced bilinguals and nine as Dutch-dominant
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367006911403213">Treffers-Daller, in press</xref>).
        The informants’ mean age is 62, they had lived all or most of their life in the Brussels
        Region, and belong to the so-called traditional bilinguals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367006911403213">Janssens, 2001</xref>, p. 92): they speak the two languages
        of the Brussels Region, that is (the regional varieties of) French and Dutch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367006911403213">8</xref></sup> The informants from Anderlecht
        also told another frog story (<italic>Frog goes to dinner</italic>) in the local variety of
        Dutch, Brussels Dutch, which made it possible to compare the bilinguals’ use of some
        collocations in both languages. The same story could not be used for elicitation in both
        languages, as this might have triggered unwanted translation effects.</p>
      <p>The Brussels data are compared with frog stories from native speakers of French from Paris
          (<italic>N</italic> = 27, mean age 21), collected in the same year, and with frog stories
        from 18-year-old Flemish L2 learners of French from the city of Aalst in Flanders
          (<italic>N</italic> = 25), who had had six years of French tuition in secondary school
        prior to data collection. The data were collected and transcribed in CHAT by Laurence
        Mettewie and Alex Housen, and they are available from the FLLOC database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flloc.soton.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.flloc.soton.ac.uk/</ext-link>). The other data sets were also formatted in
        CHAT and all data were analysed with CLAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367006911403213">MacWhinney, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>The frog story data are compared with a variety of databases from written and oral sources.
        Historical data were obtained from Frantext (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.frantext.fr/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.frantext.fr/</ext-link>). Beeching’s
        corpus of spoken French (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/hlss/llas/iclru/index.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uwe.ac.uk/hlss/llas/iclru/index.shtml</ext-link>) of about 155,000 words as
        well as the Sketchengine database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/</ext-link>) of
        126,850,281 words were used as the sources of information on spontaneous spoken and written
        data from varieties of French that are less likely to have undergone influence from Germanic
        varieties. These two sources are also used to check whether the frequency of the structures
        under study in the narratives from Paris is comparable to that in French data from other
        spoken and written sources, as a low frequency of these structures in the Paris control
        corpus could be accidental. Finally, a subset of data from Namur and Liège from the Chalons
        subcorpus of the VALIBEL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uclouvain.be/valibel.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uclouvain.be/valibel.html</ext-link>) formed the key source on Belgian
        varieties of French outside Brussels. This subcorpus contains 472,018 words. Finally, I have
        used the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (Corpus Spoken Dutch) of about 9,000,000 words
          (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inl.nl/nl/corpora/corpus-gesproken-nederlands-(cgn)" xlink:type="simple">http://www.inl.nl/nl/corpora/corpus-gesproken-nederlands-(cgn)</ext-link>) for the
        occurrence of the Dutch translation equivalents of the structures under study (e.g.
          <italic>naar beneden vallen</italic> and <italic>neervallen</italic> ‘to fall down’).</p>
      <p>From the prepositions/adverbs whose use is discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens Beardsmore (1971)</xref>, I selected those which
        occurred more than once in the frog stories from Brussels (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367006911403213">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367006911403213">9</xref></sup> Two of these constructions (<italic>courir
          après</italic> ‘run after’ and <italic>crier après</italic> ‘call for’) are attested in
        the <italic>Petit Robert</italic> and the dictionary of the <italic>Trésor de la langue
          française informatisé</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1367006911403213">10</xref></sup> (<italic>TLFI</italic>) but they were not used at all by the speakers
        of metropolitan French who told the frog stories. In order to find out to what extent their
        usage differs in Brussels French and metropolitan French, <italic>courir après</italic> and
          <italic>crier après</italic> were kept in the analysis. In all cases, I carefully checked
        whether the examples found were indeed the intended collocations and not, for example, verbs
        followed by temporal adjuncts such as <italic>après deux heures</italic> ‘after two hours’
        or constructions such as those in where <italic>regarder après</italic> does not mean ‘to
        seek’ but literally ‘look behind’: thus it does not form a collocation with the verb, but
        represent a directional adjunct which does not change the meaning of the verb. In (24), the
        object of the search is not the tree but the frog: thus the little boy is not looking
          <italic>for</italic> the tree but <italic>behind</italic> the tree. Cases such as these
        were excluded from the calculations:</p>

      <p>The search strings were formulated in such a way that all the different inflected forms of
        the verb were included in the searches in all corpora. As other words can sometimes occur
        between the two parts of grammatical collocations, as in <italic>Ils cherchent</italic>
        <bold><italic>tous</italic></bold>
        <italic>après X</italic> ‘they all look for X’, a maximum space of five words was allowed
        between the verb and the preposition/adverb. Searches in the Dutch corpora are complicated
        because different word orders are used in the main and the subordinate clause, namely
        verb+preposition and preposition+verb, and the two parts of the collocation may be written
        together or written separately depending on the construction. Therefore both word orders,
        for example <italic>naar beneden vallen</italic> and <italic>vallen naar beneden</italic>,
        were searched in the corpus as well as collocations that were written together as in
          <italic>neervallen</italic> or written separately, such as <italic>vallen neer</italic>. A
        maximum of five words was allowed between the verb and the preposition/adverb, as for the
        French corpora.</p>
      <p>As it was important to find out not only how many times informants used the different
        collocations, but also how many times informants could have used a collocation but preferred
        a bare verb (for example <italic>chercher</italic> instead of <italic>chercher
          après</italic>), I also counted in all transcripts how frequently the different verbs were
        used without the prepositions/adverbs under study. Subsequently I calculated the relative
        frequency of the collocations for each informant in relation to the total number of tokens
        of the same verb. In those cases where more than 100 tokens of a particular structure were
        found, only the first 100 were scrutinized to establish whether they were the intended
        collocations, and not tokens of temporal PPs or other structures that needed to be
            excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1367006911403213">11</xref></sup> If needed,
        further context was obtained to determine the function of the preposition/adverb in a
        particular example. The total number of collocations per 100 tokens for all verbs under
        study was then calculated as follows: the total number of collocations in the Brussels frog
        story set (41) was divided by the total number of verbs (378). The outcome was multiplied by
        100, which leads to a result of 10.85 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1367006911403213">Table 4</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to find out whether degree of contact with Dutch could explain the frequency of
          usage of the collocations, I operationalized degree of contact with the source language
          (Dutch) by dividing the group into those who attended a Dutch-speaking primary school (15
          informants) and those who went to a French-speaking primary school (6 informants). The
          remaining four informants claimed that both languages were used in class or did not
          provide any information regarding the languages spoken at school, so these informants were
          excluded from this analysis. The frequency with which the informants in the bilingual
          group use the collocations may indeed be related to the languages spoken in school, as
          among those who went to a Dutch-speaking school the relative frequency of the collocations
          is 12.9, whereas among those who attended French-speaking schools the relative frequency
          is 6.6. The differences are not significant, but represent a trend (<italic>t</italic> =
          1.39; d.f. = 19, <italic>p</italic> = .092 (one-tailed)), which indicates that, if further
          data could be collected, this factor (i.e. the language of schooling) would probably turn
          out to be a predictor of the use of the collocations under study.</p>

            significantly different from the two other groups, but the differences between the Paris
            group and the group from Flanders are not large enough to become significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1367006911403213">12</xref></sup></p>

          <p>As two reviewers point out, speakers could also have opted to use the slightly more

            instead of <italic>courir après</italic>, and <italic>appeler</italic> ‘to call’ instead
            of <italic>crier après</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1367006911403213">14</xref></sup> As it turns out, all groups do indeed use

            it is least used by the Flemish L2 learners (2), and the Brussels group occupies the
            middle position with nine tokens. The Brusselers use <italic>crier après</italic> (16),

            learner group do not use <italic>crier après</italic> but instead use
              <italic>appeler</italic> 52 and 22 times respectively. This analysis reinforces the

          <title>6.2.2 Comparison with data from Belgian French and Canadian French</title>
          <p>In this section the focus is on the frequency of the patterns in a corpus of Belgian
            French from Wallonia, which forms part of the VALIBEL corpus. As explained in section 1,
            I assume the collocations will be less frequent in these varieties, because the speakers
            are less influenced by Dutch and thus transfer from this language is less likely. The
            results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1367006911403213">Table 5</xref> show that
            only two of the collocations under study were found in the VALIBEL corpus:
              <italic>chercher après</italic> and <italic>sortir en dehors</italic>, and they occur
            10 times less often than in Brussels French:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1367006911403213">15</xref></sup> only 0.8 times in 100 tokens of the
            verbs. It will be interesting to compare these results with French data from France, as
            even less influence from Germanic varieties is expected there. This is dealt with in
            section 6.3.</p>

          <p>A brief comparison with data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367006911403213">Mougeon and Beniak’s (1991)</xref> corpus of Ontario French is interesting at this
            point, as two of the verbs under study here, <italic>regarder</italic> and
              <italic>chercher</italic>, occur with adverbs or prepositions in Ontario French too.
            The preposition used by French Canadians is <italic>pour</italic>, the translation
            equivalent of English <italic>for</italic>, as shown in (27) and (28), and not
              <italic>après</italic> ‘after’, which is the translation equivalent of Dutch
              <italic>na/naar/achter</italic>:</p>

                <bold><italic>chercher pour</italic></bold>
                <italic>de l’emploi</italic>.</p>
              <p>  ‘But you know I am going to look for a job.’</p>
            </disp-quote>
          </p>
          <p>Thus, in Brussels French, Belgian French and Ontario French a preposition is added to
            these verbs, but the choice of the preposition differs in these varieties as it based on
            the translation equivalent in the contact language. In Brussels French and in the
            VALIBEL corpus, <italic>regarder pour</italic> and <italic>chercher pour</italic> are
            not attested, and no mention is made of <italic>regarder après</italic> or
              <italic>chercher après</italic> in Ontario French. After completing a detailed
            comparison of the use of these verbs in a variety of data from speakers, Mougeon and
            colleagues conclude that the source of the innovations in Ontario French is likely to be
            English, because degree of contact with the source language English explains the
            frequency of occurrence of these forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al., 2005</xref>). As we have seen in section
            6.1, there is not yet enough evidence to draw conclusions about this issue for Brussels
            French. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al. (2005</xref>,
            p. 108) also note that the use of the verb <italic>regarder</italic> with the
            preposition <italic>pour</italic>, which together encode the meaning ‘to seek’ (a calque
            from ‘to look for’), represents a more in-depth form of contact-induced change than the
            use of <italic>chercher pour</italic> because the former entails not only the insertion
            of <italic>pour</italic>, but also the substitution of <italic>regarder</italic> for
              <italic>chercher</italic>, whereas the latter only involves the addition of a
            preposition.</p>
          <p>In (29) the <italic>regarder après</italic> can be translated as ‘to look for’ or ‘to
            seek’ but not as ‘to look at’: this would only be possible if the frog were in the jar,
            which is not the case in the picture. Thus, in this case the verb
              <italic>regarder</italic> has probably indeed assumed the meaning of
              <italic>chercher</italic>, but this transfer of meaning cannot be explained as
            contact-induced, because the Brussels Dutch translation equivalent <italic>zien</italic>
            or <italic>bezien</italic> ‘to look at’ does not mean ‘to seek’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1367006911403213">16</xref></sup></p>

          <p>This example is also interesting because the speaker corrects herself, in that she
            first uses <italic>pour</italic> and then <italic>après</italic>, which clearly
            demonstrates the difference between Canadian and Brussels French.</p>
          <p>Studies of L2 acquisition provide important information about the link between
            learners’ L1 and the use of these two collocations in French. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367006911403213">Desmet, Klein, and Lamiroy (2004</xref>,
            p. 113) Dutch learners of French often add the preposition <italic>après</italic> after
              <italic>chercher</italic>, whereas Anglophone learners often add <italic>pour</italic>
            to this verb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367006911403213">Holmes, 1977</xref>,
            cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367006911403213">Lumsden, 1999</xref>, p.
            132). Learners of French with Dutch and Anglophone backgrounds thus make different
            errors in their uses of the verb <italic>chercher</italic>, and these errors are linked
            to their L1.</p>
          <p>Finally, Mougeon (personal communication) notes that <italic>courir après</italic>
            occurs 16 times in the Ontario French corpus of 1 million words, and the more formal
            equivalent <italic>poursuivre</italic> occurs 12 times. Further evidence regarding the
            role of language contact in the occurrence of this form and the other collocations can
            be obtained through the analysis of data that have not been influenced by a Germanic
            language, which is done in the next section.</p>

          <title>6.3.1 The collocations in modern French</title>
          <p>There is some evidence that these collocations occur in varieties of French that have
            not been influenced by Germanic varieties. In his study of popular French, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367006911403213">Bauche (1920</xref>, p. 148) notes that
            prepositions can be placed at the end of a sentence, with or without complement, ‘un peu
            à la façon de la particule séparable allemande’ as in (30), which corresponds to the
            structures found in Brussels:</p>

            ‘without’ and <italic>dessus</italic> ‘on’ as <italic>prépositions orphelines</italic>
            or stranded prepositions, as in (31) and (32), is not limited to Belgian French. She
            therefore doubts that language contact is to be invoked in explaining the occurrence of
            such prepositions:</p>

          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367006911403213">Bauche (1920</xref>,
            p. 149) also mentions the use of <italic>après</italic> with ‘some other verbs’, namely
              <italic>monter après un mur</italic> ‘to climb onto a wall’, <italic>demander après
              qn</italic> ‘to ask for someone’, <italic>chercher après qn</italic> ‘to look for
            someone’ and <italic>attendre après qn ou qc</italic> ‘to wait for someone or
            something’. These collocations are still found at the end of the 20th century. In his
            study of colloquial French, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367006911403213">Ball
              (2000</xref>, p. 122) mentions that stranding of the preposition is possible with for
            example <italic>crier après</italic> ‘to shout at’, <italic>aboyer après</italic> ‘to
            bark at’, <italic>attendre après</italic> ‘to wait for’ and <italic>demander
              après</italic> ‘to ask for someone’ and notes that the last two usages are
            colloquial.</p>
          <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens Beardsmore
              (1971)</xref>, these verbs are used in this way in Brussels French too, but there is a
            wider range of verbs that can be used with <italic>après</italic> or
              <italic>pour</italic> in Brussels French, namely, for example, <italic>voir
              après</italic> ‘to look after’, <italic>sentir après</italic> ‘to feel for’,
              <italic>goûter après</italic> ‘to taste after/like’, <italic>parier pour</italic> ‘to
            bet on’, <italic>soigner pour</italic> ‘to take care of’. For many of these verbs
            translation equivalents exist in Dutch, which is why transfer from Dutch is often
            assumed to be the source of these constructions in Brussels French.</p>
          <p>It is not possible, however, to decide whether transfer from Dutch plays a role in
            these structures if one considers isolated examples only. It is information regarding
            the frequency of these collocations in different speech communities that can shed new
            light on the issue, as in bilingual communities some variants may be used more
            frequently than in others because they correspond to variants found in the contact
            language. If this can be shown to be the case in Brussels, this will provide evidence
            for covert transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al.,
              2005</xref>).</p>
          <p>Therefore I now compare the frequency of collocations in the frog story data from
            Brussels with their frequency in corpora of spontaneous metropolitan French. First of
            all I searched the collocations in Beeching’s corpus of French as spoken in France
            (155,000 words) and then in the French corpus of Sketchengine (126,850,281
                words).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1367006911403213">17</xref></sup> A
            frequency analysis of these collocations in popular French could also have provided
            highly interesting information, but to the best of my knowledge, such a corpus is not
            currently available. In Beeching’s corpus only one collocation with
              <italic>après</italic> was found, namely <italic>courir après</italic>, shown in
                (33).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1367006911403213">18</xref></sup> As we have
            seen already, this is one of the two collocations which are also attested in the
              <italic>Trésor de la langue française informatisé</italic>

            </disp-quote>
          </p>
          <p>The prepositional phrase <italic>après ça</italic> in (34) is not linked to the verb
              <italic>chercher</italic>, but to the following clause <italic>il se disait</italic>
            ‘he said to himself’, although there are no pauses between the verb
              <italic>chercher</italic> and <italic>après ça</italic> or between the PP and the
            following clause. The PP does not refer to an object the speaker is looking for, but
            refers to an earlier event. Thus, <italic>après ça</italic> is a temporal PP and not
            part of a collocation with <italic>chercher</italic> (Beeching, personal communication).
            None of the other collocations were found in this corpus:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-quote>
              <p>(34) <italic>Alors il cherchait après ça il se disait si je me mets, je vais me
                  jeter dans un virage avec ma mobylette</italic>. (corpus Beeching, speaker B, line
                664)</p>
              <p>  ‘Then he searched, after that he said to himself, if I put myself, I will throw
                myself off my motorbike in a bend in the road.’</p>

          </p>
          <p>The results from Sketchengine confirm the findings based on Beeching’s corpus: the
            collocations under study are very rare in modern spontaneous French. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1367006911403213">Table 6</xref> presents the frequency
            of each of the collocations in the Sketchengine corpus, as well as the frequency of the
            same verbs without the preposition/adverb, and the relative frequency of the
            collocations, that is their frequency per 100 tokens of each verb. These results show
            that among the collocations studied here <italic>courir après</italic> is the most
            frequent one in this corpus, but the other collocations do not occur more than once in
            100 tokens of the verb. On average, the collocations under study occur only 0.37 times
            per 100 verbs in the Sketchengine corpus, which is less than in the Belgian French

          <p>Although the analysis of the data from Beeching’s corpus and the Sketchengine corpus
            clearly shows that the collocations under study are rare in modern spoken French, it is
            of course possible that they were more frequent in previous centuries. Thus, the
            constructions in Brussels French could be archaisms which have survived in this variety.
            As is well known, regional varieties of French, including those spoken in Belgium and
            Canada, are often marked by archaisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367006911403213">Francard &amp; Latin, 1995</xref>), but to my knowledge
            the structures mentioned here have not thus far been considered to fall in this
            category. Therefore I have scrutinized historical data from the previous five centuries
            to find out whether the collocations under study here were more frequent in the past. Of
            course comparing oral data with written data is problematic, but for obvious reasons, we
            can only get access to written historical data.</p>

          <p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367006911403213">Figure 1</xref> show
            that the collocations were indeed used in the previous centuries, and there is a gradual
            decline in their use from the 16th century onwards. Only the development of
              <italic>courir après</italic> differs from the other collocations in that it becomes
            more frequent in the 18th century, after which the decline sets in. It is still
            relatively frequent in the 20th century in comparison with the other collocations. There
            are no examples at all of <italic>appeler après</italic>, and very few of
              <italic>regarder après</italic> or <italic>chercher après</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1367006911403213">19</xref></sup> As the number of
            collocations does not exceed 3.5 per 100 tokens of each verb, it is clear they are not
            very frequent in any of the centuries studied here, and there is a clear downwards trend
            in their use, which is even clearer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367006911403213">Figure 2</xref>, which represents the averages for all forms. The decline presented

            Frantext, which consists of 21 million words. It is the only time we find this
            collocation in this century. In this scene, Alidor warns his friend Cléandre that the
            woman they are both in love with, Angélique, may discover that they have exchanged
            roles. As she might scream when she discovers she has been deceived, Cléandre is told to

          <p>The earliest example of <italic>chercher après</italic> is found in the 17th-century
            corpus too (see 40). There are 7219 tokens of <italic>chercher</italic> in this corpus,
            but only one of these is a collocation with <italic>après</italic>:</p>

          <p>The historical data clearly show that the collocations studied here were used from the
            16th century onwards, even though they are extremely rare, especially in the more recent
            past, and never exceed 1 in 100 tokens of the verb. Although this means that there is at
            least <italic>some</italic> evidence that the collocations in Brussels French can be
            explained as archaisms, they are much more frequent in Brussels French, where we find
            10.85 collocations per 100 verbs, than in the historical data from the previous five
            centuries. It is therefore clear that historical explanations on their own are not
            sufficient to explain the high frequency of the collocations in Brussels French.</p>

        <title>6.4 Crosslinguistic performance congruity</title>
        <p>In this section I explore the existence of crosslinguistic performance congruity in Dutch
          and French as spoken by bilinguals in Brussels. In other words, we want to know whether
          there are similarities between the bilinguals’ use of collocations in the recipient
          language (French) and their use of collocations in the source language (Dutch). While a
          detailed comparison of L1 and L2 performance of the same speakers is not possible at this
          point, as the speakers told different frog stories in the two languages, to avoid unwanted
          translation effects, Dutch collocations such as <italic>zoeken naar/achter</italic> ‘to
          look for’, as in (41), and <italic>roepen naar</italic> ‘to call for’, as in (42), which
          are translation equivalents of the Brussels French collocations <italic>chercher

        </p>
        <p>In the Dutch frog story corpus there were no tokens of the Dutch translation equivalent
          of <italic>tomber en bas</italic>, possibly because the story <italic>Frog goes to
            dinner</italic> did not provide the right context for this collocation to be used. A
          search in the Corpus Spoken Dutch demonstrates, however, that <italic>naar beneden
            vallen</italic> and <italic>neervallen</italic> (which both mean ‘fall down’) are common
          expressions in Dutch. The translation equivalents of the other structures under study are
          all frequent in this corpus too (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1367006911403213">Table 7</xref>). In some cases, different translation equivalents were possible, as for
          example <italic>courir après</italic> can be translated into Dutch as <italic>achter X
            aanrennen</italic> ‘to run after X’ or <italic>achter X aanlopen</italic> ‘to walk after
          X’, and there is a wide range of translation equivalents for <italic>sortir
            dehors</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1367006911403213">22</xref></sup> The
          different options were all searched in the Dutch corpus. For the purposes of the current
          article it is, however, important to note that the use of the preposition
            <italic>naar</italic> (or <italic>achter</italic>) is not obligatory with
            <italic>roepen</italic> ‘to call’ or <italic>zoeken</italic> ‘to search’: the verbs can
          be used with a direct object or a prepositional phrase, as in <italic>(naar) iemand/iets
            zoeken</italic> ‘to search (for) someone/something’ and <italic>(naar) iemand/iets
            roepen</italic> ‘to call (for) someone/something’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1367006911403213">23</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1367006911403213">Table 7</xref> demonstrates, in Dutch the collocations
          occur 3.5 times per 100 tokens of each verb. Comparing the frequency of the collocations
          in Dutch to those in French is, however, problematic, because the translation equivalents
          of the verbs are unlikely to occur with the same frequency in different languages.
          However, the fact that these translation equivalents exist and are relatively frequent in
          spoken Dutch provides additional support for the assumption that the collocations in
          Brussels French have become a major use pattern under the influence of Dutch.</p>

        <p>A final, highly interesting illustration of the influence of Dutch in the production of a
          French collocation can be found in (44), where the speaker uses a hybrid collocation
          consisting of a combination of the French verb <italic>chercher</italic> with the Dutch
          preposition <italic>naar</italic> ‘after’:</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>(44) <italic>Il cherche il cherche, il</italic>
              <bold><italic>cherche</italic></bold>
              <bold><italic>naar</italic></bold>
              <italic>dans un trou</italic>. (corpus JTD, speaker 14)</p>
            <p>  ‘He looks, he looks, he looks for in a hole.’</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>A possible explanation for this hybrid collocation can be sought in the speaker’s
          language dominance profile. From an analysis of this speaker’s vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367006911403213">Treffers-Daller, in press</xref>) we know
          that he is clearly Dutch-dominant in that he obtained a score above the median for Dutch
          and a score below the median for French on the D measure of vocabulary richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367006911403213">Malvern, Richards, Chipere, &amp; Durán,
            2004</xref>). It is fascinating to see the speaker’s dominant language being activated
          exactly at the moment of the production of the collocation. It is probably the dual
          activation of the two languages which results in him producing a hybrid construction. In
          this particular case, it seems to me that we are dealing with a dynamic phenomenon which
          is linked to processing, i.e. interference in Grosjean’s terminology, while in the other
          examples which are found among a wide variety of speakers, the collocations reflect
          permanent traces of Dutch on French, and are thus best seen as examples of transfer.</p>

      <title>7. Discussion and conclusion</title>
      <p>While transfer has been studied extensively over the past few decades and insights into the
        role of transfer in SLA and in studies of language variation and change have increased
        considerably, there is still a great deal of confusion about the nature of transfer and how
        it is best investigated. The aim of this article was to provide evidence regarding the claim
        that Brussels French grammatical collocations which consist of a verb with a preposition or
        an adverb <italic>chercher après</italic> ‘to look for’ are the result of transfer from
        Brussels Dutch, following the methodology proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911403213">Jarvis (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911403213">Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al. (2005)</xref> for identifying transfer.
        Collocations and verb-particle constructions have been studied widely in the Germanic
        languages as well as in Italian, but less attention has been paid to their occurrence in
        French, in which verb-particle constructions are assumed to be much less common. It has been
        known for a long time, however, that a range of grammatical collocations and some
        verb-particle constructions can be found in Brussels French and other Romance varieties
        along the linguistic frontier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens
          Beardsmore, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367006911403213">Kramer,
          1981</xref>), although evidence for the claim that their use is related to transfer from
        Dutch or German varieties was never provided.</p>
      <p>After a brief review of the key concepts of contact-induced change, transfer and
        replication, the most important syntactic and semantic properties of the collocations in
        Brussels French were presented. With the help of Jackendoff’s tests to distinguish particles
        and prepositions, it was established that most of the constructions with
          <italic>après</italic>, <italic>(en de)hors (de)</italic> and <italic>en bas (de)</italic>
        that occur in the Brussels French data set under study are not particles, because they fail
        Jackendoff’s movement tests. For this reason, it would be incorrect to consider the
        constructions in which they are used as verb-particle constructions, and the term
        ‘grammatical collocations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911403213">Granger
          &amp; Paquot, 2008</xref>) was chosen instead. A few examples from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911403213">Baetens Beardsmore (1971)</xref> and one example from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367006911403213">De Vriendt (2004)</xref> could, however, be
        considered as VPCs. The Brussels French patterns were shown to differ clearly from Canadian
        French constructions such as <italic>shutter off</italic> ‘to shut off’. In the Canadian
        contact situation English language material has been imported into French, whereas in
        Brussels French only a pattern has been replicated, but no language material has been
        transferred into French. It is likely that differences in social pressure and intensity of
        contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367006911403213">Thomason &amp; Kaufman,
          1988</xref>, p. 46) between the contact languages are responsible for the dissimilar
        outcomes of language contact in these two language communities. French is the dominant
        language in Brussels, whereas it is the non-dominant language in many Canadian communities.
        In particular in those Canadian communities where pressure from English is strong, advanced
        forms of language contact such as the importation of VPCs from English are found. In
        Brussels, where French is much less under pressure from the contact language, no VPCs are
        imported from Dutch, but some VPC patterns are replicated.</p>
      <p>In the results section, the focus was on providing the three kinds of evidence needed if
        one wants to argue a feature is contact-induced: intragroup homogeneity (uniformity of
        behaviour of bilinguals in Brussels with respect to the patterns under study); intergroup
        homogeneity (differences between the Brussels group and other groups which are or are not in
        contact with the same source language); and crosslinguistic performance congruity
        (similarities in the structures produced by bilinguals in their two languages).</p>
      <p>The first set of evidence that was investigated consisted of frog stories collected among
        bilinguals in Brussels. The results revealed that 19 out of 25 informants in this group use
        these collocations, which demonstrates that the phenomenon is not an isolated incidence and
        the group behaves in a relatively uniform manner with respect to this feature. In addition,
        there was a trend for speakers who had been to Dutch schools to produce these collocations
        more frequently than those who had been to French schools, so that contact with Dutch is
        probably a factor that can to some extent explain the frequency of occurrence of the
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>A comparison between the French frog stories from Brussels and those produced by a control
        group from Paris and a control group of L2 learners of French from Flanders confirmed that
        there are significant differences between the Brusselers and the other two groups in their
        use of these collocations. In Brussels, collocations were found on average 10.85 times out
        of 100 tokens of each verb, while in Paris there were virtually no examples of these
        constructions. While this in itself would have been enough to demonstrate intergroup
        heterogeneity, further evidence from other French corpora (spoken data from Wallonia and
        France, written data from literary sources and from internet sources) was sought to
        establish whether the absence of these collocations in the data from the control groups was
        accidental. The VALIBEL corpus of Belgian French contained examples of <italic>chercher
          après</italic> and <italic>sortir en dehors</italic>, but their frequency was much lower
        than in the Brussels French frog stories (0.8 per 100 tokens). Beeching’s corpus of modern
        spoken French and the Sketchengine corpus contained even fewer examples of these
        constructions (0.34 per 100 tokens). The fact that the frequency of the collocations was
        equally low in such a wide variety of data is remarkable, and strengthens the validity of
        the analyses presented here.</p>
      <p>Alternative internal explanations, in particular the possibility that the patterns in
        Brussels French are archaisms, were also explored. The analysis of collocations in
        historical data from the 16th century onwards revealed that most of the collocations under
        study do occur in historical data, with the exception of <italic>appeler après</italic> ‘to
        call for’, which was not found in any of the other sources. The collocations are, however,
        extremely infrequent in the historical data or the 20th-century Frantext corpus, while they
        are much more frequent in Brussels French. Little evidence was found for qualitative
        differences between the use of collocations in Brussels French and other varieties, except
        for some Dutch influence on the word order of a number of constructions. Although it is
        likely that normative pressures have played a role in the demise of these patterns, it is
        unlikely that internal factors are sufficient to explain these contrasts; an additional,
        external factor is likely to have played a role.</p>
      <p>The most plausible explanation for the facts is that knowledge and use of Dutch has led to
        an increase in the use of collocations by bilinguals in Brussels, in other words that the
        structures are the result of covert transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al., 2005</xref>) or pattern replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367006911403213">Matras &amp; Sakel, 2004</xref>) from Dutch.
        In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367006911403213">Heine and Kuteva’s (2005)</xref>
        framework the structures can be seen as replications of a grammatical use pattern which
        existed as a minor use pattern in French and which has become a major use pattern in
        Brussels French under the influence of Dutch.</p>
      <p>A number of facts discussed in this article point to influence from Dutch as the key factor
        that can explain the high frequency of the collocations in Brussels French. First of all,
        there is a trend for bilinguals who went to Dutch schools to produce more of these
        collocations; second, an analysis of Dutch frog stories produced by the same bilinguals from
        Brussels confirmed that the speakers use many Dutch patterns that are translation
        equivalents of the French collocations, such as <italic>zoeken naar</italic> ‘to look for’
        and <italic>roepen naar</italic> ‘to call for’. A quantitative analysis of the translation
        equivalents in the Corpus Spoken Dutch revealed that these are indeed common in spoken
        Dutch. Third, for one informant from the bilingual group it could be shown that Dutch was
        activated during language production, because he produced a hybrid collocation which
        consisted of the French verb <italic>chercher</italic> and the Dutch preposition
          <italic>naar</italic>. Fourth, it is well known that Dutch learners of French often
        produce the form <italic>chercher après</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367006911403213">Desmet et al., 2004</xref>), while Anglophone learners of
        French use the forms <italic>chercher pour</italic> or <italic>regarder pour</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al., 2005</xref>). The most
        likely explanation for the differences is that they are the result of transfer or pattern
        replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367006911403213">Heine &amp; Kuteva,
          2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367006911403213">Matras &amp; Sakel,
          2004</xref>) from the students’ first language.</p>
      <p>The current article clearly shows that the rigorous methodology to study transfer proposed
        by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911403213">Jarvis (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911403213">Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367006911403213">Mougeon et al. (2005)</xref> can help
        disentangle the role of internal and external factors in language variation and change. The
        differences in the frequency of the phenomenon across a range of corpora provided the key
        evidence for the role of transfer from Dutch in the use of these collocations in Brussels
        French. It would be very interesting to see this approach applied to studies of VPCs in
        Italian and other languages spoken along the Romance/Germanic language border. Further
        studies of the frequency of these structures in popular French would also be extremely
        useful, as it appears that some of the structures under study here do occur in popular
        French. In addition, it would be relevant to study the frequency of these collocations in
        the speech of monolingual French speakers from Brussels, as this would give us further
        information about the diffusion of the phenomenon across the speech community of French
        speakers in Belgium. Factors such as social class and register may also play an interesting
        role here. These issues will need to be addressed in further studies of this fascinating
        phenomenon.</p>

          <p>The structure in (1a) is unusual in metropolitan French, as French does not have

            signed by Cléandre, not Alidor. They are both afraid she may discover the plot and
            scream when she discovers she has been deceived, because the two men do not look like
            each other.</p>

          <p>According to De Vriendt (personal communication) <italic>rennen</italic> is exogenous
            in Flanders. Instead <italic>lopen</italic> is used to express the concept of
              <italic>rennen</italic>.</p>
        </fn>

          <label>22.</label>
          <p>There are many Dutch translation equivalents for <italic>sortir dehors</italic>, as
            this expression can be used transitively as well as intransitively. In Dutch, different
            verbs are used to express the range of meanings of <italic>sortir dehors</italic>:
            intransitive: <italic>(naar) buiten gaan</italic> or <italic>uitgaan</italic>;
            transitive: <italic>buiten zetten</italic>, <italic>buiten laten</italic>,
              <italic>uitlaten</italic>, <italic>uithalen</italic>, etc. Calculating the relative
            frequency of the Dutch translation equivalents of <italic>sortir dehors</italic> is
            therefore hardly possible, and such calculations have not been included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1367006911403213">Table 7</xref>.</p>

        <fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1367006911403213">
          <label>23.</label>
          <p>In the latter case there is a slight meaning difference in Standard Dutch: <italic>iets
              naar iemand roepen</italic> means ‘to shout something at someone’, whereas
              <italic>iemand roepen</italic> means ‘to call (for) someone’.</p>
