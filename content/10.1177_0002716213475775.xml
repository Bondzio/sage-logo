<abstract>
<p>Previous literature suggests that AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) play an important support role in the lives of impoverished women living with HIV. Less is known about the dynamics of institutional support for middle-class women living with HIV/AIDS, who are assumed to possess a broader base of resources to address their diagnosis. Using qualitative data collected from a racially and economically diverse group of HIV-positive women in Chicago, this article compares how low-income and middle-class women utilize ASOs and reveals how the women’s divergent approaches to availing themselves of institutional resources have important implications for their social and economic coping. For example, associating with ASOs can be status-improving for impoverished women and status-diminishing for middle-class women. As a result, middle-class women report a less robust network of social service providers and people living with HIV/AIDS on whom they rely for HIV-related information and social support, making them vulnerable to HIV-specific social isolation. In sum, the ways that HIV-positive women deploy institutional ties to negotiate their HIV/AIDS status differs markedly depending on socioeconomic status, suggesting that the role of class in gathering social support may be more complex than previously understood.</p>

<p>Due to medical advances, people with HIV in the United States are living longer than ever before. As HIV/AIDS has transformed from an inevitable death sentence to a chronic illness, little attention has been paid to the new social and economic realities that are emerging for HIV-positive individuals. To live with HIV, effective medical treatments are perhaps best coupled with a combination of social support to ease the emotional costs of the disease and economic resources to meet ongoing financial needs. Over the years, HIV-focused support groups; legal, housing, and other social service agencies; and advocacy groups have been critically important in helping people cope with their diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002716213475775">Berger 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002716213475775">Doyal and Anderson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002716213475775">Epstein 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002716213475775">Jennings, Callahan, and Caplan 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002716213475775">Kobasa 1990</xref>). As “framing institutions,” AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) shape the form and tenor of individuals’ coping trajectories by offering initial information about one’s HIV status, a conceptual framework for understanding what it means to have HIV, language to talk about one’s condition, and resources to begin restructuring one’s life in the wake of a diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002716213475775">Watkins-Hayes, Pittman-Gay, and Beaman 2012</xref>). These institutions are especially powerful for women, who are more likely to adhere to treatment regimens when they have positive relationships with providers, confidence in the knowledge being provided, and an opportunity to demonstrate agency in their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002716213475775">Gardner et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002716213475775">Ickovics et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002716213475775">Misener and Sowell 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Urban areas tend to offer the most comprehensive resources for managing HIV. It is estimated that 50 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS around the world reside in cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002716213475775">Sidibe 2010</xref>). The political and social engagement of AIDS activists, people living with the disease, and service providers have led to robust social service and advocacy networks and medical organizations that offer HIV prevention and treatment services in many of these communities. Less conventional settings, such as churches, salons, and barbershops, and, in some cases, prisons, have also been constructively deployed in HIV prevention and treatment efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002716213475775">Grinstead, Zack, and Faigeles 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002716213475775">Linnan and Ferguson 2007</xref>). Institutions serve as buffers against (or facilitators of) structural, organizational, interpersonal, and individual factors that affect both the transmission of HIV and the experiences of those living with the virus. Neighborhood institutional resource theory predicts that organizational networks, specialized knowledge, and the ability to bundle resources are the avenues through which these processes take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002716213475775">Jencks and Mayer 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002716213475775">Small 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous literature suggests that ASOs are widely used by people living with HIV/AIDS, and their benefits are well documented. In a study of sixty-seven HIV-positive women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002716213475775">Gillman and Newman (1996)</xref> found that respondents reported using an average of 2.6 social service agencies, and 49 percent had visited a support group at least once. Attendance in HIV support groups is associated with increased medication adherence, fewer risk behaviors that might further damage one’s health, reduced feelings of shame, and a network of friends with whom to socialize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002716213475775">Lennon-Dearing 2008</xref>). ASOs in general are largely viewed as reliable sources of information and services and enjoy a solid reputation among various populations living with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002716213475775">Gillman and Newman 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002716213475775">Shedlin and Shulman 2004</xref>). For those also recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, the rejection of previous drug-using networks and the development of new formal and informal networks are pivotal for managing HIV and often occur within ASOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002716213475775">Takahashi and Rodriquez 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002716213475775">Watkins-Hayes, Pittman-Gay, and Beaman 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The plethora of ASOs, coupled with the advent of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) and increased public awareness, might lead some to assume that HIV-positive women experience few negative outcomes as a result of their status. This hinges on the assumption that HIV-focused institutions address the needs of a wide spectrum of people living with the disease. This has been found to be the case for people of various racial backgrounds, genders, primary languages, and sexual orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002716213475775">Takahashi and Rodriquez 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002716213475775">Shedlin and Shulman 2004</xref>). However, what role does socioeconomic status play in whether and how women utilize ASOs, and what are the social and economic implications of these institutional ties? If we find that variation in service use and institutional experiences among women living with HIV/AIDS follows a pattern informed by class, this may not only reveal a void in the delivery of HIV services but also serve as an illustration of multiple and intersecting identities that are mediated through support seeking in ways we may not expect.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom would predict that middle-class women who are HIV-positive reap greater benefits from interacting with ASOs than low-income women do because of the former’s ability to deploy cultural capital to advocate for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002716213475775">Lareau 2003</xref>), and the larger quantity and quality of economic and social resources that they can combine with any institutional resources that they may procure. However, these assumptions have not been empirically tested. This omission is important for two reasons. First, explicating how women’s relationships with health and service institutions differ by socioeconomic status gives us greater insight into the micro dynamics of support seeking and how women’s social identities are linked to the pursuit of social and economic resources. Second, the lack of a nuanced analysis of how organizational relationships for people living with HIV/AIDS differ by class leaves policymakers, service providers, and advocates without a complete understanding of the unique challenges and needs that confront all individuals living with the disease.</p>
<p>Social scientists have paid increased attention to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002716213475775">McQuarrie and Marwell (2009)</xref> refer to as the social productivity of institutions in urban environments. Under this framework, organizations have “an independent role in the production, reproduction, and arrangement of urban social relations . . . and individual outcomes and identities” (pp. 247–48). A perhaps overlooked role of institutions is their function in helping individuals negotiate what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002716213475775">Goffman (1963)</xref> called a “spoiled identity.” A change in an individual’s social status and definition of the self often result when a stigmatizing experience occurs or a characteristic interferes with or disqualifies one from full participation in normative roles, statuses, and social relations in a community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002716213475775">Stanley (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002716213475775">Grove, Kelly, and Liu (1997)</xref> document the processes by which women with HIV seek to reclaim a “safe” moral identity by looking for social meaning in their diagnosis and heavily controlling the conditions under which they disclose their HIV status to preserve social standing and relationships. This work tends to construct these processes as internally driven, as women reflect on their “spoiled identity” and make decisions based on their beliefs about how they might be perceived by others. What is less clear is the role that institutions play in helping women to negotiate stigma and isolation and how socioeconomic status drives that engagement. Using data from a racially and economically diverse group of women living with HIV/AIDS in Chicago, this article highlights how class can mediate the relationship between health, institutions, and social support.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002716213475775" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>In 2009, 23 percent of new HIV infections in the United States were among women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2011).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002716213475775">1</xref></sup> The Health, Hardship, and Renewal (HHR) study examines how HIV-positive women in Chicago address their financial needs once diagnosed with the disease; how those financial strategies are undergirded by social relations with institutions, networks, and individuals; and how these economic and social interactions shape health management. More specifically, through in-depth interviews and participant observation, the HHR study is ultimately interested in explicating how managing a serious and long-term health condition complicates how women navigate economic and social inequality. The HHR study looks at HIV-positive women’s interactions with government and nonprofit service providers, employers, and medical providers as they pursue resources and social support for themselves and their families. The study reveals how disclosure, stigma, privacy, respect, and power are negotiated in resource-bearing and resource-claiming relationships for women as their health status, and the social meanings attached to their health, transition with the evolution of a serious and highly stigmatizing disease.</p>
<p>We engaged HIV-positive women in two ways. First, thirty HIV-positive African American women were recruited to participate in a longitudinal ethnography. African American women were selected as the group of focus because of their disproportionately high HIV infection rates relative to the rest of the female population in Chicago and nationally. At some point in her lifetime, 1 in 32 black women in the United States—compared to 1 in 106 Latinas and 1 in 526 white or Asian women—will be diagnosed with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002716213475775">CDC 2011</xref>). Each respondent participated in two one-on-one, in-depth, open-ended interviews in 2005 and 2006, and follow-up interviews are currently being conducted. As part of the ethnographic fieldwork, the principal investigator and her research assistant conducted participant observations in several venues frequented by respondents, such as support groups for HIV-positive people, doctor’s offices at which respondents were seeking treatment, AIDS activist events, and social service agencies. The purpose of these observations was to explicate how HIV-positive African American women navigate a variety of institutional contexts and how those institutional relationships are tied to women’s economic and health management strategies. Emphasis was placed on variation among respondents on the basis of socioeconomic status, which was difficult to achieve for many of the reasons that are outlined in this article. The overall goal of this component of the HHR study was to explore a range of domains in HIV-positive black women’s lives, such as work, family, intimate relationships, and institutional ties, to capture how HIV/AIDS impacts their daily living, life chances, and social outcomes over time.</p>
<p>Second, an additional eighty-two HIV-positive women of various racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds were recruited to participate in an interview-based “snapshot study.” Each respondent participated in one in-depth, two-hour, open-ended interview in 2010 or 2011 with a member of the HHR research team. The emphasis of this component of the research was on maximizing respondent variation according to race, class, level of institutional connection, and primary income source (e.g., wages, government subsidy, informal strategies). Our goal was to provide a broad overview of the economic picture of women living with HIV in the Chicago area through in-depth analysis of resource inflows and outflows, their embedded social dynamics, and their relationships to health management strategies. For both the longitudinal ethnography and the snapshot study, the HHR research team recruited respondents from primary care doctors and obstetricians/gynecologists (including HIV specialists), social service agencies (HIV-related and not), churches, advertisements on the city’s public transportation system, and word-of-mouth.</p>
<sec id="section2-0002716213475775">
<title>HHR study sample characteristics: Longitudinal ethnography</title>
<p>All thirty participants self-identified as U.S.-born black women. Respondents ranged in age from 19 to 55, with the average being 36 at the outset of study participation. Four women had been diagnosed with AIDS at recruitment, and the rest were HIV-positive. Five of the women reported annual household incomes over $50,000, and seven reported incomes in the $20,000–$49,999 range. Most respondents were, however, impoverished, reporting yearly household incomes of less than $20,000. The twelve who reported $20,000+ annual household incomes were working at the time of recruitment. All respondents had children (two on average). Five women were married, three were divorced, and four were widows. The rest were single. HIV diagnoses were made between 1984 and 2004, with the average year of diagnosis being 1996.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002716213475775">
<title>HHR study sample characteristics: Snapshot study</title>
<p>Nationally in 2009, black women accounted for 57 percent of HIV cases among women; the numbers for white and Hispanic women were 21 percent and 16 percent, respectively. For the snapshot study, we purposely oversampled whites and Hispanics relative to their share of the female HIV-positive population to strengthen our analytic traction. As a result, 43.90 percent of snapshot study participants were black, 29.27 percent were white, 25.61 percent were Hispanic, and 1.22 percent reported racial identities outside of these three categories.</p>
<p>The snapshot study has a high number of very low-income women (68.29 percent) who report annual household incomes of less than $20,000. Slightly more than 18 percent (18.29) of respondents report household incomes in the $20,000–$40,000 range, and 13.41 percent of respondents are in households making more than $40,000. There is little national data on income levels among those living with HIV/AIDS, so it is difficult to say with certainty how our numbers compare to the national female HIV-positive population. However, the CDC identifies poverty as “the single most important demographic factor associated with HIV infection among inner-city heterosexuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002716213475775">CDC 2010</xref>, 1). The vast majority of respondents were receiving their primary income from a government subsidy (58.54 percent), which was most often Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Notably, most respondents received these disability payments for a health diagnosis other than HIV, as many have a co-occurring illness. A small percentage of respondents (less than 15 percent) received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) due to more extensive work histories. For 24.39 percent of respondents, formal wages were their primary income source, and 17.07 percent reported that their primary income came from gifts or undocumented wages.</p>
<p>In terms of institutional connectedness, a key variable for the current analysis, respondents are divided about equally, with 53.66 percent or forty-four respondents classified as “connected” and 46.34 percent or thirty-eight respondents classified as “not connected.” Institutional connectedness was determined by the respondent’s answer to the following question: “Do you ever visit or talk with someone at an HIV-focused organization, agency, or group?” If the respondent indicated that these interactions typically took place at least once every six to eight weeks, she was counted as “connected.”</p>
<p>Interviews were recorded and transcribed. The interview transcripts were then coded in two stages. Research team members first coded the transcripts following themes identified in the interview guide, using qualitative data analysis software.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002716213475775">2</xref></sup> Then, the principal investigator coded transcripts using three themes that were prominent in women’s discussions of their use of institutions: economic support, social status, and social support. It became evident through the coding process that the women experienced significant gains and losses in all three domains, due in part to their relationships with ASOs. This multistaged coding process employed a grounded theory approach that allows categories to emerge from the data obtained, rather than imposing a theory on data before research has begun, while maintaining connections with the extant literature to draw theoretical conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002716213475775">Strauss and Corbin 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>To do a comparison of the experiences of middle-class versus low-income women, we had to first determine who from the HHR study sample (longitudinal ethnography and snapshot study) could be characterized as middle class. Respondents had to meet at least one of three criteria. Individuals who reported that their annual household incomes were $40,000 or above, had a minimum of two years of college at a four-year institution, or were currently working in a professional or white-collar job were counted as middle class by the study team. This produced 20 women from the snapshot study and 5 women from the longitudinal ethnography, yielding a total of 25 middle-class respondents from the total sample of 112 women.</p>
<p>Conducting this research in Chicago allowed the HHR team to explore the micro dynamics of support seeking in an urban context rich with ASOs. There are more than twenty-two categories of services offered by more than two hundred ASOs in the Chicago area, including aging and elderly services, alternative therapies, food and basic needs services, legal assistance, mental health services, substance abuse services, and support groups. Most organizations are funded by a combination of federal Ryan White Funds, local and state government grants, and private donations. Because of the numerous ASOs in the area, women had choices about which agencies to frequent, how often to attend, and what services to procure. It is therefore highly consequential if a segment of women living with HIV are choosing not to engage with these organizations.</p>

<sec id="section4-0002716213475775">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Ties to institutions focusing on HIV/AIDS can shape the experience of living with the disease by creating a network that offers information, resources, and social support by and for individuals grappling with the same stigmatizing and serious illness. Emerging from the AIDS activism of the 1980s that advocated for nonstigmatizing, consistent, and high-quality services for HIV-positive individuals, these organizations attract a wide array of people and frequently emphasize peer-led services to empower clients and build networks among them. This approach is consistent with previous research that suggests that experiential similarity that results from having a similar life transition may be more important than structural similarities, such as age, gender, and marital status, in determining sources of emotional support following an important life event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002716213475775">Suitor, Pillemer, and Keeton 1995</xref>). Experiential similarity appears to be important, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002716213475775">Suitor, Pillemer, and Keeton (1995)</xref> write, “because of the greater empathy and understanding it create[s], as well as the increased ease in discussing problematic aspects of the transitions” (p. 1585).</p>
<sec id="section5-0002716213475775">
<title>A safety net or a trap door? Institutional ties and the economic implications of HIV disclosure</title>
<p>All HHR study respondents had private or publicly subsidized health insurance that covered their HIV medications and medical treatments, so most reported minimal health care costs directly related to HIV. However, the disease has a variety of other financial implications, largely tied to how women pursue resources for daily survival and address the question of disclosing their HIV status in the process.</p>
<p>Low-income women who connect with ASOs can find that their economic fortunes actually stabilize following an HIV diagnosis. They are often so disadvantaged prior to diagnosis that the institutional assistance for which they now qualify can offer increased financial stability. The nonprofit and public institutions that respondents frequent for HIV support groups, social services, and health care are often able to offer free subway and bus passes, stipends for facilitating support groups, and in some cases affordable housing and access to employment training opportunities, by leveraging agency funding and ties to other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002716213475775">Small 2009</xref>). This generosity is particularly effective in an urban context because of the larger number of organizations that focus on HIV, allowing women to sample from a variety of services. For example, Jada, a 43-year-old black woman, was diagnosed with HIV in 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002716213475775">3</xref></sup> As she explained, her connection to an ASO created housing stability and generated a variety of ancillary benefits:
<disp-quote>
<p>Before the job I have now, I worked in a shelter for homeless women and children as a cook supervisor. That’s how I found out about the place I’m living now. I live in a low-income housing development for single women with children living with HIV or AIDS. And it’s a very, very nice building. Rent goes according to your income. When your children get 20, 25, you don’t have to kick them out. They can also stay there with you. It has a computer room. It offers tutoring for the children, play time, laundry facility in the building, clean building, nice tenants. So it’s . . . it’s good. It’s good for me. I waited two and a half years to get that apartment. So I’m in there and I’ll be there. Since that’s permanent housing, I’m okay.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The increased access to resources that Jada describes is consistent with previous scholarship that paradoxically finds an improved quality of life postdiagnosis among many severely low-income people with HIV/AIDS due to their increased access to state and nonprofit resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002716213475775">Dickson-Gomez et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002716213475775">Leclerc-Madlala 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002716213475775">Crane, Quirk, and van der Straten 2002</xref>). “The most economically disenfranchised segments of society,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002716213475775">Crane, Quirk, and van der Straten (2002)</xref> write, “may be placed in a difficult position of experiencing AIDS both as a threat and as a means of financial survival” (p. 1116). In her analysis of the relationship between social support and health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002716213475775">Thoits (2011)</xref> posits that instrumental support through financial assistance and help with practical tasks are some of the most effective forms of aid for reducing health-related stress. Not only does this kind of support alleviate many of Jada’s daily demands, it signals to her that others care about her well-being.</p>
<p>Institutional ties to ASOs offer more than simply economic resources. The networks in which these individuals are embedded generate HIV-specific social capital that provides useful information in a nonstigmatized setting. Jada discusses her medications and overall management of HIV with the housing staff and her neighbors:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I’m ill, you know, maybe [my neighbors] can give me feedback on how to get better or what to do or what not to do, what to eat, what not to eat. Just sharing different things about medications that all of us take . . . the side effects and things. Stuff like that we talk about. Or just getting together, going on a women’s retreat. We share stuff like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Vicki, a 44-year-old single mother of a one-year-old daughter, offered a description of how she and others in her network make ends meet. While a low-wage job in a fast-food restaurant supplemented her SSI check, Vicki ultimately credits her ties to ASOs for her ability to financially subsist. Far from being a passive recipient of assistance, Vicki is an active advocate for her health, skillfully securing much-needed resources and teaching others to do the same.</p>

Let’s go over there and just explain how you’re doing, what you’re going through and how you feel, you know. So . . . and I will just walk you through those, you know, until you get balanced and then, okay, if you ain’t got housing, come on . . . you know, if you need emergency housing, we gonna call [names second agency]. If they ain’t got it, we got it over here. You know, we’re gonna work it ‘til we hear something. You know, if you need food stamps, then we’re gonna call . . . we’re gonna get the doctor to sign this paper, we’re gonna send this, we’re gonna fax this to here and we’re gonna be plugged in. Now, [names third agency], say you just got burned out, you ain’t got no clothes, you know what I’m saying? You ain’t got nothing. Nothing. You need something to put on your back right now. You need a coat right now. You ain’t got no money. Oh, we’re gonna need bus fair, we going to get us that first from [names fourth agency]. A regular staff person [gives us some paperwork] you know, take it back to [names third agency], they’re gonna give [clothes] to us right now. They ain’t gonna ask us when, where, how or what. Cause we’ve been sent. You know what I’m saying? So you have to plug in to know when and where to go.</p>

<p>As Vicki describes, psychosocially, medically, and financially coping with an HIV diagnosis are inextricably linked, and organizational ties can facilitate this. What these ties are offering, in addition to a portfolio of services, are the opportunities for women to network with one another to gather critical information. Through these relationships, the women are weaving together an HIV safety net that offers comprehensive assistance to help them get back on their feet after the shock of a life-threatening health diagnosis. Vicki goes on to say, “I’m just outreaching for anyone because I’ve been there and I know sources. And if I don’t know, I know somebody who does know. I don’t mind plugging nobody in because we’re all in this together.”</p>
<p>In contrast, these linkages play out in very different ways for middle-class women. An HIV diagnosis does not strengthen these respondents’ economic stability, whether or not they are institutionally connected. The women spoke at length about the potential for HIV to cause their downward mobility should they lose their jobs and health insurance. Unlike low-income respondents who look to ASOs for economic help, middle-class respondents believe that ASOs are ill-equipped to protect them from the financial risks associated with HIV. Barb, a 62-year-old white woman, was diagnosed in 1984. Her story is a cautionary tale that reflects a key concern of many of the HHR study’s middle-class respondents:
<disp-quote>
<p>I worked part-time while I raised four kids. Got a master’s [degree] in biochemistry before I started regularly getting sick. I had a husband who made good money, worked for an insurance company, years of promotions, years of raises. Six months after I tested HIV-positive, he got terminated. Our lawyer said it would be hard to prove it was my status. We lost our house. We had to get divorced so he could become employable again. He had been blacklisted until we got divorced, so I could not be on his health insurance at work . . . he died of a heart attack. I think it was the stress. And then I went on Social Security—$674 a month.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Barb’s story is unique among the women in our sample, and what she experienced is less likely in this era of employment protections for HIV-positive individuals. However, HIV discrimination still exists, and the prospect of such an occurrence looms large in the minds of middle-class respondents. Katy, a 35-year-old married mother of one, described this sense of economic vulnerability. Diagnosed in 2010 while pregnant, Katy is sure that her job making $120,000/year would be at risk should her status become known in the workplace:
<disp-quote>
<p>I report directly to the president of my company. And I know how my company works. There is a law against letting someone go for HIV, but there are 15 ways to let someone go without saying it. I am the main provider for my family. We just had a baby. What would I do?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Katy, protecting her job means living in silence about her health status. She is similar to the vast majority of the middle-class women in the HHR study, who reported that they reveal their HIV status much less frequently than their low-income counterparts. Katy described her reluctance to connect to ASOs: “My doctor told me about a program pairing women with HIV together and also support group lunches hosted at the hospital. I don’t need to tell anybody. I’ve never gotten myself there.” Katy works long hours, hiding the fatigue and the irritation to her digestive system that are side effects from her HIV medications, to maintain her economic standing. Because she has no ties to ASOs, Katy does not operate in a network of people who have walked similar paths and might suggest protective strategies to help her cope.</p>
<p>Contrasting the experiences of women like Jada and Vicki with those of women like Katy and Barb, we see that an HIV diagnosis has different financial implications for women based on their socioeconomic status. However, it is not a simple relationship in which higher-income women have more buffers against the potentially negative consequences of their illness. To the contrary, an HIV diagnosis appears to heighten the sense of financial vulnerability for middle-income women while lowering this sense for low-income women who access services. Similar to their wealthier counterparts, low-income women express fear about the stigma that can result from disclosing their HIV status. However, they often find that their economic survival depends on disclosing to a broad array of service providers and other people living with HIV/AIDS to get access to resources. Privacy becomes a luxury that most impoverished women with HIV cannot afford, and their disclosure can lead to institutional ties that prove very beneficial for their economic stability. The qualifier that low-income women must develop and deploy institutional ties for this to take place is key, as low-income women with few institutional ties or who choose not to utilize existing ties to ASOs for financial resources find themselves highly economically vulnerable. Conversely, middle-class women see few economic advantages associated with HIV disclosure and often go to great and stressful lengths to hide their status to avoid economically vulnerability. They fail to see how ASOs can be “helps” to them, financially or otherwise.</p>

<title>Status gained, status lost: The social significance of institutional ties for HIV-positive women</title>
<p>In her book, <italic>Workable Sisterhood</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002716213475775">Michelle Tracy Berger (2004)</xref> outlines how HIV-positive women who experience several economic and social disadvantages due to their racial, class, and gender status are often able to transform this stigmatization into political power by mobilizing around these identities after their HIV diagnoses. The politics of intersectional stigma operate such that community work and political activism motivated by multiple marginalized identities have status-enhancing effects for women who are already deeply disadvantaged.</p>
<p>During fieldwork for the longitudinal ethnographic component of the HHR study, several low-income respondents were observed engaging in public speaking for HIV prevention and running peer-led HIV support groups. By offering unvarnished accounts of their biographies as well as advice to those in similar circumstances, women with “spoiled identities” used a variety of organizational platforms to enhance their social status, gaining the respect of the audiences to which they spoke and within the community of people living with HIV. For example, with seven years of sobriety under her belt, 41-year-old Jackie has established herself as an informal mentor to several women in her Chicago community who have recently been diagnosed with HIV or who struggle with addiction. The following fieldnote captures the combination of practical advice and spiritual guidance on how to live as an HIV-positive woman that Jackie, a fixture in various ASO support groups, offers to the women in her network:
<disp-quote>
<p>During her turn in the support group, Maggie described her emotional struggle to stay sober as her sister struggles with terminal cancer. “I believe in God and I know that He’s got me, but I need someone down here,” she commented. “I feel like it’s just me and I ain’t got nobody. It’s like at two and three in the morning when I’m alone and I’m struggling the most.”</p>
<p>Jackie encouraged Maggie to stay faithful and call her for support. “I work at night so I’m up at that hour. I’ll help you. You gon’ make it. You are in God’s hands.”</p>
<p>She then began to offer more directives. “I want you to read the 12 steps again. Do you have an NA [Narcotics Anonymous] book?” she asked. “I want you to read the steps again and write a short paper on what they mean to you, how they affect your life.”</p>
<p>“I can do that,” Maggie responded. “I just need somebody to talk to. I’m struggling.”</p>
<p>“God knows it,” Jackie responded. “Here let’s pray.” She rose to her feet and held out both hands for Maggie to grab. Maggie clutched Jackie’s hands and Jackie began to pray, giving thanks for the day, for survival, for hope, and for what God has done and will do in Maggie’s life. “Walk with her Lord,” Jackie asserted. “Help her know that there is support around her and that she is in Your arms.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Maggie thanked her and commented that she felt so much better having attended the meeting.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002716213475775">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a leader in the community of women living with HIV, Jackie has a presence and commands a level of respect that, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002716213475775">Berger’s (2004)</xref> findings, she did not have access to until she mobilized her ties in the HIV community. Her personal challenges as a woman who struggled for years with drugs and alcohol as she lived in denial about her HIV diagnosis, as well as her commitment to sobriety, are now viewed as assets that afford her the expertise and authority to help others. This status-enhancing effect, along with the previously described economic benefits, helps to explain why so many HIV-positive low-income women engage with these institutions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was little evidence of the status-enhancing effects of ASO affiliations for middle-class women. HIV-positive women who are not viewed as “high-risk” may feel especially threatened and demoralized by HIV stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002716213475775">Stanley 1999</xref>). Deflecting stigma and reconstructing one’s sense of self are critical for all HIV-positive women, but this appears to be intensified for those who prior to diagnosis lived with fewer stigmatizing social characteristics. When HIV-positive status is at the center of an institutional relationship, these women must negotiate whether and how they will associate and define their identities.</p>
<p>For example, Barb struggles with her status as a social service client, which traditionally involves the display of compliance to appear “deserving” of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002716213475775">Lipsky 1980</xref>). In their study of welfare administration in the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002716213475775">Rosenthal and Peccei (2006)</xref> found that to make sense of their clients, frontline workers employ a pervasive moral categorization of clients according to their perceived body language, demeanor, interactional style, expressions of gratitude, and capacity for aggression. The economically disadvantaged, therefore, often learn the expected ways to present themselves to caseworkers and other frontline service providers to receive services. Barb’s privileged status as a white woman who was once firmly ensconced in the middle class collides with her more recently obtained status as an HIV-positive client in need. The new reliance on ASOs requires that Barb forfeit some of her privacy to receive assistance to address her economic needs:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the major shocks to the system for anybody who comes from a middle-class or upper-middle-class background is that [service providers] are going to feel free to ask you these questions and think nothing of it, and more than one person. Because nobody with HIV, once you’ve had it for a while, has only one case manager. So you have to repeat the same soul-crushing, degrading stories to multiple people. You have no privacy, your whole life—you have to discuss the most private and intimate parts of your life with someone who’s basically a stranger, to get services. You’re no longer seen as a human being; “You’re our client.” Client does not equal human.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For many women, having HIV represents a moral failing and loss of respectability. For middle-class respondents, many of whom do not have lifelong histories of trauma, an HIV diagnosis is unlike anything that they have suffered. Nicki, a 41-year-old black woman, was diagnosed in 1995 after testing positive while trying to donate blood. As a government worker making $87,000 a year, Nicki struggles to reconcile her economic privilege with her HIV status. Associating with ASOs is viewed as a status-diminishing event that causes her and many respondents who share her economic position not to participate:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s such a scary thought to be identified, especially if your life is going pretty well and you’ve pulled yourself up by your bootstraps such as I have. And to be identified as, I don’t know, a bad person or an irresponsible woman and . . . I don’t know. I just think that it’s so terrifying to be identified that people just stay away [from ASOs].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Middle-class women who chose to engage with ASOs as clients report feeling a sense of isolation because of the stark class differences with other participants, despite sharing the same HIV status. It is not unusual for their support groups to consist mostly of low-income women who have suffered a host of traumas that directly or indirectly contributed to their HIV infection such as homelessness, abuse, and chronic unemployment. Given their economic struggles and social marginalization, the topics of conversation within these settings often center on how to get resources to make ends meet or how to cope with both stale and fresh emotional scars. Part of the shame of association for middle-class women is that these organizational ties not only define them as HIV-positive but also place them in the same community as women whom they see as worlds apart and perhaps even less respectable. Nicki explained what it is like for her to attend HIV support groups:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I went into these meetings, they were drug-addicted women . . . I just didn’t have anything in common with them. . . . Like I want to discuss, I don’t know, some racist things that may go on at work or a book I am reading . . . not that they cannot identify with it. But I don’t know . . . our ideas and our things just don’t click. They just don’t.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only do middle-class respondents feel as though they cannot relate to the experiences of low-income HIV-positive women, they also charge that these relationships fail to address what they would like to place on the agenda because they are not in the majority. Nicki’s desire to discuss events at work that are impeding her climb up the ladder and the latest cultural artifacts of middle-class status are largely sidelined by the more pressing concerns of economic and emotional survival held by the majority of participants.</p>
<p>As a result, most of the middle-class respondents in the HHR study chose to forgo the institutional benefits offered by ASOs rather than adapt to their norms. The social costs are too great, they reason, as these ties threaten the social status that they are struggling to retain, place the stigma and shame that they feel front and center of the conversation, and put them in a position in which they may be giving far more advice and support than they receive. The women do not require the basic economic resources supplied by these organizations, and the social incentives are minimal. As we see in the next section, this causes middle-class women with HIV to have very few ties to people or organizations associated with the disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0002716213475775">
<title>Institutional ties and HIV-specific social isolation</title>
<p>Not needing housing, subsidized medical services, or other survival resources, middle-class women are less likely to engage institutions where the support offered is group-based and heavily focused on sharing information about emotional coping, health management, and subsidized services simultaneously. As a result, middle-class respondents frequently reference pastors, therapists, and private doctors as the main institutional actors who are helping them come to terms with and manage their health status. These individuals offer one-on-one support in private and highly confidential settings. As Katy explained, “My husband, my parents, one or two friends, and my doctors are the only ones that know. To not be able to tell my close friends at work is devastating.”</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status appears to afford middle-class women greater privacy as they cope with their illness. However, this costs them when we look at the size of their HIV-related networks. They overwhelmingly report that they know few to no other people living with HIV, unlike their low-income HIV-positive counterparts in the HHR study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002716213475775">Thoits (2011)</xref> outlines how the heavy reliance on very small networks of family, friends, and one-on-one service providers who are not specialists in the area of concern comes with several risks. These individuals may not be able to offer the emotional resources or the most up-to-date knowledge about the illness, despite their best intentions. They may offer advice that is inappropriate, generic, or unrealistic because of their lack of experience with the condition. Intimate network members may be grappling with their own feelings about their loved one’s HIV-positive status and the disruption that it has created. “Invested supporters,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002716213475775">Thoits (2011)</xref> explains, “therefore may minimize the threatening aspects of the problem, insist on maintaining a positive outlook, or pressure the person to recover or problem solve before he or she is ready” (p. 153). She therefore highlights the importance of receiving coping assistance from experientially similar others who often fall outside of one’s most immediate networks.</p>
<p>Why is it important to have HIV-specific social ties through institutions? These organizations facilitate information-sharing about the medical and social particularities of living with HIV and about the latest medical breakthroughs and advances. Just as Jada describes living in an apartment building in which many of her neighbors can offer suggestions and information about drug regimens, dealing with stigma, and other issues related to medically and socially coping with HIV, those with extensive institutional ties can count on similar kinds of support. Given that many of the HHR respondents only see their doctors every six months, relying solely on medical professionals limits the avenues through which they can gather advice and information. This may lead to HIV-specific social isolation as women grapple with a serious and ongoing medical and social condition without a broad network of supporters and contacts.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>It is widely understood that social ties and social support can be important and positive contributors to mental health and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002716213475775">Cohen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002716213475775">Kawachi and Berkman 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002716213475775">Uchino 2004</xref>). These improvements occur through mechanisms such as social comparisons that offer individuals normative and behavioral guidance from those in their reference group, the feeling of “mattering” due to role-based purpose and meaning, and belonging and companionship that reduces isolation and encourages individuals to take care of their health for the sake of their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002716213475775">Thoits 2011</xref>). What is less clear is the role of institutions in these processes.</p>
<p>Higher levels of social support among women living with HIV/AIDS are associated with fewer reported negative changes as a result of being HIV-positive, lower depression, and greater optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002716213475775">Updegraff et al. 2002</xref>). This article examines qualitative data from a diverse group of HIV-positive women to assess how class status shapes HIV-related support seeking in general and the use of institutional services specifically. Low-income respondents’ ties to ASOs could be credited with contributing to their economic stability, enhancing their social status, and expanding their HIV-specific social networks. The support that they receive is therefore instrumental, informational, and emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002716213475775">House and Kahn 1985</xref>). As a result, low-income women who tap into HIV services report almost no HIV-related social isolation. They see themselves as part of a community of women who exchange encouragement, information, and other resources in the wake of receiving a devastating and stigmatizing condition.</p>
<p>This article therefore highlights how ASOs are critically important to low-income women living with HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002716213475775">5</xref></sup> Combining institutional resources with government assistance or wages, the women are able to make ends meet not despite but, in some cases, because of their HIV-positive status. This is not to suggest that women are deliberately contracting HIV, as they consistently describe the devastation of a diagnosis. Rather, they are often so impoverished at diagnosis that plugging into a high-functioning network of institution-based ties begins to address the severe deprivation that they were experiencing prior to diagnosis. It is also important to note that in the vast majority of cases, the resources that ASOs offer are not lifting women out of poverty. Rather, they are providing a modicum of economic stability that allows them to manage their health without the additional stress of meeting basic survival needs. These institutional ties may therefore help these women to avoid economic situations that will likely further endanger their health such as homelessness, risky sexual relationships that may nevertheless yield resources, and drug abuse. The extensive and diverse array of HIV services for low-income individuals, and the ways in which women are building social capital and other skills through these affiliations, is a success story alongside the widespread distribution of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the wake of HIV.</p>
<p>Conversely, HHR’s middle-class respondents recount fewer connections to ASOs, and when such ties do exist, the women report that these relationships have no impact on their financial stability and actually signal a diminished, rather than enhanced, social status. As a result, middle-class respondents could count few people who are also HIV-positive in their networks, increasing their HIV-specific social isolation. While middle-class women may exceed low-income women in their access to social capital in general, they tend to trail these women in terms of HIV-specific social capital.</p>
<p>These findings suggest several key insights about the micro dynamics of support seeking within organizations. First, the pursuit of services within institutions is tied to identity construction. When one is presenting herself as a person “in need,” she must grapple with what a particular institutional connection, and its embedded social relations, say about her. For a woman with HIV, this could be status-enhancing or status-diminishing, depending on the prestige associated with her prior social situation and how that status interacts with current organizational conditions and opportunities. Second, the safety net for disadvantaged populations entails social exchanges among service seekers as well as between service seekers and service providers. When class differences enter the equation, a group of service seekers may struggle to meet one another’s needs, as their resources, preferences, and approaches to problem solving likely differ. Third, the nuances and dimensions that shape how a disease collides with an already firmly planted social identity and experience, one’s class status, are important. The women’s practical and emotional concerns associated with living with HIV/AIDS are constantly interacting with their practical and emotional concerns associated with being impoverished or being middle class. Both HIV and class are status categories that determine what kinds of stigmas, slights, or opportunities one will experience on a day-to-day basis and in the long term. Middle-class women, feeling vulnerable due to their HIV status, likely became even more determined to protect and assert their privilege as members of the middle class to buffer the potentially harmful effects of having HIV. In short, while all respondents similarly describe the fear, stigma, and other challenges that result from their health status, the structural dissimilarities among the women on the basis of class lead to a divide that hamstrings their abilities to be supports to one another in institutional settings.</p>
<p>The current National HIV/AIDS Strategy calls for increased access to broad-based care to improve health outcomes for people living with HIV. An important piece of this is connecting people to networks and institutions that may provide continuous and coordinated social support alongside quality health care. This study suggests that such efforts may be narrowed due to variation in how women interpret and experience the economic and social implications of coming forward. We also see what may be a divergence in the institutional resources that appear to be available for different groups of HIV-positive women, with a lack of services that target the unique needs, preferences, and concerns of middle-class women living with HIV/AIDS. As a result of their invisibility, not only does this group forgo potentially valuable support that may help them to better address their health, but the larger HIV community forgoes the resources and contributions that these women could offer in the fight against HIV. To engage middle-class HIV-positive women, institutions must be creative about the kinds of services that they offer and perhaps tailor some of their initiatives. Given the decades of work that has already been done to support broad swaths of people impacted by HIV/AIDS, opportunities abound to bridge these emergent divides.</p>

<p>HIV infection rates among women are informed by gender dynamics that disadvantage women relative to men in negotiating safe sex practices. The fear of abandonment or physical abuse is thought to leave women particularly vulnerable. Trading sex for economic resources, physical protection, or drugs is also more likely to disadvantage women and place them in situations that directly or indirectly increase their risk of HIV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002716213475775">CDC 2010</xref>, 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002716213475775">Fullilove et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002716213475775">Adimora and Schoenbach 2005</xref>).</p></fn>
