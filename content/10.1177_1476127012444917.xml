<abstract>
<p>In this article the author proposes that firm status has a significant effect on the regulatory evaluation process. Regulators rely on external signals of quality such as status to resolve uncertainty, and the tendency to be infused with ‘value beyond the technical requirements of the task at hand’ (Selznick, 1957) causes status positions in institutionalized domains to be particularly salient. Using review times for 839 New Drug Applications approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1990 and 2004, the author finds that firms with higher status in the scientific knowledge domain receive faster approval for their drugs. The effect of status strengthened when products address underserved disease areas, and when following a major product withdrawal in the industry. Status in areas unrelated to the therapy category had a stronger effect on approval speed than therapy-specific status, implying that status effects are driven by values in addition to technical concerns.</p>

<p>Economists and sociologists have long recognized that institutional environments have a profound impact on firm behavior and market outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012444917">Scott, 2001</xref>). The ability of institutional actors to control market participation through rules and regulations has obvious implications for who wins and loses in market competition. But even when lacking formal authority to coerce firms, institutional actors hold considerable power over market actors through their ability to shape the legitimacy and evaluation criteria that underlie status hierarchies central to the functioning of markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012444917">Sauder, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While the influence of institutions over firm status is well documented, organizational scholars have shown less interest in whether status hierarchies that emerge through market competition conversely shape the judgments of institutional actors. Status, in addition to being an outcome firms strive for, is an important heuristic for actors under conditions of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012444917">Podolny, 1993</xref>). Given that institutional actors face significant uncertainty in their activities, one can naturally expect status to have a strong influence over institutional judgments as well. But do non-market institutions, ostensibly tasked with protecting broader public interest, rely on the same status signals as profit-oriented market actors? Furthermore, are the mechanisms through which status influences evaluation similar for both market and institutional settings? Neither the existing literature on status nor that on institutions offers guidance in answering these questions.</p>
<p>This article attempts to fill this gap by examining the conditions under which a regulator will be influenced by firm status. Similar to consumers faced with uncertainty surrounding a supplier’s quality, regulators assessing whether a product is beneficial to the public rely upon external signals or proxies of quality to resolve ambiguity, making the status of firms salient to the institutional actor. However, I argue that the tendency for regulators and other non-market organizations to become ‘infuse[d] with value beyond the technical requirements of the task at hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012444917">Selznick, 1957</xref>: 16–17) implies that the status signals most relevant for these actors depend on the history and social context in which the organization is embedded. Not only does this lead to specific domains of status becoming more important for regulatory outcomes, but it can also lead to status positions in domains unrelated to the underlying product carrying more influence than task- relevant signals of quality.</p>
<p>Using the regulation of pharmaceutical drugs as an empirical context, I test my proposition that regulators look toward firm status in institutionalized domains. More specifically, I analyze the approval times of 839 New Drug Applications (NDAs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1990 and 2004, and find that firms widely cited for their scientific inventions receive faster approval for their drugs, even after controlling for various markers of quality. Firm size, experience, or past history of producing safe and effective drugs – all proxies of quality – are less influential in speeding up approval than status in the scientific knowledge domain. Consistent with the notion that uncertainty and institutionalization drive status’s effect on regulators, status became more valuable when uncertainty was heightened, and when the FDA’s external image was threatened due to product withdrawals. Furthermore, it is not a firm’s status in relevant therapy categories (e.g., a firm’s status in the area of cancer for a cancer product), but rather, broader perceptions of quality in the broader knowledge domain that had a greater impact on review speed, highlighting the importance of values in understanding the effect that status has on the FDA.</p>
<p>The article contributes to the strategic management and organizational theory literature by demonstrating how non-market outcomes, an increasingly important factor in understanding firm performance, are shaped by social structures that endogenously emerge in markets. This answers a call put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012444917">Henisz and Zelner (2003)</xref> to consider the social context of policy-making and incorporate insights from organizational theory into understanding non-market outcomes. In addition, the study extends the vibrant literature on status as a market advantage by demonstrating that status can also bias neutral third-party evaluators. Finally, the article highlights that status is not just an economic signal of quality, but also a social indicator of a firm’s (irreversible) commitment to particular values. Having the ‘right’ status is especially important when evaluators become embodiments of causes, as is often the case with institutional actors.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I provide an argument for why regulators rely upon signals of quality such as status, and how institutionalization leads status positions in certain domains to become more salient than others. I then put forth an account of the FDA drug review process, and generate testable hypotheses related to my theory. After describing the data I collected, I present results from the empirical analysis, and conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this work.</p>

<title>Theoretical development</title>
<sec id="section2-1476127012444917">
<title>Regulation, uncertainty, and status signals</title>
<p>Regulation is the use of the state’s coercive power for the purpose of restricting the decisions of economic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444917">Viscusi et al., 2000</xref>). Government intervention in markets usually suggests that market failure exists due to externalities. In the case of product safety regulation for pharmaceuticals, automobiles, or children’s products, a major impediment to the efficient functioning of markets is the asymmetry between producers and consumers in their ability to observe or assess the quality of products. Regulators act as arbiters of quality, limiting the market entry of producers or products that do not offer social benefits in excess of the associated risks or costs.</p>
<p>While bureaucrats may be better equipped to evaluate the quality of products than individual consumers, this does not imply that the evaluation process is without uncertainty. In fact, given that governments intervene only in markets where quality is opaque, the salience of uncertainty as an organizational problem should be greater for regulators than most other organizations. While rigorous testing and monitoring of product safety may yield helpful information for regulators, as is often the case in automobiles and pharmaceuticals, dangerous malfunctions or side-effects will only reveal themselves after long-term use, well after decisions regarding quality are made.</p>
<p>To cope with this inherent uncertainty, regulators – like any other economic agent facing uncertainty – have been shown to rely upon external signals of quality related to the producer such as size or experience in determining which products are worthy of government endorsement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012444917">Olson, 1997</xref>). As observable indicators whose costs of acquisition are inversely related to quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012444917">Spence, 1974</xref>), both the resources available to a firm indicated by its size, and its past history of performance (i.e., reputation) are reasonable proxies when quality is unobservable.</p>
<p>The sociology of networks suggest that in addition to these firm attributes, evaluators are also likely to take into account the ties and relationships that link producers together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012444917">Granovetter, 1985</xref>). In particular, status – the deference paid to an actor by other actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012444917">Gould, 2002</xref>) – provides a valuable proxy of quality when uncertainty around quality is high. When a firm is endorsed by other prominent actors in the market, an evaluator can assume that its offerings have been vetted by other competent actors in the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012444917">Stuart et al., 1999</xref>), and that the firm adheres to important institutions of conduct in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012444917">Baum and Oliver, 1991</xref>). For a regulator struggling to discern quality, the status of the producer is likely to provide a useful heuristic in determining products worthy of entry into markets.</p>

<sec id="section3-1476127012444917">
<title>Institutionalization and status in regulatory decision-making</title>
<p>While the challenges of regulatory evaluation make the status positions of firms a salient firm characteristic, prior theory does not offer much guidance into <italic>which</italic> status signals are the most relevant for institutional actors. Firms occupy multiple positions in different networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012444917">Baker and Faulkner, 2002</xref>), and while high-status actors in one domain are likely to be well regarded in others, the correlation is not always perfect. If one accepts the notion that regulators seek to maximize social welfare, the level of respect a producer receives for making high-quality products should have the greatest impact on institutional evaluation. Yet, a long literature in the political economy tradition has argued that this assumption is naive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012444917">Stigler, 1971</xref>). Even if political actors are not as vigorous in their pursuit of narrow self-interest (e.g., votes, campaign contributions) as scholars have argued, there is wide recognition among political scientists and sociologists that bureaucrats nonetheless pursue autonomous agendas or ideologies that cannot be reduced to the interests of external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012444917">Kalt and Zupan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012444917">Skocpol, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on the institutionalization of public and semi-public organizations echo this point, and furthermore, provide insight into the <italic>process</italic> through which these agendas emerge. Most prominently, Selznick’s account of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) as an organization ‘molded by forces tangential to their rationally ordered structures and stated goals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012444917">Selznick, 1949</xref>: 251) sparked numerous follow-up case studies documenting the transformation of official goals of organizations into more value-laden objectives that emerge through interactions with internal and external audiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476127012444917">Zald and Denton (1963)</xref> show how the originally evangelical and religious YMCA organization adopted values of recreation and education in response to changes in its middle-class clientele. The US Post Office’s transformation from a machine of efficiency in the early 1800s, to enforcer of Victorian moral reform during the Progressive era provides another example of how bureaucratic leadership and the networks it builds can lead to autonomous agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012444917">Carpenter, 2001</xref>). While firms operating on a for-profit basis are no doubt vulnerable to institutionalization, public or governmental bureaucracies with less precisely defined and diffuse goals are much more vulnerable to this institutionalization process.</p>
<p>The upshot of institutional actors’ tendency to become institutionalized is that when examining the effect of firm status positions on organizations such as regulators, it is critical to take into consideration the institutional history and social context of the regulator, as they shape and guide the actions of the organization. In the following section, I focus on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an example of an organization that evolved to embody values (i.e., science) to deal with the external environment. This leads the agency to look toward status positions of firms within the domain of science in resolving uncertainty about the quality of drugs they evaluate, with important implications for the technical task of identifying the safest and most effective products.</p>

<title>Context and hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section5-1476127012444917">
<title>FDA drug approval and institutionalization</title>
<p>In the United States, the FDA interacts with firms in all stages of drug development and marketing, from as early as the design of clinical trials to post-marketing safety monitoring of approved drugs. Most critically, the FDA is responsible for reviewing the product safety claims made by drug companies prior to granting access to consumers. Given the high stakes involved in new drug development, the agency’s approval process often has a significant impact on the short- and long-term viability of the firms that seek regulatory approval. Yet, for the FDA, the ability to influence the fate of firms does not necessarily imply greater authority. Despite the seemingly strong position of the agency vis-a-vis firms, the agency has historically lacked formal and legal mechanisms to coerce firms into acting in a desired manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012444917">Hilts, 2003</xref>). For example, the FDA has no legal authority to require additional safety studies, nor does it possess the power to order product recalls of harmful products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012444917">Hawthorne, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of formal power makes the FDA heavily dependent on legitimacy granted by external audiences. For the FDA, the most prominent audience is the public that consumes the drugs endorsed by the agency. Patients and their families demand safe and effective drugs, conveying their assessment of the agency’s performance through direct petitions or organized interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476127012444917">Vogel, 1989</xref>). The media as an agenda setter can also exert pressure on the FDA by making certain disease categories more salient to both the public and the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012444917">Carpenter, 2002</xref>), and highlighting corruption or mistakes in the FDA’s actions. In addition, as a state apparatus, the FDA’s staffing and operational budgets are controlled by Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012444917">Quirk, 1980</xref>), and thus, vulnerable to the ideological agendas of political entities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012444917">1</xref></sup> Finally, pharmaceutical firms submitting drugs for approval are also an important audience given their clout with politicians, and their direct role in funding the agency’s operations via ‘user fees’ collected to cover the costs of review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012444917">Berndt et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These multiple audiences and conflicting demands leave the FDA in a precarious position: being too stringent in approving drugs exposes the agency to criticisms from firms and patient groups; on the other hand, lowering standards can lead to charges from consumer groups and the media that the agency fails to protect the public. To navigate the conflicting demands imposed by these diverse audiences, the FDA turns to science as a value central to the agency’s mission. Science, according to the agency, ‘provides the knowledge needed to develop and apply the regulations in the right way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476127012444917">FDA, 2000</xref>), forming the ‘cornerstone’ of regulatory decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012444917">FDA, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Science, however, was not a central value for the FDA from the beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012444917">Hilts, 2003</xref>), and instead was slowly infused throughout the history of the agency. The demands for rigorous evidence of safety reflected in the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act were the building blocks for a more ambitious infusion of scientific values, which culminated in the 1962 Kefauver–Harris amendments, first requiring firms to submit evidence to prove that a drug was actually effective. Coinciding with these developments, the leadership position of the agency underwent a similar transformation, as what was traditionally a career bureaucrat’s job shifted to a post filled by an outside scientist, leading to major initiatives that shifted the agency’s focus toward building its scientific capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012444917">FDA, 1998</xref>). Symbolizing the various changes was the FDA’s 1966 alliance with the National Academy of Sciences, the most distinguished body of scientific and medical scholars in America, to assist in the scientific review of all existing drugs on the market. In the ensuing years, the FDA mandated the use of double-blinded studies, and adverse event reporting by firms, both essential pieces to guaranteeing the scientific integrity of clinical trial data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012444917">Hawthorne, 2005</xref>). More recently, the FDA has expanded its scientific activities beyond accumulating the knowledge expertise to evaluate product safety and efficacy, and has started to pursue collaborations with research universities and industry scientists to address key issues in pharmaceutical product quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012444917">FDA, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Adopting scientific values and methods no doubt allowed the agency to be more effective in its main task of evaluating the quality of drugs. With firms embracing scientific methods of drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012444917">Henderson and Cockburn, 1996</xref>), reviewing the quality of drugs has increasingly become a scientific endeavor. But beyond assisting in the technical aspects of the regulator’s core activities, adopting and endorsing science provides the organization with ‘cultural authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012444917">Starr, 1982</xref>) that compensates for deficiencies in formal authority. The norms of science around disinterestedness and skepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012444917">Merton, 1942</xref>) serve as a moral basis of action allowing the agency to pursue an independent agenda buffered from political or ideological shifts. The commitment to scientific values, however, has not been without controversy. Both industry practitioners and academic observers have criticized the agency for overemphasizing hypothesis-testing approaches to confirmation, ultimately depriving consumers of live-saving or more cost-efficient treatments that lacked the resources for the scientifically rigorous investigations required by the FDA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012444917">Mandel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Leaving aside the issue of whether science has become <italic>too</italic> institutionalized as a value at the FDA, the upshot of the agency’s commitment to science is that scientific identities of firms are particularly salient to the bureaucrats who make decisions about product quality. In the next section, I discuss how firm scientific status shapes a key regulatory decision variable, the time it takes for the FDA to review a drug.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476127012444917">
<title>Scientific knowledge status and approval speed of drugs</title>
<p>For most pharmaceutical firms, the approval or non-approval of a candidate drug is a crucial outcome for the prosperity and survival of the organization. With significant costs and investments into the development of a single product, failure to reach market can be a crippling event for firms. But in addition to the binary approve/reject result, an outcome of great interest to firms is the duration of regulatory review, or the speed at which products are approved. With a finite window of intellectual property protection, and sizable first-mover advantages in terms of building relationships with key doctors, hospitals, and wholesalers for early entrants, firms receiving accelerated review gain a significant competitive advantage in the market over others.</p>
<p>The main hypothesis of this article is that firms with higher status in the scientific domains will benefit from shorter durations of approval. First, a firm’s status as a scientific producer alleviates the FDA’s concern over the technological and scientific quality of a given product. While good science does not necessarily guarantee safe and effective commercialization of products, as long as the correlation is positive, a firm’s status as a scientific producer can still offer valuable information about the underlying product. Second, given the budgetary and staff constraints the FDA operates under, institutional attention becomes a scarce and valuable resource in the approval process. Network theory suggests that central or prominent actors receive greater attention through visibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476127012444917">Wasserman and Faust, 1994</xref>), and FDA reviewers, as trained scientists themselves, are likely to allocate attention to prominent firms in the scientific domains relative to others.</p>
<p>In addition to this information and attention advantage of status, relying on status signals can also help resolve political uncertainty and buffer the agency from threats to survival. With the FDA biased toward ‘doing no harm’ and avoiding Type I errors (approving drugs that turn out to be harmful) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012444917">Bazerman et al., 2001</xref>), the risk averse response for the FDA is to approve products that potential critics believe are of high quality. As the oft-mentioned saying ‘No one got fired for buying IBM’ implies, the choice of a well-known and prestigious partner can offer political protection when, and if, a product fails or creates controversy. Approving a no-name producer’s drug without full scrutiny carries a significantly higher cost to legitimacy than approving the product of a company whom everyone views as a prominent producer of science, and thus, all else equal, high- status firms should receive faster approval. Taken together, I hypothesize:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 1:</bold> The greater the status of a firm in the scientific knowledge domain, the faster the rate at which the FDA reviews the products of the firm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1476127012444917">
<title>Conditions that enhance status effects: Technical and political uncertainty</title>
<p>If, as argued above, the FDA looks toward a firm’s status position in the scientific knowledge network due to a combination of quality uncertainty and institutionalization, then it follows that conditions that increase uncertainty or threaten legitimacy, which heighten commitment to institutionalized values, should lead to an even greater advantage for high-status firms. On the other hand, if the non-market advantages high-status firms enjoy are merely a result of firms with respected science producing better products, then one should expect high-status advantages to be consistent regardless of the context.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the drug review process is more uncertain when there are technical challenges to evaluating a drug (e.g., difficult to understand the mechanism of a drug), and politically threatening when key stakeholders are less likely to accept the judgments of the regulator to be legitimate. Building on this observation, I look at four conditions that suggest technical and/or political uncertainty: radical innovations, the use of advisory committees, untreated disease categories, and product withdrawals.</p>
<sec id="section8-1476127012444917">
<title>Radical innovation</title>
<p>When a candidate drug is based on a highly novel compound never examined before, quality uncertainty is higher than when it is based on an existing compound. In general, breakthrough products developed from new components create high levels of uncertainty for both inventors and evaluators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012444917">Fleming, 2001</xref>). Returns from exploration are less certain and, on average, less successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012444917">March, 1991</xref>). The uncertain nature of novel products has a number of implications for regulatory review: first, the regulator must develop new evaluation routines and schemas, which place additional cognitive burdens on the agency; second, the higher variance and lower mean success rates of radical innovations should compel the regulator to scrutinize products more intensely to prevent safety issues. Taken together, this implies that novel products that generate uncertainty should take longer to complete review.</p>
<p>While developing a novel compound should be a regulatory liability on average, I propose that the extent of this effect will differ depending on the status position of a firm. Prior studies have demonstrated that increased uncertainty enhances the value of status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012444917">Podolny, 1994</xref>). Firms with greater scientific knowledge status should alleviate concerns over the technical quality of novel products, and lessen the slowdowns in review. Furthermore, the routines and processes developed through the institutionalization process should further direct attention toward status signals. In a set of ‘best practices’ for New Drug Application review published by the FDA,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012444917">2</xref></sup> the agency advises ‘if the drug is an NME [new molecular entity] look at the relevant published [academic] literature,’ while ‘if the drug is established, limit search to the relevant stage and type of cancer.’ This leads to the hypothesis that scientific knowledge status will be more valuable when a product is a radical innovation:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 2:</bold> The effect that scientific knowledge status has on the rate at which the FDA reviews the products of the firm will be greater when the underlying innovation is radical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1476127012444917">
<title>Advisory committees</title>
<p>The example of FDA Best Practices pushing reviewers to pay attention to broad scientific debates within the academic community shows how uncertainty can make scientific values and status positions more salient. In addition to the distinction between radical and incremental innovation, the FDA’s use of scientific advisory committees also offers a window into the extent to which the agency experiences uncertainty regarding the technical attributes of a candidate drug.</p>
<p>Advisory committees provide the FDA with independent advice from outside experts on a range of complex scientific, technical, and policy issues. According to the FDA, an advisory committee ‘lends credibility to the product review process and provides a forum for public discussion of certain controversial issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012444917">FDA, 2010</xref>). Committee membership includes academic physician- scientists, statisticians, industry officials, and representatives for patients and consumers, and these members discuss the benefits and risks of products, often with representatives of the submitting firm present to answer questions.</p>
<p>Advisory meetings can occur during any stage of a product’s review process, but most importantly, not all products are subject to advisory committee debate. The decision to involve an advisory committee is usually at the discretion of the Division Director of one of FDA’s five product centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012444917">FDA, 2010</xref>), and prior research suggests that the agency is most likely to turn to advisory committees when the risk of implementation failure is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012444917">Moffitt, 2010</xref>). More innovative drugs, treatments for lethal diseases, and complex drugs are more likely to have external experts and the public weigh in on the merits of a drug.</p>
<p>Similar to status, these advisory committees aid the FDA by both providing additional information, and offering political protection in the event that a drug is harmful to consumers post-approval. Regardless of the benefits, the choice to consult advisory committees is an indicator of the technical and political uncertainty perceived by the FDA, and as such, one should expect scientific knowledge status to be even more valuable under these circumstances. In addition, the scientific debate that emerges during these committee meetings should further highlight the salience of scientific positions, and lead to further advantages for high-status firms:</p>

<title>Untreated disease categories</title>
<p>Products targeted toward new disease niches offer distinct challenges for the FDA for both technical and political reasons. On the technical side, new disease categories make it hard to identify the correct review division, and the review process is inevitably inefficient due to the lack of protocol. Thus, the lack of familiarity with disease-specific mechanisms can lead to delays in review.</p>
<p>While the technological challenges are considerable, products for disease niches that are underserved by existing treatments also pose significant political risks to bureaucratic reputation. Advocacy groups organized around diseases are politically powerful stakeholders, and are particularly vocal when they perceive a lack of viable options for treatment, as was the case with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476127012444917">Vogel, 1989</xref>). The ‘untreatable’ label for a disease also attracts significant attention from the media and elected politicians, further heightening the damage of any potential delay in approving a new treatment for a disease category. This suggests that new entrants into a disease niche will receive faster approval, as opposed to delayed approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012444917">Carpenter, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While arguments exist for both accelerated and delayed approval for new treatments, regardless of the net effect, the influence that a producer’s status position has on the FDA’s review speed should be larger when a product is addressing a new disease category than when products are addressing a crowded disease niche. Status alleviates the uncertainty associated with the new disease niche similar to what was hypothesized with radical innovations. In addition, because other key stakeholders such as disease groups and the media are also cognizant of the relative rankings of firms in the innovative domains (if somewhat vaguely), the agency will be under greater pressure to accelerate drug approval for prominent actors when a product addresses a new disease. Delaying the approval of a drug from a firm that is widely admired as a scientific leader is more costly to the FDA than delaying approval for a firm that is not known for its cutting-edge science. As a result, I hypothesize a positive interaction between the lack of treatment options and firm scientific knowledge status:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 4:</bold> The effect that scientific knowledge status has on the rate at which the FDA reviews the products of the firm will be greater the newer a product is to a particular disease niche.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1476127012444917">
<title>Product withdrawals</title>
<p>While new market niches raise the level of both technical and political uncertainties, product withdrawals are unambiguous political threats to the agency. The recall or withdrawal of a product provides an external shock that influences both the firm that produced the defective product, and the evaluators that failed to foresee the potential problem. In the specific case of pharmaceutical regulation, the 2004 withdrawal of the pharmaceutical drug Vioxx showed how the financial consequences of a defective product can be devastating to the producing firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012444917">Oberholzer-Gee and Inamdar, 2004</xref>), but also carried significant political risks for the agency responsible for approving the drug.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1476127012444917">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adverse events also have ramifications that extend beyond the specific defective product or producer. As producers in the same organizational field, practices that led to product defects for one producer are likely to have been shared by many firms within the industry, creating a broad distrust of all producer submissions. Key stakeholders are also more apt to investigate or revisit the existing processes at the agency, which leads the FDA to alter its regulatory behavior in a number of different ways. For one, the agency is likely to slow down review for all drugs from all producers regardless of their relationship to the tainted product. This allows the agency to manage legitimacy in ways that admit that certain aspects of its operations were flawed and ‘act decisively and visibly to remedy those specific faults’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444917">Suchman, 1995</xref>). This restructuring of behavior has both a functional aspect, in that it amends flaws and prevents future disasters, and a symbolic value, in that it signals contrition and may ‘persuade some constituents that they can safely resume pragmatic exchanges with the troubled organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444917">Suchman, 1995</xref>: 598).</p>
<p>In addition to slowing down review, the threat to bureaucratic reputation following the occurrence of a product withdrawal is likely to prompt the regulator to advantage higher-status producers to an even greater degree. In times of crises, favoring of prominent actors reduces the risk of a subsequent scandal, and can serve as an effective tool for organizational perception management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012444917">Elsbach, 2003</xref>). Firm reputation has been shown to provide a buffer against threats to legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012444917">King, 2008</xref>), which should further enhance the positive effect of status on regulatory review. Throughout its history, the FDA has responded to major scandals such as the Thalidomide birth defect crisis by emphasizing the need for rigorous scientific procedures and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012444917">Hilts, 2003</xref>), rendering science a salient value in the aftermath of withdrawals. Therefore, I argue that producers with high status will suffer a smaller penalty when there is a recent drug recall, mitigating the industry-wide penalty levied upon all firms as a result of that negative event:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 5:</bold> The effect that scientific knowledge status has on the rate at which the FDA reviews the products of the firm will be greater when there has been a recent product withdrawal.</p>

<title>Task-relevant and value-driven status effects</title>
<p>The main argument of this article is that regulators look toward status signals originating from the scientific knowledge domain, driven by the need to resolve uncertainty, but also because of their institutionalized values as a scientific organization. Science, no doubt, provides technical advantages to the organization in performing regulatory tasks, but the orientation toward status signals in the knowledge domain can also be attributed to the agency’s desire to balance conflicting demands from audiences and maintain legitimacy. This suggests that status positions will shape the evaluations of institutional actors beyond any technical information or proxy of quality commonly observed in market settings. Put differently, not only will status signals specific to the task at hand have an effect on the decisions of regulators, but status signals that are representative of the respect the firm receives in the broader domain should also have an effect on regulator’s behavior.</p>

<p>To address the relevance of a firm’s status to a particular task (i.e., drug product), I propose a distinction between a firm’s status in the specific therapy domain of a product, and the status of a firm in unrelated therapy or basic knowledge domains. Therapy-specific status reflects a firm’s status in knowledge domains (cancer, cardiovascular, etc.) that match the product under review. While therapy-specific status provides the most direct and relevant proxy for the product’s underlying quality, if firm advantages derive from the firm’s overall position in the knowledge network, then status in unrelated domains should have a positive influence over institutional review times <italic>up and beyond</italic> the effects of therapy-specific status. Take, for example, a firm submitting a cardiovascular product for regulatory approval. It would not be surprising if the firm’s standing as a cardiovascular knowledge producer influenced regulatory review, as the firm’s status in the cardiovascular field should be positively correlated with the drug’s quality. However, if recognition of the firm’s contribution to the field of cancer – controlling for status in cardiovascular – has a tangible effect on regulatory treatment of the new cardiovascular product, this suggests that the regulator takes into account more than the firm’s competencies in narrow product categories. Given the article’s argument that the FDA focuses on firm identities as a producer of scientific knowledge, I expect that a firm’s status in unrelated and basic knowledge domains will also have a significant effect on regulatory review times:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 6:</bold> The greater the status of a firm in non-therapy domains of the product, the faster the rate at which the FDA reviews the products of the firm.</p>

<title>Sample and data: New Drug Application reviews</title>
<p>My sample frame includes all non-generic New Drug Applications (NDAs) approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2004. For a new molecular entity (NME) to reach consumers, it must clear numerous scientific and regulatory hurdles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012444917">Ng, 2004</xref>). In the drug discovery stage, firms search for compounds that demonstrate some desirable effect in either an animal or chemical screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012444917">Henderson and Cockburn, 1996</xref>). Scientific articles and patents usually appear at this stage. For promising compounds, firms proceed to test whether the compound is safe and effective for humans by conducting three separate stages of clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III). If the drug conclusively demonstrates safety and efficacy through these trials, an NDA is filed with the FDA to seek approval for marketing the drug. As I am interested in the regulatory agency’s evaluation of products, I focus exclusively on this final stage of drug development, as it isolates institutional evaluation from a firm’s ability to successfully run large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>The data I collected include 372 NMEs and 467 non-NMEs, or incrementally modified drugs (IMDs) (new combinations, new formulations, etc.) submitted to the FDA as New Drug Applications (NDAs). A total of 14 drugs were still under review at the end of the sample window, and are treated as right-censored. I exclude generic drugs as they are subject to different application rules (i.e., Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA]) and approval criteria (i.e., demonstration of bioequivalence as opposed to safety/efficacy). These 839 applications were submitted by roughly 300 pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.</p>
<p>I collected the submission date and approval dates for NDAs from a variety of public and private sources. The majority of review times were obtained from New Drug Approval letters issued to sponsor pharmaceutical firms posted to the FDA electronic reading room. The full range of approval letters are only available from 1998 to present, so I obtained the remaining NDAs from Ed Hass at the FDA, and Daniel Carpenter at Harvard University. Other NDA relevant data such as the review priority of an NDA, and the chemical entity type were collected from the <italic>Orange Book</italic>, an annual government publication listing all approved prescription drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs currently on the market.</p>
<p>Data for independent and control variables were obtained from a variety of sources. Detailed project-level and firm-level data come from Pharmaprojects, a database providing event-history data (time to failure/launch), related patents numbers, detailed therapeutic categorization, and the licensing status of drug development projects from 1980 to 2004. Patent data were collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the NBER patent database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012444917">Hall et al., 2001</xref>), and the National University of Singapore’s patent database (patents.nus.edu.sg).

<title>Firm scientific status (H1, H6)</title>
<p>Following prior work that looked at the status of firms in a high-technology industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444917">Podolny and Stuart, 1995</xref>), I utilize patents and patent citation patterns as a tool to operationalize the perceived quality of the firm’s scientific knowledge. Patents are useful in identifying inventions of firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012444917">Schmookler, 1966</xref>) and the citations of patents provide insight on the technological building blocks of an invention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444917">Podolny and Stuart, 1995</xref>). Admittedly, patents encompass not only scientific knowledge based inventions, but also local search derived technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012444917">Fleming and Sorenson, 2004</xref>) that cause them to be somewhat of a noisy signal of a firm’s scientific standing. Yet, for a number of reasons, I believe patents are preferable to alternative measures of scientific knowledge such as academic publications. First, although firm propensities to patent differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012444917">Levin et al., 1987</xref>), the heterogeneity in policies is much more pronounced for publication of scientific articles by research staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012444917">Stern, 2004</xref>). Second, in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology domains where the distinction between science and technology are rapidly disappearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012444917">Narin and Noma, 1985</xref>), patents usually come <italic>before</italic> publications due to concerns over spillover effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012444917">Meyer, 2000</xref>), making patents a more up-to-date reflection of the firm’s knowledge base. Finally, it is more difficult to ensure a uniform standard of evaluation for scientific publications due to the variance in quality of outlets, while patents only have a single entity – the United States Patent and Trade Office – judging all patent applications.</p>
<p>To obtain the status of firms in the patent network, I view patent citation relationships as the manifestation of deference between two actors in the knowledge space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444917">Podolny and Stuart, 1995</xref>). When a firm applies for a patent, it is required to list prior inventions that deal with similar issues to demonstrate how the current application differs. Because patent citations reflect technological building relationships, a direct tie (citation) from one organization to another signals an implicit acknowledgment of the importance of the citation-receiving organization, and suggests a certain deference by one organization (or the patent examiner) to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444917">Podolny and Stuart, 1995</xref>). Thus, firms that receive more citations on their technological work enjoy a higher status than others. Formally, the definition of status is:</p>

I proceeded to label all patents that had ‘514/xxx’ as a technology class with the matching therapy code and calculated a status measure within that code. I then calculate a ‘non-therapy category specific status’ measure that captures the proportion of citations a firm receives outside the therapy category of the product. This unrelated status not only accounts for patents from other therapy categories, but also includes more basic molecular biology or organic chemistry technologies that are not tied to one therapy category.</p>

<title>Quality of a drug</title>
<p>The hypotheses developed above explore the effects of status positions independent of the actual quality of the product that is being evaluated. Due to the intertwined relationship of status and quality, it is often times difficult to tell apart the effects of actual quality and status signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012444917">Podolny, 1993</xref>). In the case of drugs, the dimensions of quality are multiplex (efficacy, safety, cost, etc.) and ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012444917">Avorn, 2004</xref>). Therefore, disentangling quality and status is an exceptionally challenging task in this context. I attempt to control for the quality of a drug submitted in two ways. First, I include the <italic>priority rating</italic> (priority vs. standard) conferred upon the drug by the FDA as a way to distinguish between significant improvements over existing treatments and those that are moderate improvements. Second, I include the <italic>number of citations accumulated by the underlying patent</italic> for the drug product (as listed in the <italic>Orange Book</italic>) as a control for the quality of the product. As noted above, higher-quality solutions are more likely to be built upon in future inventions, and the number of citations to the drug’s patent is a reasonable proxy for quality. Prior studies on firm status in high-technology domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444917">Podolny and Stuart, 1995</xref>) have used the citation counts of a particular invention to control for product quality, and I follow their example. Because the citations to a given patent are a function of the status of the firm, including this as a control variable should make a more stringent test for finding status effects.</p>

<p>In addition to controls for the quality of the drug, I include measures to control for firm-level factors that have previously been recognized to influence a firm’s performance in regulatory and non-market settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012444917">Bonardi et al. (2006)</xref> note that a firm’s <italic>experience with the regulator</italic> can provide an advantage given the learning effects and opportunities for interpersonal relationship building that result from frequent contact. To construct this variable, I count the number of firm’s approved NDAs (since 1982) prior to submission of the focal product. Second, a firm’s involvement in political campaigns has been considered as a proxy for the political pressure firms can apply, and thus I use data collected from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to measure the extent to which firms contribute to political candidates as a way to control for a firm’s political influence. Admittedly, the literature on Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions is mixed, with most finding little evidence for its effect on outcomes of importance (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012444917">de Figueiredo and Edwards, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, I count the number of political contributions made by the firm in the election cycle when the drug was submitted to the FDA, and use the normalized number as a measure of <italic>political clout</italic>. Finally, given the amount of attention the ‘revolving door’ phenomenon attracts in the popular press, I include a count of the number of individuals with government experience (as coded by BoardEx, a database of board of director profiles) a firm has on its board as a g<italic>overnment ties</italic> control.</p>

<sec id="section26-1476127012444917">
<title>Other firm-level controls</title>
<p>To control for the differential resources available to firms, I include the <italic>size of the sponsoring firm</italic> as measured by the log of the firm’s employee count in the submitting year. The size of the firm has also been identified as a signal of quality in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012444917">Olson, 1997</xref>). I also include a count of the number of <italic>prior product withdrawals</italic> the firm caused, as this can be thought of as a measure of firm reputation, i.e., past performance regarding safety of products. A dummy variable indicating the firm’s <italic>public</italic> or private status, and a dummy variable coding whether the firm is headquartered in the United States or <italic>internationally</italic> was included. Since firms with more patents are naturally at a higher risk for receiving citations, I include the logged number of patents issued to the firm as a control for <italic>knowledge stock</italic>. To control for the strategic priority firms assign to the drug, I include the <italic>duration of a drug’s development</italic> under the assumption that firms accelerate the development of more important drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012444917">Dranove and Meltzer, 1994</xref>). I also include the number of NDA applications that are already under review at the FDA (<italic>current applications under review</italic>) following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012444917">Olson (1997)</xref>. Finally, to control for the correlation across projects within firms, I estimate robust standard errors by clustering the drugs by sponsoring firm.</p>

<sec id="section27-1476127012444917">
<title>Disease category</title>
<p>It is well established that drugs treating certain diseases are easier to develop and cause fewer safety problems in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012444917">Danzon et al., 2003</xref>). This heterogeneity across disease categories also carries over to FDA review times as certain treatments are not only easier/harder to evaluate due to the relative complexity of the treatment and target mechanisms, but also due to political factors such as the media or disease support groups (e.g., AIDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012444917">Carpenter, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012444917">2010</xref>). To control for this correlation within disease categories, I include a dummy variable for each of the 216 disease categories in the regression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1476127012444917">
<title>Other controls</title>
<p>I include <italic>year dummies</italic> to control for general shifts in FDA review times that result from legal, political, and staffing changes over time. I also include a variable indicating whether the candidate drug was originally developed by the sponsoring firm or <italic>licensed</italic> later on in the development stage, as the decision to license-out a compound has been viewed as a signal of the quality of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012444917">Pisano, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Data description</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012444917">Table 1</xref> reports the means and correlations for the major variables. The mean duration for review time is 629 days. Twenty-three percent of the candidate drugs received a priority rating, while 42% were new molecular entities (NMEs). NMEs spent an average of 625 days under review, while non-NMEs averaged 631 days. The FDA received an average of 50 submissions per year during the sample period, with the number peaking at 71 in 1999. Firms submitted an average of 4.04 drugs during the sample period, with a median number of 2 submissions per firm. The highest status firm, at 3.14 for the normalized status measure, was Johnson &amp; Johnson, followed by Eli Lilly (2.78), and Merck (2.21). Firms such as Reliant Pharmaceuticals and Auxilium A2, who had no patents issued to the firm prior to NDA submission, were ranked as the lowest status firms (–0.87). Consistent with prior studies and theory, firm status shows stability over the years, with a peak and trough difference of 0.11 for the average firm during the sample period.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012444917">Figure 1</xref> shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of exiting FDA review (i.e., drug approval). Results from the piecewise constant models of the hazard of completing FDA review are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012444917">Table 2</xref>. I include five time pieces (&lt; 6 months, 6 months to 1 year, 1–2 years, 2–5 years, and &gt; 5 years) in the model to account for differences in the baseline hazards depending on duration of review.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1476127012444917">8</xref></sup> The significant drop in coefficients from 6 months on suggests that the underlying hazard declines over time, especially after the first 6 months of review.</p>

<title>Baseline model</title>
<p>The first model shows the baseline estimates with the control variables. Drugs that receive priority ratings from the FDA received significantly faster approval (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). A priority drug experiences close to a 300% increase<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1476127012444917">9</xref></sup> above the baseline hazard rate. The number of existing treatments (i.e., order of entry) had a significant effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) on drug approval, with drugs that were treatments for underserved diseases receiving faster approval. The effect of NMEs, which I argued lead to greater technology uncertainty, had a coefficient in the expected direction, but was not significant at the .05 level. Consultation with advisory committees, another indicator of the scientific and political uncertainty, had a negative effect on the approval speed of drugs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), reducing the hazard of approval by 28%. The experience of the firm submitting NDAs to the FDA, firm size, firm political contributions to political campaigns, and the number of board members with government ties did not have a statistically significant effect on approval speed. Product withdrawals in the previous year led to a slowdown of review<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1476127012444917">10</xref></sup> for all drugs submitted to the FDA (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but the accumulated number of withdrawals (i.e., reputation for safety) for a given firm did not slow down review. Noteworthy is the positive and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) effect of the number of citations to the underlying patent. This suggests that drugs based on technologies that receive many citations from others are approved faster than those that are developed from less useful science.</p>

<sec id="section33-1476127012444917">
<title>Status effects (H1)</title>
<p>Tests for the main effect of status are presented in Model 2. Supporting Hypothesis 1, the status of the firm has a strong and positive effect on the review times of its drugs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). According to the piecewise-hazard estimates, a one standard deviation increase in status leads to a 21% increase<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1476127012444917">11</xref></sup> in the hazard of completing review. To translate hazard rates into review duration (i.e., days), I calculated the marginal effects of each variable with all other control variables at mean levels. A firm in the top 15% of status will spend 212 fewer days in FDA review than the median status firm. These effects show strong support for the claim that status influences regulatory decision-making. Also noteworthy is the change in the effect of firm size. With the inclusion of firm status in the model, the effect of firm size is reduced by more than half. The effect of all other major variables remained robust to the inclusion of status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-1476127012444917">
<title>Status and uncertainty (H2, H3, H4, H5)</title>
<p>Models 3, 4, 5, and 6 include the interaction effects of various measures of uncertainty. Throughout all the models, status remains strongly positive and significant in its effect on approval speed, with a 20% increase in the hazard ratio for each standard deviation increase in status. Contrary to Hypothesis 2, the uncertainty stemming from radical innovation does not moderate the effect of status. Similarly, while the coefficient for the interaction between advisory committees and status is positive and large, the effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero. On the other hand, status becomes less valuable as the order of entry increases (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), providing support for the hypothesis on the effect of uncertainty due to untreated disease niches (H4). The interaction effect between the product withdrawal variable and status is positive and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), confirming the hypothesis that status becomes more salient when the FDA is subject to scandal (H5). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012444917">Figure 2</xref> depicts the relationship between status, recall, and review speed. It is interesting to note that for the most prominent actors (i.e., top 8% in status), product withdrawal events are actually more beneficial in expediting review than non-crisis times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1476127012444917">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Therapy vs. non-therapy status (H6)</title>
<p>Model 7 shows estimates for the two components of a firm’s status position: status that is related to a particular product’s therapy category, and status in the broader domain of knowledge. The regression results show that a firm’s status in the product’s therapy category does not have a strong effect on the speed of approval. On the other hand, unrelated status is significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with a slightly smaller effect than the combined status position of a firm. A standard deviation increase in status leads to a 19.2% decrease in the hazard of approval. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1476127012444917">Figure 3</xref> plots the coefficients with confidence intervals for both models. Wald-tests for equality of the coefficients reject the null hypothesis that the effects are identical (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), strongly suggesting that the observed status effects are driven to a greater degree by the firm’s position in the overall knowledge space as opposed to domain-specific status positions.</p>

<title>Robustness checks</title>
<p>The results above paint a compelling picture that a firm’s status position in the scientific knowledge domain has an effect on the FDA’s review behavior, namely the speed of approval. To ensure the robustness of these findings, I performed three additional analyses addressing (1) generalized status and reputation, (2) potential selection bias, and (3) alternative outcome measures such as approval probability.</p>
<p>While the regression results show a strong correlation between a firm’s scientific status and FDA approval speed, it is possible that these effects are driven by more general status positions or reputations of the firm, and not necessarily the scientific positions of the actor. Because status positions tend to be correlated, it may be that prominent firms are more likely to receive faster approval, while these firms are also likely to occupy high-status positions in the scientific fields as well. To ensure that scientific positions, and not firms’ general status positions, are behind shorter approval durations, I include a measure for the firm’s generalized status based on scores from <italic>Fortune</italic> magazine’s annual list of the ‘Top 100 Most Admired Companies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012444917">Fombrun and Shanley, 1990</xref>) for the corresponding year at the time of submission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1476127012444917">13</xref></sup> The mean score for firms in my sample was 1.87 with a standard deviation of 3.18. As one would expect, the correlation between this variable and scientific status is strongly positive (0.61). Models 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012444917">Table 3</xref> show the hazard model results with this <italic>Fortune</italic> score included in the models. The reputation variable is positive, but not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). When the scientific status measure is included together in the model (Model 2), the effect of scientific status remains strong and significant, suggesting that scientific status matters to a greater degree to FDA reviewers than status in broader market domains.</p>

<p>To control for quality, the regression models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012444917">Table 2</xref> included the priority designation of a candidate drug. This variable had a strong and significant effect on duration, yet, there are ample reasons to believe that receiving a priority rating is not exogenous to the identity of the firm. As status is usually correlated with quality, it is plausible that higher-status firms produce better quality drugs, leading to a higher likelihood of receiving a priority designation, and inflating the effect of status. To account for this potential selection bias, I estimated the likelihood that a particular drug will receive a priority rating from the FDA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012444917">Table 3</xref>) based on various drug and firm characteristics. NMEs are two and a half times as likely to be deemed as a priority drug (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Not surprisingly, drugs that are early entrants into a disease category received priority ratings at a significantly higher rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Of greatest interest are the coefficients for status. Model 3 shows that higher-status firms did not have a higher likelihood of receiving priority ratings (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). However, when distinguishing between therapy-specific and non-therapy status (Model 4), status in relevant therapy categories showed a significant and positive relationship (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), while non-therapy status did not have an effect. This implies that high-status firms tend to get priority ratings, but only status in the therapy-specific category is correlated with priority ratings, while the status that drives shorter durations (i.e., non-therapy status) does not influence priority ratings. This mitigates concerns of endogeneity, but to further confirm that selection into priority ratings are not biasing the results, I calculated the inverse Mills ratios for drugs that were priority and non-priority following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012444917">Hamilton and Nickerson (2003)</xref>, and include the indicators in the hazard models (Models 5 and 6). Both were negative but not statistically significant, and did not alter the effects of status.</p>
<p>While approval duration has been the focus of the analysis, the proposed theory should nonetheless speak to status’s influence over the approval probability of a drug, an equally important outcome for firms. Technically speaking, the FDA does not ‘Reject’ a drug application, but instead issues a ‘Not Approvable’ decision when an application does not provide sufficient evidence for approval, and firms can resubmit their applications after revision. I analyze the first-round review outcomes for approved drugs in my sample, and estimate a logit model of the probability that an approved candidate drug received an ‘Approved’ or ‘Approvable’ decision (Model 7 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012444917">Table 3</xref>). Of the 613 NDAs which had this information available, 87% of drugs received approval, while 13% received a ‘Not Approvable’ decision. Consistent with the results from the duration analysis, the likelihood that a candidate drug will receive approval in the first round is positively and significantly correlated with the scientific knowledge status of the firm (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). A standard deviation increase in status led to a doubling in the odds ratio of ‘approval.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1476127012444917">14</xref></sup> More intriguingly, when looking at the speed of firms receiving a ‘Not Approvable’ decision in the first round (Model 8), high-status firms had a <italic>slower</italic> time to decision, suggesting that the FDA showed greater attention to high-status firms, even when quality did not meet the standards of the FDA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1476127012444917">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>The current study examines the duration of FDA new drug approval and how producer status positions in the scientific knowledge domains expedite or delay regulatory reviews. Institutional theory has provided ample evidence that institutional actors shape the status hierarchies of organizations, but the extent to which status hierarchies shape institutional actors has received less attention. My main argument in this article is that uncertainty and legitimacy concerns push the regulator to draw upon status signals in their decision-making. Furthermore, the tendency for public organizations to become institutionalized can often lead to status signals unrelated to the technical task becoming more salient. In the case of the FDA, the values of science and knowledge are infused into the organizational routines of product evaluation, rendering firm positions in the knowledge domain particularly salient for regulatory review. I proposed that greater technical and political uncertainty would enhance status effects.</p>
<p>Results from an examination of 839 New Drug Approval (NDA) applications submitted to the FDA from 1990 to 2004 supported a number of the hypotheses. First, firms with higher status in the knowledge domain enjoyed faster review times for their drugs. A drug sponsored by a firm occupying a position in the top 15% of the knowledge hierarchy spends roughly 200 fewer days in the regulatory review process compared with a drug from a median-status firm. This advantage bestowed upon high-status actors translates into significant revenue for the firm. Second, the evidence confirmed that status is more valuable when uncertainty is high. The interaction effects imply that high-status firms are rewarded for pursuing new market niches that address underserved disease categories, and enjoy a smaller penalty when the FDA slows down approval after a significant product withdrawal event. While these status effects can simply be the result of high-status actors producing higher-quality products, I find evidence that the regulatory advantages high-status firms enjoy are not driven exclusively by superior product quality. A firm’s status in the relevant therapeutic domain had a positive effect on review speed, but it was status accumulated in more basic scientific domains or unrelated therapy categories that had a larger effect on regulatory duration.</p>
<p>The study, of course, is not without limitations. First, the conclusions from the study are conditional on a drug ultimately receiving approval from the FDA, as NDAs abandoned during the review process are not revealed due to trade secret laws, and absent from the sample. While the number of drugs abandoned during the NDA review stage is very small (in contrast to the large numbers that are discontinued during the Phase I, II, and III clinical trials), nonetheless, the conclusions are limited to drugs that are eventually approved by the FDA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1476127012444917">16</xref></sup> Second, the current study fails to account for firm decisions on the timing of their submissions to the FDA. If firms adjust their submission strategy to maximize market reception, then review times can in fact be endogenous to events that alter the submission calculus. Finally, while the article proposes that uncertainty resolution and legitimacy concerns are the mechanisms that drive the positive effects of status positions, the agents that are making decisions in light of this uncertainty are not the organization per se, but rather the individuals that comprise the review teams of the agency. The intra-organizational social structures such as networks or teams that shape the review behavior of the FDA have not been explored in this article.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, I believe the study offers a number of important contributions to the organizational theory and strategic management literature. First, the article contributes to the fields of institutional theory and non-market strategy by providing a richer understanding of the social context in which policy is made, and highlighting how regulators respond to firms and their status hierarchies. By avoiding the conventional political economy perspective of the regulator as a passive entity maximizing resources or votes in favor of an image of the regulator as organizational actor dealing with uncertainty and conscious of legitimacy, this article offers a direct answer to the call put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012444917">Henisz and Zelner (2003)</xref> to incorporate disciplinary tools from sociology and organizational theory into discussions of non-market strategies.</p>
<p>Second, the article adds to the vibrant literature on status by identifying the policy arena as another setting in which status provides competitive advantage. Status and reputation have received much attention as a source of competitive advantage, and this article provides strong evidence that status is highly valuable in institutional settings as well. But beyond adding one more domain in which status is valuable, this study contributes to the literature by delving deeper into the social construction of status signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476127012444917">Washington and Zajac, 2005</xref>), and exploring the mechanisms of status effects. Non-market settings offer a unique opportunity to test the seldom discussed ‘political’ sources of status advantages (i.e., ‘No one gets fired for buying IBM’) that work in conjunction with the economic view that status acts as signal of quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012444917">Podolny, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, as public organizations are more likely to be infused with values beyond the task at hand, they provide an interesting test regarding the decoupling of status and quality. The finding that regulators place less emphasis on relevant signals of quality (i.e., therapy status), and more on markers consistent with broader competencies of the producer (i.e., non-therapy status) suggests that values are an important consideration in understanding how status shapes evaluation.</p>
<p>Third, the study opens a window into biases of our purportedly neutral and objective gatekeepers. Third-party actors such as critics, regulators, and analysts play an important role in market settings by evaluating or providing schemas that help others evaluate the quality of some difficult-to-judge product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012444917">Hsu, 2006</xref>). That mediating actors are subject to social influences and decision-making errors allows one to draw interesting conclusions about market outcomes. If gatekeepers respond to status positions by (unfairly) favoring high-status actors, then while the firm may enjoy short-term advantages (e.g., faster approval and market entry), the longer-term consequence is that these firms will have a higher likelihood of having underperforming products relative to low-status actors who are more closely scrutinized. I find in preliminary analysis for a follow-up study that, once approved, high-status firms’ products have a higher risk of causing significant adverse events such as major product withdrawals or severe warnings post-approval. These findings suggest that social and behavioral biases of gatekeepers can have unintended effects on markets.</p>
<p>The notion that regulators and other institutional actors respond to firm status also carries many strategic and practical implications for managers. First, the results from this study provide tangible guidelines to firms choosing their product strategies. The fact that new markets and political uncertainty following product withdrawals render status an even more valuable asset implies that low-status actors should sort into appropriate market niches (i.e., established disease niches) as a way to avoid incurring institutional penalties. This implication goes against conventional wisdom that suggests young (and thus, low-status) biotechnology firms should pursue high-risk, high-return opportunities, when in fact, these are the firms that suffer the most from any delay in regulatory approval. A strategy that initially pursues easily developed and quickly approved drugs for faster revenue recognition may be more ideal for these young and unproven firms.</p>
<p>In addition, the finding that general signals of quality (as opposed to therapy-specific signals) are more important in expediting review has implications for R&amp;D investment strategies of large firms. While a firm’s status position, being the product of the perception of others, is not something firms can directly control, the long-term strategic implication for firms is that investment in basic science and other non-product-specific capabilities can generate ‘halo effects’ for future products even if the actual results from the investment return little in tangible results. This decoupling of research and product provides further support for building broad and deep knowledge bases regardless of the immediate benefits to firms.</p>
<p>More broadly, this article provides the public, the ultimate principals of governments, a better understanding of the incentives that state agencies face, and how these incentives influence the way they deal with the firms they regulate. While viewing regulators as purely motivated by protecting the public can be considered too naive a perspective, the alternative that government bureaucrats seek the highest price may also be too simplistic in its depiction of the individuals and organizations involved. Understanding that non-market organizations are boundedly rational actors susceptible to uncertainty offers a more nuanced view of policy-making, and provides an important theoretical foundation for designing regulatory systems that balance the various interests of society.</p>

<p>Not only were FDA officials summoned to appear before multiple Congressional hearings to explain its role in the Vioxx scandal, but in the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal, Senator Dodd unveiled a bill that would establish a new $100 million-a-year Office of Patient Protection with power to demand new studies for approved drugs and to take drugs off the market, a significant challenge to FDA’s authority regarding drug regulation.</p>

<p>As has been noted by previous studies on the FDA, a new drug submission is not ‘rejected,’ but is only considered to be ‘Not Approvable’ at a given time, leaving open the possibility for the firm to submit a revision at any time in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012444917">Carpenter, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, for drugs that have successfully completed Phase III, the question is less about whether there is some indication or population for which the drug will show efficacy, but more around the boundaries on the claims a firm can make, or how many restrictions will be imposed on the marketing of the drug, making abandonment of drug submissions less likely.</p>

<p>It is important to note that I am not arguing that FDA reviewers actually observe and take note of the relative patent citation shares of firms. Rather, the patent citation network is a manifestation of a generally agreed-upon underlying status hierarchy (e.g., ‘Lilly has the most cutting-edge science in diabetes’), and the argument is that FDA reviewers share these perceptions of quality.</p>
