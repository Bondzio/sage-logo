<p>When it comes to accessing healthcare, poor English language skills can be a major barrier. Selina Stewart, from Joseph Chamberlain Sixth Form College Birmingham, introduces a project that has helped to make the NHS more accessible</p>

<p>In urban areas like Birmingham it is not uncommon for health professionals to treat women who cannot speak English and who have no real understanding of the way the NHS works. This is frustrating for health professionals and for the women concerned and can often lead to poor health outcomes. To help make the health service more accessible, the traditional solution is to bring in interpreters (either official or informal). However, many women do not like using their husbands or family members to translate and they do not necessarily feel comfortable discussing sensitive health issues with an official interpreter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430914">1</xref></sup> Heart of Birmingham Teaching Primary Care Trust (HOBTPCT) and Joseph Chamberlain College (JCC) have worked together to offer a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>JCC has many years’ experience in providing English as a Second or other Language (ESOL) classes for women from the Yemeni, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Somali communities. Colleges have found that many women attending these classes do so because they want to be able to talk to medical professionals. However, in everyday ESOL classes where teachers are preparing students for exams, they simply do not have the time to research and produce materials that focus on health in the way many students would like. Students are taught how to say body parts but more specific medical terminology is simply not covered because it is not needed for the exam.</p>
<p>HOBTPCT has found that an ability to speak and read English is essential for good health and accessible health care. In this PCT there is a significant population with limited English skills; one in every five adults lacks language skills above Entry 3 level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430914">2</xref></sup> Such statistics are not confined to Birmingham alone. The National Institute for Clinical Evidence (NICE) calculated that 10.2% of women giving birth had difficulty reading or speaking English.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430914">3</xref></sup> NICE recommended that these women should be offered information on access and entitlement to health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430914">4</xref></sup> However, access to this information is restricted if women lack literacy in English and the problem is made worse if, as with 76% of JCC students at Pre-entry level, students lack literacy in their own languages. For Birmingham this is a significant problem.</p>
<p>Helping patients to overcome literacy and language barriers has been a real challenge for HOBTPCT. Over £1 million was spent on interpreters in 2007/8 in the Heart of Birmingham. If health professionals rely on family members alone to act as interpreters then this could potentially cause embarrassment for the patient or family member, as well as poor-quality interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430914">4</xref></sup> While employing translators can be costly, failure to access services at the appropriate time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430914">1</xref></sup> or place can increase costs further and lead to poorer health outcomes in the long term. Research in 2004 identified that language and a lack of understanding prevented women from going for a cervical smear test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911430914">5</xref></sup> The Woman-to-Woman Report into cervical screening among ethnic minority women showed that education improves the understanding of why smear tests are so important. This is an issue that can be extended to many other areas of child and adult health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911430914">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to find effective solutions to a lack of English language skills and poor knowledge of the way the NHS functions, HOBTPCT funded a three-year project to develop high-quality teaching materials and deliver these to over 340 women living in the Heart of Birmingham area. JCC appointed a very experienced ESOL teacher to research the topics and to write the materials at three levels:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913911430914" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pre-entry, which is best described as a similar level of reading and writing English to a reception child in primary school.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Entry 1 level, which is similar to a first year junior school child of seven or eight years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Entry 2, which is equivalent to a top junior child of about 11 years.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The NHS is notorious among literacy and ESOL teachers for the complexity of its leaflets. JCC ESOL teachers therefore used the medical content of the materials but translated them into straightforward English so that they were easy to read for both non-English speakers and mother-tongue English speakers. All the materials were developed in consultation with relevant health professionals from HOBTPCT or other NHS professionals and were then checked by the PCT for accuracy. GHK Consulting was appointed as external evaluator to assess the effectiveness of the project.</p>
<p>The materials form a five-module course, which includes over 35 story books available at the three different levels (there are 117 books in total). Videos, audios and interactive exercises for use on an interactive whiteboard or a PC were also developed. The modules cover the following health areas:</p>
<list id="list2-1757913911430914" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pregnancy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Childbirth and child development to age three</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Healthy living (obesity, drug use, smoking and heart disease)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Women’s health (menopause, mammograms, cervical smears and breast cancer)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Carers</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The scheme was well received among a number of children’s centres in Birmingham, with many offering rent-free venues and childcare for those who wanted to take up the course. GHK found in its evaluation that they so welcomed the course because of the lack of low-level ESOL provision and also the fact that many women who had not been living in Britain for three years could not access ESOL classes. Cherry Tree Children’s Centre in Lozells, Birmingham was one of the first children’s centres to work with the project. The staff in the centre helped to recruit women who needed ESOL for health reasons. Interest in the project has continued to grow at this centre with 52 women so far taking the course; a further 50 women queued for places in September 2011.</p>
<p>The course was also adopted for Chinese people living in Birmingham. The Chinese community is often overlooked when it comes to literacy and so through the Chinese Community Centre in Birmingham, a Mandarin-speaking ESOL teacher was employed. The course has again proved popular with students.</p>
<p>To date, 12 children’s centres have helped 320 women across many different communities complete at least one module of the course. Interest is still growing and we have constant requests for further classes, specifically to help mother-tongue English speakers living in outer-city estates who lack basic literacy. Feedback from the children’s centres has been very positive. They have reported that improving the language skills of patients is cost-effective for health centres. Through ensuring awareness of available services and providing knowledge of the right services to access, health outcomes could be improved and costs reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911430914">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, women have said that they feel much more able to make an appointment and visit their midwives and GPs independently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911430914">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The project was initially funded until the end of March but the PCT has provided some further funding to support classes to continue until the end of June 2012. JCC will continue to use the resources in ESOL and literacy classes and the published version of the course, which has been accredited by the Royal Society for Public Health, will be available for purchase through the ESOL for Health website. Any income from this will be fed back into extending the provision of ESOL for Health classes in the Birmingham area.</p>
<p>ESOL teachers, children’s centre staff and health professionals, especially midwives, have seen the real impact of the course. Women who have taken the course can see what a difference it has made to their lives, from the ability to go to a GP independently to knowledge about what basic steps to take to improve the diets of their families. The materials are so thorough that it can be delivered by non-specialists and can have a real impact on the lives of some of the most hard-to-reach women.</p>
