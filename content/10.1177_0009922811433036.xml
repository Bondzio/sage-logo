<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge preparation is a critically important step in the introduction of an infant into a family unit and the transition from NICU to primary care. For families, discharge preparation begins on admission to the NICU and initially focuses on preterm infant behavior and care. Educating parents involves direct bedside teaching, instruction in and demonstration of appropriate technical infant care skills, repetition of important messages, and supplementation of oral information with written literature. After completing discharge preparation, families should be able to make well-informed medical decisions, possess basic technical baby care skills, and recognize, as well as respond appropriately, to signs of infant illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811433036">4</xref></sup> Discharge teaching has been reported to contribute to families’ confidence in caring for their preterm infant(s) and the infant’s well-being after discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811433036">5</xref></sup> For families with healthy term infants, poorly perceived discharge preparedness has been associated with decreased postpartum parental happiness, more parental self-reported physical and psychosocial problems, inappropriate infant care behaviors (eg, placement of infant in a high-risk sleeping position), and greater use of other health care resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811433036">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811433036">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Less is known about perceived discharge preparedness of families of preterm infants. However, poor discharge preparation has the potential for more significant adverse outcomes in this population because preterm infants may have immature feeding and sleeping behaviors, ongoing medical problems (particularly those with lung disease and other conditions putting them at risk for hospital readmission), and a more limited ability to express their needs and desires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811433036">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811433036">14</xref></sup> Parental readiness at discharge from the NICU is especially important if it helps ensure that parents seek medical attention appropriately, administer medications and other therapies correctly, and demonstrate confidence in home management of acute and nonacute medical problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that ongoing follow-up preterm infant care occur in a primary care office or medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref></sup> For primary care providers to be able to fully care for these infants and their families, they need to understand conditions facing the infant and the family. For the transition of care to be successful, the primary care providers should specifically be apprised of the infant’s condition at discharge and postdischarge needs/potential issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811433036">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we sought to investigate specific postdischarge outcomes and issues for families after NICU discharge. We previously quantified how prepared for discharge families felt on leaving the NICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup> Now, we present the postdischarge early experiences for families with varying reported discharge preparedness of which providers should be aware.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922811433036">
<title>Clinical Setting</title>
<p>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School with approximately 5000 deliveries annually. The NICU has 48 intermediate and intensive care beds (levels II and III) with an average daily census of 40 and approximately 900 admissions per year. The NICU staff includes more than 80 clinical nurses, 8 neonatal nurse practitioners, 1 physician assistant, 11 neonatal respiratory therapists, 14 neonatologists, and 18 neonatal-perinatal fellows.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922811433036">
<title>Conceptualization of This Study, Discharge Process, and Definitions</title>
<p>This study follows up on our previously published work about perceptions of discharge preparedness on the day of discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup> The correlates of discharge preparedness incorporated infant, mother, and nursing descriptive characteristics, as well as parental technical skills and emotional factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup> In the previously published study, we did not have the capacity to link discharge preparedness on the day of discharge with subsequent outpatient outcomes.</p>
<p>The discharge process and instrument used in this study have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup> Briefly, on the discharge day families rated their overall discharge preparedness on a 9-point Likert-type scale. The discharging nurse independently evaluated the family’s overall emotional and technical discharge preparedness using a 9-point Likert-type scale. Families and nurses were blinded to each other’s responses. Based on our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup> families were considered “prepared” for discharge if they rated themselves and the nurse rated their technical and emotional preparedness greater than or equal to 7 on the Likert-type scale. “Prepared” was treated as a dichotomous variable. We also recorded maternal and infant descriptive characteristics from the medical record. “Medically complex” infants were those with conditions that required additional special teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Instrument and Postdischarge Interviews</title>
<p>Follow-up phone calls began as a quality improvement effort based on feedback from parent satisfaction surveys, standard practice for our NICU. To create the standardized interview script, a nurse called and interviewed families about their post-NICU experiences. The most regularly mentioned themes were developed into questions for the standardized script, pretested on a sample of NICU families, and revised based on feedback. The following items were directly queried: in-home nursing, early intervention program, visits to the pediatrician, other services for the baby, difficulties with the baby’s home medication, issues with infant feeding and/or sleeping behaviors, and readmission to the hospital. Additional comments were also noted.</p>
<p>Using the standardized interview script, phone interviews were initiated during the first few days after discharge between May 2008 and July 2009. The nurse attempted to reach families on multiple occasions for at least 3 to 4 weeks before the family was considered unreachable. On a regular basis, the aggregate phone call summary data were presented to a multidisciplinary family resource group.</p>
<p>To review individual responses and to link the data with the discharge preparedness data, we obtained approval from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Committee on Clinical Investigations to conduct a retrospective data analysis of the quality improvement data. We were allowed to conduct this study after excluding the pilot data and removing patient identifiers from the quality improvement data.</p>

<sec id="section6-0009922811433036">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We used Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous nonnormal data and χ<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical data. In all analyses, a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were done using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 487 eligible discharges during the study period, we had follow-up phone call data on 349 (response rate of 82%). There were no statistically significant differences in maternal and/or infant descriptive characteristics between those families with and without follow-up phone call data (data not shown). Because we did not have a parent and/or nurse discharge assessment for 62 discharges, we had a final study sample size of 287 (59%). Forty-one percent of mothers were from minority racial groups. The median (interquartile range) maternal age was 33 (30-37), and 60% were nulliparous. Mothers completed the discharge survey more often than any other responder (68%)—either responding alone (44%) or with the other parent (22%).</p>
<p>At discharge, 35 of 287 (12%) families were “unprepared” as defined by a Likert response of less than 7 by either the family member or nursing assessment. Descriptive characteristics for the “prepared” and “unprepared” families are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811433036">Table 1</xref>. Families who were “prepared” for discharge had higher infant discharge weight and an infant who was medically complex. The “prepared” families had a discharging nurse who was familiar with them or their infant (62% and 63%, respectively) more often than the “unprepared” families (31% and 29%, respectively; both with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). “Unprepared” families were more likely to report that their pediatrician could not access the infant’s NICU hospital discharge summary, problems with the infant’s milk/formula, more frequent formula changes, difficulties mixing formula, concerns that their infant was not tolerating its feeding, and an inability to obtain needed feeding supplies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811433036">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811433036">3</xref>).</p>

<p>After discharge, many parents shared their views about the processes that helped prepare them for the transition to home. These included abundant instruction in infant care and illness recognition, sufficient time at the bedside to become familiar with their infant and his/her needs, written instructions, and initial supplies for the first night at home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811433036">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, many parents shared ideas about how their discharge transition could have been improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811433036">Table 4</xref>). Opportunities for improvement included having a discharging nurse familiar with the family and/or infant, providing more and consistent information regarding car seats, explaining clearly the discharge criteria and process, and informing the family of a change in the discharge plan as soon as possible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study highlights several issues for primary care providers accepting care and for NICU staff discharging infants/families. Despite the reassurance that comes from the vast majority (89%) of families having seen the pediatrician at the time of our follow-up call, there are some specific issues of which primary care should be aware. The need for accurate communication between the discharging NICU team and the primary care providers has already been noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref></sup> Primary care providers need to be aware of the infant’s hospital course and condition. It is imperative that they make sure that they obtain discharge summaries on each former preterm infant they are seeing, because primary care providers are not going to be aware of which families were and were not prepared for discharge. It would be preferable for them to be able to review this information prior to seeing the infant. Also, routine assessment of feeding is already a core part of infant primary care. Based on the results of this study, we would recommend that primary care providers ask families of preterm infants specifically about feeding supplies and formula on their first visit to the primary care office.</p>
<p>For NICU providers discharging infants, there are some encouraging and discouraging findings. Although it is reassuring that most families appeared to be “prepared” for discharge on the day of discharge, it is vexing that a notable portion (12%) continues to be perceived as “unprepared.” The percentage of “unprepared” that we found is similar to published rates among families with term infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433036">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811433036">17</xref></sup> Although none of the maternal descriptive characteristics were specific to “unprepared” families, their infants at the time of discharge weighed less but, interestingly, did not meet our criteria for medical complexity. Since there was no difference in birth weight, length of stay, or time to follow-up phone call, we can only surmise that the infants of the “unprepared” families had less weight gain. We also speculate that there was something different about how the discharge of the medically complex infants was handled that left the family and medical staff with a more positive perception of the family’s discharge preparedness. The clinical, socioeconomic, and provider data we had in this study were insufficient to further characterize families at risk for being “unprepared.” Therefore, we are unable to use this information for further post-NICU discharge risk stratification. In contrast, risk factors for “unreadiness” for discharge among families with term infants include maternal race/ethnicity, history of chronic disease, nulliparous status, highest level of educational attainment, and marital status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811433036">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811433036">9</xref></sup> For children with tracheotomies, success at home is linked to the financial status of the parents, family structure, social environment, and the comprehensiveness of the discharge planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811433036">18</xref></sup> We explored some of these risk factors in our population, but they did not distinguish between those “prepared” and not “prepared.” A more comprehensive study of risk factors for being “unprepared” and the mechanism of that risk is merited.</p>
<p>Both primary care providers and NICU staff should note that despite the brief period of time between NICU discharge and phone follow-up, “unprepared” families in our study reported some concerning difficulties in the days immediately following discharge. For example, being “unprepared” for discharge was associated with higher levels of parental concern about the infant’s feeding and less satisfaction with postdischarge primary care. Our results are not meant to imply a causal relationship between the actual discharge prepared score and the suboptimal outcome. Rather, the factors that led to the families being unprepared are likely to be similar to those that contributed to their experiencing difficulties after discharge. Such factors could be either the current state of a family under stress or traits that are inherent to a family. For example, not having formula, bottle, nipples, or diapers at home when the infant is discharged suggest a deficit in planning or organization, but this deficit could be temporary.</p>
<p>This study adds to the literature because there is very limited literature about difficulties associated with being “unprepared” for discharge. Bernstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433036">8</xref></sup> showed that mothers of term infants who were “unready” for discharge reported more infant-related concerns and less happiness. However, unlike our population, it is not clear that those mothers had more difficulties immediately after discharge because despite most of the mothers having general infant-related concerns during the first 2 weeks after discharge, differences in the mothers who were and were not “ready” for discharge were not observed until approximately a month after discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433036">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because there are detrimental consequences associated with not being “prepared” for discharge, every effort should be made to prepare families as well as possible. One of the most important lessons from this study is that there may be ways for improving the high-risk newborn transition to home. Currently, the AAP recommends that the timing of a high-risk infant’s discharge be based primarily on when the infant is able to coordinate breathing and oral feeds, ingest adequate volumes for weight gain, maintain normal body temperature in an open environment, and maintain stable cardiorespiratory function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811433036">19</xref></sup> The AAP further specifies that an infant needs physiologic stability, an active program for parental involvement and preparation for care of the infant at home, arrangements for health care after discharge by a physician or other health care professional who is experienced in the care of high-risk infants, and an organized program of tracking and surveillance to monitor growth and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref></sup> The timing of a NICU discharge should thus be mostly based on the physiologic maturity of the infant, while ensuring that the discharge planning and arrangements for follow-up have been completed, and that the family has received the necessary teaching as well as has demonstrated its mastery of the essential knowledge and skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433036">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811433036">19</xref></sup> These recommendations do not specify the content of the parental involvement program or the method of verifying that it is complete.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, our families reported dissatisfaction with inconsistency in care providers. The transition process may be improved by implementation of a consistent standardized discharge program that could be individualized to meet the specific needs of the family. From parental responses in our study, we believe that an ideal standardized transition program might include the following: a discharge teaching plan, a home preparedness assessment, follow-up primary care arrangement confirmation, and a family emotional evaluation. Sheikh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811433036">13</xref></sup> suggest that the discharge teaching should begin early during the hospitalization and continue until discharge with frequent repetition of important concepts and ideas to help encourage retention and to instill confidence in the family. Families should receive technical infant care skills and illness recognition instruction, and teaching should be supplemented with written instructions that are concise and clear. Finally, improved communication between NICU and post-NICU providers may improve the transition. Perhaps discharging the family with an information packet (including a NICU discharge summary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811433036">19</xref></sup>) that explains expectations for the infant and potential risks to the family that they could share with the post-NICU providers would improve communication because the majority of our cohort had been seen by the pediatrician and the in-home nurse by the time of the follow-up phone call. Such a package should be subjected to prospective evaluation.</p>
<p>Despite the knowledge gained, there were several limitations to this study. The mother was the family responder the majority of the time. Because mothers tend to be the primary infant care providers and often spend more time in the NICU, they are likely to be the most reflective of how prepared the family is at the time of discharge, but this is not universal. The median of time from discharge to the follow-up phone call was 5 to 6 days following discharge. This timing may not have been sufficient to identify the full range of potential adverse events reported in other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811433036">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811433036">9</xref></sup> including rehospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811433036">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811433036">21</xref></sup> A nurse who was not familiar with the family was more likely to give them a lower discharge prepared score. It is possible that a nurse who was familiar with the family spent more time with them and better understood their capabilities. If the discharging nurse was familiar with the family more often, our percent of unprepared may have been less. Nursing unfamiliarity has been a constant vexing problem that has defied our attempts to resolve it.</p>
<p>We did not explore any emotional factors such as depression or anxiety in this study, but others have shown that they could be a problem as well. Mothers of term infants who felt less ready for discharge also felt less happy at home and had a more difficult time coping at home, which resulted in more frequent calls to friends and family for support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811433036">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433036">8</xref></sup> We know from our prior work that emotional factors contribute to discharge preparedness more than the technical skills, but the specifics of these emotional factors have not been elucidated by us or others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811433036">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433036">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study was conducted in a single unit. Although we did not explicitly collect data on socioeconomic status or on marital status data, we know from other quality improvement projects that about 80% of our NICU parents tend to be part of an intact couple and most are from households with incomes above $80 000 a year. Finally, these data were initially intended to be used to improve the quality of care for families in the NICU and has only limited follow-up data. It was not initially structured as a research project and has the limitations typically associated with a secondary data analysis. Because of these limitations, the results should be generalized to other populations with caution.</p>

<sec id="section9-0009922811433036">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Despite the limitations of this study, the transition to home is a critical time. In addition to the practical and emotional benefits of discharge readiness, there are potential economic advantages of an effective program that must be considered. It has been demonstrated that infants of younger gestational age and additional comorbidities are at an increased risk of rehospitalization in the first several years of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811433036">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811433036">23</xref></sup> In fact, because of the risks, those infants may receive more extensive discharge teaching. However, there are additional populations where proper discharge readiness can serve substantial benefit in reduction of postdischarge health care related costs, including in those infants born to adolescent mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811433036">24</xref></sup> Even normal birth weight infants, generally considered a lower risk population compared with the low birth weight infants (&lt;2500 g), who were admitted to the NICU were at an increased risk for rehospitalization postdischarge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811433036">25</xref></sup> Although earlier appropriate discharge from the NICU has been to shown to reduce the hospital costs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811433036">26</xref></sup> there is concern for cost shifting the health care dollars toward later rehospitalizations. Silber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811433036">27</xref></sup> demonstrated that delayed NICU discharge did not reduce the post–health care utilization in the first 6 months of life.</p>
<p>Finally, we must consider the financial burden that could be potentially reduced on the family itself through proper education and discharge planning. Appropriate preparation for discharge should reduce the need for outpatient visits, thus reducing missed time from work, the co-pay and transportation costs, as well as the potential for reduction of inpatient admissions as in the case of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922811433036">28</xref></sup> These have been shown to be associated with generous out-of-pocket expenses for parents, in addition to the health care dollars. “Institutional hindrances to the discharge process needs to be ameliorated, and a community response to family and social needs requires a high priority not only to reduce unnecessary hospitalization, but also unwarranted costs of care.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811433036">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings support that most families were “prepared” for discharge, as self-reported and corroborated by their discharging nurse, and did well during the immediate postdischarge period. Those families who were “unprepared” reported some concerning difficulties. There are some opportunities that may improve the transition from NICU care to primary care, but the recommendations that we make in this article to enrich the transition process are just a beginning. Discharge readiness assessment should be a standard part of the discharge process. Each NICU should make every effort to make sure that parents are prepared for discharge to prevent untoward events as well as conduct regular evaluations of their discharge program to allow improvement over time. Finally, effective communication between the hospital and primary care providers is vital for a successful transition.</p>
