<abstract>
<p>This article examines 50 films produced and released between the years 2001 and 2012 that are concerned with the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Using Jacques Ellul’s theories set out in his book <italic>Propaganda</italic>, the article argues that while the films have failed at the box office, they were intended to function as integration propaganda. The article proposes six different tropes or common frames for understanding how the films avoid dealing with problems raised by the wars. Why the films failed, and what functioned as integration propaganda instead, is the subject for a second article titled “Eyeless in America, the Sequel.”</p>

<title>Unreeled War</title>
<p>It’s over a hundred thousand at this point, maybe as much as half a million, depending on how you count. They are wearisome, depressing numbers we turn away from; we click off the TV, close the laptop, redirect the mobile device to a social network instead: We’ve seen enough, had enough, just don’t want to look. We’re sickened and bored by it all—not again, not another one. These high numbers aren’t the body counts of combatant and civilian dead in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, although they could be, but instead they represent the combined footage of reel after analog reel, itself a form as tired as the content (Hancock qtd. in Hachman, 2011), of films produced by Hollywood and Indiewood about the wars in Afghanistan (2001-present) and Iraq (2003-present). For over a decade, film has been unspooling at the rate of 1,000 feet per 11 minutes of film; since the average Hollywood movie runs about 110 minutes, that’s 10,000 feet for each feature (Sciretta, 2009). The celluloid ribbon of over 50 feature movies about the wars (I exclude another three dozen documentaries) has been spinning heedlessly onto projection room floors as if there’s no projectionist or audience. Many films have rarely, or never, been screened but have instead been flattened onto DVDs and fired out across the web in an attempt to make them available to the viewing public. The majority of the films I highlight in this article can be seen legally outside a large urban film center only by streaming or buying them from an online retailer. BitTorrent downloads may draw in another few thousand sets of eyes—otherwise the texts remain unseen.</p>
<p>In his 1965/1973 book <italic>Propaganda</italic>, Jacques Ellul argued that like other massed societal structures, democracy requires integration propaganda to function. In this article I consider why war films (crucial for integration propaganda) have fared so badly both monetarily and popularly since the start of the two wars in the Middle East. I begin by revisiting Hollywood’s relationship to the state’s propaganda apparatus; continue by proposing six different framing devices films use to obscure or eclipse the two wars; consider whether it’s fair to say that the 50 films have been failures. The article’s true conclusion will be found in “Eyeless in America, The Sequel,” where I investigate the films’ various cultural moments and discuss what future war films will look like. The sample of 50+ films I use is representative, not exhaustive—I exclude most 9/11-related films like Oliver Stone’s <italic>World Trade Center</italic> (2006) and Stephen Daldry’s <italic>Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close</italic> (2011).</p>

<title>Hollywood’s Government</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0270467612459928">Ellul (1954/1964)</xref> argues that as soon as one mass group begins to use propaganda, all other such groups must follow or face extinction. Ellul understands propaganda as a creation and necessary part of “the technological society” (p. 4). In all forms of mass government, propaganda gives meaning to and explains the benefits of the state’s worldview. Since living in a machine age, when work is often thankless, pointless, exhausting, and discouraging and performed without craft, love, or willingness, may not be satisfying, keeping people at work requires regular emotional replenishment. Adrift during the weekend, the person will feel like
<disp-quote>
<p>a victim of emptiness—he [sic] is a man devoid of meaning. He is very busy, but he is emotionally empty, open to all entreaties and in search of only one thing—something to fill his inner void. To fill this void he goes to the movies—only a very temporary remedy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul, 1965/1973</xref>, p. 147)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once full of meaning composed of ritual (human activities that undergird community) grounded in natural patterns (changing seasons and their attendant cycles), life is now divorced from the reality of the harvest or spring, times of plenty, and renewal. High-speed entertainments that mimic life are the new interim filler for those confronting the abyss. Because such material needs to be produced incessantly and in mass quantities, the film industry is as much a machine as the machines needed to create films themselves: all these interconnected devices support the ruling societal worldview. It is crucial that the texts I’m dealing with here are visual: integration propaganda works to reach the widest audience, especially those least interested or most resistant to the state’s goals. Any visual medium will reach further in our particular image-driven world than other forms of text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0270467612459928">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given previous close connections between Hollywood and the federal government during wartime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0270467612459928">Doherty, 1993</xref>), the November 11, 2001, visit (a date surely chosen because of its mythic force and symmetry with the 9/11 attacks) between George W. Bush’s eminence grise Karl Rove and 47 powerful Hollywood studio chiefs and producers to discuss Hollywood’s war role was no surprise. So that everyone present could be inoculated against claims that they might create propaganda, propaganda was the first thing discussed. Their self-reflexive motion bespeaks the desire to demonstrate how above such things they, as representatives of a free market democracy, would be. Rather than be characterized as being in thrall to a wartime government preparing to open a second front in another Muslim country, the group emphasized they had come to offer help, and to absorb Rove’s seven-point message:
<disp-quote>
<p>That the war is against terrorism, not Islam; that Americans must be called to national service; that Americans should support the troops; that this is a global war that needs a global response; that this is a war against evil; that American children have to be reassured; and that instead of propaganda, the war effort needs a narrative that should be told, said a straight-faced Rove, with accuracy and honesty. (Cooper, 2001)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cooper’s (2001) ironic aside redirects us to Rove’s final point: What kind of narrative <italic>would</italic> such an accurate and honest account be? Rove wasn’t offering guidance to a legion of independent documentary filmmakers working with unlimited funds from politically neutral sources. He was talking to people whose job it is to produce fictions, untruths, of a kind that are immersive, coercive texts. All Hollywood representations are in some way based in or on realities derived from inner and outer human experiences. All stories make truth claims; all fiction is about human life, even if that life is cloaked in alien forms, because aliens created by humans originate in our minds’ creative universes. When Karl Rove uses the words “accuracy” and “honesty,” he means versions of reality that the White House will recognize as being the correct ones, which Hollywood should then disseminate.</p>
<p>Producer Lynda Obst laughs off Karl Rove’s tutelage not because she’s going against him: She’s been with him and his predecessors all along (Cooper, 2001). Hollywood needs no guidance about creating made-to-order realities. The November 2001 meeting caused a brief stir in the news world, but it was largely seen as an unimportant event. In 2005, <italic>USA Today</italic> reporters César G. Soriano and Ann Oldenburg (2005) concluded that “not since World War II has Hollywood so embraced an ongoing conflict.” However, the story about the deep connections between the two cultural hubs was more of a historical note than a panic about democracy’s condition. Hollywood, like all story generating forces, is integral to the self-creation of, installation of desired values in, and resolution of approved contradictions present in the United States. Hollywood has a deep history of explaining war as a painful, often terrible, ultimately rewarding event, enough that researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0270467612459928">Boggs and Pollard (2007)</xref> flag the entire enterprise as
<disp-quote>
<p>the “Hollywood war machine” . . . From its inception, the motion picture industry has been fascinated with warfare not only as entertainment but also as a vital part of the country’s deeply patriotic legacy—a phenomenon that has taken on new meaning since the end of the cold war and, more emphatically, since the events of September 11, 2001. (p. ix)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It’s hard not to think of Rove’s commandments that the fight be portrayed as a “war against evil” and “that American children have to be reassured” when considering Colin Powell’s well-orchestrated fictional performance at the United Nations in 2003 when he “proved” the existence of “Weapons of Mass Destruction”: a scene worthy of any thriller about international terrorism like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0270467612459928"><italic>The Sum of All Fears</italic> (2002)</xref> or <italic>Peacemaker</italic> (1997).</p>
<p>Worst of all is the supposition that overtly discussing propaganda excuses one from having to worry about participating in it. A month after the 9/11 attacks, senior statesman Richard Holbrooke (2001) famously said in the <italic>Washington Post</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>Call it public diplomacy, or public affairs, or psychological warfare, or—if you really want to be blunt—propaganda. But whatever it is called, defining what this war is really about in the minds of the 1 billion Muslims in the world will be of decisive and historic importance,</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>as if a billion people can easily be sold a new way of seeing, as if they don’t already have their own views, as if the Americans talking to and at them earned the right to define “what this war is really about.” Holbrooke’s (2001) paternalism smears the definition of propaganda such that it becomes synonymous with, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0270467612459928">R. S. Zaharna (2004)</xref> points out, legitimate government statements: “Yet this time, the term <italic>propaganda</italic> is being used interchangeably with a new term, <italic>public diplomacy</italic>, to characterize all foreign information activities” (p. 222). The silver lining is that an experienced diplomat and enduring government representative of many administrations is honest about demanding that propaganda be waged around the world. The massed thunderhead around that lining is that the propaganda wars had already begun. One might try to read Holbrooke’s (2001) piece ironically and interpret his rhetorical devices as exhortations to his readers to rise up in justified democratic fury; but when he calls for the winning of Muslim “hearts and minds,” the phrase that brutally encapsulates disastrous, racist, governmental policies during the Vietnam War, all irony evaporates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0270467612459928">2</xref></sup> Holbrooke’s article begins, as does Rove’s meeting in Hollywood, with the winking knowledge that what is said in public (and perhaps a great deal in private) won’t be straightforward; what is seen on computer, television, or cinema screens, what is uttered in any fashion to the press, will be arrayed to support an order that believes above all in maintenance of the status quo, even when such a thing is clearly unsustainable. For all of Holbrooke’s serious commentary and Rove’s plea for “accuracy” and “honesty,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul (1965/1973)</xref> knows, the information machinery “furnishes [the citizen] with a complete system for explaining the world, and provides immediate incentives to action. We are here in the presence of an organized myth that tries to take hold of the entire person” (p. 11). It’s a difficult process to take hold of the public’s, or in actuality, the many publics’ (there is no unified public but rather a panoply of groups, niches, subgroups, alterities), throats and force down the Truth. To deal with different audiences, I propose six main subgenres of war film that are the most powerful modes by which the work of reassurance and integration is accomplished.</p>

<title>Six Degrees of Alienation</title>
<p>Thanks to cultural studies professor Martin Barker’s superb longitudinal analysis <italic>A ‘Toxic Genre’: The Iraq War Films</italic> (2011), it is clear that almost without exception, films made about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, high or low budget or concept, have failed at the box office. Failure is a kind word: Most have been full-tilt budgetary smashups that pay off in thousands, not millions, of dollars. Some of the worst performers on screen (the following numbers do not include DVD sales or rentals) are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0270467612459928"><italic>Day Zero</italic> (2007)</xref>, which recouped $16,600 of its original $2 million dollar investment; the comedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0270467612459928"><italic>War, Inc.</italic> (2008)</xref>, which cost $10 million but clawed back just over $560,000; and independent films like <italic>Badland</italic> (2007), which also cost $10 million to produce and grossed $25,000 worldwide (BoxOfficeMojo). These are the most egregious losses, but the overall result is grim: Of all the films concerning either the wars or their veterans, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612459928"><italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> (2008)</xref>, the science fiction films <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0270467612459928"><italic>Battle: Los Angeles</italic> (2011)</xref> made any money (<italic>The Hurt Locker</italic>’s box office play was boosted by its six Academy Award wins, including those for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay). The rest of films were deemed to be “box office poison” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker, 2011</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Before looking at the six framing devices these films use to elide troublesome war issues, it’s worth recalling some comparative history. Unlike the Vietnam War, which became an inferno of domestic resistance to the establishment that produced it, as well as eradicating Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, the two wars in the Persian Gulf made their respective Presidents into box office popularity poll heroes: “The conclusion of the first Gulf War brought Bush I a resounding 91 percent approval rating, not quite reached by Bush II in 2003, when military victory (short-lived) produced a 73 percent rating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0270467612459928">Boggs &amp; Pollard, 2007</xref>, p. 23). Such numbers suggest that “the mass public was prepared to believe any lie or myth spun by politicians and the media, allowing warmakers greater flexibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0270467612459928">Boggs &amp; Pollard, 2007</xref>, p. 23). The “mass public’s” fervor signals that the post-9/11 media generated agitation propaganda. Given the high rhetorical and social temperatures it requires, agitation propaganda tends to burn rapidly, scorching the people experiencing it, causing public exhaustion with the issues even as they play out. Agitation propaganda is least interested in news that needs to be considered rationally, its claims judged logically. No service is provided by what we used to earnestly call “current events” (what defines an event and its currency become a problem when celebrity coverage overwhelms major news stories<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0270467612459928">3</xref></sup>):

<p>Hardly has an event taken place before it is outdated; even if its significance is still considerable, it is no longer of interest, and if man experiences the feeling of having escaped it, he is no longer concerned. . . . The event that has been supplanted by another is forgotten; it no longer exists; nobody is interested in it any more. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul, 1965/1973</xref>, p. 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These wars occurred simultaneously with the rise of blogs (web logs or weblogs), which not only created the blogosphere and gave voice to as many people (including soldiers) as had web access but also redirected attention from the few major news networks and older forms of media (television, newspapers) to typed or audio/video user-driven commentary. Consider that the bandwidth needed to stream video was barely available the year of the 9/11 attacks when 6% of American homes had broadband connections, while in 2012, high-speed lines reach 62% of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-0270467612459928">Zickuhr &amp; Smith, 2012</xref>). Between the blogs, social networks, private websites, and YouTube, an enormous variety of voices and content creators cranked up the data flow, making it that much harder to focus on the occurrences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul (1965/1973)</xref> discusses.</p>
<p>As with other media, film, too, had to find its balance as technology and the industry shifted. In film’s case, it was format migration that caused the most upheaval as movies sold physically to the public first on VHS tapes (usually played back to cathode ray–tube television sets), then DVDs, then Blu-ray disks (and briefly HD DVD), then to 3D disks and projection, seen on home flat screens connected to digital cable, with the attendant cessation of analog broadcasts. Broadband connections made peer-to-peer file sharing reliable, fast, and cheap and enabled the exchange of increasingly bulky files—like entire movies. Keeping people in the theater became critical to the survival of the film industry: Where Hollywood has, since the passing of American new-wave cinema of the late 1960s and early 1970s, been increasingly risk averse, such aversion is now a debilitating phobia. Powerful franchises (<italic>Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Twilight</italic>) are seen as the best way to cut risk. While the films I consider cover a diversity of attitudes, narrative forms, aims, and methods, they are generally united in that they “‘are pro-soldier. I think it genuinely says that Americans across the political spectrum have a strong degree of admiration for the military’ despite how they might feel about the war in Iraq,” so says Bing West, noted for his military histories and battlefield accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0270467612459928">Soriano &amp; Oldenburg, 2005</xref>). Because of shifting technological territory, Hollywood war films needed to find large audiences, the industry measure of success.</p>
<p>Before I begin with the six major groups of films, there is one I deliberately omit: satire and comedy. While there are a few films that have tried to take on the wars using humor—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0270467612459928"><italic>Charlie Wilson’s War</italic> (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0270467612459928"><italic>Embedded Live!</italic> (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0270467612459928"><italic>In the Loop</italic> (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612459928"><italic>The Tiger and the Snow</italic> (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0270467612459928"><italic>War, Inc.</italic> (2008)</xref>—most are attenuated, vague discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0270467612459928"><italic>Charlie Wilson’s War</italic> (2007)</xref> can be taken as a commentary on the benefits of interfering in Middle Eastern politics, but it really addresses the Russian war against Afghanistan in the 1980s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0270467612459928"><italic>Embedded Live!</italic> (2005)</xref> is the filming of a live stage production written by actor Tim Robbins and is not conceived of as a film. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0270467612459928"><italic>In the Loop</italic> (2009)</xref> says more about the political power games between America and England in the war years than it does about the war itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612459928"><italic>The Tiger and the Snow</italic> (2005)</xref> is another of Roberto Benigni’s ill-conceived would-be Chaplinesque comedies that he insists on staging in some of world history’s least funny places—his earlier success, <italic>Life Is Beautiful</italic> (1997), saw Benigni carry on his slapstick in a Nazi death camp, a performance for which the Academy immediately granted three awards. <italic>The Tiger and the Snow</italic> is a romance that barely, and offensively, uses Iraq as a backdrop. Of all the films, it is the last, John Cusack’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0270467612459928"><italic>War, Inc.</italic> (2008)</xref> that shows the most promise. None of these films was a commercial success, nor do they take up the war’s issues (with the exception of Robbin’s stage play and Cusack’s film), and all but the last are such frail texts that I chose to put them aside rather than devote more time to them. In considering the relationship between films from Vietnam and these two wars, few comedies have worked: Even Robert Altman’s 1970 <italic>M*A*S*H</italic>, while it could be read as a damning anti-Vietnam text, was officially about the Korean war.</p>
<sec id="section4-0270467612459928">
<title>Degree 1: Dear John’s Correspondence</title>
<p>One of the adroit tactics war films employ to hide their intentions is to nest an epic romance (complete with lovers eternally pursuing the infinite while doomed to be put asunder by fate) within the war story. War may be seen as an inescapable, invidious agent, but the real problem is that it forces men (usually) to choose between duty and death and women, children, love, and life. If there’s insufficient grief in a given story line, the “Dear John” letter, typically written by a selfish, thoroughly culturally condemned woman safe at home who decides to leave her man (and by association his war) while he’s being chewed up overseas, can ratchet up the melodrama. Cartoonist Bill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0270467612459928">Mauldin (1945)</xref>, famous for his creation of the dogface <italic>Stars and Stripes</italic> characters Willie and Joe, wrote sarcastically that “a man feels very fine fighting a war when his girl has just written that she is thinking that perhaps they made a mistake. . . . He’s going to feel pretty low and he might get a little careless because of it” (p. 24). In case someone needs blaming for a soldier’s death, the faithless woman at home can bear the load. The narrative of lovers caught in or divided by war replaces the war itself: The relationship is the war in microcosm, pushes the war into the position of backdrop, or stands in for families under siege. Of the seven films I identify in this category, some are immersed in filial or familial relations—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0270467612459928"><italic>Brothers</italic> (2009)</xref>, <italic>Divergence</italic> (2007), <italic>Grace Is Gone</italic> (2007)—others in traditional heterosexual love relationships—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0270467612459928"><italic>The Messenger</italic> (2009)</xref>, <italic>The Situation</italic> (2006), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref>—still others are would-be quotidian healing narratives one might find on current daytime talk shows—two main strands of the television serial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0270467612459928"><italic>Over There</italic> (2005)</xref>. Some, like <italic>Source Code</italic>, draw on a combination of genres (romance crossed with a science fiction thriller) as played out by the typical Hollywood beautiful people whose major charms are their youth, fitness, and apparent instant sexual availability to others of the same breed.</p>
<p>In <italic>Brothers</italic>, a remake of the Danish film <italic>Brødre</italic> (2004),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0270467612459928">4</xref></sup> an unlikely prisoner of war narrative that recalls the ludicrous Russian roulette metaphor in Michael Cimino’s 1978 <italic>The Deer Hunter</italic> is obscured by a love triangle between two brothers and a woman. One brother, who survives as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan by killing his subordinate, is left for dead by the army. His ex-con brother has been drifting through life until his sister-in-law, an attractive young widow and her two sweet children, give him new purpose. Just as the second brother attempts to settle in with his adoptive family (his sister-in-law refuses his advances, convinced that her husband is still alive), the soldier brother is discovered and returned home. The triangle is resolved in the climactic scene where the veteran tries to commit suicide by cop (a newly recognized form of suicide: Anguished veterans returning from one or more tours in Iraq or Afghanistan have learned that drawing weapons and threatening to shoot can goad police into killing them in the name of public safety; “‘Suicide by Cop’ Phenomenon,” 2009). Despite the severity of the battlefield events and the soldier’s dreadful survivor guilt, the film rotates around the major axis of the apparent wastrel brother (he turns out to be an exceedingly talented carpenter and plumber, as well as excellent human being—how he wound up in jail is surely more related to his disapproving authoritarian father than his own character flaws). The narrative machinery groans along, lurching to a foregone conclusion of unlikely reconciliation between all parties. The war acts solely as a device to keep one brother away long enough for the civilians at home to get busy with the looming romance.</p>
<p>Similarly in <italic>Divergence</italic> (2007), war is a pretext for romance, which hides a moral lesson about obedience. For both recovering helicopter pilot Tim Lawson on leave from Iraq and attractive young suicidal widow Clare O’Neil, time has seemed to halt. The two isolated individuals bring each other back to life, restarting the clock and bringing on the military’s inevitable recall of Lawson. Although Clare tries to convince Tim to desert, she is unable to do so, and he returns to Iraq. Lawson’s acceptance of his responsibility forces Clare to confront the deaths of her husband and young child and finally go home—she is initially pictured, complete with cloak, like John Fowles’s mysterious Sarah Woodruff from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0270467612459928"><italic>The French Lieutenant’s Woman</italic> (1969)</xref> looking out to sea—to build a new life where her old one stood. Clare pleads with Tim that he escape with her (it is the only time in 114 minutes of film that she mentions the war), a speech she delivers half-dressed, kissing him, presenting herself as the sexual prize he will win for desertion:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Clare:</speaker>
<p>Listen to me. You’re not going back. We’ll go away. We’ll go somewhere, someplace they can’t find you. We could go away, just the two of us, together, so they can’t make you go back . . . We could do it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tim:</speaker>
<p>Clare, I can’t desert . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Clare:</speaker>
<p>. . . Listen to me. This is not some fantasy. This war is wrong. We could do it. A clean slate. Do it for me. Say you’ll do it for me . . . you can’t go back there.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Tim:</speaker>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Clare:</speaker>
<p>You mean it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tim:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Clare:</speaker>
<p>. . . It would be good to get away from here. Away from everything. That’s our deal. You and me. I don’t want to lose you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tim:</speaker>
<p>That’s our deal. (Divergence, 2007, 1:23:40-1:26:42)</p>
</speech>
<p>Once Tim reluctantly agrees to her “deal,” the two make love and seal the bargain. The love affair turns on to the tortured veteran’s willingness to save a grief-crazed woman in flight from her responsibilities: She is not only suicidal but a lost cause without him. He is drawn to her in the tradition of romantic immolation but is saved by the advice of his ex-boss, a professional helicopter pilot and Vietnam vet (played by Al Cerullo, who is both of these, as himself), who reassures him as the two fly a helicopter together: “I went down seven times in ‘Nam in the 13 months I was there . . . and you always, always get back in. It’s just what you do, it’s our job” (<italic>Divergence</italic>, 2007, 1:17:22). Simultaneous return to war, unpleasant but necessary duty, and rejection of love and escape are the central trope of these romances. Leaving Clare on the railroad platform, Tim tells her brutally: “<italic>That’s</italic> our deal.” There is little indication that he will return to her: They have come together but now diverge, as the title suggests. Tim’s brief, brusque lecture about duty drives Clare back to her house, where, in the last frame, she stares enigmatically at three American flags snapping in the breeze. Just as she once looked only outward to the ocean’s horizon, now she must confront her inner American world. Women at home will create new lives; men overseas will take them. The text is suffused with lessons about conformity: “The propaganda element is in the American way of life with which [the film director] is permeated and which he expresses in his film without realizing it. We see here the force of expansion of a vigorous society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul, 1965/1973</xref>, p. 64) Sexual prizes are to be had in each of these texts, where the woman initially falls to the man who stays at home and will not or cannot fight: Ultimately the woman, like Penelope waiting for Odysseus, resists the suitors and awaits the master’s return. Even the messiest domestic situation imaginable (<italic>Brothers</italic>) can be resolved by the woman’s steadfast commitment.</p>
<p>Military duty and persistence are crucial to Duncan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928">Jones’s 2011</xref> science fiction romance thriller <italic>Source Code</italic>, but they are put in service to the heterosexual love story that is the real narrative engine. Veteran helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens, who we later learn is all but brain dead, returns to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train that carries a bomb. Through Hollywood magic, Stevens has become an experimental subject for a military program—one directed by a visibly crippled, Black, civilian scientist—that has managed to keep his brain operating long enough for him to be projected into a past event (the train’s final 8 minutes) where he must discover not only the train bomber’s identity but also the whereabouts of a dirty nuclear device the bomber has planted near downtown Chicago. As Stevens is thrown repeatedly onto the doomed train, he falls in love with the woman sitting across from him; ferrets out, frustrates, and arrests the bomber; and finally creates a parallel universe where he is alive and whole. In this new Chicago, he dismounts from the train with his beautiful girlfriend to a happy, Hollywood life. Dr. Rutledge, the physically and morally crippled civilian scientist working for the military industrial complex, is not merely an untrustworthy, ambitious company man but a villain of the kind who evokes soldierly virtues without possessing any himself. Stevens bargains fruitlessly for his death and end of service (he’s the apotheosis of a stop-lossed soldier) with Rutledge—the audience knows Rutledge will promise anything to keep his project running, and will work Stevens’s brain to its last operating cell. It falls to Stevens’ go-between, his military handler Captain Colleen Goodwin (a single, childless, increasingly sympathetic career officer), to act morally and unplug him. Goodwin’s gender and childlessness are pushed to the front of the discussion: The newly maternal military will take care of its own. Going against specific civilian orders, sacrificing her career, Goodwin tells Stevens:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Goodwin:</speaker>
<p>At the end of this source code I will terminate your life support. There will be no coming back.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Stevens:</speaker>
<p>I’m going to save her, Goodwin.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Goodwin:</speaker>
<p>It was an honor, Captain. And I thank you for your service. Good luck. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic>, 2011</xref>, 1:09:33)</p>
</speech>
<p>Even though Goodwin doesn’t believe Stevens’s story about his ability to create new events from what should be a fixed past, she believes in Stevens himself. The military can trust only other military: Only a soldier can genuinely thank another for his or her service. <italic>Source Code</italic>’s military characters display impeccable manners, behavior, and morals, unlike the civilians surrounding them (intriguingly, the film opts out of the common Vietnam film trope of the deranged veteran bomber and instead finds its villain in a fully functioning sociopathic, soft, effeminate civilian who creates and plants the nuclear device). All of this is backdrop for the love under fire, where the relationship between the beautiful, ignorant woman waiting to catch the supercompetent Captain Stevens’s attention, is the drivetrain. The combination of love story set in an action/adventure grid is what presumably powered the film’s financial success: not that it was about an almost dead Iraq war veteran but that it was a love story between two very alive, if mythic, lovers who live in a world better than ours.</p>

<title>Degree 2: Some (Sort of) History</title>
<p>That world of ours provides the second frame for sanitizing the war: partial history. In the next group of films, there is little or no mention (let alone discussion) of nonexistent Weapons of Mass Destruction, a smoking gun that might be a mushroom cloud, the elimination of a dictator with (no) ties to Osama bin Laden, a botched “regime change,” near civil war, or occupation. While some texts deal with specific instances of loss and grief, they step around the faked reasons for war. Historical events and their political contexts are modified or purged utterly. The films operate in the same eternal twilight inhabited by Bruce Joel Rubin’s 1990 <italic>Jacob’s Ladder</italic> (a retelling of Ambrose Bierce’s 1890 “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge”), removed from the context, in that case, of the early 1970s, Nixon’s failing presidency, the collapse of the Vietnam War, and deep citizen unrest at home. Instead, the focus is on a traumatized, baffled Vietnam veteran’s relationship with his dead, literally angelic, son named Gabriel. Of the Iraq films, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0270467612459928"><italic>Day Zero</italic> (2007)</xref>, <italic>Grace Is Gone</italic> (2007), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0270467612459928"><italic>Home of the Brave</italic> (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0270467612459928"><italic>The Lucky Ones</italic> (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0270467612459928"><italic>Taking Chance</italic> (2009)</xref> not only shear off the war’s causes or the war itself (<italic>something</italic> looms over the texts, but what?) but also divorce the characters from their environments, as if Iraq and Afghanistan are empty back lots, not even what soldiers refer to as “the sandbox,” “the suck,” or more drolly, “wall to wall fuck all.” Rather than focus on causes or the complexities of political background, the films stare resolutely at the soldier, in some cases—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0270467612459928"><italic>Taking Chance</italic> (2009)</xref>—with sacred fervor the viewer is not permitted to challenge. The veteran, especially hurt or barely functional, becomes the new sign for purity, a seam <italic>Source Code</italic> and <italic>Divergence</italic> mine. Irvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0270467612459928">Winkler’s 2006</xref> <italic>Home of the Brave</italic> makes it clear that all veterans must be thanked, no matter how they handle themselves on or off the battlefield.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0270467612459928">5</xref></sup> Thanking military personnel generically “for your service” covers the possibility that one might accidentally express the deep and sincere gratitude meant for a combat veteran to one of the dozens of support and logistics soldiers (including, heaven forbid, a cook) the military requires to keep a single combat soldier on the ground. Like other dreary truths about war, support personnel remain hidden.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0270467612459928"><italic>Day Zero</italic> (2007)</xref> considers what might happen were the draft to be renewed in the near future. Three male friends in their late 20s are suddenly thrown into crises of conscience about whether or not to go to war. The first initially takes Vice President Dick Cheney’s line that he has other priorities (despite his bellicosity, Cheney received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War); the second is unhesitatingly prepared to go; and the last one (played by Elijah Wood) is so terrified of life and war that he makes a Top 10 list of things to do before dying, and finally commits suicide. The friends come together against a sort of political green screen (a physical green screen is crucial to creating virtual environments in film): Any beliefs the viewer chooses about war or politics can be magically created and inserted and the characters superimposed on them. With politics and the issue of just war theory sidelined, the film focuses on the way the men see each other’s sense of duty. Even this personal issue has no traction: The characters debate lackadaisically about patriotism, and then fall back on often-told high school fables. Neither acting nor script can bear the narrative’s load. Although the third character’s suicide is predictable, one is not meant to feel badly for Elijah Wood’s character, a Hobbit without Shire or grit: He is encoded a loser and coward. While there might be a way into a discussion of male courage in the early 21st century, the film doesn’t open one. Scholar Jeanie Elenor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0270467612459928">Gosline (2008)</xref> sums up the problem astutely: “The filmmakers seem unwilling to delve into the specific ambiguities and complexities of the Iraq War and the lives of its participants.”</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0270467612459928"><italic>The Lucky Ones</italic> (2008)</xref> flexes more muscle than <italic>Day Zero</italic>, it falters as an overly sweet road movie in which serious events are overcome by a surfeit of coincidence and military camaraderie. As in <italic>Day Zero</italic>, each of three characters (one wounded in the groin and fearing for his masculinity, the next, a wounded female veteran played by Rachel McAdams, mourning a friend and looking for an adoptive home) must arrive at his or her own destinations: The lead story belongs to Tim Robbins’s character, Sergeant Cheaver, injured by an accident in Iraq and returned home. The three wounded veterans are forced into a rental car together and, given the genre, soon learn each other’s stories, most important of which is about the falling Porto John that has damaged Cheaver’s back, enough to excuse him from the war zone. Answering his fellow soldiers’ expressions of sympathy and dismay at the accident, Cheaver laughs,
<disp-quote>
<p>Are you kidding? I <italic>love</italic> that Porto John! Best thing that ever happened to me. A week later my unit shipped off to Mosul, got shot to pieces. That shitter saved my life. I wish I could have brought it home, set up a shrine. If I have another kid, I’m gonna name him Porto John.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of the three, Cheaver, happily married, probably college educated, and settled into a stable, middle class life, is the most content. However, all is not calm in Porto John world, as Cheaver finds himself abruptly abandoned by his wife of many years and on the hook for $15,000 for his son’s college tuition. Although the other soldiers try to help, and Rachel McAdams offers him her precious guitar that happens to be worth precisely the missing $15,000, Cheaver is determined to do the right thing, reenlisting for a $20,000 signing bonus.</p>
<p>Ostensibly at the center of <italic>The Lucky Ones</italic> is a discussion about the way the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as with most of America’s wars, represent America’s class divisions. The film’s three veterans are victims not only of a desperate military in need of warm bodies but also of what political scientists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0270467612459928">Douglas Kriner and Francis Shen (2010)</xref> call “the casualty gap,” where even in the post-Vietnam all-volunteer military, battle injuries and deaths still fall disproportionately on the poor (p. 71). While the other two veterans’ stories may be more fabular (particularly Colee’s, the soulful female veteran<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0270467612459928">6</xref></sup>) than Cheaver’s mundane tale, it is his story that commands our attention. The one soldier who could probably summon the resources to support his son (mortgage the house, to start with—the film was released before the subprime housing market imploded) does what is least likely for his character: reenlist. Cheaver signs on again, refusing both Colee’s and TK’s (Michael Peña) offers of money and advice (TK tells Cheaver that he “could get out of that” reenlistment): The man with three crushed vertebrae thanks to his beloved Porto John answers calmly, smilingly, “I’m not sure I want that.” Just as the suicide in <italic>Day Zero</italic> was predictable, improbable, and destructive to the narrative, so Cheaver’s reversal is indigestible. Presumably the audience is to understand that the most educated, oldest (Cheaver seems to be in his late 40s), most experienced, and sympathetic person can be caught in the military’s trap: No one is invulnerable to the vicissitudes of life, anyone can fall prey to a military willing to pay high signing bonuses. Perhaps Cheaver is disgusted by his wife’s callous, selfish rejection of him; perhaps he is so undone by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that he cannot think, although this seems unlikely since he hasn’t spent any time in combat. Cheaver’s moment on the Road to Damascus (or in this case, Las Vegas), remains frustratingly offscreen. Perhaps he sacrifices himself so his son can live properly. What makes no sense for his character is the enormous goodwill with which he returns to his fate in Iraq, as if his accident with the Porto John prevented him from proving himself on the battlefield, something he and all Americans need to do, according to the film. There is no context for the soldiers’ joining up or discussion about the way the war is being fought, let alone reasons for fighting it at all: Most irritating is the cloak wrapped around the characters’ reasons for their actions. The one conclusion we can safely draw from <italic>The Lucky Ones</italic> is that working-class Americans are good Americans if they follow orders and do as they’re told.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0270467612459928">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final film I consider in this section is based on Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl’s article of escorting a young Iraq war veteran’s remains home to Wyoming. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0270467612459928"><italic>Taking Chance</italic> (2009)</xref> follows Kevin Bacon as Strobl, who volunteers for escort duty because he’s struggling with his conscience. As the guards must, Bacon’s character stays with Chance Phelps’s body until it reaches its destination, producing yet another road trip. The voyage across America is used in no fewer than eight films about returning veterans as a way to confer on the country and its people a mythic, unified, status. Strobl finds one noble American after another, from pimply teens to hardened veterans, all of whom bow in submission before the example of Phelps’s sacrifice. Much detail is given to the elaborate mechanics of the Mortuary Affairs unit (part of the Quartermaster Corps), with close attention paid to the freezing, thawing, preservation, and unpacking of the corpse as well as the soldier’s effects. This HBO film could have been written and produced for The History Channel in conjunction with the Pentagon. If Chance’s problems are over, Strobl’s are not. Late in the film, Strobl finally finds his confessor in a wise old combat veteran:</p>

</speech>
<p><italic>Taking Chance</italic> is a well-intentioned film rooted in Michael Strobl’s personal struggle to come to terms with the fact that he, a Marine, stepped back from war. While Strobl questions his masculinity, the text focuses relentlessly on loss. Paradoxically the loss itself has little emotional impact on the viewer. The film is one long funeral, but unlike other such texts at whose core is a passionate eulogy, here there is little emotion, nothing messy. Everything is sanitized, frozen, polished, made safe. The family cries silently: Everyone gets a hug. Unlike difficult and important scenes in <italic>The Messenger</italic>, no distraught family members attack the guards, the Quartermaster Corps, the military, or the reason for a young person’s death. Instead, what we are presented with is a country united by a military that has created for itself a very special, desirable, exclusive family. The sadness at the loss of a once-lively twenty-year-old is overwhelmed by the solemn rites documented by the camera’s reverential intimacy. Nothing, not even a death, can compare to the Marine Corps’ power as it buries one of its own: The Marine Corps’ body lives on through its rituals, sayings, flags, and once-secular, now-sacred habits. Strobl (and by extension all viewers who may be shamed by their inaction in the wars) is reassured that he, too, plays a critical role as a witness. The film is a smooth ride into and out of a war death. Grief and horror that might be elicited were human pain shown would likely ignite a discussion of the purpose death has served (it may not be one desired by the state). The attempt to make a film that has no visible politics creates a weightless, value-free historical environment where things just happen because they do, where wars are out of our control, and where obedience to an authority that must know better is the rule (as Charlie tells Strobl, “They must have needed you here”: Command knew what it was doing when it kept Strobl at home). Like <italic>Source Code</italic>’s nearly dead pilot hero, one simply wakes up in the middle of a nightmare and must start fighting. Questions certainly won’t be answered: As much as we love a maverick, the questions shouldn’t be asked, either.</p>

<title>Degree 3: The Army as Hero</title>
<p>Another way around the problem of the two wars and their causes—revenge in the first case, the second case largely obscured by the self-styled Bush White House “Vulcans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0270467612459928">Mann, 2004</xref>, pp. ix-x), who made the return to Iraq 12 years after the first Gulf war baffling and inexplicable unless, as was suggested at large and then specifically, “It’s [About] the Oil, Stupid!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0270467612459928">Chomsky, 2008</xref>)—is to pursue a classic American narrative that the military is the hero. While individual soldiers can be acclaimed, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0270467612459928"><italic>Taking Chance</italic> (2009)</xref>, no single light can outshine the collective that provides the soldier with identity through propaganda, compelling its subjects to learn regimental history and lore, swear loyalty to unit and service arm (something that fuels often extreme interservice rivalries), and observe bizarre occasions like the Marine Corps’ birthday (November 10, 1775). The military is an exotic, attractive country where civilians may win brief stays—one such was experienced by civilian journalist Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0270467612459928">Weisskopf (2007)</xref>, who became an honorary combatant and war hero, gaining him entrance into the until then all-military hospital Walter Reed for treatment as an amputee. The widening gap between the military and civilian worlds has been a constant concern in America and was discussed with typical insight by journalist Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0270467612459928">Ricks (1997)</xref> before the 9/11 wars. Civilians have come to be in awe of the military in the post-Vietnam world, while the military continues to nurture a deep suspicion of its civilian bosses. The result is that it is relatively easy to mythologize something with which people largely have no contact (one of the reasons civilians are so entranced with specialized military service arms like the Navy SEALs or snipers of any variety comes from this divide: These are soldiers who, with their unusual skills, are not in any way like “us”). In this section are films that find a collective hero (and often superhuman levels of strength and endurance) in the military: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612459928"><italic>The A-Team</italic> (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0270467612459928"><italic>American Soldiers</italic> (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0270467612459928"><italic>The Green Zone</italic> (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0270467612459928"><italic>In the Valley of Elah</italic> (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612459928"><italic>Valley of the Wolves: Iraq</italic> (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0270467612459928"><italic>The Kill Point</italic> (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0270467612459928"><italic>Kingdom of Heaven</italic> (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref>. The military provides a stable, moral center from which to understand the chaos not only of war but also of politics. (Many films fall into more than one of the categories I explore—<italic>Taking Chance</italic> could easily be included here; the overlap demonstrates how porous the boundaries are between the different war film frameworks.)</p>
<p>While America is used to prizing the silent man of action as its hero—whether incarnated as Cooper’s Deerslayer (Hawkeye or Chingachgook), Jack London’s lupine frontiersmen, Hemingway’s lonely hunters, John Wayne (both his characters and, finally, himself as a character), Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone, Luke Skywalker in his various guises, or Arnold Schwarzenegger—the gunfighter and military man are often conflated. Many heroes operate extralegally or are outright vigilantes, but the most reliable come from within the community’s approved violent actors: the police and the military. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Ellul (1965/1973)</xref> points out that the
<disp-quote>
<p>collective will always be best idealized, patterned, and represented by the hero. The cult of the hero is the absolutely necessary complement of the massification of society . . . The well-known mechanism of identifying the movie stars is almost impossible to avoid for the member of modern society who comes to admire himself in the person of the hero. (p. 172)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The star who accepts typecasting is soon rolled into one being identical on screen and in private life. The hero acts where the average person can find no effective action to take (for instance, voting might feel like an exercise in futility rather than power) and because the world is infinitely more inflected than any fiction can show. The film hero gets to be direct, confrontational, physical, rule breaking and self-serving, all of which are particularly gratifying to audiences used to living in urban environments where functioning in close quarters requires the observation of unspoken rules and statutory law. The action hero becomes our avatar, the one who not only knows what to do but also does it without hesitation. An action hero rooted in the military has that much more clout: He or she is a normal person but, in joining the military, taps the hero’s astonishing resources of strength that each member of the mass audience suspects it has, even if it cannot locate it just this moment. The little guy connected to a bigger force is given pride of place in Paul Haggis’s <italic>In the Valley of Elah.</italic> The text rotates around a scene between Tommy Lee Jones’s retired Sergeant Hank Deerfield and the only child (coincidentally named David) in the film, a boy who has lost his father and lives in permanent fear:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Deerfield:</speaker>
<p>You know where your name comes from? You’re named after King David . . . One day this kid, not much bigger than you, comes delivering bread. He says to the king: “I’ll fight Goliath.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Really? No way.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Deerfield:</speaker>
<p>True story . . . and [David] steps out into the valley with his slingshot in his hand. Goliath comes running, yelling this horrible scream. David let’s fly with that slingshot, hits him in the forehead, cracks his skull open—Goliath falls down, dead.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>So he shot him.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Deerfield:</speaker>
<p>With a rock. Not the same thing. And you want to know how he beat him?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Deerfield:</speaker>
<p>The first thing David had to fight was his own fear. He beat that, he beat Goliath. Because when Goliath came running, David planted his feet, took aim and waited. You know how much courage that took? Just a few more steps and Goliath would have crushed him. Then he let fly with that rock. That’s how you fight monsters. You lure them in close to you, you look them in the eye, you smack ‘em down.</p>

</speech>
<p>Although the ex-sergeant and military detective Deerfield’s investigation into his son’s military-related disappearance and murder brings him into contact with four Iraq veterans who have lost all moral compass, the film is still prosoldier. Deerfield clearly misses the military and is at home there and there alone. While <italic>In the Valley of Elah</italic> has been condemned as an anti-American, antisoldier film, it is not. The soldiers have been led astray by bad civilian policies in Iraq: Even the fact that Deerfield’s son took pleasure in torturing wounded Iraqis, and that his fully functioning sociopathic comrades are equally lost in a garden of evil, cannot damn them—they remain victims of an intolerable situation. None have had David’s strength—that is why the boy exists in the text—to point to the future. The David and Goliath story is not only immediately attractive to a person who is small and scared but also one of the ways in which America presents itself to itself. Particularly after World War II, America took care to nurture the myth of the underdog—the nation fights only when it must, kills reluctantly, acts honorably. Films like John Ford’s <italic>The Quiet Man</italic> (1952) and John Sturges’ <italic>Bad Day at Black Rock</italic> (1955) underscore the importance of morally driven, appropriate violence that demonstrates true American force as being quiet, fair, and final (Deerfield tells David about combat: “There <italic>are</italic> rules. You don’t shoot somebody that’s challenging you to a fight with a sword”). This narrative hasn’t altered despite massive geopolitical shifts in power since August 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0270467612459928">8</xref></sup> The story Hank Deerfield has used to raise his own sons, both of whom have died at war (“You could’ve left me one,” wails Hank’s wife [37:33]) he now passes on to detective Emily Saunders’s (Charlize Theron) son, who will carry the torch of righteousness into the 21st century. At the end of the film, Saunders confides to Hank that David now wants to hear this same story every night, and has asked for a slingshot. The inoculation has taken.</p>
<p>The shift from David’s private struggle to that of David’s army is not as great as one might think. Most of the war films assume the warrior is a member of ground forces (Army, Marines): There’s an occasional helicopter pilot but so far no stories about fixed wing pilots or drone operators working remotely. The stories are familiar: Some texts have changed the Army combat uniforms’ color but otherwise left previous war tropes intact. Even if at first blush a narrative appears to be harmful, representing war helps the Military:
<disp-quote>
<p>Wars giving visceral expression to patriotic valor, technological virtues, and masculine conquest fit this pattern. Within such a narrative the Vietnam war would end up frustratingly messy and confusing, while the first Gulf War easily fit into the desired historical pattern, reinvigorating the nation’s psyche (deflated by the Vietnam syndrome) in a triumphal war over a demonized opponent (Iraq).

<disp-quote>
<p>Actually, Vietnam war films are all pro-war, no matter what the supposed message, what Kubrick [<italic>Full Metal Jacket</italic>, 1987] or Coppola [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0270467612459928"><italic>Apocalypse Now!</italic> 1979</xref>] or [Stone, <italic>Platoon</italic>, 1986] intended. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson in Omaha or San Francisco or Manhattan will watch the films and weep and decide once and for all that war is inhumane and terrible . . . but Corporal Johnson at Camp Pendleton and Sergeant Johnson at Travis Air Force Base and Seaman Johnson at Coronado Naval Station . . . watch the same films and are excited by them, because the magic brutality of the films celebrates the terrible and despicable beauty of their fighting skills. (pp. 6-7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>French director Francois Truffaut suggested (perhaps apocryphally) that it was impossible to make an antiwar film because the representation, no matter how ugly, would romanticize war (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0270467612459928">Hamrah, 2004</xref>). A text may be antiwar but can still slide into a prosoldier or promilitary stance, showing men and women, ardent combatants, as dutiful (if at times misled) champions. In Sidney Furie’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0270467612459928"><italic>American Soldiers</italic> (2005)</xref>, the squad’s emerging leader confesses to his wounded sergeant:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Jackson:</speaker>
<p>I ain’t never really thanked you, I mean, said the words, for everything you did for me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sergeant Delvecchio:</speaker>
<p>Thank the Army, son. I do. Along with that judge . . . the one who gave me a choice between serving time and serving my country. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0270467612459928"><italic>American Soldiers</italic>, 2005</xref>, 40:38).</p>
</speech>
<p>Such dialogue slots into most World War II films, a good many about Korea, and even some about Vietnam. The Army has not only saved the otherwise weak men Jackson and Delvecchio and transformed them into responsible citizens, but it has made them leaders capable of saving others: All will die unless given proper direction on this one very bad day in Iraq. However, the film is as naturalistic as the above forced dialogue. The narrative grinds on from one unbelievable event to another, ending with a jaw-dropping fantasy knife fight that pits seven American soldiers, one badly wounded, against 11 or 12 (it’s hard to tell with all the dust) “insurgents.” The beleaguered American troops, completely out of ammunition, lure the foolhardy Iraqis (all armed with loaded automatic weapons) over a berm and, in a 3-minute assemblage of jump cuts and cinema verité, kill each Iraqi hand to hand, knife against gun. Not one American is injured. Such a scene might have played in a World War I film made during World War I, or a Western or World War II movie from a certain era; today, it is preposterous—or should be. The film also revises history as the squad, having dropped off prisoners, mutinies when it sees Iraqis being mistreated. The prisoners are being tortured by Comandante Federico de la Rocha, who is not a native English speaker. The CIA has apparently outsourced torture to a Hispanic, or Spanish-speaking, brute (de la Rocha’s nationality is unclear—he is certainly encoded Other). Furthermore, it is the CIA, not the Army, that runs the compound and keeps the prisoners caged like rats, similar to the treatment of humans at Guantanamo’s Camp X-Ray. Contravening direct orders from senior officers, the squad raids the compound, seizes the prisoners, beats up the sadistic de la Rocha, and empties the camp. In the long course of the American wars in the Middle East, it’s more than possible that soldiers mutinied in this way, although if they have, the news hasn’t traveled even to the furthest fringe news source available, including soldiers’ blogs. Furie presents the squad’s actions as a reality that flies directly in the face of the pictures and testimonies from both Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, where the shaming and torture of prisoners turned out to be not only systemic but also an official policy ordered by President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Furie’s entrance into the Iraq war film genre was highly anticipated because of his sympathetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0270467612459928">1978</xref> Vietnam film <italic>The Boys in Company C</italic>. While that text may have used somewhat heavy-handed metaphors to recount war truths, it didn’t directly contradict known facts. Furie’s military may be heroic, but it is also unbelievable: The vision of American soldiers selectively deciding which orders to follow may be reassuring to civilian viewers, but it has nothing to do with military training or reality.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the problem of a military (which is not a unitary institution—no group composed of millions of people will agree on everything) that is convinced, as many of its members have been since Vietnam, that civilians are busy stabbing it in the back and preventing it from winning wars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref> shows a military that can rely only on itself: Civilians may be friendly, helpful (find an unavailable rental car for the three needy veterans in <italic>The Lucky Ones</italic>, give work to suffering vets in <italic>Badland</italic>), they may be ignorant and stupid (<italic>Home of the Brave, The Messenger</italic>), but when they’re leaders, they cannot be trusted at all. Such betrayal is at the heart of Paul Greengrass’s well-intentioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0270467612459928"><italic>The Green Zone</italic> (2010)</xref>, a film bearing no relation to its originary material, Rajiv Chandrasekaran’s superb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0270467612459928"><italic>Imperial Life in the Emerald City</italic> (2006)</xref>. The film finds Matt Damon in quasi-Bourne mode, a supercompetent military weapons inspector who leads a vain search for the fabled Weapons of Mass Destruction the Bush White House gave as the main reason for the Iraq war. Ultimately Damon’s character, Miller, learns the truth of the so-called sexed-up files discussed in the notorious Downing Street Memo, which revealed that the case for war was bogus. Miller’s real enemy is a slippery civilian diplomat Clark Poundstone, presumably modeled on Paul Bremer, whose ruinous errors as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority between 2003 and 2004 caused thousands of civilian deaths and a near civil war in Iraq. Realizing that the military, which is honestly doing its job, has been lied to by its civilian bosses, Miller confronts Poundstone, who fluffs off the outraged soldier:</p>

</speech>
<p>The Machiavellian Poundstone presses the full weight of his authority on the army, forcing it to abide by his lies: The military must submit. Miller’s warning about “next time” elicits only Poundstone’s utilitarian jibe: “We won!” The “Emerald City” that Chandrasekaran limns so beautifully is rife with people who never feel or see the consequences of their actions: They run the country from inside the green zone (the safe area established by the American military), they don’t step out of Oz. The Army, however, and the military more generally, goes out into the world and faces its dangers. Because it is on the ground and is portrayed as working-class (it does the dirty jobs handed to it by white-collar mendacious civilians), it becomes the repository of faith and citizenship, duty, honor, and societal security. Soldiers in these films are minimally dented saints who unhesitatingly set everything aside and put others first. In doing so, they form America’s moral core.</p>

<title>Degree 4: Technical Wizards</title>
<p>The soldier combat narrative often follows a triadic pattern where the text traces the scared recruit’s passage from boot camp or early arrival in the war zone to key formative battlefield events where the recruit becomes a functioning soldier, accustomed to fear, proficient with weapons, and willing to make snap judgments about danger—as much a master in combat as is possible. The period of battlefield competence reveals the soldier’s character and morals. The third step sees the soldier become a veteran who functions with differing degrees of success due to ongoing exhaustion, panic, and horror. In many fictions, soldiers are killed off at this juncture: Survivors are often shown to be deeply hurt or entirely broken psychologically and emotionally. Oliver Stone’s <italic>Platoon</italic> (1986) epitomizes this pattern: the green Chris Taylor is wounded, evolves into a practiced fighter, and is finally overwhelmed by trauma that renders him unable to continue. The films I discuss in this section, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0270467612459928"><italic>Battle: Los Angeles</italic> (2011)</xref>, <italic>Body of Lies</italic> (2008), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0270467612459928"><italic>Generation Kill</italic> (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612459928"><italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> (2008)</xref>, <italic>The Kingdom</italic> (2007), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0270467612459928"><italic>Over There</italic> (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref>, focus on the last two steps of surviving combat and its aftermath, although they spend most of their time near or in the world of combat.</p>
<p>The best known of the Iraq war films and the only fiction film to win any Academy Awards, Kathryn Bigelow’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612459928"><italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> (2008)</xref>, jumps us to the point where the soldier is a master on the battlefield. Few films hold here, although the televisions series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0270467612459928"><italic>Generation Kill</italic> (2008)</xref> based on Evan Wright’s book of the same title, shows the soldiers’ (many of whom play themselves on screen) calm steady professionalism as much as their lunatic interactions with each other and command. Soldiers have played themselves before—Audie Murphy’s recreation of his life in Jesse Hibb’s <italic>To Hell and Back</italic> (1955) is probably the most famous example—but having lives framed in the now-established genre of “reality television” has made war into more of a spectator sport than ever. Soldiers are ready-made agentic-actor-reality players who transcend Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0270467612459928">Herr’s (1977)</xref> grunts from Vietnam:
<disp-quote>
<p>I keep thinking about all the kids who got wiped out by seventeen years of war movies before coming to Vietnam to get wiped out for good. You don’t know what a media freak is until you’ve seen the way a few of those grunts would run around during a fight when they knew that there was a television crew nearby; they were actually making war movies in their heads, doing little guts-and-glory Leatherneck tap dances under fire, getting their pimples shot off for the networks. (p. 209)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Soldiers in Vietnam were alert to the media: Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan became the media. Contemporary soldiers may be as knowledgeable (or not) about history and politics as ever, but they are more capable of portraying a world of characters (at times a lapsed civilian, combat veteran, or media director but always someone reflexively in the rapidly shifting public eye) than any other group before them. Never have combatants been so intimately and thoroughly surveilled by themselves and others.</p>
<p>The poster child for such a character is the unshakeable Explosives Ordnance Disposal specialist Sergeant Will James who is a battlefield superstar (there’s very little James cannot do, including outshoot professional snipers). James is a fidgety ball of rage and stress, joking darkly about murder with everyone around him. The definition of cool, Sergeant James is the envy of even the brutal Colonel Reed (a nod to another lethal survivor, <italic>Apocalypse Now!</italic>’s Colonel Kilgore; when Reed is told about a wounded Iraqi who will live if treated properly he tells a subordinate definitively, “He didn’t make it”), who stays clear of a burning car and massive bomb that James first extinguishes, then defuses:</p>

<p>While the exchange between the crazed Colonel and the wonderfully talented Sergeant James recalls scenes from other war films, it really is about someone astonished at mechanical perfection. Reed, stuck in repetition as he struggles to come to terms with the number of times James has beaten the odds (David Morse infuses these lines with luminous insanity), is as delighted with James as if he were the inventor of a new weapon. James functions like an overheated machine: He does his job immaculately but endangers the lives of everyone with whom he comes in contact. To be near him is to risk scorching, if not immolation. A constellation of metaphors, he is also a cowboy, the new sheriff in town, which he confirms when he subdues his junior noncommissioned officer by literally riding him like a bronco. An adrenalin junkie most alive when pitting himself against an explosive device and its author, James is also a technical wizard, a combination mechanical Merlin and Schwarzneggerian Terminator able to comprehend (and typically defeat) any device he confronts. He keeps the trigger mechanisms of bombs that have nearly killed him: They are possessions he prizes above pictures, and the reality, of his family. The new soldier is a master not only of battle but also, because battle has become such a highly technological enterprise, of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0270467612459928">Jacques Ellul (1965/1973)</xref> calls “<italic>la technique</italic>.”</p>
<p>Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker (2011)</xref> points out that unlike many war films, <italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> focuses on the specifics of the job, with a
<disp-quote>
<p>fascination to its maneuvers and tactics, and to the fine use of deadly weaponry. In all this, James becomes the one lead character in these Iraq war movies who is never once bewildered. He is a calming epicenter for characters and cameras alike. (p. 158)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Depicting a specialized kind of war has given a number of filmmakers a way into discussions that appear to be exhausted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0270467612459928"><italic>Beneath Hill 60</italic> (2010)</xref>, <italic>War Horse</italic> (2011), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0270467612459928"><italic>Shooter</italic> (2007)</xref>, have all given life to old stories, particularly World War I narratives. Each specializes, constructing a small piece of the story as a theater for the whole: Australian miners at the front, innocent animals drafted for war labor, the advanced physics of sniping, all provide new stages for retelling stories of patriotism and duty. The soldiers’ highly technical abilities focus the audience on the astonishing way specialists can stay calm in dreadful circumstances, distracting the audience from larger questions or problems with morality (or the war’s validity) that might arise. Iraq war veteran Kate Hoit (2010) notes about <italic>The Hurt Locker</italic>: “James represents a Hollywood soldier that is fearless, reckless, and is now the face of the 21st century G.I. Joe. And who doesn’t love G.I. Joe, right?” Neither the comic nor the film versions of G.I. Joe have fought conventional wars for decades any more than John Rambo fought in a recognizable Vietnam, Afghanistan, or Myanmar. But it is to the technical wizard of cool, paradoxical wild man and cowboy Sergeant James that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave six of the nine Academy Awards for which <italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> was nominated. While an Academy Award is no guarantor of excellence, it is a litmus test for what is considered acceptable centrist (arguments that Hollywood is either too liberal or conservative notwithstanding) expression on difficult topics. Hollywood determined that accepting Vietnam on film in certain ways (<italic>Coming Home</italic>, 1978; <italic>The Deer Hunter</italic>, 1979) allowed it to close the door on more problematic representations of other behavior in Vietnam and after (<italic>Taxi Driver</italic>, 1976; <italic>Apocalypse Now!</italic> 1979; <italic>Full Metal Jacket</italic>, 1987). Oliver Stone, forced to secure funding for <italic>Platoon</italic> (1986) from the British production company Hemdale, had a rare moment of revenge when the film won an Academy Award.</p>
<p><italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> is the past decade’s celebrated Iraq war narrative, embraced full-throatedly by reviewers like Stephen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0270467612459928">Hunter (2009)</xref> who enthuses that
<disp-quote>
<p>its evocation of pure war is so gripping and it feels almost too real. You feel the weight of the sand in the air, the density of the sweat bead running down your nose, the slippery frictionless flank of a pair of needle-nose pliers standing between the self and obliteration. It’s war as sensual experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0270467612459928">Hunter’s (2009)</xref> voluptuous language as he identifies with Sergeant James reveals that he has transcended viewing the film and has moved on to winning the war by proxy. Hunter says hagiographically about James that “in the end it was his higher wisdom that prevailed, his strength that abided, his courage that won the war.” James is the centered, better version of us, says Hunter, someone dedicated to “professionalism and some commitment to an almost indefinable thing called duty.” The suggestion that James is “braver and stronger and that we are not up to his standards” indicates the degree to which <italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> is successful integration propaganda. It explains who we should be, gives us an ideal toward which we should strive, and forces on us the admission that Hunter obligingly makes for everyone: James is the best of and for the nation.</p>
<p>Veteran Kate Hoit (2010) isn’t having any:
<disp-quote>
<p>So, let me get this straight. We have an American soldier running through Iraq in a hooded sweatshirt, trying to find out what happened to a kid who sold bootleg movies, and a sweet soldier who just lets James waltz on base? Bravo Hollywood; that was pure magical bullshit.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Reality cannot be in question, though: This is a movie, not a documentary, but a mythic retelling of how it feels (Hunter’s senses have been accurately targeted) to wear a 75-pound disposal suit in typical daily heat of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit while struggling with an explosive device that can be remotely triggered any time. James’ role is to play out Hollywood’s “pure magical bullshit”: Hunter is there to mistake it for the truth. Hunter is satisfied with his reality, even though the film good-naturedly gestures to itself as a postmodern artifact in its opening scene. Within minutes of a recognizable actor’s appearance (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes), they are killed off. If famous actors keep getting killed in it, the film <italic>must</italic> be about real people, says the text, a logic that draws the viewer familiar with film straight out of the narrative. If the familiar can be killed, then perhaps the unknown (the then much less famous Jeremy Renner) will survive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker (2011)</xref> points out astutely that Sergeant James is now a representative not only of wars past but also of troubles to come:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is here that the real politics of the film lie. Soldiers like James do it because that is what they do: <italic>finis</italic>. What this film celebrates, is a character who is the living embodiment of post-traumatic stress disorder, but who is treated by the film as not disordered at all. (p. 157)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Barker’s insight makes clear how smart it is to have given this film a raft of awards: James is our hero—he lives in war, and as the film’s close suggests, can live nowhere else. PTSD has been normalized as a crucial part of heroic action.</p>
<p><italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> formed the template for Iraq war heroes, one solidified by financial successes like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic> (2011)</xref>, in which soldiers can accomplish anything, including creating new universes. Although Captain Stevens is held hostage by the crippled, Black civilian scientist Dr. Rutledge (there are few speaking characters of color in <italic>Source Code</italic>; the fact that the sadistic Rutledge is Black is thoroughly problematic when all the good people in the text are White, although the “terrorist” bomber is White as well—he has to be, the film would too obviously support racial profiling if the bomber were of color, let alone of Middle Eastern descent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0270467612459928">9</xref></sup> When Stevens confronts his jailer with the challenge “This can’t be legal, what you’re doing,” Rutledge is ready with the official answer:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Rutledge:</speaker>
<p>In fact, your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by military court. You know, many soldiers would find this preferable to death. The opportunity to continue serving their country.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Captain Stevens:</speaker>
<p>Have you—have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Rutledge:</speaker>
<p>That’s immaterial.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Captain Stevens:</speaker>
<p>Any solider that I’ve ever served with would say that one death is service enough.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Rutledge:</speaker>
<p>Fine. You can have that in return for completing this mission. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0270467612459928"><italic>Source Code</italic>, 2011</xref>, 51:44)</p>
</speech>
<p>The key point is the one that Rutledge evades: He has never served, in fact would be rejected for service because of his physical limitations. Rutledge has no honor, and he will not act on his promise to release Stevens from his living death. But Stevens is not only a soldier, he’s a helicopter pilot, a technician, a technological master. He determines that despite or because of his near-death state, he can have an impact on a world. Like James, Stevens calls on all of his technical skills and battlefield cool, deciphers two bomb plots, makes contact with his father (who assumes he’s dead), sends a message across time and space to his friendly military guardian Captain Goodwin, and gets the girl. He is as much man, if not more, than James. James has a body and risks it: Stevens has only some brain function left and risks even that, so convinced is he that his understanding of the world is the correct one (unlike James, he chooses life, not war). Like any wizard technician or engineer hero from American science fiction authors like Robert Heinlein or Isaac Asimov, Stevens changes reality until it suits him, something that few people outside of Washington or the Pentagon seemed able to do during the wars. As Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0270467612459928">Beck (2008)</xref> wrote in <italic>Film Quarterly</italic>: “Today, facts aren’t enough, and neither are large manifestations of indignation and outrage, a.k.a. protests . . . ‘We respect the people’s right to peacefully protest,’ administration officials said. Then they went about their business” (p. 8). The films in this section are the only ones to have succeeded at the box office, to have drawn broad public support, to have won awards, to have satisfied audiences. <italic>The Hurt Locker</italic> has, in particular, acted as a tourniquet for films about Iraq. While there will be other representations, for the moment the wars have been tied off with a measure of satisfaction that the film establishment, the “veritable American Dream Machine,” has turned the crazy cool Sergeant James and calm solipsist Captain Stevens into heroes: That should be enough.</p>

<title>Degree 5: War Crimes Policy</title>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum are the notorious, if little seen and in America, wildly unpopular, films about atrocity. Films that either discuss torture or put it at the center of the argument represent a fifth of the war film list I use for this article and include the following: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0270467612459928"><italic>The Battle for Haditha</italic> (2007)</xref>, <italic>Body of Lies</italic> (2008), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0270467612459928"><italic>Five Fingers</italic> (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0270467612459928"><italic>In the Valley of Elah</italic> (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0270467612459928"><italic>Infinite Justice</italic> (2006)</xref>, <italic>Insurgents</italic> (2006), <italic>Mark of Cain</italic> (2007), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0270467612459928"><italic>Redacted</italic> (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0270467612459928"><italic>Rendition</italic> (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0270467612459928"><italic>The Road to Guantanamo</italic> (2006)</xref>. Some of the films are driven by specific historical events covered by news sources (<italic>The Battle for Haditha, Infinite Justice, Mark of Cain, Redacted, The Road to Guantanamo</italic>); others use torture to run the narrative (<italic>In the Valley of Elah, Five Fingers</italic>); a few note torture in passing but reduce it to a plot element (<italic>Body of Lies, Infinite Justice, Insurgents, Rendition</italic>). Some of the films, particularly Brian De Palma’s <italic>Redacted</italic>, so polarized critical discussion that to agree with any part of the film seemed to mean one felt that all soldiers were psychotic crypto-sadists. <italic>Redacted</italic> gave the audience few safe places to stand except as judgmental outsiders: It was not a film that explained but one that decided beforehand that its subjects were loathsome rapists—how they got into the military and were tolerated for so long was not, although it should have been, the issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0270467612459928">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>What the films don’t investigate is the jam into which military and civilian command put soldiers where they must interpret the standing rules of engagement, the guidelines for how to deal with the enemy (Is a car driving toward a checkpoint hostile? Should the car’s occupants be shot at, killed, even if they’re civilians? What if there are children in the car?). Like the other films about Iraq, war atrocity texts are removed from historical and political context. Despite the filmmakers’ best wishes to foster outrage, create mass revulsion in a public apparently immune to the moral aspects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the most scathing texts were ignored by American audiences. Only the documentaries (<italic>Taxi to the Dark Side</italic>, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0270467612459928"><italic>Standard Operating Procedure</italic>, 2008</xref>) took up the issues of systemic enemy and civilian abuse, as well as Command’s deliberate policies of torture of both known combatants and innocent citizens. The fictional films don’t address the enemy: Who, after all, were and are the enemies in these two wars? According to the Bush White House, they were “terrorists,” “evil-doers,” “insurgents,” but never soldiers, never human beings with their own coherent belief systems. Denied that status, they could be and were excluded from treatment accorded combatants and prisoners under the Geneva Conventions. Even as President Obama gestured wanly toward closing the American concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the administration refuses to name the prisoners there as soldiers but rather continues to deal with them as “detainees,” or “PUCs” (persons under control). One of the lessons learned from the Vietnam “conflict,” as it was called by the American governments who furthered it, was to deny the enemy legitimacy. If you go to war and declare that you are not at war at all, and are fighting only illegal resisters, then you don’t have to answer for your battlefield conduct in an international court of law or, perhaps more damning, public opinion. Killing a great many civilians will make you unpopular, but that doesn’t necessarily alter the course of your war policy, or the ways in which you determine how the Other is not you. You can show war crimes, and you can also kill discussion: “Atrocities appear with frightening regularity . . . The general tone of the films is despairing, totally the reverse of the loyal and enthusiastic support we see in films made during and about World War II” (Eberwein, 2009, p. 134). If there’s no civilian alignment with the soldiers, then their actions need not represent “us,” viewers who look on appalled. In a paradoxical way, the most extreme films about atrocity give citizens the easiest way to deny the crimes; people must recognize themselves in the soldiers if they are to accept that they, too, might be capable of atrocious behavior. If they can disown the soldiers, they can disavow their actions as well. The further from us soldiers and their actions seem, the easier it is to avoid looking at atrocity since “we” didn’t commit it.</p>
<p>The Bush White House’s attempt to eliminate unpleasant images of wounded and dead during the early years of the two wars may be largely responsible for the outpouring of real and grotesque pictures aired in a number of the films (particularly the slideshow that closes <italic>Redacted</italic>). When Bush banned photographs of caskets at Dover Air Force Base, he put a premium on war’s reality: the dead. Making the dead vanish created a parade of extraordinarily powerful phantoms (or in director Joe Dante’s clever imaginary, zombies who needed to vote before they could truly die; <italic>Homecoming</italic>, 2005). Pictures otherwise came from embedded reporters who necessarily surrendered whatever objectivity they could muster, since they were taking images of people who were daily responsible for preserving their lives. The suppression of photos finally ended with the eruption of cheery digital snaps taken by the Military Police of themselves at Abu Ghraib prison (originally Saddam’s own torture palace) featuring, among others, the now infamous Charles Graner and Lynndie England grinning at or with corpses and piles of naked live Iraqis.</p>
<p>There has been a division in the films about Iraq, one that America has seen before in handling problematic wars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0270467612459928">11</xref></sup> George Packer, journalist and award-winning author of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0270467612459928"><italic>The Assassin’s Gate</italic> (2005)</xref>, notes with dismay that “all the Iraq-war movies . . . seem entirely atrocity-driven, based on the conceit that combat turns men axiomatically evil and that evil is to be taken as a surrogate for the evil policies that spawned them” (p. 22). Even if one agrees with Packer, the numbers don’t bear out his conclusion. Of the more than 50 films I cover in this analysis, 8 include Americans engaged in some form of torture: Some do the torturing, some are tortured—eight is not “all the Iraq war movies.” I have just argued that no fictional representations discuss policy. Brian De Palma’s <italic>Redacted</italic> likely poisoned the well for Packer: The other films (the best known are British filmmaker Nick Broomfield’s <italic>Battle for Haditha</italic> and Paul Haggis’s <italic>In the Valley of Elah</italic>) hardly overbalance the 40+ films depicting Americans as innocent but just (or confused, wronged, betrayed) fighting men and women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0270467612459928">Packer (2008)</xref> fumes about the depiction of
<disp-quote>
<p>American soldiers as psychopaths who may as well be wearing SS uniforms. The G.I.s rape, burn, and mutilate corpses, torture detainees, accelerate a vehicle to run over a boy playing soccer, wantonly kill civilians and journalists in firefights, humiliate one another, and coolly record their own atrocities for entertainment. Have these things happened in Iraq? Many have. But in the cinematic version of the war, these are the <italic>only</italic> things that happen in Iraq. (p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Packer, who labored so successfully in <italic>The Assassin’s Gate</italic> to produce a balanced account of the nightmare that unfolded in Iraq, should know better. He wants to make sure that the bad news isn’t pinned on the troops, the way it often was in the Vietnam War, when veterans recounted the dreadful receptions to which they returned. When Packer narrates what happens in the films, we should note where and in which texts these actions occur. It may be instructive to revisit his list, then, and make some minor annotations. Once more, here’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0270467612459928">Packer (2008)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The G.I.s rape [<italic>Redacted, Battle for Haditha</italic>], burn [<italic>Battle for Haditha</italic>], and mutilate corpses [described but not seen in <italic>In the Valley of Elah</italic>], torture detainees [<italic>The Road to Guantanamo, Mark of Cain</italic>], accelerate a vehicle to run over a boy playing soccer [<italic>In The Valley of Elah</italic>], wantonly kill civilians [<italic>Redacted, Haditha, The Situation</italic>] and journalists in firefights [<italic>The Situation</italic>], humiliate one another, and coolly record their own atrocities for entertainment [<italic>Redacted, In the Valley of Elah</italic>]. (p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the basis of 5 films, Packer condemns another 45. Perhaps these films stand out because they represent, each of them, events that occurred.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to make a film like <italic>The Road to Guantanamo</italic> without showing the interrogation and torture of prisoners. It would be impossible to discuss the specific rape, murder, and burning of 15-year-old Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi on March 12, 2006, and the subsequent murder of her father, mother, and 5-year-old sister, if it hadn’t actually happened (“A Soldier’s Shame,” 2006). Equally, <italic>The Battle for Haditha</italic> would look odd if we removed the reality of the 2005 civilian murders caused by
<disp-quote>
<p>a group of Marines [who] went on a shooting spree in which 24 Iraqi civilians were killed. Their patrol had been hit by a roadside bomb and one of their comrades was dead. They ordered five men out of a taxi and gunned them down. Then they went into three nearby homes and shot 19 people, including 11 women and children. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0270467612459928">Sly, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As much as Packer might want to focus elsewhere, these films are based on fact. They may have been made into pieces of antiwar or even antisoldier propaganda—De Palma’s <italic>Casualties of War</italic> (1989) similarly earned him equal measures of loathing and respect for its examination of a comparable event in the Vietnam War). De Palma’s stock in the United States likely fell further when <italic>Redacted</italic> won the Silver Lion at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, a message from what the Bush White House dubbed “Old Europe” to this “new” America.</p>
<p>If these films drew the American press’s attention while more staid films about soldiers failed at the box office, it suggests what I have been moving toward all along: that the public cannot be made to love a war for long and that these wars have gone hugely filmed but largely unseen. Soldier and deserter Joshua Key had his own response to the daily prosecution of the war, offering a counterpoint to Packer’s impassioned attack on the straw men films he constructs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0270467612459928">Key (2007)</xref> wonders,
<disp-quote>
<p>What would happen if every atrocity were compressed into the same day and the same city, still with my eyes watching and my camera at the ready[?] Then, I suspect that the total number of victims would shock and astonish Americans just as profoundly as did the discovery of the My Lai massacre. (p. 217)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The slaughter in Haditha (another one of the soldier-on-civilian stories about which we will probably never know the facts, particularly since thousands of pages of classified reports on the Haditha massacre were found dumped in a Baghdad junkyard; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0270467612459928">Schmidt, 2011</xref>) represents less than a twentieth of the murders in My Lai, but as Key points out, there are lots more to be had (in March 2012, a U.S. Army sergeant walked into a village in Afghanistan where he killed 16 people—including nine children and three women—then burned some of the bodies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0270467612459928">Vogt &amp; Khan, 2012</xref>). Had a Muslim soldier done the same in America, one can all too well imagine the reaction of the tribute industry that cranked up post-9/11, as well as opinion networks like Fox News). There are many stories from Iraq: Packer is wrong to get irritated about these—they’re true.</p>
<p>The drive to redirect the audience to happier, more conventional narratives about strong men and women who have offered everything they have or, in the endless rhetoric of the post-9/11 years, have made “the ultimate sacrifice,” is fueled by the post-Vietnam rejection of defeat as “inconceivable, so to conceive it is unpatriotic. If a film shows America winning, it is acceptable, even if there are ambiguities over the Army’s motives and the soldiers’ behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker, 2011</xref>, p. 25). Atrocity films have their own gravitic fields of attraction that draw in the viewer, robbing them of thought and speech. It is precisely expression that is needed when the Geneva Conventions are unilaterally razed, constitutional law is revised to suit White House policies and definitions of torture, and countries can be invaded without the slightest gesture toward <italic>jus ad bellum</italic>. Ahistorical atrocity films malign thousands of combat troops who acted well only if those films hang in freefall, unattached to events: Hiding war crimes is equally dire, particularly when the offenses at stake are declared to be legally part of a entire war policy, as they have been. The real problem with most atrocity films is not that they exist but that they do so in a fabular universe of good and evil instead of an infinite universe of gray areas: they aren’t tough, subtle, or real enough.</p>

<title>Degree 6: Crazily Familiar Vets</title>
<p>Of the war films that emerged from, reflected, or mined the Vietnam War, one trope that transferred unaltered to Iraq films is the “crazy” veteran. Played with bug-eyed lunacy by Bruce Dern in Hal Ashby’s 1978 <italic>Coming Home</italic>, the insane veteran was someone characterized by Michael Herr and Francis Ford Coppola as a kid “from some South Bronx shithole, and I think the light and the space of Vietnam really put the zap on his head” (<italic>Apocalypse Now!</italic> 2001, 21:37). Over the years they returned from the war, Vietnam vets began appearing in films as another dangerous example of rebellious youth. In Vietnam films like <italic>Rolling Thunder</italic> (1977), the veteran unmoored from reality is typified by William Devane (with costar Tommy Lee Jones as the even more terrifying empty-faced Master Sergeant Johnny Vohden); in Michael Cimino’s <italic>The Deer Hunter</italic> (1978) it’s Nick, played by Christopher Walken, who finds peace only by playing Russian roulette each night; in the Rambo series, the veteran remains the only sane being in a world of corruption, betrayal, and hatred of soldiers—for that, he is classified a public enemy and hunted down. The unstable, violent veteran appears in films as diverse as <italic>Apocalypse Now!</italic> (1979), <italic>Birdy</italic> (1984), <italic>Black Sunday</italic> (1977), <italic>Cutter’s Way</italic> (1981), <italic>Distant Thunder</italic> (1988), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0270467612459928"><italic>Jacknife</italic> (1989)</xref>, <italic>Platoon</italic> (1986), <italic>The Stunt Man</italic> (1980), <italic>Taxi Driver</italic> (1976), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612459928"><italic>Twilight’s Last Gleaming</italic> (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0270467612459928"><italic>When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?</italic> (1979)</xref>, <italic>Year of the Dragon</italic> (1985)—on and on and on. In these films, and particularly before the definition of PTSD began to sharpen and cast into relief what soldiers might be suffering, veterans filled the role of villain or sociopath now taken up by serial murderers or the ingenious sadists running the show in so-called “torture porn” films like the <italic>Saw</italic> (seven films to date) or <italic>Hostel</italic> (three films) franchises.</p>
<p>Worry about showing veterans in a bad light has so far kept filmmakers quiet: If George Packer feels aggrieved about five films, he should remember the dozens that used veterans in the post-Vietnam environment for their political grist. Phil Strub, the Pentagon’s film liaison, notes that
<disp-quote>
<p>“These days, there is an unwillingness to criticize individual servicemen and women, which was quite common in the Vietnam era . . . Americans are very disinclined to do that now, and we’re very glad this attitude tends to pervade all entertainment.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0270467612459928">Soriano &amp; Oldenburg, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The trope of the crazed veteran has, however, persisted. Despite an enormous increase in education about PTSD, it is still depicted as something that happens to the weak—one exception is Samuel Jackson’s character in Irvin Winkler’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0270467612459928"><italic>Home of the Brave</italic> (2006)</xref>, a doctor in denial about his own psychological illness. In films like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0270467612459928"><italic>Stop-Loss</italic> (2008)</xref>, while the hero may doubt the war, he is no coward and never considers suicide, unlike the group’s weak link, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt. The soldiers’ heroism is underscored when they choose to return to Iraq—they are strong in their war faith, or certainty in America. The films that fall into the category of unhinged veteran overlap, as most do, with others: Classifying a film inevitably does its subtleties a disservice. Most films operate on multiple planes, even ones that appear (<italic>Divergence, Badland</italic>) to be reduced to one or two. With those caveats in mind, the films that draw most heavily on the crazed-veteran genre include <italic>Badland</italic> (2007), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0270467612459928"><italic>Brothers</italic> (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0270467612459928"><italic>Essential Killing</italic> (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0270467612459928"><italic>G.I.

<p>Some films propose that the returning veteran has been driven insane by war, although the soldiers threaten only themselves, not the community at large. The oddest of these is <italic>Time Bomb</italic>, in which an addled veteran cannot determine what is real: At the text’s heart is one sure thing—his young son has burned to death in an accident. His guilt about this tragedy coupled with war trauma produces a series of paranoid fantasies, perhaps realities, involving evil civilian scientists who are either using soldiers’ bodies for an organ trade or figuring out how to kill men by causing their self-combustion. If the film is unconvincing, it recalls a number of surreal classics from the American New Wave, particularly <italic>Easy Rider</italic> (1969), <italic>ElectraGlide in Blue</italic> (1973), and <italic>Vanishing Point</italic> (1971)—the intriguing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0270467612459928"><italic>G.I. Jesus</italic> (2006)</xref> is of the same genre.</p>
<p>Veterans who attack the community are more numerous, exemplified by John Leguizamo’s “Mr. Wolf,” a discharged, decorated sergeant with 15 years of military service who, with his loyal soldiers, stages a robbery at a major downtown bank in Pittsburgh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0270467612459928"><italic>The Kill Point</italic>, 2007</xref>). The affair soon deteriorates into a drawn-out hostage debacle. Trapped inside the bank, Mr. Wolf begins negotiating for terms with nonveteran but experienced police captain Horst Cali, played by Donnie Walhberg. The series (it was aired as eight episodes on Spike TV in 2007) follows the predictable relations that develop inside the bank, while the encoded intelligent “good guy” negotiator (he has a pregnant wife, makes sure to shave, corrects other people’s grammar) struggles to find a way to rescue the hostages. Some hostages seem to have been hoping for a bank robbery all their lives, they fall so quickly into the Stockholm syndrome. The center of the piece is a long monologue delivered convincingly by Leguizamo. As with the rest of the series, every gesture rests on some previous film or television moment, particularly Wolf’s speech to the watching crowd, a performance that nearly loses its head nodding to Al Pacino’s famous “Attica” scene in Sidney Lumet’s 1975 <italic>Dog Day Afternoon</italic>. However, unlike Pacino’s characterization of Sonny Wortzik based on the actual bank robber John Wojtowicz, the fictional Mr. Wolf not only knows SWAT (special weapons and tactics) tactics and hostage-taking protocols, he is a successful military commander who is cool under fire. The text plays a game with both the police captain and the audience: Is Wolf’s real desire to air his political message or to steal money? Although money is Sonny and Sal’s goal in <italic>Dog Day Afternoon</italic>, the robbery is automatically politicized (especially in the context of 1975) because Wortzik seeks money for a sex change operation. When Mr. Wolf emerges from the bank he takes his case directly to a growing legion of onlookers, and there he makes his stand:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see you up there, Snipes. I’m lookin’ at you, SWAT. Uniforms. I know what you’re thinking about me, man. I’ve been here before. I’ve had guns pointed at me many times. It’s not new to me, I know the fear. Go ahead. You wanna shoot me? Go ahead, man, shoot me. Go ahead. Look I’ll give you an easy target, man, look, come on [takes off shirt, pants—he’s covered in burn and shrapnel scars] Go ahead, come on. Go ahead. Shoot me. Like they did in Fallujah, man. Or you know what? How about here? How about here, like that shrapnel blast in Baghdad. Go ahead, shoot me. Come on, go ahead [snipers lower their weapons]. What are you waiting for? ‘Cause I love my country, man. I fought for my country and I would die for my country. You think I wanted to end up here? Huh? You think I wanted guns in my face again, man? No way. No freakin’ way. But I came home to sickness and nightmares. You know, when I close my eyes, you know what I see? I see the faces of the soldiers and civilians that I killed, that’s what I see. I spoke to my captain and he makes me talk to a shrink, who doesn’t know shit. And then the goddamn government, smokes me out with their lies and away goes my pension. Away goes my medical. And if my wife gets sick, who’s gonna pay for it, huh? Who’s gonna pay? I pay! [gestures to crowd of onlookers] We pay! I served my country, man. I served—15 years I gave. 15 years! Who’s gonna protect me? Who’s gonna protect me, huh? Who? So I started this and look where I am, man. Look where I am. Back in the firing line. So maybe you should shoot me, go ahead. Maybe you should shoot me. I’d rather die than go to jail, that’s for damn sure. I didn’t spill my blood for this country for freedom, to have it taken away when I came home. I got some demands ‘cause they took everything away from me, okay? I want antibiotics because I’ve got injured in there. And I want a flak jacket for every soldier in Iraq! ‘Cause our stupid-ass government doesn’t think that they’re necessary! And I want the son of every Senator who voted Yes for this war to sign up for active duty. You get me those things, and I’ll leave here. I’ll ask for a bus and a chopper, and I’ll disappear. Got that? [cheering and applause from crowd] [to police Captain] Don’t ever breach again, man. ‘Cause you know what’s at stake and I know how to play. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0270467612459928"><italic>The Kill Point</italic>, 2007</xref>, Episode 1, 42:00)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sergeant’s performance is so sure, so certain, that it impresses the crowd, and the police lose the moral high ground, which has been seized by the war itself, and the attendant injustice of the way the government treats the troops. The sergeant addresses the troops first by specialty and murderousness (the sniper and SWAT teams, both of which are anxious to roll in for a kill), letting them know he “sees them” and understands what they’re capable of, then the regular uniformed officers. He understands them as a tribe, angry with him because a number of them have been killed by his own troops. He constructs the meeting as ritual combat, calling out the enemy to play fair, to level the field, and closes with game imagery. He makes himself completely vulnerable, stripping off his shirt and pants, showings his scars and burns so as to emphasize the degree to which the state has used and discarded his body. For the receptive crowd, what Wolf wants is reasonable: medication for the sick, protection for the fighters, and class equality during wartime service. Wolf’s lecture takes its cues from the famous question Specialist Thomas Wilson posed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2004, asking, “Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles and why don’t we have those resources readily available to us?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0270467612459928">Suarez, 2004</xref>). Wolf’s monologue connects the problem of “hillbilly armor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0270467612459928">Raddatz &amp; Cerre, 2004</xref>) with the suggestion that elected officials’ offspring should serve, driven home by Michael Moore’s in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0270467612459928"><italic>Fahrenheit 9/11</italic> (2004)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0270467612459928">12</xref></sup> What Wolf suggests is hardly a cry against the establishment—rather, it supports it. A career soldier in league with other soldiers, Wolf fights for his own against an enemy (the government) that doesn’t care about or for the little people who do its bidding. The problem is not with the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, or the irony that while soldiers are treated badly, they are expected to treat enemy combatants worse. Rather, the abuse written in scar tissue on Wolf’s body graphs the problem: Torture is the governing discourse, but the soldiers don’t understand they, too, are its subject.</p>
<p>Unlike Sonny Wortzik’s enraged repetition of the rallying cry “Attica” as he finds himself beset by hordes of uniforms, Wolf calls for a stronger police force. The idea that Wolf isn’t in it just for the money occurs to the SWAT captain in a later episode, when she wonders aloud: “Maybe Wolf’s political agenda isn’t bullshit? And if that’s the case, we’re back to zero.” Her problematic question is capped off by deputy chief Abrami, who lectures her: “Let’s worry about what this means after we get this contained, okay?” (<italic>The Kill Point</italic>, Episode 5, 12:29) Abrami’s comment speaks to both the hostage taking and war itself: We’ll worry about what we’re doing in Iraq and Afghanistan once it’s “contained,” the kind of vague bureaucratic language that could well mean “once the troops are home,” assuming that means the war is over. Perhaps the bank operates as a larger metaphor for corporate America’s treatment of its soldiers: Like Rambo before them, they must seize control of their own fortunes and hold civilians hostage until the wars can be fought properly. Perhaps Wolf shouldn’t release his hostages until the wars are concluded. While Wolf appears to be the ghost of desperate veterans past, he is truly a model citizen, just as John Rambo was, and is again by the end of the fourth film when he returns to the family farm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0270467612459928"><italic>Rambo</italic>, 2008</xref>). The only villains in <italic>The Kill Point</italic> are greedy ex-soldiers who have become mercenaries. If the film has its crazy veterans, it is also staunchly prosoldier.</p>
<p>Eberwein (2009) argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>Two of the four major war films of 1978 [<italic>Coming Home</italic> and <italic>The Deer Hunter</italic>] . . . accounted for eight Oscars, six in major categories. This suggests something about the anguished mood of the country in regard to the Vietnam War close to the time of US defeat . . . They are in effect the repressed of the Vietnam War, the films that didn’t get made during the conflict. (p. 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the films I group here, the veteran is much more sinned against than sinning—many are utterly at the mercy of external forces, usually civilian bureaucracies that have no sense of obligation toward the men and women who have fought. While some of the soldiers may commit crimes of abuse against their families, they are still shown to have good cause, struggling with what they’ve seen and done. Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612459928">Barker (2011)</xref> points out about them, “No matter how crude, misogynistic and racist the soldiers may appear when seen off-duty, the moment they step out onto the streets of Iraq they become innocent, bewildered and desperate” (pp. 32-33): The same is true at home. The soldier is, except as characterized in the films that so gore George Packer’s ox (<italic>Battle for Haditha, Redacted, In the Valley of Elah</italic>), a sacred individual who remains honored and honorable. Barker continues by noting that the soldiers’ “brutality simply [is] a mistake arising out of stress and sickness” (p. 32). The issue is not a soldier’s guilt but rather the adoption and reversal of the Vietnam film trope. Where Vietnam veterans on film are often detached, amoral killers like <italic>Taxi Driver</italic>’s Travis Bickle, who understands himself to be “God’s lonely man,” Iraq war veterans on film are in good company and have been befriended, even when they’re not very friendly, by the American public. In a potentially resistant text like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0270467612459928"><italic>The Messenger</italic> (2009)</xref>, what prevents the widow Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton) from beginning a relationship with Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) is the fact that once her cruel soldier husband is dead, she remembers the man she had fallen in love with, and must mourn him. The audience is given no reason to lament his death: By her account he was abusive to her and her child, hurt, and in pain. Still, the film stands by the soldiers, even the dissolute, troubled Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who brings the living news of the dead. Veterans may be dysfunctional, but they are certainly no worse than the aimless, wandering civilians around them.</p>

<p>In an earlier article, I considered the significance of the coverage of Princess Diana’s death outstripping all news stories published about World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0270467612459928">Blackmore, 2004</xref>, p. 48).

Zuckerman compares the relative attention paid by the media to a famine in the Horn of Africa with celebrity Kim Kardashian on any given day. Where the famine flatlines at 1 Kardashian (a high score), Kardashian herself averages 20 Kardashians per day (even Angelina Jolie rates only about 9 Kardashians daily). The infamous Joseph Kony video (100 million views on YouTube) about the Lord’s Resistance Army clocked a mere 7.7 Kardashians at its peak; Kardashian’s announced divorce in October 2011 and June 2012 Oprah appearance each drew 100 Kardashians. As whimsical as such a proposed metric might appear, it is a keen indicator of how serious news issues fare when rated against celebrity events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0270467612459928">Zuckerman, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>It’s worth saying, after all this time, that <italic>all</italic> the wars America has been involved in have been problematic. World War II is invariably used as an example of “the good war,” as Studs Terkel ironically named it in his 1984 oral history of a war that, it turned out, wasn’t the unified “good” thing people thought it had been. As more narratives emerge, it is increasingly difficult to say that any war is “good” or that it was fought for one reason only. The Vietnam War appeared to end the long narrative of American exceptionalism, but perhaps that was only a bump in the road—a 25-year, 58,000 (American) dead, 2 to 3 million Vietnamese dead, bump.</p>
