<abstract>
<p>Technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) is a conceptual framework for the teacher knowledge necessary to effectively integrate technology into teaching and learning. The purposes of this study were to (a) develop and administer an instrument to measure music educators’ TPACK, (b) examine how music teachers acquire their TPACK, and (c) determine if a relationship existed between those teachers’ TPACK and their reported integration of technology. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 284) were music teachers who completed two questionnaires, one designed to measure their TPACK (Musical TPACK Questionnaire [MTPACK-Q]) and another to describe the level of technology integration in their classroom (Concerns-Based Adoption Model–Levels of Use [CBAM-LoU] instrument). Scores on the technology-related domains of the TPACK model were lower than content, pedagogical, or pedagogical content domains. A moderate, significant, positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .51, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) was found between the participants’ MTPACK-Q score and the level of technology integration in their classroom as reported by the CBAM-LoU.</p>

<p>Technology can be an effective tool to facilitate student learning. When used appropriately, instruction that uses technology has been documented to provide small to moderate gains in student achievement over non-technology-based teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712457881">Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami,&amp; Schmid, 2011</xref>). Technology also appears to make it possible for students to exert more control over their own learning, leading to more student-centered instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712457881">Russell &amp;Sorge, 1999</xref>). Tony Bryk, the president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, is cautious, but he believes that technology can be an asset to education. He states, “There is extraordinary promise in being able to use multimedia tools to enhance the capacity of teachers to teach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712457881">Jaschik, 2008</xref>). Bryk believes teachers need to consider “how we can integrate technology effectively into the work lives of adults and students that advance much more ambitious instruction and higher levels and deeper learning by students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712457881">Jaschik, 2008</xref>). He also expresses a common fear for some educators, that technology could result in education being “reduced to a very mechanical activity.” The challenge is for teachers to use technology in pedagogically appropriate ways to help students achieve curricular objectives.</p>
<p>Although there have been a number of studies of innovative approaches to music learning with technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712457881">Webster, 2011</xref>), few researchers have examined the integration of technology into music classes and rehearsals. A consistent finding of the extant research has been that most music educators are not extensively using technology, especially for instruction. In an early national study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712457881">Taylor and Deal (2000)</xref> learned that music teachers were making use of technology for administrative purposes—letters, memos, student handouts, programs, flyers, and so on—but found few curricular applications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712457881">Dorfman (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712457881">Jassmann (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083712457881">Ohlenbusch (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083712457881">Reese and Rimington (2000)</xref> have reported similar accounts. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712457881">Dorfman (2008)</xref> asked teachers how frequently they used various technologies for their own professional productivity, few teachers indicated <italic>regular use</italic> of a computer for (a) writing or arranging music—18%, (b) creating music with a sequencer—3%, (c) recording live performances—7%, (d) burning CDs—21%, (e) accompaniment—12%, and (f) multimedia presentations—7%. These music educators had students use technology as part of formal instructional activities even less, with only very small numbers reporting regular student use of the computer for (a) writing or arranging music—4%, (b) creating music with a sequencer—2%, (c) recording live performances—2%, (d) burning CDs—4%, (e) accompaniment—3%, (f) multimedia presentations—2%, and (g) computer-assisted instruction applications—7%. The music educators rated their own general level of comfort with technology fairly high but were more moderate in their expressed competence with music-specific technologies. Although most of the respondents indicated interest in integrating technology into their teaching, they cited inadequate budgets and facilities as barriers to doing so.</p>
<p>This apparent lack of technology integration into music teaching and learning comes at the same time as state boards of education, accrediting organizations such as the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncate.org">http://ncate.org</ext-link>) and Teacher Education Accreditation Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.teac.org/">http://www.teac.org/</ext-link>), and professional organizations such as the International Society for Technology in Education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iste.org/">http://www.iste.org/</ext-link>) are advocating increasing emphasis on the use of technology by teachers. Similar efforts in music education have led to technology competencies for music teachers, such as those outlined by the Technology Institute for Music Educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057083712457881">Rudolph et al., 2005</xref>). The National Association for Music Education has also established standards for using music technology, outlining curriculum and scheduling, staffing, equipment, materials/ software, and facilities requirements for effective technology integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083712457881">MENC, 1999</xref>). Even secondary school principals have indicated an interest in additional technology course offerings in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712457881">Abril &amp; Gault, 2008</xref>). With such an emphasis on the use of technology, it seems that possible reasons why it is not more fully used by music teachers should be explored.</p>
<sec id="section1-1057083712457881">
<title>Teaching and Technology</title>
<p>Teaching is a very complex act, requiring teachers to use many different types of knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083712457881">Mishra and Koehler (2006)</xref> describe teaching as “ill-structured” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083712457881">2006</xref>, p. 1020) and label it as a “wicked problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712457881">Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2008</xref>, p. 10), a phrase originating in social planning used to describe a problem that is difficult to solve because of a variety of factors, including incomplete or contradictory information and no clear path to a solution being evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712457881">Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973</xref>). The teaching environment is very contextual and constantly changing. There are no recipes or algorithms for teaching that will work for every teacher, in every classroom, with every group of students, on every day of the week. Rather, excellent teachers are constantly making decisions, adapting, and adjusting in an ongoing manner during any instructional episode.</p>
<p>Adding the use of technology to the mix creates a whole other set of concerns. Although many technologies in today’s classrooms are <italic>transparent</italic>—things such as chalkboards and overhead projectors have become commonplace and are usually not even considered technology—some characteristics of newer, digital technologies may cause many teachers to be apprehensive about incorporating them into their classroom routines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712457881">Koehler and Mishra (2008)</xref> describe recent technologies such as computers to be <italic>protean</italic>—usable in many different ways, <italic>unstable</italic>—they change quickly, and <italic>opaque</italic>—exactly how they work cannot be easily determined. In contrast, traditional technologies such as the chalkboard are <italic>specific</italic>—they have a well-defined use, <italic>stable</italic>—they do not change much over time, and <italic>transparent</italic>—it is easy to understand how they function. In addition, all technologies have certain affordances (benefits) and constraints (limiting features). Teachers must conduct a cost/benefit analysis to determine if the use of any particular technology is worthwhile. Technology should only be incorporated when there is a clear benefit to learning.</p>

<title>Pedagogical Content Knowledge</title>
<p>For teachers to effectively help students learn, they need to have well-developed subject matter knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and an understanding of curriculum. In addition to the discrete competencies required in each of these domains, each area also interacts and influences the others, forming what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712457881">Shulman (1986)</xref> has called <italic>pedagogical content knowledge</italic> (PCK). PCK involves having an expert understanding of a discipline, along with the ability to communicate that understanding to others through a variety of pedagogical processes that account for the unique characteristics of both students and various educational contexts. Shulman defined it thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>The most regularly taught topics in one’s subject area, the most useful forms of representations of those ideas, the most powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and demonstrations – in a word, ways of representing and formulating the subject that make it comprehensible to others. Pedagogical content knowledge also includes an understanding of what makes the learning of specific topics easy or difficult: the conceptions and preconceptions that students of different ages and backgrounds bring with them to the learning of those most frequently taught topics and lessons. If those preconceptions are misconceptions, which they so often are, teachers need knowledge of the strategies most likely to be fruitful in reorganizing the understanding of learners, because those learners are unlikely to appear before them as blank slates. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>PCK is unique to each discipline. In other words, the music teacher will use a form of PCK that is different from the math teacher, English teacher, science teacher, and so on.</p>
<p>If technology is to be an integral part of teaching and learning, it would seem logical that teachers need not only well-developed PCK but also an understanding of technology itself and how it interacts with PCK. Technology, if conceptualized as a tool to be used to further curricular goals rather than as an end in itself, becomes a third component of the pedagogical and content knowledge dyad.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Integrating technology is not about technology—it is primarily about content and effective instructional practices. Technology involves the tools with which we deliver content and implement practices in better ways. Its focus must be on curriculum and learning. Integration is defined not by the amount or type of technology used, but by how and why it is used. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712457881">Earle, 2002</xref>, p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Technology makes the complexities of teaching even more <italic>wicked</italic>. What is needed is a way to both conceptualize and actualize the knowledge, skills, and dispositions educators need to be able to effectively integrate technology into teaching and learning.</p>

<title>Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge</title>
<p>Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712457881">Shulman’s (1986)</xref> ideas, some researchers have developed a hybrid model of teaching and learning with technology.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Previous approaches to helping teachers learn to take advantage of technology have focused on teaching teachers about technology. We believed (erroneously, as the research increasingly indicates) that after teachers learned to use technology, they would naturally figure out how to use the technology to teach their content area. What is clear now is that we need to go beyond simplistic technocentric approaches because knowledge of technology does not necessarily lead to effective teaching with technology. Effective use of technology, we have learned, involves the ability to make informed decisions on how to take advantage of the affordances of technology (with a sensitivity to the concomitant constraints technologies bring to the table) to support specific pedagogies within a particular content area. Thus, teachers need the total PACKage: the knowledge that lies at the intersection of knowledge of Content, Pedagogy AND Technology i.e., TPACK. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712457881">Thompson &amp; Mishra, 2007-2008</xref>, p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1057083712457881">Figure 1</xref>) provides a way to conceptualize how technology can be effectively integrated into teaching and learning. Technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge are each necessary. However, it is the way they overlap and interact that potentially affects a teacher’s choices of the type of technology, the pedagogies used, and even the specific content to be taught. The TPACK framework has the potential to take the focus off technology itself and place it on ways in which technology might assist students in achieving curricular goals. Teachers who have an understanding of the specific content and pedagogical needs for a subject can then examine the affordances and constraints of any particular technology, making appropriate decisions as to how to use the technology appropriately.</p>

<p>Technology can be a beneficial tool for learning. Yet music teachers do not extensively use technology for instruction. TPACK is a conceptual framework for the teacher knowledge necessary to effectively integrate technology into teaching and learning. If music educators have well-developed TPACK, would they be more likely to use technology with students? The purposes of this study were to (a) develop and administer an instrument to measure music educators’ TPACK, (b) examine how music teachers acquire their TPACK, and (c) determine if a relationship existed between those teachers’ TPACK and their reported integration of technology.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section5-1057083712457881">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 284 music educators who were enrolled in 1-week music technology workshops held in 17 separate locations throughout the United States. The participants, who were 48% male and 52% female, came from 26 states. Their teaching experience ranged from 1 to 40 years (<italic>M</italic> = 12.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.48) and they held bachelor’s (48%), master’s (48%), and doctoral degrees (2%). The teachers worked in both public (89%) and private schools (11%) and were located in rural (15%), suburban (59%), or urban (26%) settings. They taught in all areas of music education, including band (43%), strings (18%), choral (41%), elementary general (36%), secondary general (29%), and other music areas (19%). The teachers also represented all grade levels, K–12 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1057083712457881">Table 1</xref>). Near the beginning of their workshop, the participants completed an online questionnaire that incorporated two measurement instruments (see the following section).</p>

<title>Measurement Instruments</title>
<p>Two measurement instruments were used in this study: the Concerns-Based Adoption Model–Levels of Use (CBAM-LoU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712457881">Griffin &amp; Christensen, 1999</xref>) instrument and the researcher-designed Musical TPACK Questionnaire (MTPACK-Q). The CBAM-LoU is a self-assessment measure for use in ascertaining the level of technology use in education. It is based on the eight levels of use defined in the Levels of Use Chart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083712457881">Loucks, Newlove, &amp; Hall, 1975</xref>). The levels of use are as follows: (0) Nonuse, (I) Orientation, (II) Preparation, (III) Mechanical Use, (IVA) Routine, (IVB) Refinement, (V) Integration, and (VI) Renewal. The respondent selects a single level that best describes his or her present level of technology use.</p>
<p>The MTPACK-Q, developed by the researcher, was constructed in three parts and is based on two existing questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712457881">Bauer, Forsythe, &amp; Kinney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712457881">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). The first part of the MTPACK-Q sought to measure the various components, separate and combined, that comprise TPACK in music teachers. The basis for this part of the questionnaire was a survey developed by Schmidt et al. to measure the various TPACK domains of preservice teachers. These domains are created by the intersections of technology, content, and pedagogical knowledge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1057083712457881">Figure 1</xref>) and include (a) technology knowledge (TK), (b) content knowledge (CK), (c) pedagogical knowledge (PK), (d) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), (e) technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), (f) technological content knowledge (TCK), and (g) technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK). For the MTPACK-Q, the researcher used the TK, PK, and TPK sections of the original survey. The sections of the Schmidt et al. survey that included questions related to content were adapted to reflect musical content, specifically the musical domains of creating, performing, and responding to music. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1057083712457881">Table 2</xref> for examples of questions from each TPACK domain.</p>

<p>The second part of the MTPACK-Q examined respondents’ paths to the development of various components of their TPACK. This portion of the instrument was modeled on a professional development survey created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712457881">Bauer et al. (2009)</xref>. It asked participants to indicate the ways they had acquired their current understanding of the various TPACK domains: (a) technology (TK), (b) music (CK), (c) generalized approaches to teaching (PK), (d) music-specific approaches for teaching (PCK), (e) technologies that are used in music (TCK), (f) generalized approaches for teaching with technology (TPK), and strategies for combining music, technology, and teaching and learning strategies (TPACK). Possible responses included participation in conferences, summer workshops, local in-services, online learning, learning informally with a friend or mentor, learning through self-exploration, and undergraduate and graduate courses. The final part of the questionnaire collected demographic information on the participants.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Responses for each TPACK component in the first part of the questionnaire were summed to provide a score for each of the TPACK domains. These values were then tallied to arrive at an overall TPACK score. The raw domain scores were converted to a percentile score (raw score divided by total possible score) in order to determine the relative strength of each TPACK component (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1057083712457881">Table 3</xref>). Finally, the percentile scores were ranked from highest to lowest. They were (a) PK (85.71%), (b) CK (85.07%), (c) PCK (81.95%), (d) TCK (76.60%), (e) TPK (75.20%), (f) TPACK (72.95%), and (g) TK (70.63%). Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for each of the TPACK domain subscales. Reliability of the seven subscales ranged from .87 to .95 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1057083712457881">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Part 2 of the questionnaire examined how participants developed the various components of their TPACK. Respondents were asked to check all the options that they had used to learn in each domain. The frequency of responses was tallied and divided by the total number of respondents to arrive at a percentage of respondents who had selected each option. The top ways respondents reported learning about technology (i.e., TK) were (a) by exploring on their own (81%), (b) summer workshops (69.4%), and (c) music education conferences and conventions (68.3%). Learning about music (i.e., CK) was accomplished through (a) music education conferences and conventions (82.7%), (b) undergraduate courses (81%), and (c) exploring on their own (80.6%). Participants developed their understanding of generalized approaches to teaching (i.e., PK) as a result of (a) in-services held in their school district (70.4%), (b) music education conferences and conventions (67.3%), and (c) undergraduate courses (61.6%). Primary approaches used to acquire music-specific approaches for teaching (i.e., PCK) were (a) music education conferences and conventions (77.8%), (b) undergraduate courses (76.4%), and (c) exploring on their own (67.6%). Teachers reported learning about technologies that are used in music (i.e., TCK) through (a) exploring on their own (59.5%), (b) music education conferences and conventions (58.8%), and (c) summer workshops (55.6%). Generalized approaches for teaching with technology (i.e., TPK) were attained by (a) exploring on their own (64.8%), (b) in-services held in their school districts (58.5%), and (c) learning informally from a friend or mentor (42.6%). Finally, the top ways respondents reported learning about strategies for combining music, technology, and teaching and learning strategies that assist students in learning music concepts and skills (i.e., TPACK) were (a) exploring on their own (57%), (b) music education conferences and conventions (53.9%), and (c) summer workshops (47.9%).</p>
<p>In addition to the MTPACK-Q, respondents also completed the CBAM-LoU. Here, participants placed themselves at one of eight possible levels (from low to high) that represented their present level of technology use. The sixth level (IVB: Refinement—“I vary the use of information technology in education to increase the expected benefits within the classroom. I am working on using information technology to maximize the effects with my students”) was the response most frequently selected. The mean level selected was 5.31, with a standard deviation of 1.87.</p>
<p>A Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient was calculated to determine if there was any relationship between participants’ reported level of technology use and their overall MTPACK-Q score. A moderate, positive, significant (<italic>r</italic> = .51, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) correlation was found between the two variables. The higher the participants’ MTPACK-Q score was, the higher their reported level of technology use tended to be. A Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient was also calculated to determine if there was any relationship between participants’ reported level of technology use and their score on the TPACK subscale of the MTPACK-Q. A moderate, positive, significant (<italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) correlation was found between the two variables. The higher the participants’ TPACK subscale score was, the higher their reported level of technology use tended to be.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The sample in this study was diverse, including music educators who (a) encompassed a wide range of years of teaching experience, (b) were from multiple geographic locations, and (c) represented a variety of music teaching specialties and settings. Anecdotally, after many years of teaching similar workshops, the author has found that the in-service teachers who enroll in professional development experiences such as these vary greatly in skill and experience with technology and exhibit disparate attitudes toward its integration into music classes and rehearsals. They are not necessarily technologically inclined or savvy. However, it should be kept in mind that the participants in this study were volunteers who had chosen to enroll in technology workshops that were designed to develop basic competencies in using technology for music learning. They were not randomly selected from the population of all music educators. Although there is no evidence that the participants as a group were atypical as to their backgrounds, experiences, or attitudes toward music education or technology, caution should be used when generalizing the results of this study to the profession at large. Despite this possible limitation, it does appear that the general principles of TPACK have merit as a conceptual model for the integration of technology into music classes and rehearsals, as a potential framework for the design of professional development experiences for pre- and in-service music teachers, and as a theoretical construct for research.</p>
<p>Participants rated themselves as strongest in their PK—85.71%, closely followed by their knowledge about music (i.e., CK—85.07%) and PCK—81.95% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1057083712457881">Table 3</xref>). It is not surprising that PK, CK, and PCK were the highest rated of the TPACK domains. These areas are focused on extensively in undergraduate music education curricula. In addition, teachers typically engage in many professional development opportunities that serve to develop these competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712457881">Bauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712457881">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). TK, however, received the lowest score of any of the MTPACK-Q subscales (70.63%). Subscale scores for other domains that included technology (TCK—76.60%, TPK—75.20%, and TPACK—72.95%) also were rated lower. Clearly, the technology component was the weakest aspect of the TPACK triad (technology, content, and pedagogy) for these teachers. These lower technology domain scores seem to align with previous researchers’ findings of minimal technology integration by music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712457881">Dorfman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712457881">Jassmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083712457881">Ohlenbusch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083712457881">Reese &amp; Rimington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712457881">Taylor &amp; Deal, 2000</xref>) and raise the question of the degree to which inadequate TK, TCK, TPK, and TPACK affect music educators’ use of technology. This topic needs further inquiry.</p>
<p>To acquire and develop their TPACK, these music educators used a number of approaches. Although undergraduate coursework was cited as being influential in the development of CK, PK, and PCK, less than a third of the respondents indicated that their preservice curriculum was a means to develop any of the TPACK domains that included technology. Some of this may be related to when the participants completed their undergraduate education. Those teachers who graduated more recently may have had classes that focused on developing technological knowledge and its integration into teaching and learning, whereas older music educators may not have had such coursework. Or it may be that most undergraduate curricula do not provide students with the background necessary to effectively integrate technology. Additional studies in this area would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the top means of learning about all four of the domains that include technology (TK, TCK, TPK, TPACK) was through self-exploration. Similar results have been reported in studies of technology integration in general education, where researchers have found that teachers’ use of technology is dependent on them having acquired the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes, often through self-study or formalized professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712457881">Baylor &amp; Ritchie, 2002</xref>). It appears that if teachers have access to technological tools and are able to explore and become comfortable with them, they will not only develop their TPACK but also may be more likely to attempt to use the technologies in the teaching/learning process. It could also be that because of a lack of formal learning opportunities related to technology, those educators who are most interested and motivated to discover ways to integrate it into their instructional practice take the time to explore the possibilities on their own.</p>
<p>Music education conferences and conventions were an important means of acquiring understandings in nearly all of the TPACK domains. Summer workshops figured prominently in several of them, especially those that include technology. Conferences, conventions, and workshops are an important means of professional development for music educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712457881">Bauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712457881">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). Those individuals responsible for planning and organizing them should be sure to include sessions that assist teachers in developing their understanding of technology, ways in which specific technologies are suited to the achievement of curricular objectives, and appropriate pedagogies for use with students in varied music learning environments.</p>
<p>A moderate, yet significant, positive relationship was found between the participants’ TPACK subscale scores and their level of technology integration as measured by the CBAM-LoU, as well as between their MTPACK-Q total score and CBAM-LoU level. It appears that the higher a teacher’s TPACK, the more likely it will be that he or she will use technology for student learning. However, the strength of the correlation suggests that there may be additional factors that also affect a teacher’s use of technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712457881">Dorfman (2008)</xref> found that inadequate budgets and facilities were perceived as barriers to technology integration, whereas others have cited a lack of computers and inadequate technical support, along with insufficient professional development, as inhibiting elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057083712457881">National Education Association, 2008</xref>). Perhaps these or other variables also influenced decisions about incorporating technology in the classrooms of the music educators in the present study. Further research is needed.</p>
<p>TPACK appears to be a promising model to better understand the knowledge and skills needed by teachers to effectively integrate technology in to teaching and learning. Further study of the most effective and efficient means of developing musical TPACK is needed. Additional ways to assess an individual’s TPACK should also be examined. If music teachers have a fully developed understanding of the affordances and constraints of various technologies, and have thoughtfully considered ways in which those technologies interact with musical content, pedagogy, and the classroom environment, students may benefit from approaches to music study that can potentially enhance and even transform their learning experience.</p>
