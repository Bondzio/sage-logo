<body>
<p>Soft tissue defects located on the palmar surface of the proximal interphalangeal joint can result in a severe disability of the finger.</p>
<p>The recent knowledge of the vascular anatomy of the finger has identified the presence of three dorsal branches of the proper digital artery that constitute the vascular system of the dorsal skin covering the proximal phalanx.</p>
<p>The ‘transposition flap’ described by Zhang et al. is based on the first dorsal branch (FDB) and its reverse sub-branch. The size of the FDB is about 0.3 mm and it appears quite difficult to identify and mark out the course of this small vessel with ultrasound Doppler. The Authors recommend using another flap when there is no Doppler sound. I agree, particularly if there are concomitant injuries to the dorsal or volar aspect of the finger and in the presence of crush or avulsion injuries.</p>
<p>The article provides a clear well-written guide to the design and raising of the flap, in particular in relation to its vascular anatomy. As the origin of the FDB is located 14–19 mm of distance proximal from the proximal interphalangeal joint this represents a more reliable anatomical point than Doppler evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as stressed by the Authors, it is very important to keep the paratenon intact when a dorsal finger flap is harvested.</p>
<p>The aesthetic result at the donor site result can be quite unattractive, as shown in Figure 3 of Zhang et al. The mean soft tissue defect in this series is about 1.7 × 2 cm. These types of defects could also be treated with a reverse dorsal metacarpal flaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469144">Gregory et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469144">Onishi and Maruyama, 2006</xref>). The donor site would be closed primarily, but for the Authors a linear scar located on the dorsum of the hand is less pleasing than a skin grafted donor site, despite hyperpigmentation at the donor site in 60% of their cases.</p>
<p>Overall I believe that this is an interesting article and that this transposition flap represents another surgical option for treating these types of defects, although probably not the first choice.</p>
