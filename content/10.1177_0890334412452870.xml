<p>Wouldn’t it be great if there were unanimous support for the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in your institution? Unfortunately, the process of becoming designated as “Baby-Friendly” is often complicated by the need to change some long-standing beliefs and practices that interfere with breastfeeding. This issue’s Research Spotlight describes the results of focus groups conducted with Australian health care providers, describing their views of BFHI implementation. Taking their research to the next level, Schmied and colleagues interpret their findings using an “adoption of innovation” model, based on the work of Greenhalgh and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412452870">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study used qualitative research methods to understand health care providers’ perceptions of implementing the BFHI. The authors recruited health care providers (N = 132) from 4 maternity hospitals pursuing BFHI designation and 2 neonatal intensive care units to participate in 1 of 10 focus groups (5 for midwives, 2 for neonatal nurses, 2 for community-based child and family health nurses, and 1 for infant feeding clinical leaders [International Board Certified Lactation Consultants]). Each focus group lasted approximately 1 hour, and all were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The research team analyzed the transcripts using thematic analysis. They developed codes to identify themes and subthemes and selected representative quotes for each theme.</p>
<p>Three key themes were identified. The first, “belief and commitment,” reflects the overall positive attitude that the providers expressed toward BFHI. They reported favorable perceptions of the BFHI, because of the health benefits to women, infants, and society. In addition, they felt that becoming Baby-Friendly would improve the reputation of their maternity services, making their hospital the preferred location for childbirth, because of the exemplary breastfeeding support. As an added benefit, all staff members would consistently provide the same breastfeeding advice. This would minimize the need to correct misinformation provided by less informed peers.</p>
<p>The second theme, “interpreting BFHI,” addresses the ways in which staff would explain BFHI to a novice. The responses identified breastfeeding as “the normal way to feed a baby,” a global initiative, and included mention of the Ten Steps. However, reservations about BFHI were expressed, with concerns that staff would feel coerced into adopting BFHI practices, that the program would pressure women to breastfeed, or that parents could not make an informed decision to formula feed.</p>
<p>The final theme, “climbing a mountain,” characterizes the difficulties experienced in changing practices and attitudes while working toward BFHI designation. Participants expressed concerns regarding resistance to change, time constraints based on their patient load, the use of formulas as a “solution” to their time constraints, and institutional pressure to discharge patients quickly. The providers did point out, however, that some of the Ten Steps were more easily achieved than others. They felt that the requirement for skin-to-skin contact (step 4) saved staff time, since the mother and baby were content and safe together. Most of the institutions in this region had also adopted 24-hour rooming-in (step 7) and no longer routinely supplied pacifiers (step 9), so these steps were not seen as barriers.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledged the limitations of their research. Like most qualitative research, this study has limited external validity, since the participants were drawn from a single Area Health Service in New South Wales, Australia. In addition, the focus groups did not include other relevant clinicians (ie, pediatricians, obstetricians, peer counselors, community-based health providers) or new mothers. Despite these limitations, this article provides unique insights into key aspects of BFHI implementation, as perceived by hospital staff.</p>
<p>Typical qualitative studies would conclude here, but Schmied and colleagues have used their discussion to interpret their findings within the framework of a model that evaluates how an innovation’s characteristics affect its adoption. This model is based on the work of Greenhalgh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412452870">1</xref></sup> and highlights 9 characteristics of innovations that affect the ease of implementation (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, “trialability,” observability, reinvention, “fuzzy boundary,” task issues, and augmentation support).</p>
<p>As an innovation, BFHI has several attributes that facilitate its adoption in many settings. For example, innovations that demonstrate a relative advantage over current practices and have a high level of compatibility with individual and institutional norms and values tend to be easily adopted. Participants in this study felt that BFHI had a relative advantage over the status quo, as it would enhance the hospital’s reputation, minimize the need to correct misinformation, and improve breastfeeding outcomes. Similarly, BFHI was viewed as compatible with the norms in Australia, as it would improve maternal and infant health. The ability to test an innovation, before full implementation, typically enhances adoption. The BFHI offers this feature, since the steps can be implemented individually, working toward the goal of compliance with all Ten Steps. “Task-focused” innovations are readily adopted, as they are relevant to the individual’s work and make the job easier. Focus group participants clearly reported that this was relevant to their work and that some steps were time saving (ie, skin-to-skin contact), thus making their jobs easier.</p>
<p>The complexity and observability of the BFHI have both positive and negative implications. The BFHI is a complex intervention, given the multiple steps and layers of change required in many settings. However, the fact that the BFHI is broken down into the Ten Steps leads to a simplification of this process, making it more achievable. The benefits of some steps of the BFHI were observed on the maternity ward by focus group participants (ie, staff time saved by implementing skin-to-skin contact). However, participants were not able to directly observe the impact of the hospital-based changes on long-term breastfeeding outcomes. This lack of a directly observable long-term benefit may hinder BFHI implementation in some settings.</p>
<p>Because the BFHI is a global initiative developed by WHO/UNICEF, some aspects are nonnegotiable and may pose difficulty in adoption. Typically, innovations that allow for “reinvention” or user modifications are more easily adopted; however, these are not possible with BFHI. Focus group participants expressed concerned that the BFHI rules had to be adopted the same way in all settings. This sentiment overlaps the concept of fuzzy boundaries (ie, the peripheral changes made within a system in response to adopting the innovation’s nonnegotiable core changes). Innovations with fuzzy (vs clear) boundaries are easier to implement. The statements expressed by focus group participants implied that the inflexibility of the Ten Steps minimized the fuzzy boundaries, making implementation more difficult.</p>
<p>One final facilitator for implementing innovative changes is augmentation support (ie, the extent to which an organization endorses and provides the resources to facilitate an innovation). This varies by institution. The focus group participants knew that their state had endorsed BFHI, but they expressed concern that institutional priorities (ie, the timely discharge of patients to ensure the availability of beds) made implementation difficult. Some felt that the process of becoming Baby-Friendly was not the clear responsibility of a specific person or group. This perceived lack of support made it more difficult to achieve BFHI designation.</p>
<p>The qualitative research of Schmied and colleagues, combined with this very practical framework for evaluating the factors that affect the adoption of an innovation, provides valuable insights into staff perceptions of the BFHI process. Administrators and clinicians will find these research findings extremely valuable as they examine their institutional facilitators and barriers to BFHI designation.</p>
