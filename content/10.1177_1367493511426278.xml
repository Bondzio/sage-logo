<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore parents’ attributions for their children’s behaviour and their beliefs about treatment efficacy, and to investigate the specific topics and strategies parents believe would be most beneficial in a parenting intervention. A survey of 165 parents and qualitative interviews with 13 parents were conducted, assessing child behaviour, parental attributions and intervention characteristics. The findings indicated that parents were confident in their ability to manage the challenges of asthma, and in general, believed that five key asthma treatment recommendations were at least moderately helpful in managing their child’s asthma. Many parents believed that asthma medications were related to behavioural difficulties including hyperactivity, disruptiveness, and disobedience. Nearly half of the parents were concerned about how to best manage their child’s asthma, and a number of themes were identified as important intervention elements. The implications of these findings for intervention development are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness and the burden of asthma is highest in childhood, leading to reductions in quality of life for children and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511426278">Asher et al., 2006</xref>). While there is consistent evidence as to the benefits of a range of medical interventions, such as preventive medication and written action plans, only a minority of children use these strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511426278">Australian Centre for Asthma Monitoring, 2005</xref>), and adherence to management plans is generally poor. Children with asthma have more behavioural and adjustment problems, both disruptive behaviour and internalising problems (e.g. anxiety or depression) compared to non-asthmatic children, and greater asthma severity is associated with more behavioural difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511426278">McQuaid et al., 2001</xref>). Problem behaviours can include anxiety, clinging, dependence, demanding behaviour, and using the asthma as a way of getting their own way or avoiding school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511426278">Vila et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511426278">Hysing et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents of children with asthma use many ineffective parenting strategies to manage their child’s asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511426278">Wade et al., 2000</xref>), and mothers and fathers often do not agree on the severity of their child’s asthma and how best to manage it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511426278">Eiser et al., 1991</xref>). Caregiver and family factors, such as parental stress and psychopathology, poor parenting practices, poor parent–child relationships and family conflict are related to asthma onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511426278">Klinnert et al., 2008</xref>), morbidity and treatment adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511426278">Kaugars et al., 2004</xref>). In general, adherence is lower and morbidity higher when parents have low self-efficacy in relation to managing the child’s asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511426278">Chen et al., 2003</xref>); when parents use ineffective parental problem-solving strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511426278">Wade et al., 2000</xref>); and when parents reduce their involvement in their child’s asthma management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511426278">McQuaid et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the difficulties parents of children with asthma experience in ensuring treatment adherence, and the higher likelihood of behaviour problems among these children, it is clear that strategies need to be developed to support parents and reduce the burden of asthma on the family and the health system. While there is a need for parenting programmes, there are limited data on parenting interventions for children with asthma, with the exception of educational interventions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511426278">Warschburger et al., 2003</xref>). Existing psychosocial intervention approaches to improve adherence and to support families have lacked an explicit theoretical framework, largely focusing on education and social support, and the outcomes of these have been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511426278">Gibson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511426278">Graves et al., 2010</xref>). In order to develop effective interventions, it is critical to better understand the beliefs that parents hold in regard to the nature of their child’s asthma and the cause of their child’s behavioural problems, and their preferences for support and intervention.</p>
<p>Parents’ willingness to engage in intervention is influenced by their attributions relating to their child’s behaviour problems, perceptions about their self-efficacy in managing these problems, and expectations about the effectiveness of interventions for their child. For example, parents who attribute child behaviours to an external locus of control are more likely to view their child’s behaviour as stable, unchangeable, and most importantly, outside parental influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511426278">Morrissey-Kane and Prinz, 1999</xref>). As such, it makes sense to suggest that parents who hold these beliefs may be less likely to engage in a parenting intervention. In addition, research from the field of paediatric asthma has highlighted the impact of parental beliefs on health behaviours. When parents believe that preventive therapy is important, they are more likely to adhere to preventive management. Furthermore, children whose parents have positive beliefs about the benefits of asthma management behaviours are less likely to experience wheezing and have better general health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511426278">Wade et al., 2000</xref>). Lower parental expectations of treatment benefits, along with fears about the potential harm caused by medications, have been shown to predict non-adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511426278">Yoos et al., 2003</xref>) and for some parents these concerns can even outweigh the perceived necessity of these medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511426278">Conn et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore parents’ attributions for their children’s behaviour and their beliefs about treatment efficacy. Specifically, this study aimed to determine the types of beliefs parents of children with asthma hold regarding the nature of their child’s asthma and behaviour that are likely to affect their willingness to adhere to treatment regimens or to access support. In particular, it was predicted that parents who more strongly endorsed the belief that asthma or its treatment causes problem behaviour would be less interested in accessing support for their child’s asthma. Furthermore, it was predicted that parents who more strongly endorsed specific asthma management recommendations would be more interested in accessing support for their child’s asthma. Finally, it was predicted that parents who had more difficulties with their child’s asthma management or behaviour would be more interested in accessing support for their child’s asthma. In addition, the purpose of this study was to investigate what specific topics and strategies parents believe would be most beneficial in a parenting intervention. The study consisted of a quantitative survey, as well as qualitative interviews with parents of children with asthma.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1367493511426278">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the survey were 165 parents of children with asthma, whose children were on average aged 7.00 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.61; Range = 3–12). One hundred (60.6%) of the children were boys. The majority of respondents were Caucasian (92.6%) and the mother of the target child (97.6%), with the remaining 2.4% of respondents being the child’s father. Most respondents were married (79.3%) or in a cohabiting relationship (11.6%), with a minority single (4.3%), or separated/divorced (4.8%). The majority of children lived in their original family (82.4%), with 9.7 per cent living in a sole-parent family, and 7.9 per cent in a step-family. Many respondents had a university education (51.5%), while 18.8 per cent had a high school education or less, and 27.2 per cent had trade or college qualifications. Approximately one-third (32.7%) of respondents were not working, 25.4 per cent were working more than 30 hours per week, and the remainder worked part-time. A quarter of participants indicated that during the past 12 months there had been a time when their household was unable to meet its essential expenses (i.e. food, the mortgage or rent payment, utility bills, child care, or important medical care). Further to this, 12.1 per cent of participants indicated that after essential expenses have been paid for there is typically not enough money left over to purchase much of anything that their family would like.</p>
<p>Thirteen parents of children with asthma participated in qualitative interviews and were recruited through an asthma clinic at a local Brisbane hospital. The majority of participants (<italic>n =</italic> 12) were the child’s mother (92.3%) while the remaining participant was the child’s father. Parents were aged between 31 and 48 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 37.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.65). The majority (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 84.6%) were married, while the remainder were separated. Most (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 76.9%) households consisted of the original family (i.e. both parents present) while the remaining participants reported being in a sole-parent or step-family. The slight majority of participants had education at least to completion of high school (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 53.8%), while less than half of partners were reported to have completed additional years of education (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 33.3%). The target children in this study all had a diagnosis of asthma, with an average age of approximately 8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.23). There were slightly more boys (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 53.8%) than girls and the majority of children (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 84.6%) had at least one sibling living with them. The average age of diagnosis with asthma was approximately 3 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.19).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367493511426278">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>A demographic questionnaire was used to assess a range of demographic factors relating to parents and their children, including socioeconomic status, ethnic background, parent age, and single parent status. Child factors included age, gender, and health status. Five questions relating specifically to asthma included items assessing the child’s age at diagnosis, the number of hospitalisations due to asthma, the number and severity of asthma episodes over the previous two-week period, how the responsibility for asthma management was shared between parents and children, and details of the child’s asthma medication prescriptions.</p>
<p>The <italic>Asthma Behaviour Checklist</italic> (ABC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511426278">Morawska et al., 2008</xref>) outlines 22 specific child behaviours that parents of children with asthma are often required to manage. Parents rate the extent to which each behaviour has been a problem for them with their child (Extent Scale), using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>Very much</italic>). In addition, for each item, parents are asked to rate how confident they are that they can successfully manage the behaviour (Confidence Scale), using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Certain I can’t do it</italic>) to 10 (<italic>Certain I can do it</italic>). High internal consistency was demonstrated for the extent and confidence ratings (α = .87 and .98, respectively) in this sample.</p>
<p>The <italic>Asthma Parent Tasks Checklist</italic> (APTC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511426278">Morawska et al., 2008</xref>) outlines 17 asthma management tasks that parents are typically responsible for and that are thought to be essential for optimal asthma management. Parents rate the extent to which each parenting task has been a problem for them using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>Very much</italic>). In addition, parents rate their level of confidence in successfully managing each task, on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Certain I can’t do it</italic>) to 10 (<italic>Certain I can do it</italic>). High internal consistency was demonstrated for the extent and confidence ratings (α = .94 and .94, respectively) in this sample.</p>
<p>The <italic>Parent Belief in Treatment Efficacy Scale</italic> (PBTE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511426278">Bursch et al., 1999</xref>) was designed as a health belief measure for parents of children with asthma. The questionnaire includes five items that describe five key treatment or management approaches for paediatric asthma (e.g. <italic>How helpful is seeing a doctor regularly in helping control asthma?</italic>). Parents rate how helpful they find each treatment strategy using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Not helpful</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Extremely helpful</italic>). The scale also provides an additional response option to indicate where a specific treatment strategy does not apply. The scale showed acceptable reliability (<italic>α</italic> = .67) in the current sample.</p>
<p>Child behaviour was assessed using the <italic>Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory</italic> (ECBI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511426278">Eyberg and Pincus, 1999</xref>), a 36-item measure of parental perceptions of disruptive behaviour in children between the ages of 2 and 16. It consists of a measure of the frequency of disruptive behaviours (Intensity) rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from <italic>never</italic> (1) to <italic>always</italic> (7) and a measure of the number of behaviours that are a problem for parents (Problem), using a <italic>yes–no</italic> format. In this sample there was good internal consistency (α = .95 and .94, respectively), and the ECBI has good test-retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .86 and .88, respectively). Scores greater than 131 on the Intensity scale and greater than 15 on the Problem scale are indicative of difficulties in the clinical range, and were used as clinical cut-offs in this study.</p>
<p>The <italic>Asthma Child Behaviour Questionnaire</italic> (ACBQ) was designed for the purpose of the current study. The 15-item questionnaire assesses parents’ beliefs regarding factors that contribute to their children’s behavioural difficulties. Each item represents a possible attribution for why a child displays difficult behaviour (e.g. <italic>When my child takes asthma medication he/she behaves aggressively</italic>). Parents rate the extent to which they agree with each of 14 statements using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Strongly agree</italic>). In addition, the questionnaire includes an open-ended question that allows parents to describe in their own words what they perceive to be the main reasons for their child’s difficult behaviours. Psychometric analyses revealed good reliability for this scale (<italic>α = .</italic>83).</p>
<p>Finally a series of questions assessed parents’ concerns regarding their children’s asthma management and what type of assistance they would find beneficial. Parents indicated whether they were concerned about how best to manage their child’s asthma and whether they would like additional assistance with managing their child’s asthma (<italic>Yes/No)</italic>. Parents rated how helpful a parenting intervention would be in increasing their skills and confidence in regards to managing their child’s asthma, using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Not at all helpful</italic>) to 10 (<italic>Extremely helpful</italic>). In addition, parents were also asked to rate how important they believed it would be to include each of 17 topics in such a parenting intervention (e.g. <italic>Tips for identifying barriers to appropriate asthma prevention</italic>), on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Not at all useful</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Extremely useful</italic>). The measure also includes an open-ended question that asks parents to detail any additional information or skills training that they believe should be included in a parenting intervention to help manage their child’s asthma and behaviour.</p>
<p>The interview consisted of seven, semi-structured questions that examined participants’ experiences as a parent of a child with asthma, and their beliefs regarding the nature of asthma and its treatment. Specifically, the interview examined what it is like parenting a child with asthma in general (i.e. the day-to-day unique experiences), the most common challenges parents face, common behaviour difficulties, parents’ explanations for behaviour, current and previous asthma management strategies, support received at the time of diagnosis, and what other forms of support would be beneficial. Time was also provided for parents to make additional comments on any key personal experiences or perspectives that were not explored during the interview. All interviews were recorded using a mini-cassette recorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367493511426278">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethical clearance for the study was obtained in accordance with the ethical review processes of the University of Queensland and the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. Parents for the survey were recruited Australia-wide from the general community as well as from a local clinic population. Parents accessed the survey online via a web link detailed in the research advertisement or by a pen and paper version of the questionnaire provided by the researchers. Parents were informed that the survey was about looking at the beliefs and challenges of parenting a child with asthma. Completion of the survey required approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Parents participating in the interviews were approached in the hospital waiting room or provided information regarding the study during their clinic appointments, and were not the same as those completing the survey. Interviews were performed in a consultation room at the centre adjacent to the clinic waiting room, expect for two parents where a telephone interview was conducted. Participants were advised that the interview would be approximately 20 minutes in duration and that it would be audio-recorded for the purposes of data collection. Prior to commencing the interview, parents were asked to sign a consent form to indicate that they agreed to the terms of participation and completed a brief demographic questionnaire. During the interview, participants were presented with seven questions regarding their child’s asthma, parenting challenges, and their beliefs about asthma and asthma management. Parents were also provided with the opportunity to make additional comments at the completion of these questions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367493511426278">
<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred and ninety two parents responded to the survey, but of these 27 provided only some demographic data and did not complete the questionnaires and hence were excluded from analyses. Cases with missing data for the 165 remaining respondents were minimal and were retained, to give confidence to correlations and to maximise the generalisability of the results. Subsequently, sample size differs across measures.</p>
<p>The mean age for diagnosis of asthma was 2.85 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.92) and most children were prescribed at least one asthma medication (96.4%) at the time of assessment, with 38.5% taking preventer medication. Most (61.1%) children had been hospitalised for their asthma, and, on average, children had been hospitalised 2.91 times (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.91). In regard to asthma severity, the majority (71.5%) of respondents indicated that their child had either experienced no asthma episodes or between one and three mild episodes each lasting two hours or less in the previous 14-day period. However, 16.4 per cent of children had experienced four or more asthma episodes or one or more episodes that temporarily interfered with activity, play, school, or sleep, and 11.5 per cent of parents indicated that their child had experienced one or more asthma episodes in the previous 14-day period that had lasted longer than two hours or resulted in shortening of normal activity or seeing a physician or going to hospital. Responses indicated that the majority of parents (74.5%) were completely or mostly responsible for the management of their child’s asthma, with only 4.2 per cent of parents indicating that their child was mostly or completely responsible for asthma management. Furthermore, child age was positively correlated with increasing child responsibility for asthma management (<italic>r</italic> = .580, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Parents were also asked to report any diagnoses other than asthma that their child had received. The most commonly occurring diagnosis was food allergies (24.2%), followed by visual or auditory impairments (17.6%), developmental disorders (6.7%), emotional or behavioural disorders (3.6%), chronic illnesses other than asthma (3.0%), and physical disability (2.4%). Approximately one-fifth of children had other diagnoses such as eczema and allergies other than food related, gastro-intestinal disorders, and sleep apnoea.</p>
<sec id="section7-1367493511426278">
<title>Child behaviour, asthma behaviour and parenting confidence</title>
<p>In general, parents reported low levels of problems (<italic>M</italic> = 10.09, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.94) and intensity (<italic>M</italic> = 107.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 37.40) of general child behaviour problems on the ECBI, although scores indicated that 22.6 per cent of children were in the clinical range for Intensity and 30.8 per cent were in the clinical range for Problem. Similarly, on average, parents reported low levels of asthma-related behaviour problems on the ABC (<italic>M</italic> = 39.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.46), and had good levels of confidence in managing these behaviours (<italic>M</italic> = 199.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 38.02). Finally, parents did not report high levels of parenting difficulties related to asthma (<italic>M</italic> = 43.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 22.95), and had good levels of parenting confidence (<italic>M</italic> = 142.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.90).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367493511426278">
<title>Parental beliefs</title>
<p>Overall, the treatment recommendations that were viewed as most helpful for preventing or managing asthma on the PBTE were keeping the child calm (<italic>M</italic> = 4.17, <italic>SD</italic> = .94), and using inhalers to control serious breathing problems (<italic>M</italic> = 4.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00). The remaining three items (seeing a doctor regularly; calling a clinic for advice regarding serious breathing problems; avoiding things that cause allergic reactions) were rated as moderately helpful in preventing or managing paediatric asthma (<italic>M</italic> = 3.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23; <italic>M</italic> = 3.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34; and <italic>M</italic> = 3.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.32, respectively).</p>
<p>The results from the ACBQ indicated that parents were more likely to attribute child behaviour to factors other than asthma or asthma management. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511426278">Table 1</xref>
, the majority of parents agreed somewhat or strongly with the statement that the way they parent their child has an effect on the child’s behaviour, while just under half believed that their child’s behaviour was due to something about their child. More than one-third of parents believed that their child became hyperactive after taking asthma medication, while approximately one in ten parents agreed that their child behaved more aggressively after taking medication. Only a small number of parents believed that their child’s behaviour problems were a direct result of asthma. In relation to other potential causes for child behaviour, a quarter of parents believed that their child’s behaviour tended to be more disruptive when the child ate certain types of foods.</p>

<p>In addition to rating their level of agreement with these statements, parents also had the opportunity to describe what they believed were the main reasons for their child’s misbehaviour. Over 100 participants provided responses for this item. Many parents used this space to describe in further detail their observations regarding the link between asthma medication, particularly steroids, and child behaviours such as hyperactivity and moodiness. Other parents described their observations of various foods and food additives contributing to behaviour difficulties, while some reiterated their beliefs regarding personality being the key reason for their child’s problem behaviours.</p>

<title>Parents’ perspectives on desired assistance</title>
<p>Over half of parents (51.9%), were concerned about how to best manage their child’s asthma, and over one-third of parents (37.2%) indicated that they would like additional assistance with managing their child’s asthma. Parents felt that a parenting intervention would be somewhat helpful (<italic>M</italic> = 5.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.61) in increasing skills and confidence in managing their child’s asthma. Parental concern about their child’s asthma management was strongly correlated with desire for further assistance (<italic>r</italic> = .621, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the belief that a parenting intervention would be helpful (<italic>r</italic> = .401, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>There was no association between parental beliefs about the causes of their child’s behaviour and interest in accessing support for their child’s asthma (<italic>r</italic> = .117, <italic>p</italic> = .153), nor between parents’ endorsement of asthma management recommendations and interest in accessing support for their children’s asthma (<italic>r</italic> = -.125, <italic>p</italic> = .125). Parents who had more difficulties with their child’s asthma management were more interested in accessing support for their child’s asthma (<italic>r</italic> = .209, <italic>p</italic> = .011), but not those with more behaviour problems in general (<italic>r</italic> = .079, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .395).</p>
<p>Parents provided ratings of the potential usefulness of 17 asthma and parenting topics outlined for inclusion in a parenting intervention designed to increasing parents’ skills and confidence in managing their children’s asthma and behaviour, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511426278">Table 2</xref>
. The most popular topics for inclusion in an intervention programme for parents of children with asthma were identifying asthma triggers, learning strategies for managing asthma and asthma attacks, and identifying asthma symptoms. All of the items received mean ratings of greater than 3, indicating that parents viewed these topics as at least somewhat useful.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined several aspects of paediatric asthma and parenting with the purpose of clarifying parents’ perspectives on the challenges they face and the type of assistance they desire. Responses to the survey elucidated the challenging child behaviours and parenting tasks associated with parenting a child with asthma. The extent of these problems was moderate at most, and overall parents were confident in their ability to manage these problems. The interview results indicated that parents of children with asthma experience many unique day-to-day experiences associated with their child’s asthma and asthma management. Almost all parents interviewed reported that one of these unique experiences was the constant need to plan ahead and be prepared, and be alert to symptoms. This included specific tasks such as ensuring preventer and reliever medications were readily available at all times, and informing teachers and caregivers of their child’s asthma and management regimen. Parents reported that they find tasks associated with managing asthma, such as ensuring adherence to a medical regimen, form a demanding and often stressful part of daily life. For some parents, having a child with asthma was also associated with emotional stress and financial burden.</p>
<p>Common challenges described by parents included remembering to give their child medication, identifying and avoiding asthma triggers, and getting their child to comply with taking medication. Key problem behaviours included whining and complaining about medication, and resistance or refusal to take medication. These results are consistent with previous research in which parents identified forgetting medication and adverse child reactions to being given medication as the two most common factors contributing to reduced adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511426278">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>). The task of identifying and avoiding asthma triggers has also previously been reported as one of the leading difficulties parents experience in managing their child’s asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511426278">Morawska et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Results indicated that parents believed that five key treatment recommendations were at least moderately helpful. Keeping the child calm and using inhalers were the two strategies seen as most useful in managing or preventing asthma exacerbations. Overall, these results suggested that parents were generally satisfied with common treatment recommendations. This is in keeping with past research such as evidence which indicates that the majority of parents view their child’s asthma medications as necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511426278">Conn et al., 2007</xref>), and results of this study yielded scores on the PBTE that were comparable to previous research using this tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511426278">Bursch et al., 1999</xref>). The majority of interviewed parents reported that their child’s asthma was managed through the use of daily preventive medication and reliever medication. Parents acknowledged that this treatment was in keeping with best practice; however, concern regarding use of medications and possible side effects was widespread. In addition to concerns regarding the effect of medication on child behaviour, parents were apprehensive about side effects such as dental damage, cardiac stress, and the impact of medication on their child’s growth and development. Subsequent to these concerns, some parents reported that they would ultimately like to reduce their child’s reliance on asthma medications through the use of complementary strategies. Others reported that they currently employed complementary strategies in conjunction with the medical regimen to promote their child’s health and well-being.</p>
<p>In regard to parents’ attributions for child behaviour, the majority of parents agreed to some extent that their parenting style has an effect on their child’s behaviour, indicating that parents may acknowledge the potential benefits of a parenting programme that aims to increase parental skills and confidence. However, just over half of parents also believed that their child’s behaviour was due to something about their child. This may indicate a barrier to seeking help or engaging in an intervention, as parents who believe that enduring characteristics of their child, such as personality, are the cause of child behaviour problems may be less likely to perceive these problems as amenable to treatment. Furthermore, a notable number of parents believed that asthma medications were related to behavioural difficulties including hyperactivity, disruptiveness, and disobedience. Interview responses were also consistent with a number of parents attributing some of the most challenging child behaviours, including hyperactivity and aggression, to medication usage. However, there was no support for the hypothesis that parents’ beliefs about the causes of their children’s behaviour were related to interest in seeking assistance for their children’s asthma.</p>
<p>These findings give some support to the notion that some parents hold beliefs regarding their child’s asthma management that may affect their willingness to adhere to a treatment regimen or to access support. Those parents who believe that asthma medication contributes to child behaviour problems may be less motivated to stringently adhere to their child’s treatment regimen, and may be less likely to perceive the benefits of an intervention that targets their own skills and knowledge. This finding is supported by previous literature which shows that positive beliefs about the benefits of asthma management behaviours are related to better adherence and fewer asthma symptoms in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511426278">Wade et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, concerns about side effects and potential harm caused by medications, have been shown to predict non-adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511426278">Yoos et al., 2003</xref>). It follows that if parents view child behaviour problems as a side effect of medication they will be less likely to adhere to these treatments.</p>
<p>Finally, exploration of parents’ perceptions regarding the potential benefits of an asthma specific parenting intervention revealed that nearly half of parents were concerned about how to best manage their child’s asthma, while just under a third were interested in receiving additional assistance and support with managing their child’s asthma. Interest in accessing support was only associated with difficulties in relation to managing the child’s asthma but not to general child behaviour or parental endorsements of the usefulness of asthma recommendations.</p>
<p>Exploration of parents’ perspectives helped to clarify the specific topics and strategies that would need to be included in an intervention specifically tailored for parents of children with asthma. Parents were most interested in areas that related to increasing their knowledge and skills regarding managing their child’s asthma, including topics such as identifying children’s asthma triggers and symptoms, and strategies for managing and preventing asthma exacerbations and attacks. Additional themes included assistance with how to manage children’s anxiety related to asthma and how to communicate effectively with children about asthma, and advice on evidence-based alternative strategies for managing asthma. Parents also reported that they would like to be provided with guidelines for decision making in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Interview responses indicated that many parents did not receive what they perceived to be comprehensive and consistent information or support at the time their child was diagnosed, or across the course of their child’s asthma. On the other hand, some parents, particularly those whose children were diagnosed while in hospital at the time of an acute episode, indicated that they believed they received sufficient information about asthma and guidance with management practices. These results suggest that the level of assistance and support parents receive in relation to their child’s asthma is varied. A key theme was the desire for timely and high quality medical advice. Not surprisingly, parents reported that they would have liked to be provided with accurate and consistent information at the time of diagnosis and as the course of asthma progressed. Parents reported that training in the use medication devices and how to effectively deliver medication to their child would be an important part of an intervention programme. In addition, parents described a desire for support from other parents as a means of sharing experiences and knowledge.</p>
<p>A number of limitations may have affected the validity of the results in this study. As participation in this survey was voluntary, it is possible that results were affected by a non-response bias, such that parents who participated in this study may not have been a representative sample of the actual population. The majority of parents who were interviewed were recruited at a specialist asthma clinic and most parents reported that they had been attending the clinic for more than one year. At the clinic, parents and children had contact with an asthma nurse educator and paediatric respiratory specialist, and as such were exposed to a high level of specialist care. This may have had a potentially confounding effect on the results of this study, as parents interviewed in this sample may have had a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of asthma and asthma management practices than other parents of children with asthma. However, despite the level of specialised intervention offered to these parents, they still seemed to lack knowledge in some areas and struggled with various aspects of asthma management. This observation is worth noting, given that the majority of parents of children with asthma do not access this level of specialist care, and, as such, may have even greater need for additional support.</p>
<p>This study helped to determine the extent to which parents desire assistance with managing paediatric asthma and clarified the type of material that should be included in a parenting intervention. Understanding the beliefs that guide parent behaviours in managing their child’s asthma is necessary in order to support parents in achieving better outcomes for their child and their family. These findings provide valuable guidance for tailoring a parenting intervention specifically designed to suit the needs and preferences of parents of children with asthma. In particular, interventions should combine education about asthma and its management, with skills training both in relation to how to ensure good medical adherence, and how to manage difficulties in the child’s behaviour and emotional adjustment. In addition, interventions should assist parents to explore the nature of their child’s behaviour, and how this is linked to their child’s asthma, as well as helping parents develop specific strategies for managing difficulties. Finally, providing such interventions in a group environment may be most helpful for parents given the themes around the need for support and sharing experiences with other parents in a similar situation. This research will enable the development of methods of intervention that better cater to the needs and preferences of parents and take into consideration parent beliefs that may potentially hinder optimal asthma management. Addressing these beliefs is fundamental to designing an intervention that will appeal to parents. Providing parents with the skills and confidence to manage their child’s asthma and behaviour may contribute to better compliance with asthma management plans, and therefore lead to reductions in asthma morbidity, disruptions to family functioning, and costs associated with asthma.</p>
