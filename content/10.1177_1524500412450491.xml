<abstract>
<p>Since social marketing’s formal introduction in 1971, the field has advanced through employing innovations in marketing thought. Despite debates over whether or not marketing principles should be used to promote socially beneficial behaviors, the field has become successful at utilizing such practices to achieve its goals. However, even with these advancements, social marketing research has yet to fully consider how the use of traditional marketing practices in socially oriented settings can alter the way stakeholders perceive and interact with the organizations employing these tactics. This article examines how parallels between nonprofit management and social marketing research illustrate how socially oriented organizations can damage their legitimacy as change agents and community partners by not evaluating the true costs of employing marketing techniques. Both warnings and recommendations are provided to help the managers of social marketing efforts more effectively evaluate both the costs and benefits of their decisions.</p>

<p>Social marketing has reached an important milestone in its development. Forty years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450491">Kotler and Zaltman (1971)</xref> established the theoretical and practical foundations for a new field of marketing study. A field that aimed to use marketing practices as a tool for solving a myriad of societal problems. Unfortunately, from its inception, many have questioned whether such a division of marketing theory and practice could legitimately achieve its goals. The very notion that marketing principles could be employed to promote socially beneficial behaviors radically challenged conventional views about the rightful role and purpose of marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450491">Luck, 1969</xref>).  Luckily, despite these criticisms, the field’s innumerable success stories over the last four decades have silenced many of these early opponents. </p>
<p>During the last 40 years, social marketing techniques have proven successful at precipitating socially optimum behavior changes, across cultural, economic, and geographic boundaries. Therefore, it is not surprising that in an increasingly competitive “new world” for nonprofit organizations, social marketing tactics are viewed as a vital tool for perpetuating meaningful societal change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450491">Lee, Aschermann, Ehrmann, &amp; Mintz, 2005</xref>, p. 51). However, recent economic shifts are making the use and management of such practices more complicated. </p>
<p>The global economic downturn has led nonprofit organizations to encounter almost unprecedented challenges. A survey of approximately 2,000 nonprofit organizations revealed that 87% believe the economic downturn has not ended and 77% have witnessed an increased demand for their resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500412450491">State of the Sector Survey, 2011</xref>). As a result, these organizations must increasingly work to prove the importance of their continued existence amid growing obstacles. </p>
<p>During difficult times such as these, nonprofit leaders are placed in a precarious position. They must rethink how they can help their organizations sustain mission-driven activities while still trying to be audience centered. Unfortunately, during economic scenarios such as these, nonprofit organizations have historically not been immune from poor decision making. In the zeal to mitigate economic hardships, nonprofit managers are prone to integrate conventional private sector practices, such as marketing, into their work. Unfortunately, often these decisions are made without considering their stakeholders’ views of such actions. As a result of these oversights, nonprofit organizations have encountered damage to key aspects of their operation including the ability to fundraise, engage in effective relationship management, and preserve the legitimacy of their mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450491">Arnold, Handelman, &amp; Tigert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412450491">Backman &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450491">Dees, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412450491">Guo, 2006</xref>). Quite simply, the mismanagement of stakeholder perceptions only further puts into question a nonprofit organization’s ability to adapt in order to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Nonprofit management research presents an important series of warnings for all public and private organizations that wish to employ social marketing interventions. Research in this area illustrates the implications of ignoring stakeholder interests in the effort to continue perpetuating socially beneficial behavioral outcomes. The intersection of these two bodies of research indicates that not evaluating the perceptions of all stakeholders involved in a social marketing intervention may result in organizations losing valuable forms of financial and social capital. </p>
<p>Social marketing’s success stories certainly validate the field’s ability to assist organizations enhance the impact of their work. However, an even more important discussion revolves around the pitfalls socially oriented organizations may encounter when trying to enact the dual role of “social partner” and “social marketer.” Therefore, this article does not advocate for an avoidance of social marketing practices. Instead, this article is a cautionary tale of what organizations may encounter when employing “customer-centered” social marketing efforts without considering stakeholder perceptions of such forms of engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450491">Andreasen (2003)</xref> explained how social marketing’s ascension into “early maturity” makes it vital for researchers to explore the intersection between the field’s practices and the lessons learned from others. Therefore, examining the problems nonprofit organizations have encountered helps social marketers of all kinds learn how to avoid these pitfalls and enhance the future effectiveness of their work.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524500412450491">
<title>Evolution of Marketing Practices in the Implementation of Social Marketing</title>
<p>Deciding what constitutes the appropriate management of social marketing practices has always been a contentious issue.  Even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450491">Kotler and Zaltman (1971)</xref> acknowledged the tensions underlying this debate by explaining how some may view the use of marketing practices as an inherently manipulative way of fostering socially beneficial behavior changes. Therefore, it is not surprising that early social marketing management debates focused on the ways this new field signaled a radical paradigmatic shift in the way “marketing” could and should be conceptualized.</p>
<p>Numerous scholars warned of the complications associated with utilizing marketing practices to meet societal needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500412450491">Sweeney (1972)</xref> cautioned that employing a conventional marketing approach to the pursuit of socially beneficial behavior change outcomes did not necessarily represent the best interests of the efforts’ intended recipients. For him, such an approach neglected how marketing activities do not inherently consider social values when determining the goals and outcomes of such practices (1972).  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450491">Bartels (1974)</xref> further addressed how social marketing led “marketing” activities to become overly focused on noneconomic outcomes. As a result, he believed a reorientation of marketing established the questionable premise that “all” organizations could engage in such activities and therefore “selling” in social contexts would just become glorified forms of communication, problem solving, and management (1974). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450491">Luck (1974)</xref> further challenged this new view of marketing based on the ways it altered conventional notions of the marketing exchange. He noted how using marketing to achieve societal goals could just result in a person receiving free services and thus not taking part in any form of real exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450491">Luck, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The theoretical nature of these early social marketing management debates hindered the field’s early growth because scholars acknowledged the field’s marketing heritage but questioned whether marketing practices should actually be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450491">Andreasen, 2003</xref>). Luckily, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discussion of social marketing began to change orientation. Discourse became less focused on social marketing’s impact on theory and instead began to emphasize the ways marketing practices in the field could be more effectively managed.</p>
<p>Early social marketing efforts had been plagued by various forms of mismanagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450491">Bloom and Novelli (1981)</xref> elaborated how organizations utilizing social marketing principles experienced problems in a wide array of areas including marketing analysis, product strategy, pricing, choice of appropriate channels, communication, and organization design/planning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450491">Rothschild (1979)</xref> explained that many of these marketing issues could be attributed to for-profit and nonprofit organizations having underdeveloped channels for assessing stakeholder needs and proper implementation strategies. Problems such as these became compounded by nonprofit organizations understanding how to manage themselves but not accepting the need for oversight procedures affiliated with their marketing efforts (1981). Without proper mechanisms for planning and management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450491">Bloom and Novelli (1981)</xref> believed that social marketing efforts would become conflated with communication campaigns and therefore only achieve mid-range performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Issues surrounding the management of social marketing actions did not just pertain to best practices but also the ethics of leadership.  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412450491">Laczniak, Lusch, and Murphy (1979)</xref> articulated how serious ethical issues surrounded the implementation of social marketing efforts. They explained that organizations could encounter difficulties when trying to differentiate between the ethics of applying marketing principles to social problems and the ethical nature of the problems themselves. As a result, social marketers needed to be held accountable for understanding the ramifications of their actions (1979). </p>
<p>Acknowledging the importance of properly managing social marketing efforts, many scholars and practitioners began focusing on the ways the field could look to the private sector for insights regarding how to maximize the potential of marketing techniques. Merritt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500412450491">Christopoulous, and Thorpe (2009)</xref> explained that this kind of reflection became necessary because the field had lost focus on the limitations of solely using educational messages to perpetuate socially beneficial behaviors. To advance the field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450491">Andreasen (1994)</xref> described how social marketing needed to include commercial marketing ideas in its application, emphasize the “bottom-line” goals of any socially beneficial behavior change effort, and use marketing ideas in a way that benefited the recipients rather than the organizations offering the interventions. Achieving these goals required social marketing efforts to be conceptualized as an exchange, in which the recipients are offered some mechanism for lowering their barriers to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450491">Lefevbre &amp; Flora, 1988</xref>). Approaching social marketing from this perspective aimed to make the field’s efforts more consumer centered by embracing stakeholder self-interest as a source of consumer insight data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450491">Maibach, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Renewed emphasis on the role of customer-oriented exchanges also signaled increased attention on the proper management and use of the commercial marketing mix. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412450491">Grier and Bryant (2005)</xref> explained that an often misguided belief about social marketing is that the field is solely focused on promotional efforts and thus only employs communication channels, such as advertising, to achieve its goals.  The view that social marketing is promotion rich but practice poor stirred interest in the ways the field could further use marketing frameworks from the private sector to become more results oriented. </p>
<p>As a result, social marketing research has increasingly specified how components of the commercial marketing mix framework should be reconceptualized for social marketing contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450491">McKenzie-Mohr and Smith (1999)</xref> interpreted <italic>price </italic>as any barrier the target audience must incur as a consequence of adopting a socially beneficial behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500412450491">Smith (2009)</xref> discussed the value of the social marketing <italic>product </italic>by explaining how it needed to be designed in a way that allowed the intended recipient to view its use as <italic>fun</italic>, <italic>easy</italic>, and <italic>popular</italic> (p. 105). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450491">Lotenberg (2010)</xref> also emphasized the importance of the behavior change <italic>product</italic> but also advocated for the proper management of <italic>placement </italic>factors to ensure an area is conducive for implementing a socially beneficial behavior change intervention.</p>
<p>Despite scholars focusing on individual aspects of the marketing mix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450491">Kotler and Lee (2008)</xref> called on scholars to avoid perpetuating a silo-ed perspective regarding the importance of individual marketing factors. Instead, they supported the notion that social marketers can best serve their target populations through understanding and embracing how these variables function in tandem. Social marketers becoming more exchange focused helped practitioners better understand the benefits of private sector influences and gain insights about the negative/positive aspects of these transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412450491">Hastings &amp; Saren, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights From Nonprofit Management Research</title>
<p>Despite social marketers seemingly embracing a private sector orientation toward their work, the decision by socially oriented organizations to employ these kinds of practices has historically created backlash from stakeholders. Organizations from the nonprofit sector initially began seeking out the use of private sector practices due to economic conditions similar to those being experienced currently. At the beginning of the Reagan administration, nonprofit organizations started to face numerous challenges to their existence. Not only did these organizations face cutbacks in federal spending, but they also faced a concurrent increase in demand for their resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450491">Salomon, 2002</xref>). As a result of lessened resources, many nonprofit managers began to realize that their organizations had become overly dependent on the whims of third-party funders to ensure financial stability. With the possibility of lower funding, nonprofit managers sought out new ways to ensure the survival of their industry and lessen dependency on mercurial funding sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450491">Dees, 1998</xref>). </p>
<p>Many nonprofit managers began to recognize that continuing to use the same forms of strategies normally associated with community partners would not be adequate to match the kinds of resource deficiencies facing their organizations. As a result, any form of new organizational practices needed to come from a sector that had a more established track record of successful resource management and revenue creation. With these issues in mind, it is not surprising that nonprofit managers hoped to address these trends by learning how to adapt their organizations to be more conducive to using practices normally associated with the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450491">Dees, 1998</xref>). Not only did these new strategies offer the potential to counteract resource shortages but also assist in the development of new avenues for mission promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412450491">Bush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412450491">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450491">Eikenberry &amp; Kluver, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the goals of these efforts did not match the results. Before adopting these practices, nonprofit organizations had thrived because they utilized reliable mission-driven activities that had been agreed upon by the organization’s stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412450491">Salipante &amp; Golden-Biddle, 1995</xref>).  However, the push to adopt private sector practices violated these notions from the start because ironically the organizations that most needed to translate private sector practices into their work actually became the ones who did not seek out their use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450491">Arnold et al., 1996</xref>). As a result, many nonprofit managers started to become less stakeholder focused because of the difficulties they encountered in balancing the nonprofit and new private sector aspects of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450491">Alexander &amp; Weiner, 1998</xref>). </p>
<p>Numerous nonprofits have encountered the ramifications of thinking more like a business rather than a community partner. When the proper evaluation of stakeholder perceptions does not occur, the by-product is often an organization losing credibility, even when these efforts are well intentioned. For example, in 2010, many supporters of the Susan G Komen Foundation expressed frustration with a proposed revenue-creating partnership with KFC restaurants. Despite the deal yielding the organization $0.50 for every bucket of chicken sold, stakeholders argued that the relationship violated key components of the nonprofit’s identity by partnering the nation’s largest breast cancer nonprofit with a corporation whose products have been found to contain cancer-causing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450491">Black, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Problems such as these illustrate the important role that a nonprofit’s mission serves in shaping the way stakeholders perceive the use of private sector practices. Historically, a nonprofit’s mission solidified the organization’s position as a community partner by establishing a core set of values that dictated how the organization engaged its stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412450491">Salipante &amp; Golden-Biddle, 1995</xref>). Thus, nonprofit organizations sustained themselves by carving out a unique niche from private sector entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450491">Eikenberry &amp; Kluver, 2004</xref>). However, changing organizational practices have led stakeholders to perceive these nonprofits as community partners that no longer acknowledge the importance of their mission statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412450491">Foreman &amp; Whetten, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450491">Schlesinger, Mitchell, &amp; Gray, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>When organizations neglect stakeholder views of such actions the result can not only be losses to credibility but also financial capital. The proposed partnership between the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Sunbeam Corporation perfectly exemplifies how a nonprofit’s reputation can be damaged simply through an act of omission. In 1997, a partnership between the AMA and Sunbeam had been announced, which would have allowed the corporation to use the nonprofit’s logo on product boxes in exchange for millions of dollars in compensation. Unfortunately, the AMA did not consult the physicians when proposing this partnership. As a result, the nonprofit’s stakeholders rejected this plan less than a week after its proposal on the grounds that an objective medically oriented nonprofit organization should not partner with a corporate entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450491">Collins, 1997</xref>). Not only did the AMA damage relationships with central stakeholders and lose a revenue-creating opportunity, but the organization also incurred a $9.9 million penalty for breaching their contractual agreement with Sunbeam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450491">Broken Deal Costs A.M.A. $9.9 Million, 1998</xref>). The executive vice president for the AMA expressed the implications of not assessing stakeholder perceptions by stating, “our credibility was called into question…we take full responsibility for actions on our part that may have eroded our credibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450491">Collins, 1997</xref>). When nonprofits place the preservation and advancement of the organization above their stakeholders, they fall into a vulnerable position in which they must expend resources rebuilding trust rather than using those resources to reinforce the meaningful bonds that already exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524500412450491">
<title>Intersection Between Nonprofit Management Research and Social Marketing</title>
<p>Based on the experiences of nonprofit managers, there are several important issues that all organizations, on both the governmental and nonprofit levels, should consider when employing social marketing actions. When evaluating how to conduct a successful social marketing campaign, neglecting any of the audiences affected by these actions makes the initiator vulnerable to criticism. A challenge facing these organizations is that decisions that would seem correct in a business setting may be incongruent with the values of community stakeholders. The dichotomy of concurrently thinking like a business and a community partner has already created conflicts that make it difficult for organizations to employ social marketing techniques while engaging in relationship management.</p>
<p>A new challenge for conducting stakeholder-centered social marketing efforts has been the increasingly important role of metrics in evaluating the “effectiveness” of social marketing efforts. Currently, increased emphasis on campaign evaluation is leading to result metrics becoming an increasingly vital part of stirring funder interest in social marketing efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450491">Strand, 2010</xref>). Even in social marketing friendly environments, such as England, government cutbacks are creating the possibility that agencies will receive funding based on the behavioral outcomes they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500412450491">Merritt, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, by emphasizing the need for “returns on investment,” formative research efforts become either overlooked or expedited for the sake of developing a socially optimized behavior change “product.” Such an approach actually contradicts private sector approaches to marketing because potential “products” are discussed before an analysis of stakeholder perceptions can be conducted to determine what constitutes the <italic>right</italic> product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500412450491">Merritt et al., 2009</xref>). Without gathering audience insights, it becomes increasingly likely that attempts to propagate socially beneficial behaviors become viewed as interventionist rather than a pursuit to perpetuate mutually beneficial exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450491">Smith &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>). </p>
<p>The mismanagement of social marketing due to funding issues also extends to the policy agendas of the funders themselves. Unfortunately, often organizations that want to employ social marketing strategies are not focused on actually engaging in “social marketing” but rather simply want to advocate for an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450491">Lagarde, 2009</xref>). Scenarios such as these occur because organizations that are reliant on third-party funders often are forced to employ social marketing tactics that reflect donor expectations rather than the needs of target audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450491">Smith &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>). Not only do these issues have a profound effect on target audiences, but they also impact the relationships between these organizations and their internal stakeholders. </p>
<p>As community-oriented organizations begin to increasingly integrate marketing practices into their work, an employee’s knowledge of marketing becomes just as valued as their experience with the target population. Therefore, it is not surprising that prosocial marketing organizations have become popular destinations for MBA graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450491">Smith &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>). Even though these individuals have a working knowledge of marketing and an inclination toward promoting societal good, they can harm the dynamics of a nonprofit workplace by overemphasizing the need to maximize behavioral outcomes, even when those goals compromise community engagement efforts (2009).</p>
<p>Backlash from internal stakeholders not only damages the workplace environment but also extends into populations being served by the organization. For many nonprofit employees, there is resistance to employing a results-oriented approach to their work because they perceive such actions as incongruent with their role as community partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450491">Arnold et al., 1996</xref>). Consequently, when these roles appear to be compromised, the result is an organization damaging its ability to perpetuate the kinds of social capital-creating networks that are vital to community building and volunteerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450491">Dees, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412450491">Backman &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>).  </p>
<p>Despite nonprofit organizations facing many of these issues, government agencies wishing to utilize social marketing practices have not been immune from these challenges. Even though government agencies often have significantly more financial resources to expend on social marketing interventions, this does not mean that these organizations are still not impacted by the agendas of third-party actors. Government attempts to use marketing practices of any kind are always complicated by political influences and ideology. Due to these agencies functioning in highly politicized climates, they must orient themselves and their marketing efforts around the demands of such environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524500412450491">Snavely, 1991</xref>). Unfortunately, this politicization of marketing makes such efforts less consumer centered because outside agendas are able to influence everything from an agency’s ability to engage in long-range planning, budgeting, and even program prioritization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524500412450491">Lamb, 1987</xref>). Thus, politics rather than people may dictate how government agencies use marketing to tackle controversial issues such as birth control and HIV/AIDS prevention. Unfortunately, the existence of such forces creates a troubling scenario in which sensitive audiences just become consumers rather than cofacilitators of meaningful changes in behavior. </p>
<p>A perfect example of how this kind of politically oriented approach to marketing can hinder a well-intentioned campaign pertains to Canada’s attempts to reduce health disparities within the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450491">Majid and Grier (2010)</xref> explained how the federally funded Canadian Food Mail program utilized a social marketing approach to counteract health disparities among the country’s aboriginal and nonaboriginal populations. Despite formative research indicating that these outcomes could be attributed to barriers associated with the group’s access to nutritious foods, the agency’s research focused on finding the right “product” rather than actively addressing the needs and cultural aspects of the target population. As a result, the program did subsidize the transportation of nutritious foods into some of the most isolated areas of the country but ignored the vital components of the aboriginal diet, such as the role of whale meat. Eventually, not only did the program need to be revamped but a perceived lack of cultural appreciation only made the efforts appear self-serving and interventionist. </p>
<p>What this example illustrates on a macro-scale is that social marketing efforts are not just about changing behaviors. They are about the creation of mutual understanding among all stakeholders involved in that process. The problems associated with using marketing practices in a social sphere are largely the result of such strategies not being used in a vacuum. These new organizational practices complicate and change how an organization conducts all aspects of its work. For that reason it is important to acknowledge how marketing is inherently a “social process” that is continuously altered based on the values, social structures, and ideology of a given period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500412450491">Sweeney, 1972</xref>, pp. 7–8). In situations such as the Food Mail program, the use of social marketing presents possibilities for not only improving behaviors but also fostering trust between groups that may have experienced distrust in the past. However, when marketing efforts are missing a human component, organizations are just using their already limited resources to reinforce why their stakeholders may have been skeptical of these kinds of practices from the start. </p>

<title>Implications for Social Marketing</title>
<p>With all of these issues in mind, the leadership of organizations devoted to using social marketing must ask a fundamental yet important question: Are we managing audience-centered actions that utilize commercial influences <italic>or</italic> private sector practices with a social slant? The differences are slight but fundamentally important. The former approach allows social marketing interventions to become a form of community advocacy. The latter increases the likelihood that these same organizational actions are perceived as manipulative. </p>
<p>Employing stakeholder-centered social marketing efforts in an increasingly results-driven environment requires all organizations to be involved in the “business” of managing stakeholder expectations. In other words, the way marketing is utilized should be a reflection of an organization’s “corporate philosophy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524500412450491">Yorke, 2007</xref>, p. 17). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1524500412450491">Smith (2010)</xref> articulated that one of field’s most significant contributions is the way it has consistently illustrated how properly managed marketing interventions can produce meaningful societal changes. Understanding the pitfalls faced by nonprofit managers teaches social marketers of all kinds that in increasingly complex social change marketplaces the management of an intervention requires more than just managing behaviors. Ignoring social norms and stakeholder needs result in social marketing efforts that not only are ineffective at altering behaviors in a socially meaningful way but also decrease available resources and lower support for future efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450491">Glassman &amp; Braun, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Luckily, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450491">Kotler and Zaltman (1971)</xref> implicitly provide social marketers with the tools necessary to bridge these divides. In their view, it is not enough to just understand how the core ideas of marketing shape social marketing. Instead, they advocated for social marketers to also learn how to effectively engage in the practice of marketing management (1971). For this reason, perhaps the field can better integrate stakeholder perceptions into their work by working toward the expansion of <italic>social marketing management research</italic>. </p>
<p>The advantages of this kind of research are numerous. A commercial marketing management framework can be utilized by social marketers in the same way elements of the marketing mix have been adapted and employed.  Embracing the 3 Cs of the marketing management mix would push both practitioners and scholars to look past the price, product, promotion, and placement variables of the intervention and think more holistically about the contextual factors that may impact stakeholder perceptions regarding the use of marketing practices. Employing a social marketing management framework would allow practitioners and theorists alike to ask several important questions.</p>

<p> Now, it is certainly a valid argument that the current state of global economies and its impact on nonprofit organizations and government agencies alike may lower an organization’s ability to engage in more extensive and/or expensive forms of formative and evaluative research. However, conceptualizing socially beneficial behavior change campaigns through a social marketing management framework does not necessarily require extra research. Instead conventional forms of research can be reframed and approached in a more nuanced and audience-directed way. Thinking about each “P” of the marketing mix from the perspective of each “C” of the marketing management mix helps to not only identify possible design flaws in social marketing efforts but also identify previously unexplored opportunities for creating improved relationships among stakeholders</p>
<p>To tackle some of the stickiest problems social marketers still struggle to counter, the field’s practitioners and theorists must use tools that are as dynamic and nuanced as the individuals they serve. At the core of all social marketing exchanges is trust. It is the currency that fuels meaningful exchanges. Unfortunately, it is also a resource that is extremely difficult to earn but extraordinarily easy to lose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412450491">Peattie and Peattie (2003)</xref> explained that it is not enough to view the recipients of social marketing as customers in a traditional sense. Instead, these individuals should be viewed as the providers of vital resources, such as credibility and trust, that help foster and maintain mutually beneficial relationships among stakeholders and community partners. Engaging in dialogue that positions each side as equal partners helps to foster not only better communication but also a desire for collaborative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450491">Desai, 2009</xref>). By understanding the key parallels between nonprofit management research and social marketing, perhaps the field’s practitioners can more fully embrace a simple yet profound piece of consumer insight research: it requires more resources to gain a new customer than it is does to maintain an old one. Through continuous reflection and self-improvement hopefully the second 40 years of social marketing’s existence can be even more fruitful than its first. </p>
