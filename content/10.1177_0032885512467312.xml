<abstract>
<p>The relationships between dual psychiatric and substance use disorders and assaults among U.S. federal prisoners were examined using logistic regression. Dually disordered inmates were more likely to be assaulted than nondually disordered inmates but both groups were equally likely to assault others. Assault victimization and perpetration were strongly correlated, and assault victimization and perpetration were associated with being assaulted before this incarceration and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. Dually disordered inmates may be “importing” into prison some vulnerability to being assaulted. Effectively screening for and treating inmates’ trauma-related disorders (e.g., PTSD), and providing inmates specialized dual disorders treatments are two study implications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As of July 24, 2010, over 172,000 inmates were in prisons operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032885512467312">Federal Bureau of Prisons, n.d</xref>.). A significant proportion of prisoners have mental health and substance use issues. An estimated 45% of federal prisoners abused drugs before entering prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512467312">Mumola &amp; Karberg, 2006</xref>) or have psychiatric histories, and 29% have co-occurring psychiatric and substance abuse issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512467312">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). In its 2000 census of state and federal prisons, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) found an aggregate of over 52,000 inmate-on-inmate and inmate-on-staff physical assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032885512467312">Stephan &amp; Karberg, 2003</xref>). A subsequent BJS survey of sexual assaults in jails and prisons contained a sample of 19 federal prisons: Across facilities, 0% to 3.6% of inmates were assaulted by another inmate and 0% to 3.3% were assaulted by facility staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0032885512467312">Beck, Harrison, Berzofsky, Caspar, &amp; Krebs, 2010</xref>, p. 45). How co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders (i.e., dual disorders) contribute to inmate assaults is absent in the prisons’ literature. This study examines the relationships between these dual disorders and federal inmates’ involvement in prison-based assaults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0032885512467312">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>For prisoners in general, involvement in assaults may result from the many social, psychological, and material deprivations experienced in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0032885512467312">Sykes, 1958</xref>). Or assaultive behavior may arise from inmates “importing” into the prison the outside world’s expectations about things like being a “street smart” tough guy who exploits others and uses violence when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512467312">Irwin &amp; Cressey, 1962</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512467312">Thomas, Petersen, and Zingraff (1978)</xref> assert that inmate assaults result from the combined effects of the pains of imprisonment and importation of “street” norms. Like other “total institutional” populations (e.g., psychiatric hospital patients), prisoners’ daily lives are dictated by the official rules and regulations of the prison, the prison’s composition of inmates and staff, and the prison’s unique subculture (a subculture which often emphasizes the use of violence to protect oneself; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032885512467312">Goffman, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Most inmates eventually adapt to the assorted prison deprivations and conflicting demands of prison officials and fellow prisoners. But because distorted cognitions, emotional volatility, social isolation and withdrawal afflict people with many severe mental illnesses (SMIs), inmates with SMIs are likely to have a harder time adapting to prison life. For example, distorted thinking may cause inmates to grossly miscalculate their response to other inmates’ efforts to manipulate them and prison officials’ demands; cognitive distortions may lead to misperceived and ill-advised reactions to various interpersonal threats. Volatile inmates are inmates likely to be aggressive with staff and inmates and to be retaliated against. Isolated and withdrawn inmates, especially those with explosive tempers and those not thinking clearly, may very well find themselves at severe risk of victimization by others as staff or inmate protectors are few and far between. Due to their more severe pathology inmates with dual SMIs and substance use disorders (i.e., dual disorders) will have even more difficulty coping with the daily rigors of prison and subsequent involvement in prison-based assaults (as victim and/or perpetrator). Such dynamics get aggravated when inmates import into the prison street norms consistent with using violence (e.g., portraying an image of toughness so as not to be exploited) and offender-level factors associated with inmate violence (i.e., demographics, criminal histories, prior physical and sexual victimization).</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Little is actually known about the links between dual psychiatric and substance use disorders and federal prisoner assaults since most attention has been paid to state prisoners with psychiatric disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032885512467312">Adams (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512467312">James and Glaze (2006)</xref> are two notable exceptions. Adams found federal prisoners’ with a lifetime hospitalization for a mental illness to be at more risk of being charged with assault and other institutional violations than never hospitalized inmates. James and Glaze found federal prisoners with psychiatric conditions to be about twice as likely as prisoners without to be charged with physical assault and be injured by someone else during the current incarceration.</p>
<p>State prisoners with mental disorders, especially thought and affective disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are at extra risk of prison infractions in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512467312">Feder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512467312">Toch &amp; Adams, 1986</xref>) and prison-based assaults in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512467312">Blitz, Wolff, &amp; Shi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512467312">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512467312">Wolff, Blitz, &amp; Shi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032885512467312">Wolff &amp; Shi, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512467312">Toch and Adams (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512467312">Feder (1991)</xref> examined the associations between New York State prison inmates’ psychiatric histories and involvement in prison infractions. Toch and Adams found inmates that had ever received outpatient psychiatric services had higher infraction rates than never treated inmates; inmates with inpatient and outpatient treatment histories had more involvement in violent infractions than never treated inmates. Feder found inmates hospitalized during the current incarceration to be somewhat more likely to commit infractions than nonhospitalized inmates.</p>
<p>Examining inmates in a state prison system, Wolff and colleagues compared the 6-month prevalence of physical and sexual assaults among inmates with psychiatric and substance use disorders and those without. Inmates with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or another anxiety disorder were at greater risk of physical assault by other inmates and/or staff than nonmentally ill inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512467312">Blitz, Wolff, &amp; Shi, 2008</xref>). The mentally ill group was also more likely to have been sexually assaulted by other inmates and/or staff than the nonmentally ill group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, male (but not female) inmates with dual psychiatric and substance abuse disorders were more likely to have been physically and/or sexually assaulted in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032885512467312">Wolff &amp; Shi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other inmate- and facility-level characteristics have been linked with inmate assaults. Inmate age has repeatedly been found to be associated with involvement in assaults: Younger inmates engage in more violent and nonviolent misconduct than older inmates; younger and older inmates are also in more danger of being victimized (e.g., thefts and assaults; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512467312">Edgar, O’Donnell, &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512467312">Kerbs &amp; Jolley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512467312">Lahm, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff, Shi, &amp; Siegel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512467312">Wooldredge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0032885512467312">Wooldredge, Griffin, &amp; Pratt, 2001</xref>). Better educated inmates are less likely to break prison rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512467312">Toch &amp; Adams, 1986</xref>) but more likely to be assaulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512467312">Wooldredge, 1998</xref>). Inmates imprisoned for the first time are also at more risk of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512467312">Hensley, Koscheski, &amp; Tewksbury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2009</xref>). Violent offenders may be at increased risk of being an assault victim and/or perpetrator in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032885512467312">Morash, Jeong, &amp; Zang, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2009</xref>). Inmates’ risks of being assaulted and committing assault have been linked with past physical and/or sexual assault victimization, findings similar to those among community populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032885512467312">Desai, Arias, Thompson, &amp; Basile, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032885512467312">Elliott, Mok, &amp; Briere, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512467312">Fergusson, Boden, &amp; Horwood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512467312">Kerbs &amp; Jolley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032885512467312">Kilpatrick, Acierno, Resnick, Saunders, &amp; Best, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512467312">Ullman, Najdowski, &amp; Filipas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2009</xref>). The racial–ethnic diversity of inmates and staff, security classifications and staff to inmate ratios are a few of the institutional level factors related to inmate assaults (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512467312">Steiner, 2009</xref>, pp. 136-142).</p>
<p>We know of no study that has looked at the dual disorders’ and federal prisoner assaults’ relationship. The current study therefore addresses a major gap in our understanding of prisoner assaults in general and federal prisoner assault in particular. The study tested two hypotheses using a nationally representative sample of federal prisoners. First, dually disordered prisoners will be more likely than nondually disordered prisoners to report having been physically and/or sexually assaulted during the current incarceration. Second, compared with nondually disordered inmates, dually disordered inmates will be more likely to report having been formally charged with/convicted of physically assaulting prison staff or other prisoners. These predictions were expected to be true after controlling for the inmate-level factors implicated in prisoner assaults above.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0032885512467312">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study analyzed self-report data from a nationally representative sample of male and female prisoners in Federal BOP facilities (e.g., Federal Prison Camps, Federal Correctional Institutions, United States Penitentiaries, Metropolitan Correctional Centers, Administrative-Maximum, and the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners). These data came from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ <italic>Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2004</italic> (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, Study No. 4572) using a two stage probability sample, with stage one selecting individual prisons and stage two selecting inmates (<italic>N</italic> = 3,686). Inmates with mismatched prison admission date for the controlling offense and recent (prior) admission date<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032885512467312">1</xref></sup> were excluded. Inmates in state prisons were excluded for two reasons. First, the prevalence of mental illness among state inmates is greater than that of federal inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512467312">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). A larger proportion of higher functioning inmates in federal prisons (e.g., convicted of white collar and political corruption crimes, drug dealers) compared to state prisons is one possibility. Next, we wanted to use a single prison system to test our hypotheses, as the policies and practices of facilities within a single prison system should have greater consistency compared to facilities across multiple prison systems. The final sample size was 2,973. To adjust for sampling error in all the analyses we used the appropriate sampling weights provided in the dataset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0032885512467312">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p><italic>Assault victims</italic> (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) were inmates who sought medical care after having been intentionally injured by someone else during the current incarceration. Injuries ranged from minor (e.g., bruises) to life threatening (e.g., knife wounds, internal injuries). To be considered an assault victim, inmates had to say <italic>yes</italic> to the questions “since your admission on [date], have you been injured in a fight, assault, or incident in which someone tried to harm you?” and “did you see a doctor, nurse, or other health care person for the injur(<italic>ies</italic>)? Inmates who said they were not injured during an assault or fight since their admission to prison were coded as having not been assaulted. Inmates that reported being injured during an assault but did not seek medical attention were excluded. This was done in order to screen out ambiguous or minor incidents.</p>
<p><italic>Assault perpetrators</italic> (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) were inmates charged with or convicted of physically assaulting staff members and/or other inmates during the current incarceration. Inmates were categorized as having perpetrated physical assault if they said <italic>yes</italic> to one or both of these questions: “Since your admission [to prison], have you been written up for or been found guilty of . . . [p]hysical assault on a correctional officer or other staff member?” and “since your admission [to prison], have you been written up for or found guilty of . . . [p]hysical assault on another inmate?” Inmates answering <italic>no</italic> to both questions were coded as not having assaulted others. They could also be coded as not having assaulted others if they answered <italic>no</italic> to the question, “Since your admission on [date], have you been written up for or found guilty of breaking any prison rules?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0032885512467312">
<title>Main Predictor Variable</title>
<p>A dummy coded dual disorders variable was the main predictor variable (1 = present). To be categorized as having dual disorders, inmates had to first meet the study criteria for having a SMI. Inmates had to first report having “ever been told by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, that [they] had” a depressive disorder, manic-depression, bipolar disorder, mania, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and/or PTSD (Criterion A). If Criterion A was met, it had to be established with some certainty that the disorders were present before the current incarceration. Criterion B required that inmates report having received one or more of these mental health services in the year before the arrest leading to the present incarceration: Psychotropic medication, hospitalization, therapy/counseling, or “any other mental health treatment or services.”</p>
<p>Requiring inmates to have received treatment services before their last arrest served the dual purposes of increasing the likelihood that inmates had a serious and chronic disorder, and established the presence of a major mental illness <italic>before</italic> the inmate was a victim or perpetrator of assault in prison. So as to improve their classification as mentally ill or not mentally ill before entering prison, two inmates that said they had ever been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, manic-depression, bipolar disorder, mania, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and/or PTSD but never received psychiatric treatment during the year before arrest were excluded from the analyses. For a major mental disorder to be categorized as absent, inmates must have actively indicated that they were never diagnosed with any of the aforementioned disorders. Inmates were also categorized as not having a major mental disorder if they only indicated that they had been diagnosed with disorders such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders (besides PTSD), or any other unspecified mental disorder.</p>
<p>Next was determining if inmates had a substance abuse issue in the year before admission to prison. This was a two-step process. The survey asked inmates 12 yes/no questions about their abuse of drugs and alcohol and 22 yes/no questions about drug and alcohol dependence in the year before their admission to prison (e.g., Did you lose a job because of your drinking [abuse]? Did you continue to use drugs even though it was causing emotional or psychological problems [dependence]?). The 34 survey items were compared with the respective Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for abuse and dependence (e.g., legal problems, interpersonal problems, persistent desire to stop). In step one, each abuse and dependence criterion was dichotomized (0 = <italic>not met</italic>, 1 = <italic>met</italic>). In step two, inmates endorsing at least one alcohol or drug abuse criteria <italic>or</italic> at least three alcohol or drug dependence criteria were coded as having a substance abuse problem in the year before their prison admission. Inmates were coded as not having a substance abuse problem during this period if they did not meet the above cut off criteria for substance abuse or dependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0032885512467312">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>Each model had up to 12 control variables. The variables’ inclusion and predicted relationships with inmate assaults were based upon a review of the literature on prison misconduct in general and inmate assaults in particular. The first was <italic>gender</italic> which was dummy coded (1 = female). Inmates’ race and ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic) were represented by four dummy variables (1 = yes): <italic>White non-Hispanic</italic> (reference group); <italic>Black non-Hispanic; Hispanic</italic>; and, <italic>Other Races non-Hispanic</italic>. Next, to account for the ages that inmates’ risk of being an assault victim or perpetrator began, their estimated <italic>age when beginning their current incarceration</italic> was calculated. First, the number of years passing between the time they entered prison and the survey’s administration was calculated. This number was subtracted from the inmates’ age when the survey was administered. The last demographic variable was inmates’ <italic>highest school grade completed</italic> before the current incarceration (0 = <italic>never attended, or attended/completed kindergarten only</italic>, 17 = <italic>completed at least one year of graduate school</italic>).</p>
<p>There were three incarceration history variables. The first was the <italic>number of prior incarcerations</italic> (0 = <italic>0 incarcerations</italic>, 4 = <italic>4 or more</italic>). Next was <italic>years spent in prison for the current incarceration</italic>. This variable was included in order to take into account inmates’ time at risk for assault and based upon the number of years between when inmates entered prison and took the survey. Whether the inmate was currently <italic>incarcerated for a violent offense</italic> was represented by a dummy coded variable (1 = yes). For inmates on parole or probation when returned to custody, or inmates returned to custody after an escape, this variable took into account the original and new offenses.</p>
<p><italic>Ever diagnosed with a personality disorder</italic> was a dummy coded psychiatric control variable (1 = yes). To be classified as a yes, inmates had to report having ever been told by a mental health professional that they had a personality disorder such as antisocial or borderline personality disorder. Next, a dummy coded variable was used to capture inmates’ experiences (before the present incarceration) with having been <italic>physically and/or sexually victimized in the past</italic> (1 = yes). One way inmates could be coded yes is if they said <italic>yes</italic> to the question, “Before your admission to prison on [date], had anyone ever pressured or forced you to have any sexual contact against your will, that is, touching of [sex organs, or oral, anal, or vaginal sex]?” Another way inmates could be coded yes is if they had ever been injured as a result of physical abuse and/or assault before the current incarceration. These injuries ranged from minor (e.g., bruises) to serious (e.g., broken bones) to life threatening (e.g., being stabbed, internal injuries). Inmates were categorized as not having been physically or sexually victimized before if they denied any unwanted sexual contact or activities and denied any physical assaults (or reported assaults/abuse but without injuries).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0032885512467312">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>Univariate and bivariate analyses were first conducted in order to assess the prevalence of inmate assaults, demographic characteristics, dual psychiatric and substance abuse disorders, incarceration and abuse histories, and personality disorder diagnoses. Formal hypothesis testing used hierarchical logistic regression (SPSS 19.0) as assault victimization and perpetration were dichotomous outcomes. Sample weights were used in all of the analyses. Both hypotheses were tested using models with an identical sequence of predictor variables. Model I controlled for inmate demographics and length of time incarcerated. In every model inmates’ length of time incarcerated was controlled for as they had varying periods of risk for assault victimization and perpetration. Model II added dual disorder status, the primary predictor variable. Model III added lifetime personality disorder diagnoses, number of prior incarcerations, and currently incarcerated for a violent offense. Model IV then added inmates’ having ever been physically and/or sexually victimized before this incarceration.</p>
<p>So as to have a meaningful intercept, inmates’ age when admitted to prison was centered around the mean of 33.55 years but the other predictor variables remained uncentered. Each model’s intercept is interpreted, then, as the log-odds of inmates being assaulted or assaulting others if they were of average age when admitted to prison and their values on all other predictor variables equaled zero. For example, the Model I intercepts represent inmates’ log-odds of being assault victims or perpetrators if they were White males who were 33.55 years old when admitted to prison, who never attended school or only completed kindergarten, and were incarcerated for zero years when they completed the survey. The full model is represented in the equation below:</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Small proportions of inmates reported having been assaulted or of having committed an assault since being admitted to prison (6.1% and 7.1%, respectively; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032885512467312">Table 1</xref>). Inmates were mostly male (91.7%), White or Black (69.4%) though Hispanics made up nearly one quarter of the sample, between the ages of 33 and 34 years (<italic>M</italic> = 33.55), and had an 11th grade education. On average inmates were incarcerated once before (<italic>M</italic> = .94). For this incarceration, inmates were incarcerated for about four years (<italic>M</italic> = 3.88) with 28.8% incarcerated for a violent offense. Nearly four out of ten inmates reported having been physically and/or sexually victimized before the current incarceration (38.2%). Over three percent were ever diagnosed with a personality disorder (3.4%) and nearly four percent (3.8%) had dual disorders.</p>

<p>Bivariate analyses indicated that as a whole, inmates who had been assaulted since their admission to prison were likely to have also assaulted another inmate and/or staff and vice versa (Phi = .384, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001); this relationship was especially pronounced among the dually disordered inmates (Phi = .696, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032885512467312">Table 2</xref>, assault victims were in their late 20s when admitted to prison whereas nonvictims were in their early 30s (uncentered means of 28.94 and 33.42 years, respectively; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Males were more likely to be victims (6.4%; females: 2.5%), so too non-Whites (6.7%; White: 4.6%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Victims had more prior incarcerations (<italic>M</italic> = 1.24; nonvictims: <italic>M</italic> = .92; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) and were incarcerated this time for longer (<italic>M</italic> = 7.39 years; nonvictims: <italic>M</italic> = 3.60 years; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Violent offenders were more likely to be assault victims (9.5%) than nonviolent offenders (4.7%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Inmates who had been physically and/or sexually assaulted before this incarceration were at greater risk of being assaulted in prison (9.7%) than inmates without these experiences (3.5%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Inmates ever diagnosed with a personality disorder had more risks of being assaulted (12.0%) than inmates without personality disorders (5.9%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Finally, dually disordered inmates were more likely to be assaulted in prison (11.6%) than nondually disordered inmates (5.5%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05).</p>

<p>Like assault victims, assault perpetrators were in their late 20s when admitted to prison whereas nonperpetrators were in their early 30s (uncentered means of 27.43 and 33.52 years, respectively; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001); perpetrators were more likely to be non-White (8.2%; White: 4.5%), and to have just a 10th grade education (versus the nonperpetrators 11th grade education; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Perpetrators had more prior incarcerations (<italic>M</italic> = 1.35; nonperpetrators: <italic>M</italic> = .90) and for this incarceration, imprisoned longer (<italic>M</italic> = 7.33 years; nonperpetrators: <italic>M</italic> = 3.59 years; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Violent offenders were more likely to perpetrate an assault (12.5%) than nonviolent offenders (4.9%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Inmates physically and/or sexually assaulted before this incarceration were at greater risk of perpetrating an assault in prison (11.7%) than inmates without these experiences (4.3%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Inmates diagnosed with a personality disorder were more likely to assault others (14.1%) than inmates not diagnosed with these disorders (6.9%; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01). Importantly, there was no bivariate association between dual disorder status and perpetration of assault.</p>
<p>Multivariate analyses were conducted to explore further the differences between assault victims and nonvictims. More specifically, four models were used to assess inmates’ likelihood of being an assault victim in prison (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0032885512467312">Table 3</xref>). As each predictor variable’s variance inflation factor (VIF) was under 1.7, collinearity was not a concern. However, though each model’s <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> indicated a satisfactory fit with the data (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Hosmer and Lemeshow tests for the first two models indicated an unsatisfactory fit (Model I <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(8) = 18.218, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Model II <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(8) = 15.862, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Some caution is thus warranted when interpreting the relevant regression coefficients. Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values ranged from .125 to .164.</p>

<p>The first model used years incarcerated and inmate demographics to predict assault victimization. Three predictor variables were statistically significant: years spent in prison for the current incarceration; other non-Hispanic races; and, inmate age when admitted to prison. The intercept (–4.292, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) reflects the average log-odds of being assaulted in prison for newly admitted White inmates of average age (33.55 years) when admitted to prison. After controlling for each of the other predictors, the log-odds of being assaulted went up by .129 with each passing year in prison (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) and by .776 for inmates of other non-Hispanic races (relative to Whites; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Also, for each year they were below the average age when admitted to prison, inmates’ log-odds of being assaulted increased by .048; however, for each year they were above the average age, inmates’ log-odds of being assaulted decreased by .048 (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001).</p>
<p>The second model added the dual disorders variable. After controlling for each of the other predictor variables, dually disordered inmates had greater log-odds of being assaulted in prison than nondually disordered inmates (1.027, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). As in Model I, inmates were at more risk of being assaulted the longer they were incarcerated (.132, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001), if they were of other non-Hispanic races (relative to Whites; .802, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), and with each year they were below the average inmate age when admitted to prison (–.049, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Inmates’ log-odds of being assaulted were lower with each year above the average inmate age when admitted to prison.</p>
<p>In Model III, personality disorder status, number of prior incarcerations, and currently incarcerated for a violent offense were added as predictor variables. Controlling for all other predictors, the log-odds of being assaulted increased by 1.094 for dually disordered inmates (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Likewise, inmates’ risk of being assaulted increased the longer they were incarcerated (.128, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001); the more prior incarcerations experienced (.168, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05); if they were another non-Hispanic race (compared to Whites; .800, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05); and with each year they were below the average inmate age when admitted to prison (–.052, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Unlike the previous models, the log-odds of being assaulted in prison went up as inmates became more educated (.086, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). With each year above the average inmate age when admitted to prison, however, the risk of being assaulted decreased.</p>
<p>Inmates’ past experiences with physical and/or sexual victimization was added as a predictor variable in Model IV. Controlling for all other predictor variables, the log-odds of being assaulted increased by .905 for dually disordered inmates (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Similarly, inmates’ risk of being assaulted went up the longer they were incarcerated (.130, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001); if they were of another non-Hispanic race (compared to Whites; .834, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05); with each year below the average inmate age when admitted to prison (–.047, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001); the more education they had (.102, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05); and if they were physically and/or sexually victimized before this incarceration (.933, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Again inmates’ log-odds of being assaulted decreased with each year above the average inmate age when admitted to prison. Finally, unlike the preceding model, the number of prior incarcerations had no relation to inmates being assaulted.</p>
<p>While a bivariate relationship between the dual disorders and inmates’ likelihood of perpetrating assault inside prison was absent, the planned multivariate analyses proceeded. These analyses were warranted due to the possibility that other inmate-level factors such as prior victimizations and incarceration histories were suppressing the dual disorders and assault perpetration relationship. A set of four multivariate models, identical to those used to test the relationship between dual disorders and assault victimization, were tested here (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0032885512467312">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Collinearity was not an issue as each predictor’s VIF was under 1.7. Each model had satisfactory fit with the data as indicated by their respective model <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Hosmer and Lemeshow test (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> values ranged from .156 to .193. Models II through IV show that after controlling for all other predictor variables, inmates’ log-odds of assaulting others were no different if they were dually or nondually disordered (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). As the respective log-odds indicate the most consistent predictors of inmates’ risk of assaulting others were how long they were imprisoned during this incarceration (.106-.120, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001), whether they were White or another non-Hispanic and non-Black race (.739-.795, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), their age when admitted to prison for this incarceration (–.062- –.066, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001), and whether they were incarcerated for a violent offense (.427-.494, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). In Model IV, having ever been physically and/or sexually victimized before this incarceration was another good predictor of inmates’ risk of assaulting others (.805, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Federal inmates’ involvement in prison-based assaults, whether as victim or perpetrator, was not very common: About one of every 15 inmates said they were assaulted or had assaulted others since their admission to prison. Less common were inmates who met study criteria for dual psychiatric and substance use disorders; even rarer were inmates who met study criteria for a SMI only (2%)—that is, they did not have a co-occurring substance use disorder (these results not reported above). Thus, irrespective of whether they misused drugs or alcohol before entering prison, fewer than six percent of the sample had a SMI (e.g., schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD) as defined in this study.</p>
<p>As predicted, dually disordered inmates were more likely to be injured as a result of an assault than nondually disordered inmates. That is, inmates with dual psychiatric and substance use disorders were at more risk of being assaulted than inmates with a SMI only, a substance use disorder only, and inmates with neither a SMI nor substance use disorder. Recall that to be classified as dually disordered, inmates had to have: ever been diagnosed with a psychotic-spectrum disorder, an affective disorder, and/or PTSD; received treatment for a mental condition within one year before the arrest leading to the current incarceration; and met diagnostic criteria for substance abuse/dependence in the year before the most recent prison admission. This suggests that dually disordered inmates are “importing” into the prison an inherent vulnerability to victimization. Additional research is required to confirm this and to explore whether dually disordered inmates experience severer “pains of imprisonment” than their nondually disordered peers. These data did not even permit a tentative answer to the latter question.</p>
<p>Not knowing how the access, or lack thereof, to proper psychiatric and substance abuse treatment affects dually disordered inmates’ victimization risks is unfortunate, so too not knowing whether these inmates’ consumption of illicit substances in prison contributes to their victimization. Heavily medicated inmates may be especially vulnerable to victimization by other inmates because the sedation so alters their awareness of their surroundings and ability to quickly respond to threats. Because it causes them to respond more slowly to correctional officer commands, the sedation may lead to an inmate being assaulted by correctional officers. Missed diagnoses happen and even if clinical staff correctly diagnose inmates and devise effective treatment plans, inmates sometimes reject treatment outright or become noncompliant over time. Left untreated, they may socially withdraw and isolate themselves, becoming more vulnerable to predatory inmates; there may be an onset of delusions or hallucinations causing them to resist correctional officer demands (e.g., to vacate their cell) with officers forcibly gaining compliance (e.g., a forced extraction); or they may be assaulted because their verbal outbursts are especially irritating or interpreted by others as a possible threat.</p>
<p>While dually disordered inmates were more likely than nondually disordered inmates to be assaulted in prison, the risks of assaulting others were no different for the two groups. On the one hand, this finding may be the result of too little statistical power in the models. While the correlations between assault victimization and assault perpetration were moderate to strong, there were relatively few inmates with dual disorders; even rarer were dually disordered inmates charged with/convicted of assaulting others (less than 1% of the overall sample).</p>
<p>Indications are this is a genuine finding, however. Logistic regression was used for hypothesis testing even though six to seven percent of the overall sample was an assault victim or perpetrator, respectively. There were nevertheless concerns that the study outcomes were uncommon enough to warrant the use of negative binomial regression (NBR). NBR is appropriate when study outcomes are rare, the outcome variables are overdispersed (i.e., standard deviations &gt; mean), and it is unreasonable to assume the multivariate models account for all of the outcome variables’ variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512467312">Cameron &amp; Trivedi, 1998</xref>). NBR (STATA 11.0) was subsequently used to test eight nearly identical models and the results were similar to those of the logistic regression models: Dually disordered inmates were at more risk of being assaulted in prison but at no more or less risk of assaulting others (results available upon request).</p>
<p>Nearly four of every ten inmates said that they had been physically and/or sexually assaulted before this incarceration, the significance of this being that such experiences were strong predictors of inmates’ involvement in prison-based assaults (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0032885512467312">Table 3</xref>). In analyses not reported above, nearly three of every ten dually disordered inmates reported a lifetime PTSD diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032885512467312">2</xref></sup> and inmates ever diagnosed with PTSD, irrespective of their dual disorders status and receipt of treatment services before prison, were more likely to report having been assaulted outside and inside prison.</p>
<p>By not restricting ourselves here to the preprison admission receipt of mental health services, the timing of inmates’ victimization and PTSD diagnosis cannot be ascertained. The data nevertheless portray a complex interplay of past assault victimization, PTSD, a preincarceration substance abuse history, and prison-based assault victimization and assault perpetration. This is not surprising considering that in the community, having been assaulted raises peoples’ risk of depression, PTSD, and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512467312">Hedtke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032885512467312">Kilpatrick et al., 1997</xref>), and worsens the clinical prognoses of some mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032885512467312">Neria, Bromet, Carlson, &amp; Naz, 2005</xref>). Having ever been diagnosed with PTSD raises the chances it will return following a subsequent traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032885512467312">Breslau, Peterson, &amp; Schultz, 2008</xref>), and puts people at risk of future victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512467312">Ullman et al., 2009</xref>) and violence towards others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0032885512467312">Collins &amp; Bailey, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-0032885512467312">
<title>Study Implications for Policy and Practice</title>
<p>An important study implication for policy and practice is that effective screening of inmates for prior traumas and trauma-related disorders (i.e., PTSD, acute stress disorder), and current trauma-related disorders should be part and parcel of any prison admission process. Inmates currently symptomatic for PTSD or acute stress disorder should be offered appropriate therapies. Likewise, inmates that have been assaulted after prison admission will require further screening for trauma-related symptomology and prophylactic therapy. These recommendations are equally applicable for dually and nondisordered inmates. Because of their daily contact with inmates, correctional officers are perfectly situated to identify recently assaulted inmates and to refer them for further assessment and treatment. Officers, then, may need to be educated about how to identify assault victims and how to respond in an appropriate and sensitive manner.</p>
<p>Just as important are prompt and accurate mental health and substance use assessments at prison admission and throughout inmates’ incarceration. Again because of their daily contact with inmates, correctional officers are perfectly situated to identify inmates with psychiatric and substance abuse issues and to refer them for further assessment and treatment. Correctional officers should therefore be given specialized training as to the particular challenges of working with dually disordered inmates.</p>
<p>Likewise, prison-based treatment programs that target inmates psychiatric and substance use disorders need to be widely available to dually disordered inmates. Evidence indicates that such programs help to reduce postrelease substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512467312">Sullivan, McKendrick, Sacks, &amp; Banks, 2007</xref>) and returns to custody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032885512467312">Sacks, Sacks, McKendrick, Banks, &amp; Stommel, 2004</xref>). The Lexington Federal Medical Center has a dual disorders treatment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032885512467312">Federal Bureau of Prisons, 2010</xref>) and there is the specialized “Challenge Program” that “. . . targets high-risk offenders with histories of substance abuse and/or mental illness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512467312">2009</xref>, p. 28) in 15 United States Penitentiaries. If the programs are shown to be effective in remedying the psychosocial pathologies associated with dual disorders, a potential—albeit unintended—treatment effect is that dually disordered inmates experience less victimization in prison.</p>

<sec id="section13-0032885512467312">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>A study assumption was that due to their severer psychopathology, dually disordered inmates would have more involvement in prison-based assaults than nondually disordered inmates. Along these lines, an open question was whether dually disordered inmates would have more involvement in assaults than SMI only inmates. Is it the SMI itself (regardless of substance abuse status) that raises inmates’ risk of being assaulted? Or does the substance use disorder somehow boost mentally ill inmates’ psychological and social vulnerability to victimization in prison? And what psychiatric disorders are most strongly related with inmates’ involvement in assaults? Some evidence suggests that disorder type is related to inmates’ involvement in assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512467312">Blitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512467312">Friedman, Melnick, Jiang, &amp; Hamilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Circumstances precluded our exploring these questions further. First was the paucity of SMI only inmates. Second was the survey’s diagnostic imprecision. Except for PTSD the survey does not distinguish among the different types of manic disorders (e.g., Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II), depressive disorders (e.g., major depression vs. dysthymia), or psychotic disorders (e.g., psychosis not otherwise specified vs. schizophrenia subtypes vs. schizoaffective disorder). Had we tried to compare diagnostic categories (e.g., PTSD vs. psychotic disorders) the relative paucity of mentally ill inmates would have resulted in even lower statistical power.</p>
<p>In the overall sample, it was not unusual for assault victims to have also assaulted others (and vice versa). This relationship was especially pronounced among dually disordered inmates. The timing of these events unfortunately cannot even be approximated due to limitations in the survey. It is also not known how frequently inmates were assaulted; when in the incarceration they were involved in an assault; the assault victimization and assault perpetration sequence; or the particular circumstances of the assaults (e.g., mutual inmate-on-inmate combat, assaulted by staff or other inmates). Also, the study used retrospective self-report data. For inmates incarcerated a decade or more, there were ample opportunities for errors in inmates memories.</p>
<p>Researchers are increasingly expected to use multilevel modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512467312">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) to study inmate misconduct and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0032885512467312">Camp, Gaes, Langan, &amp; Saylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512467312">Lahm, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512467312">Wolff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0032885512467312">Wooldredge et al., 2001</xref>). Put simply, inmate behavior is guided by the particular characteristics of that inmate and by the characteristics of their physical and social environment. Inmates are for example often assigned to housing units comprised of inmates with similar security classifications. Compared with inmates with minimum or medium security classifications, inmates classified as maximum security will have greater contact with violence prone inmates and correctional officers who are more likely to resort to physical force. Although the dataset had an identification number for the prison the survey was administered, we had no basis for expecting it to be the same prison the assaults occurred.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study contributes to the literature by having used a nationally representative sample of federal prisoners, all asked the same questions, to model inmate assault victimization and perpetration. That is, after taking into account inmate characteristics found by others to be related to assaults, our study found dually disordered inmates across federal correctional facilities to be more likely to be assaulted in prison.</p>

<p>The survey used multiple prison admission dates with two admission dates of particular relevance here: (a) The prison admission date for the controlling offense (i.e., the original offense leading to imprisonment now) and (b) any recent (prior) admission for another offense (survey items STORAGE ITEM 2D and REC _ADMIN_DATE, respectively). For example, a parolee was readmitted to prison on some date after committing a robbery (STORAGE ITEM 2D); the reason the parolee had been in prison before being discharged to parole was for committing a burglary and the REC_ADMIN_DATE represents the date they entered prison for the burglary.</p>
<p>For inmates who reported the month(s) and year(s) of their respective prison admission dates but not the day(s), we calculated their admission dates as being on the 15th of the month reported.</p>

<p>Assuming they met the preincarceration treatment and substance abuse requirements, inmates could be categorized as dually disordered if they reported a PTSD diagnosis by itself or in addition to a mood or psychotic disorder.</p>
