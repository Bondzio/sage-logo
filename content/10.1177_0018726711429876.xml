<abstract>
<p>This study investigated how the controllability attributional style of an employee influences the effect of participative leadership on psychological empowerment and work performance. The controllability attributional style refers to the extent to which employees habitually attribute their negative organizational experiences such as failures and setbacks to controllable or uncontrollable causes. The results of two studies consistently showed that participative leadership had a weaker impact on employees’ psychological empowerment for those who had a low rather than high controllability attributional style. In Study 2, psychological empowerment was found to fully mediate the joint effect of participative leadership and the controllability attributional style on the objective work performance of employees measured a month later.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been established that participative management enhances employees’ work motivation, sense of control, and job performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711429876">Ahearne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711429876">Arnold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711429876">Leach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711429876">Sashkin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711429876">Seibert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711429876">Wagner and Gooding, 1987</xref>). However, prior research has shown that some employees remain passive and indifferent towards participative management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711429876">Foster-Fishman et al., 1998</xref>). Although a few empirical studies have indirectly addressed this phenomenon by showing that these passive reactions towards participative management are more prevalent for employees with more organizational experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711429876">Ahearne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2006</xref>), we still do not know what psychological processes drive these passive behaviors. In the current study, I propose that one potential and fundamental explanation for this phenomenon may lie in the findings of a series of experiments on dogs conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711429876">Overmier and Seligman (1967)</xref> over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>In these experiments, the researchers completely immobilized the dogs and then repeatedly inflicted electric shocks on them. At the beginning, the dogs struggled and attempted to escape, to no avail. After repeated failures to free themselves, the animals discontinued their attempts to escape and passively accepted the shocks. Afterwards, when the experimenters removed the harness and allowed the dogs to escape, they were surprised to find that the dogs made no attempt to get away. This was because when the dogs formed an expectation that their aversive experience was caused by uncontrollable factors independent of their efforts, they were likely to give up and thus exhibited such passive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711429876">Peterson et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Analogously, negative organizational experiences such as failures and setbacks are unavoidable; but when employees repeatedly experience limited control over the causes of such experiences and their efforts do not pay off because of the harness of organizational control and bureaucratic constraints, they are likely to start habitually attributing unmet expectations and negative experiences at work to uncontrollable causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711429876">Ashforth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Gardner, 1982</xref>). When managers try to return a certain amount of control to employees using a participative style of management, these employees may remain passive and indifferent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711429876">Atwater et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711429876">Labianca et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711429876">Randolph, 2000</xref>). Drawing from attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711429876">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711429876">Overmier and Seligman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1979</xref>), I propose a novel approach to understanding why some employees react passively to participative management efforts that aim to enhance their motivation and psychological empowerment. I posit that the extent to which employees habitually attribute negative work-related experiences to controllable or uncontrollable causes may determine how participative leadership influences their feelings of empowerment and subsequent work performance.</p>
<p>This research contributes to the literature in three ways: first, by illuminating why participative leadership may induce a higher level of psychological empowerment and better work performance for some employees but not for others; second, by bringing the role of attributional style to the forefront to clarify how the habit of causal explanations influences an employee’s cognitive and behavioral reactions; and third, by providing practicing managers with insights into the origins of employee indifference towards participative management and possible means for optimizing the effectiveness of such management efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018726711429876">
<title>Controllability attributional style</title>
<p>Research on attributional styles has its roots in a series of experimental studies on animal learning deficits, on the basis of which researchers developed the theory of learned helplessness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711429876">Maier and Seligman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711429876">Overmier and Seligman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711429876">Seligman and Maier, 1967</xref>). The results of these experiments have consistently shown that exposing animals to uncontrollable rather than controllable aversive conditions (e.g. repeated and inescapable electrical shocks) inhibits their learning and generates passive behaviors.</p>
<p>When extending this research to human subjects, researchers have turned their focus on the cognitive processes of humans and have developed a reformulated model of learned helplessness. Central to this reformulated model are people’s habits of giving causal explanations for the events they experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711429876">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711429876">1985</xref>). People develop these habits of causal explanations based on their experience to make the social world predictable and controllable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711429876">Kelley, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711429876">Pittman and Heller, 1987</xref>). When people encounter important events that elude their control, they attempt to make sense of them in terms of causes. Over time, they may develop habits of causal explanations for certain repeated experiences. More importantly, attributional habits may also be developed from observation of others, cultural stereotypes, and information regarding particular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711429876">Peterson et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this attributional perspective, researchers have proposed that people’s learning and motivational deficits are associated with their habitual causal explanations or attributional styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711429876">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711429876">1985</xref>). People with learning and motivational deficits or learned helplessness tend to attribute negative events and the experience of failure to internal, stable, global, unintentional, and uncontrollable causes. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Gardner (1982)</xref> proposed that cues from the organizational context, together with an employee’s past organizational experiences, shape the habitual causal explanations that an employee will give for organizational events. For example, some employees may be constantly exposed to work conditions where their sense of self-control is denied despite initial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711429876">Ashforth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711429876">Ashforth and Saks, 2000</xref>). Typically, such organizational experiences may make these employees expect failure, and their passive behavior and performance deficits are likely to continue even after environmental changes enable the possibility of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Garden, 1982</xref>). Hence, many of the passive and maladaptive behaviors of employees may well be caused by such organizationally induced attributional styles.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711429876">Kent and Martinko (1995)</xref> identified six dimensions of organizational attributional styles: internal causality, external causality, stability, controllability, globality, and intentionality. They argued that among these six dimensions, controllability attributional style is particularly relevant to our understanding of motivational deficits because it is related to achievement motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1979</xref>) and better reflects an employee’s sense of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711429876">Rosenbaum, 1972</xref>). Controllability<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726711429876">1</xref></sup> represents the extent to which an individual sees a cause as being under his or her control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1979</xref>); it also tends to influence the effort the individual will devote to changing the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711429876">Rosenbaum, 1972</xref>). When individuals consider their negative and aversive organizational experiences to be caused by uncontrollable factors, they are likely to believe that outcomes are independent of their efforts and that they are unable to exert personal control and influence them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711429876">Greenberger and Strasser, 1986</xref>). As a result, they tend to exhibit motivational deficits. Therefore, I focus only on the controllability dimension of the organizational attributional style. It should be noted that controllability attributional style is conceptually distinct from locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711429876">Rotter, 1966</xref>). The former refers to judgments about the causes of events, whereas the latter ‘is a belief about the nature of reinforcement – that is, about rewards and punishments in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711429876">Peterson et al., 1993</xref>: 145). In the following sections, I develop specific hypotheses on how the controllability attributional style influences the effect that participative leadership behavior has on psychological empowerment and work performance.</p>

<sec id="section3-0018726711429876">
<title>The moderating role of the controllability attributional style</title>
<p>Participative leadership aims to increase the participation of followers by providing them with greater discretion, attention, autonomy, and influence, and to share problem solving with followers by consulting them before making a decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711429876">Bass, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711429876">Nystrom, 1990</xref>). These behaviors are likely to enhance employees’ psychological empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711429876">Conger and Kanungo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711429876">Thomas and Velthouse, 1990</xref>), which is a set of cognitive intrinsic task assessments with four interrelated components: impact, competence, meaningfulness, and choice. Employees feel psychologically empowered when both outcome expectancy and self-efficacy expectancy can be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711429876">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711429876">1986</xref>). Particularly, the experience of participation generates the expectancy that more effort will be associated with higher performance, that performance will result in meaningful outcomes, and that one has control over the effort one puts into the work.</p>
<p>In the model of psychological empowerment proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711429876">Thomas and Velthouse (1990)</xref>, attributional style plays a central role in shaping how environmental events such as leadership behavior influence an employee’s cognitive processes of psychological empowerment. They view attributional styles as ‘developed habits rather than innate abilities. These habits are relatively isolated from day-to-day learning activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711429876">Thomas and Velthouse, 1990</xref>: 677). If an individual has a more pessimistic attributional style, he or she may have predictable negative expectancies of success at subsequent tasks and upon actual performance. As a result, participative leadership may not produce positive expectancies for him or her. Surprisingly, no research has investigated the role of attributional style in the cognitive processes of psychological empowerment. My key contention is that the habit of uncontrollable causal explanations for aversive organizational experiences such as failures and setbacks may disrupt the cognitive processes of psychological empowerment and inhibit the development of positive expectancies.</p>
<p>Specifically, controllability attributional style is an individual difference construct. Employees may have different work experiences and may come from different working environments. The differences in work experiences and backgrounds may give rise to different attributional styles or interpretation habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711429876">Kent and Martinko, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Gardner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711429876">Thomas and Velthouse, 1990</xref>). Employees who habitually attribute negative organizational experiences to uncontrollable causes tend to believe that they are unable to alter these experiences, failures, and setbacks; that is, they tend to see effort and outcomes as independent. They are thus likely to suffer from motivational deficits that tend to suppress positive expectancies. Consequently, even if they are given more opportunities to exercise self-control by participative leaders, they may not develop strong self-efficacy expectancies or outcome expectancies. In other words, an uncontrollability attributional style may disrupt the cognitive processes through which participative leadership behavior is translated into psychological empowerment. Hence, for these employees, such leadership behavior is less effective in inducing psychological empowerment. By contrast, employees who habitually attribute negative outcomes and aversive organizational experiences to controllable causes are prone to believe that they are capable of exercising personal control over the negative events and altering the negative outcomes if they make an effort. They tend to develop expectancies that outcomes are dependent on their own effort. When given opportunities to participate in decision making, they are more likely to develop the expectancies that they can influence their work environment, they are able to perform tasks, their work is meaningful, and they have more control over their work. In other words, a low level of controllability may weaken while a high level may strengthen the positive effect of participative leadership on an employee’s psychological empowerment. Therefore, I hypothesize the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The positive relationship between participative leadership and psychological empowerment is weaker for employees with a low than for those with a high controllability attributional style.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The literature is replete with inconsistent findings regarding the association between participative management and employee work performance. Although some quantitative reviews have shown a positive link between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711429876">Cotton et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711429876">Miller and Monge, 1986</xref>), others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711429876">Schweiger and Leana, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711429876">Wagner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711429876">Wagner and Gooding, 1987</xref>). To address the inconsistent findings regarding the association between participative management and work outcomes, researchers have identified several situational moderators of participative management, such as group size, task interdependence, task complexity, performance standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711429876">Wagner and Gooding, 1987</xref>), as well as individual-level moderators such as individual values and culture-specific efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711429876">Lam et al., 2002</xref>), role identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711429876">Zhang and Bartol, 2010</xref>), positive self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711429876">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>), organizational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), and organizational experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711429876">Ahearne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, I contend that the controllability attributional style is a salient individual-level factor that may provide fresh insights into situations when participative leadership has a stronger impact on work performance. I also suggest that psychological empowerment is a critical mechanism underlying the joint effects of participative leadership and controllability on performance.</p>
<p>Research has generally shown that participative leadership tends to transmit its effects on work performance through psychological empowerment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711429876">Seibert et al., 2004</xref>). In other words, participative leadership is likely to induce psychological empowerment, which is then associated with enhanced work performance. In Hypothesis 1, I posit that the effect of participative leadership on psychological empowerment depends on one’s controllability attributional style. When controllability is lower, the positive relationship between participative leadership and psychological empowerment will be weaker. Extending this argument, when employees have a low controllability attributional style, the impact of participative leadership on their work performance should be relatively weak, because such leadership is less effective in inducing psychological empowerment for these employees. Stated differently, when employees habitually attribute negative organizational events to uncontrollable causes, they may lack motivation to change work outcomes. Even if their participative supervisors give them opportunities to make contributions and have an influence on their work, they may not expect their efforts to result in desirable outcomes. Consequently, the influence of participative leadership on their work performance will be limited. By contrast, participative leadership behavior may induce a high level of work performance when employees have a high controllability attributional style, because they are more likely to experience psychological empowerment. Employees who habitually attribute negative outcomes and organizational experience to controllable causes will be motivated to try to change the outcomes. When given an opportunity to be involved in decision making and to contribute, they will be more likely to form the expectation that their involvement can make a difference, and thus to put more effort into their work. The findings of two studies offer some initial evidence for the moderating role of controllability attributional style. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711429876">Ahearne et al. (2005)</xref> and Huang et al. (2004) discovered that the positive relationship between participative leadership behavior and self efficacy is weaker for employees with more work experience and organizational tenure. Huang et al. (2004) explicitly pointed out that the indifference of long-tenured employees towards participative leadership may result from their past organizational experience of repeatedly being exposed to work conditions where their sense of self-control is denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711429876">Ashforth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711429876">Ashforth and Saks, 2000</xref>). The experience of an inability to assume a certain amount of control over their own jobs may foster a pessimistic way of interpreting organizational events, which in turn influences the cognitive responses of long-tenured employees to participative leadership (Huang et al., 2004). Taken together, I hypothesize the following:</p>

<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Psychological empowerment mediates the interactive effect of participative leadership and the controllability attributional style on work performance.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>I conducted two studies in two telecommunication companies in China, Company A and Company B. Both companies were Fortune 500 companies and are currently listed in the New York Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Study 1 tested Hypothesis 1, which predicted that the controllability attributional style would moderate the relationship between participative leadership and psychological empowerment. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 and then examined whether psychological empowerment would mediate the joint effect of participative leadership and controllability on objectively measured work performance (Hypothesis 2). Except objective performance, all the measures used in both studies were developed originally in English and were subsequently translated in to Chinese by bilingual experts. The Chinese questions were then back-translated into English. Finally, the back-translated English version was compared with the original English edition for equivalence and agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711429876">Brislin, 1980</xref>).</p>

<p>Study 1 included office support staff and frontline sales representatives of Company A, which was located in China’s Shandong province. Two research assistants and I visited the company in person to conduct the survey. The respondents received a questionnaire containing questions regarding the participative leadership behavior of their immediate supervisors, their own psychological empowerment, and their controllability attributional style, as well as a return envelope and a letter of introduction. To ensure confidentiality, the respondents were instructed to seal the completed questionnaires in the return envelopes and returned them directly to the researchers onsite. Of the 281 questionnaires distributed, 231 were returned with a response rate of about 82 percent. Of the 231 employees, 71 percent were female. Employee age ranged from 21 to 51, with a mean of 26.7 years. Average tenure was 3.7 years.</p>

<p>I measured the attributional style of the respondents using items taken from the Organizational Attributional Style Questionnaire (OASQ) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711429876">Kent and Martinko (1995)</xref>. The OASQ measures people’s attributions regarding negative organizational experiences and outcomes using 16 hypothetical situations of negative work experiences and outcomes. With the help of the two CEOs and three HR managers of the two companies, I selected six hypothetical work situations that were most relevant to the work context of the respondents to include in the questionnaire. These six situations included receiving poor performance evaluations from supervisors, having suggestions rejected by the boss, getting less in pay increments, failing to achieve performance objectives, receiving complaints from external or internal customers, and obtaining no support from co-workers. The respondents were asked to write down the major cause of each negative outcome, and then to rate the extent to which this cause was under their control (1 = <italic>not at all under my control</italic>; 7 = <italic>completely under my control</italic>). I then averaged the scores of their responses on the six hypothetical situations to reflect the respondents’ <italic>controllability attributional style</italic>.</p>

<title>Confirmatory factor analyses</title>
<p>As participative leadership was moderately correlated with both controllability and psychological empowerment, I conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to distinguish the three constructs. In this model, participative leadership and controllability were estimated by their corresponding items, while psychological empowerment was estimated by the latent variables of its four dimensions. The results of the three-factor model yield a better fit than the one-factor model as well as the other three possible two-factor models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726711429876">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypothesis testing</title>
<p>I performed multiple regression analyses to test Hypothesis 1, which stated that the positive link between participative leadership and psychological empowerment would be weaker for employees with a lower controllability attributional style. To minimize the likelihood of multicollinearity problems and to facilitate comparison between the obtained coefficients, I standardized participative leadership and controllability prior to the analyses. The interaction term was the product of the standardized variables (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711429876">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>). After entering all control variables in Step 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726711429876">Table 3</xref>), in Step 2 I regressed psychological empowerment on participative leadership behavior and controllability. Participative leadership and controllability were both positively related to psychological empowerment. In Step 3, the two-way interactive effect of participative leadership and controllability on psychological empowerment was significant (β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>= .02) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726711429876">Figure 1</xref>). To determine whether the form of the interaction matched the one raised in Hypothesis 1, I tested the simple slopes of low controllability (one standard deviation lower) and high controllability (one standard deviation higher). The results showed that, in support of Hypothesis 1, participative leadership behavior was less strongly related to psychological empowerment for employees with low controllability (simple slope test: β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than for those with high controllability (simple slope test: β =.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The purpose of Study 2 was three-fold. First, I attempted to replicate the findings of Study 1 using a sample of front-line sales representatives from another telecommunications company, Company B. Second, since Company B provided me with the objective work performance data for each sales representative, I could test the mediating role of psychological empowerment in the joint effect of participative leadership and controllability on work performance (Hypothesis 2). Finally, one criticism of the controllability attributional style is that this construct is conceptually and empirically closely related to the other two dimensions of attributional styles: the internal causality and the external causality attributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711429876">Russell and Tarico, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711429876">Weiner, 1985</xref>). Also the OASQ asked respondents to make an attribution for an array of negative events, which may prompt them to make external attributions based on self-serving bias. Therefore, in Study 2, I controlled for the effects of these two attributional styles when testing the hypotheses.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section15-0018726711429876">
<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>The sample of Study 2 was drawn from a subsidiary of Company B located in Hebei province. These participants served as front-line sales representatives in 60 retail shops and were chosen randomly to take part in the study. Ten research assistants and I visited the 60 stores in person to conduct the surveys following the same procedure as in Study 1. The respondents’ objective performance was obtained from the company’s internal records. Of the 350 questionnaires distributed, 333 were returned with a response rate of about 95 percent. Of these 333 employees, 84.4 percent were female. Employee age ranged from 18 to 44 years with a mean of 23.9 years. Average tenure was 2.6 years.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Participative leadership</italic>, the <italic>controllability attributional style</italic>, and <italic>psychological empowerment</italic> were measured using the same scales as in Study 1. I measured the <italic>objective work performance</italic> of all respondents using data provided by the company. Since all respondents were front-line employees in retail stores, the company kept a record of the monthly work performance of each one. The performance scores were composed of supervisor ratings, customer ratings, service inspector ratings, scores of monthly tests of product knowledge, and peer ratings. The performance scores were collected a month after the survey and ranged from 60 to 100, with a median of 91.</p>

<sec id="section17-0018726711429876">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>As noted earlier, in addition to the demographic control variables used in Study 1, I controlled for the effects of both <italic>internal and external attributional styles</italic> in Study 2. I asked the respondents to rate the two dimensions on the same six hypothetical situations for the controllability attribution. Internal causality was measured using the item, ‘To what extent is this cause due to something about you?’ (1 = <italic>nothing to do with me</italic>; 7 = <italic>totally due to me</italic>). External causality was assessed using the item, ‘To what extent is this cause due to something about other people or circumstances?’ (1 = <italic>nothing to do with other people or circumstances</italic>; 7 = <italic>totally due to other people or circumstances</italic>). The alpha coefficients of the two dimensions were .77 and .72, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section18-0018726711429876">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In Study 2, I tested the mediated moderation hypothesis that the joint effect of participative leadership and the controllability attributional style on work performance would be mediated by psychological empowerment. A conventional analytical approach to testing this mediated moderation model would be to follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711429876">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> three-step regression analyses. Specifically, in the first step, the interactive effects of the independent and moderator variables on the mediator variables should be significant. In the second step, the interactive effects of the independent and moderating variables on the dependent variables should also be significant. Lastly, the mediator variables should be significantly related to the dependent variables, with the interactive effects of independent and moderating variables controlled for. Complete mediation occurs only when the interactive effects become non-significant in the third step.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711429876">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</xref> have raised some concerns about this three-step regression procedure. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711429876">Sobel’s (1982)</xref> test is often recommended to examine the mediating effect by testing the product term of the regression coefficient for the link between the independent variable and the mediator and that for the link between the mediator and the dependent variable. This test requires an assumption that the product term is normally distributed, yet this assumption is often violated. A solution to this concern is to use bootstrapping. Moreover, multiple regression analysis is unable to show the magnitude of the mediating effects at different levels of moderators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711429876">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</xref> have thus suggested a procedure using bootstrapping analysis to reveal these specific effects. Specifically, in the present study it was essential to show, at different levels of controllability, the extent to which psychological empowerment mediated the link between participative leadership and work performance. In other words, there was a need to directly test the proposition that when controllability is lower, the positive effect on performance will be weaker, because under such a condition participative leadership will be less effective in inducing psychological empowerment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711429876">Preacher and Hayes (2004)</xref> developed an SPSS macro to test the mediated moderation using bootstrapping; therefore, in Study 2, I report the results of regression analyses following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711429876">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> procedure as well as the results of this bootstrapping approach.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In Study 2, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726711429876">Table 1</xref> shows, participative leadership was positively correlated with the controllability attributional style (<italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and psychological empowerment (<italic>r</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), while psychological empowerment was positively related to controllability (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The magnitudes of the correlation coefficients were comparable to those in Study 1. Also, psychological empowerment was significantly and positively related to objective performance (<italic>r</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but controllability was not related to objective performance.</p>
<sec id="section20-0018726711429876">
<title>Confirmatory factor analyses</title>
<p>Following the procedure of Study 1, I performed a CFA to statistically differentiate participative leadership, controllability, and psychological empowerment. Similar to what was found in Study 1, the results of the three-factor model yield a better fit than the one-factor model as well as the other three two-factor models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726711429876">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypothesis testing</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711429876">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> three-step procedure, I first performed hierarchical multiple regression analyses to test Hypothesis 2. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018726711429876">Table 4</xref> shows, supporting Hypothesis 1, the two-way interactive effect of participative leadership and controllability on psychological empowerment was significant (β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>= .02) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726711429876">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine whether the form of the interaction matched the one raised in Hypothesis 1, I tested the simple slopes of low controllability (one standard deviation lower) and high controllability (one standard deviation higher). The simple slope tests showed that participative leadership behavior was less strongly related to psychological empowerment for employees with low controllability (simple slope test: β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than for those with high controllability (simple slope test: β = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This significant interactive effect fulfilled the first requirement for mediated moderation.</p>

<p>I then found a significant interactive effect of participative leadership and controllability on objective performance (β =.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01), thus, fulfilling the second requirement for mediated moderation. Plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726711429876">Figure 2B</xref> show that participative leadership behavior was positively related to performance for employees with high controllability (one standard deviation higher, simple slope test: β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), yet unrelated to performance for employees with low controllability (one standard deviation lower, simple slope test: β = .07, n.s.). Finally, I examined the third requirement for mediated moderation by regressing the dependent variable (objective work performance) on the mediating variable (psychological empowerment), with the interaction term of participative leadership behavior and controllability included in the equation in Step 4 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018726711429876">Table 4</xref>). The mediated moderation effect was supported, thereby substantiating Hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>Although the results of the regression analyses support the meditating role of psychological empowerment, they did not show the degree of the indirect effect at different levels of controllability. Hence, I re-examined the mediated moderation model using bootstrapping. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018726711429876">Table 5</xref> shows, I examined the conditional indirect effect of participative leadership on work performance through psychological empowerment at three values of controllability: the mean (0), one standard deviation above the mean (+1), and one standard deviation below (-1). The results indicated that all three conditional indirect effects were positive and significantly different from zero. Bootstrap confidence intervals supported these results. Also, in line with the prediction of Hypothesis 2, the magnitude of the indirect effect of participative leadership on performance through psychological empowerment was larger when the value of controllability was +1 than when -1. This result lent further support to Hypothesis 2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the central concerns of organizational behavior research is how to motivate employees and enhance their work performance. Participative management has been considered an effective way to provide employees with a stronger sense of control and motivation. However, research on the link between participative management and work performance has shown mixed results (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711429876">Wagner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711429876">Wagner and Gooding, 1987</xref>). The findings of the current study provide a possible explanation for these inconsistent findings; namely, that when an employee’s feelings of lack of control over negative organizational experiences such as failures and setbacks become chronic, participative management will be less effective in enhancing this employee’s psychological empowerment and work performance. Specifically, I found that employees who develop a lower controllability attributional style (i.e. they tend to habitually attribute negative experiences to uncontrollable causes), participative leadership behavior has a weaker positive effect on their psychological empowerment and work performance. Psychological empowerment is therefore a critical intermediating mechanism that underlies the joint effect of participative leadership and controllability on work performance.</p>
<p>These findings corroborate and complement two key explanations for the inconsistent results of the participative management–performance link in the literature. First, in a qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711429876">Labianca et al. (2000)</xref> attempted to explain the failure of introducing participative management practices in an organization from a cognitive perspective. Central to their arguments was the idea that most employees had adapted to a centralized and control-based management style and had developed cognitive schemas (a sense-making habit) to guide their reactions towards these old management practices. When the participative management practices induced a new cognitive schema, the clashes between the old and the new schemas resulted in cognitive confusion, anxiety, worries, and thus passive reactions towards the new practices. The findings of the current study offer an extension of the above explanation. Employees working in an environment that emphasizes centralized control tend to develop a low controllability attributional style because they are likely to experience a sense that they have no control over outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Gardner, 1982</xref>). The clashes between the old and the new schemas observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711429876">Labianca et al.’s (2000)</xref> study can be explained, at least in part, in terms of the mismatch between the new participative management practices and the low controllability attributional styles developed under the old centralized management practices. Employees with such an attributional style may have difficulty making sense of the new participative management practices and thus react to them passively.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711429876">Ahearne et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711429876">Huang et al. (2006)</xref> have demonstrated that participative leadership behaviors are less effective in inducing feelings of empowerment for employees with more organizational experience, because these experienced employees have more negative views of the organization, they attach less value to personal development and intrinsic motivation, and they are therefore indifferent to more opportunities to participate in decision making. The findings of the present study, however, suggest a more fundamental explanation for this phenomenon. Specifically, although participative management and empowerment practices have been advocated for decades, most organizations still adopt a centralized decision-making structure, which limits the autonomy of employees and imposes control over them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711429876">Morrison and Milliken, 2000</xref>: 713). Employees with more organizational experience are more likely to learn that they have limited control over the causes of failures and setbacks and to become habitually disposed to attribute the causes of these negative experiences to uncontrollable factors, and thus to develop motivational deficits. Such a style of attribution may prevent them from seeing participative leadership as a way to develop more competence, influence, meaning, and autonomy at work.</p>

<p>Although the current study has several methodological strengths, such as the replication of the moderating effect of the controllability attributional style on the participative leadership–empowerment link across two studies, adopting a time-lagged design in Study 2, and using an objective performance measure in Study 2, it does have four major limitations. First, despite using a time-lagged measure of performance in Study 2, I was unable to draw firm conclusions about the causality between participative leadership, psychological empowerment, and work performance. As is common in field studies, spurious relationships based on unmeasured third variables might account for the findings. Therefore, there is a need to obtain further evidence based on experimental research designs or panel data to verify the causality of the model.</p>
<p>Second, I define controllability as an individual difference construct and assume that low controllability emerges from aversive organizational experience in the past. One source of low controllability is the low participative leadership style of the immediate supervisor of the employee. If the supervisor consistently and continuously exhibits a high level of participative leadership, it is unlikely that his/her subordinates will experience a low level controllability and a high level of psychological empowerment. Controllability plays a moderating role in the relationship between participative leadership and empowerment, only if the supervisor has used low participative leadership behaviors to elicit low controllability in the past. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data, I was unable to examine this change in leadership style as well as the other possible causes of low controllability such as bureaucratic organizational practices. Future research should try to address this limitation by employing multiple-wave longitudinal surveys to disentangle the effects of current and past work experiences of the respondents.</p>
<p>Third, the respondents in the two studies came from the same type of companies and the same country, thus limiting the generalizability of the results. Both companies under investigation were large state-owned enterprises characterized by bureaucratic and centralized control. In such organizations, employees are more likely to be repeatedly exposed to work conditions where they are unable to control the causes of negative organizational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711429876">Ashforth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711429876">Ashforth and Saks, 2000</xref>), and thus are more likely to develop a low controllability attributional style. It is therefore important that future research investigate whether employees in less bureaucratic and centralized organizations would be less likely to develop such a style, and whether the moderating effect of this attributional style would be less salient in such a context. In addition, cross-cultural research has generally demonstrated that participative management effort is less effective in enhancing work outcomes in countries with a large power distance culture such as China, because in these countries, employees tend to take the hierarchical inequality for granted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711429876">Hui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711429876">Robert et al., 2000</xref>). One may expect that the participative leadership–psychological empowerment link would be stronger in countries with a smaller power distance culture, and thus the moderating role of the controllability attributional style would be less salient. Further evidence is thus clearly needed to support the cross-cultural generalizability of the model proposed in this study. Furthermore, most of the respondents have relatively short organizational tenure and work experience. Thus, many of them may have not developed a habitual attributional style. This may be the reason why across the two studies, the explained variances (i.e. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change) of the interactive effect of participative leadership and controllability on both psychological empowerment and objective performance are relatively low. Future research should test the model using respondents with longer organizational tenure and work experience.</p>
<p>Finally, when testing the moderating effect of controllability, I did not control other moderators documented in the literature, owing to the limited length of the questionnaires. In the future, researchers should try to examine whether controllability attributional style can explain the variation in the effect of participative leadership on various work-related outcomes above and beyond both situational and individual-level moderators that have been used in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711429876">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711429876">Lam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711429876">Wagner and Gooding, 1987</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for future research</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study has important implications for future research in two areas. First, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711429876">Martinko and Gardner (1982)</xref> asserted that repeated failures and setbacks experienced in organizational life may cause individual employees to develop pessimistic attributional styles that would in turn induce learning and performance deficits, this proposition has yet to be empirically examined. A fundamental question is how such negative organizational experiences give rise to a low controllability attributional style over time. One promising line of research to address this issue would be to examine the effect of the frequency and intensity of negative experiences on changes in the attributional style of newcomers using a longitudinal research design. Indeed, in the organizational socialization literature, there is growing empirical evidence that the initial excitement, enthusiasm, and job satisfaction of organizational newcomers upon joining the organization are likely to diminish over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711429876">Boswell et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711429876">2009</xref>). Researchers have explained this phenomenon in terms of the inability of organizations to help newcomers adapt to a new work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711429876">Bauer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711429876">Saks et al., 2007</xref>) and to minimize psychological contract breaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711429876">Payne et al., 2008</xref>). I would propose, however, that newcomers’ causal explanation habits, which are developed based on their day-to-day organizational experiences over time, may be a major, if not the only, cause of their motivational and performance decline.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711429876">Labianca et al. (2000)</xref> revealed that after appropriate organizational interventions focused on enhancing employee understanding of the function of participative management and building trust in the motives of top managers, employees could gradually develop new sense-making habits and come to support the newly introduced practices. Similarly, research on learned helplessness has discovered that although an uncontrollable attributional style tends to be chronic, stable, and difficult to change, after prolonged interventions that aim to rebuild effort-outcome expectancies, people may recover from motivational and learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711429876">Peterson et al., 1993</xref>). In fact, most of the studies on attributional style have focused on negative experiences. We know little about how positive experiences affect people’s attributional styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711429876">Peterson et al., 1993</xref>). A possible extension of research on attributional style would be to identify organizational and leadership practices that could help individual employees to experience more ‘successes’ rather than ‘failures’ to alter their habits of causal explanations for organizational events.</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>This study offers several implications for practicing managers. Participative management efforts have long been regarded as an effective way to secure a high level of employee motivation and engagement; but the findings of the current research suggest that this is not always the case. In particular, participative leadership tends to be less effective in driving performance for employees who no longer believe that their efforts could lead to success. Put differently, once employees come to habitually attribute their failures and setbacks to factors outside of their control, they tend to exhibit motivational and performance deficits and passively respond to participative leadership efforts. It then becomes difficult, if not impossible, for managers to alter such an attributional style.</p>
<p>Moreover, managers should pay attention to how to prevent employees from developing an uncontrollability attributional style in the first place. This can generally be achieved by providing employees with adequate autonomy to allow them to have a stronger sense of self-control, offering support and using positive reinforcement to strengthen their positive expectancies, and giving them learning and development opportunities. More importantly, managers should try to ensure consistency among various organizational practices and leadership behaviors that aim to enhance motivation and empowerment, as well as the consistency of these practices over time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings of this study shed new light on our understanding of the effectiveness of participative leadership efforts. Using the lens of attribution theory, it opens a new avenue of research into the origins of employee indifference and passive reaction towards participative management practices. It suggests that the way employees habitually interpret organizational practices may have a more profound influence on their reactions to these practices than previously recognized.</p>
