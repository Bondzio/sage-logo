<abstract>
<p>The conflict between the Chilean state and the Mapuche ethnic minority, and the history of dispossession of land, discrimination and marginalization go back to the end of the nineteenth century. The Pinochet military dictatorship made matters worse by giving their land away to big forest and hydroelectric enterprises. The end of the dictatorship produced expectations that these historical injustices would be addressed. While the post-dictatorship governments have implemented social assistance and cultural recognition policies, they have continued the economic policies put in place under the dictatorship and have criminalized social protests by sections of the Mapuche community. Meanwhile, Chilean society more broadly has remained indifferent towards the plight of Mapuche because of the pervasive narratives that depict Mapuche as standing outside the nation. Neither the state nor non-indigenous society has resolved their relationship with the Mapuche minority.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961463X11431336" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the 1992 world fair in Seville, Chile was represented by an iceberg. The feat of extracting 60 tons of ice from Patagonia and transporting and conserving it for six months during the European summer is symptomatic of the commitment of the new democratic and post-dictatorship government, which came into power in 1990, to transmitting an image of a transparent, successful, modern, dynamic and efficient country. The coldness of the iceberg symbolized, for the new government, a natural and virginal condition, which ‘made clear the historical double break with the past the Chile of the Transition tried to make: both with the utopian-revolutionary past of the latino-americanism of the 60s, and with the traumatic past of the military dictatorship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11431336">Richard, 1998</xref>: 175).</p>
<p>By stressing a break with a tumultuous past, Chile’s post-Pinochet governments have hoped to emphasize to foreign investors that Chile is now stable. They have tried to skirt references to the violence experienced during the dictatorship (assassinations, torture, disappearances, exile) and, more importantly, to continued violence in the post-dictatorship era. For, more than 20 years after the end of the dictatorship, the relations between indigenous Chileans and the state are still marked by violent conflict, particular in Araucanía in the south, where many of Chile’s indigenous people live.</p>
<p>According to the National Commission of Truth and Reconciliation, the military coup of 1973 led to the execution of 40, and the disappearance of another 80 Mapuche in the south of Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11431336">Durán Pérez et al., 1998</xref>). At ceremonies to commemorate the victims of the dictatorship, the repression of Chile’s indigenous people by the Pinochet regime is often forgotten. Neither the state nor civil society groups have memorialized the suffering of indigenous Chileans under the dictatorship. A central memorial on Santiago’s main cemetery, for example, which had been the outcome of lobbying by the Agrupación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos (Association of Relatives of the Disappeared Detainees), lists the names of victims of political assassinations and state violence but has no reference to the Mapuche victims. The Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which was opened in January 2010 by the then president, Michelle Bachelet, to exhibit the history of the country under the dictatorship and redeem the memory of its victims, does not have any specific references to Mapuche repression either.</p>
<p>Today, indigenous Chileans total about 700,000 or just under 5 per cent of the population. Almost 90 per cent of them are Mapuche, with whom this article is principally concerned. This article considers why, in post-Pinochet Chile, successive governments have failed to adequately address historical and on-going injustices against indigenous Chileans.</p>
<p>In the following, I sketch the historical background of the relationship between Mapuche and the state from the beginning of colonization to 1989, the end of the dictatorship. Then I consider in more detail the approach to Mapuche and their grievances by several governments in democratic Chile. I argue that the response of democratic Chile to Mapuche must be understood in the context of the historic marginalization of Mapuche. While governments have failed to adequately address historical and present-day injustices perpetrated against Mapuche, partly because of economic imperatives, the current situation is the product of enduring historical representations of the Mapuche as a people who are not part of mainstream Chile and have no place in its national identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961463X11431336"><title>Historical roots of Mapuche dispossession</title>
<p>The history of the Mapuche people is unique in the history of Latin America because they waged armed resistance against the Spanish and later against the independent republic founded in 1810. In the south of the country, that resistance continued until the end of the nineteenth century. Although the republican government granted citizenship to the Mapuche, with all the rights and prerogatives that it entailed, both their continued resistance and the fact that many Chilean intellectuals subscribed to nineteenth-century European positivism and evolutionism, reinforced the antagonism between ‘white’ and ‘non-white’ Chileans. Gradually, the Mapuche were excluded from a national project based on liberal ideas, aspirations and values that shaped Chilean society. The vast majority of Chileans came to view their society as mono-cultural, Christian, western and racially homogeneous.</p>
<p>This discourse worked as an ideological justification for the Chilean army’s ‘pacification’ of Araucanía, which was done to foster the nation’s development through immigrants interested in settling and farming in the territory. In Chile’s socio-political imagery of the mid-nineteenth century, deeply marked by liberalism, Araucanía was supposedly an unoccupied space, scarcely inhabited by a few natives, and in need of being ‘civilized’ in order to rapidly integrate these natives into the Chilean world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Once Araucanía was occupied by the military, the state declared itself the guardian of Mapuche lands. It issued so-called <italic>títulos de merced</italic> (titles of favour) to Mapuche. These were communal titles for individual <italic>reducciónes</italic>, parcels of land where Mapuche could be confined. The rest of the ancestral Mapuche land was sold to Chilean and foreign settlers and made productive in terms of a modern capitalist agriculture.</p>
<p>Mapuche means ‘people of the land’. From a Mapuche perspective, their right to the land stems from their ancestral occupation of the territory. For them, the land has profound cultural, mythical and symbolic meaning; much of their culture, language, knowledge, history, spiritual life and memory are linked to the land and to the natural environment. The state, however, regarded the occupation of Araucanía as a legitimate takeover of a territory that belonged to Chile. Nation-building involved the establishment of state sovereignty over Araucano territory in order to incorporate its population into the national project, providing them with the juridical-legal instruments in the assumption that education would be the most important mechanism to transform ‘natives’ into citizens.</p>
<p>The centuries-long war led to deep-seated antipathies towards Mapuche on the part of other Chileans. The identity of Mapuche, on the other hand, was informed by a profound resentment that was created by segregationist policies, laws that applied only to them, the occupation of Araucanía and the expropriation of their lands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1999</xref>). Throughout the nineteenth century, as a cohesive Chilean identity emerged, mainstream society excluded the nation’s indigenous peoples. Although culturally an image of the ‘brave Mapuche’ who had resisted the Spanish invasion was brought up occasionally, socially Mapuche were stigmatized, discriminated against and excluded. Despite periodic attempts to integrate the Mapuche into society, there has never been enough political support, not even among members of the Left, for the implementation of Mapuche demands. Left-wing parties, which at times were a strong political force, were not interested in issues of ethnic minorities. Within the framework of Latin-American Marxism, the Chilean Left tended to focus on class struggle and considered the indigenous question a peasant, rather than an ethnic, matter.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1960s, Mapuche mobilized to recoup their former lands under the agrarian reforms spearheaded first by President Eduardo Frei Montalva (1964–1970), and then pursued vigorously under the <italic>Unidad Popular</italic> (Popular Unity) government (1970–1973). The early 1970s witnessed the first farm occupations by Mapuche activists linked to the radical Left, which reignited in the Chilean collective imagery the image of the Mapuche as violent and barbaric. The <italic>Unidad Popular</italic> government – which regarded the Mapuche as poor peasants – linked indigenous policies with the Agrarian Reform Law, returning lands to them, furthering the creation of peasant cooperatives and granting economic support for education.</p>
<p>The coup d’etat of 1973 reversed the process. On the one hand, there was marked political oppression (executions, disappearances, torture and incarceration) against those who participated in the agrarian reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11431336">Durán Pérez et al., 1998</xref>). The military often labelled Mapuche ‘communists’. On the other hand, the Pinochet regime drove the Mapuche out of the territories that had previously been returned to them following the agrarian reforms of President Salvador Allende’s government. The military regime wanted to hand over that land to foreign investors, particularly companies pursuing forestry or hydroelectricity projects, in order to modernize the country so it could play an important role in the international markets. The regime began an agrarian counter-reform during which Mapuche land that had been converted into indigenous cooperatives was transferred to individual private ownership. The new owners expelled the Mapuche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11431336">Chihuailaf, 1999</xref>), leaving huge ‘Mapuche-free’ areas where forestry, logging and hydroelectricity projects were installed. Under the military dictatorship, the category ‘indigenous’ was purged from the official vocabulary, as the government promoted the mandatory integration of the Mapuche into Chilean society. This provoked Mapuche resistance, which eventually contributed to the return to democracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961463X11431336"><title><italic>Concertación</italic> governments and the Mapuche issue</title>
<p>In 1988, Chileans voted in a referendum against a provision that would have made it possible for Augusto Pinochet to be reelected for another term as president. In the 1989 elections, Patricio Aylwin, the candidate of the <italic>Concertación</italic>, an alliance of moderate and left-wing parties who had pushed for the ousting of Pinochet, was elected president. The Pinochet era had come to a close.</p>
<p>In response to demands for justice, the <italic>Concertación</italic> governments permitted investigations into certain aspects of the Pinochet era, but with clear limitations. They supported the establishment of national commissions to investigate the systematic and large-scale violations of human rights during the dictatorship. For example<bold>,</bold> in April 1990 President Aylwin established the National Commission of Truth and Reconciliation. The first of its reports was released at the beginning of 1991. In 2003 President Ricardo Lagos created the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture. But justice has arguably not been delivered. Perpetrators have been let off lightly, and some of those responsible for the dictatorship have even been exonerated. Although the government tried to privilege the memory of the victims of violations of human rights, the continuing role of people such as General Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief, ensured that collective memory regarding the dictatorship’s terrorist methods was condemned to ‘political oblivion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11431336">Moulian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11431336">Richard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11431336">Hite, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The post-dictatorship governments tried to heal a socially and politically fractured and deeply polarized society. In order to achieve national reconciliation they embraced ideological plurality as a principle of democracy. The <italic>Concertación</italic> governments tried to convince Chileans that in order to successfully make the transition to democracy, the conflicts of the past needed to be overcome through compromises. Consensus was considered the foundational principle of peaceful coexistence of Left and Right. This consensus has entailed a commitment to the depoliticization of society and the demobilization of social movements including the Mapuche rights movement, which had played an important role in the struggle against the military dictatorship. Even the most outspoken leaders of <italic>Concertación,</italic> who had previously been members of leftist parties, legitimized this policy of depoliticization, due to fears of political polarization and the need to reinforce Chile’s economic achievements to the outside world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11431336">Hite, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The transition to democracy created a climate in which Mapuche activism could flourish. The quincentenary of the ‘discovery’ of the Americas in 1992 marked the beginning of a coordinated indigenous mobilization throughout the continent in which indigenous people organized a wide range of events to publicly condemn the conquest and colonization of the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 2000</xref>). Gradually<italic>,</italic> the Mapuche movement developed an ethnically informed consciousness. This development was encouraged by international NGOs and had the support of European media that collaborated with exiled Mapuche and reported about the conditions of Latin America’s indigenous peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431336">Chihuailaf, 2002</xref>). Better access to television, radio and other mass media also contributed to the creation of a new ethnic identity. Mapuche activism complicated the <italic>Concertación</italic>’s policies that were aimed at bringing about a transition free of social conflicts.</p>
<p>The democratic government tried to settle the historical debt, which had been incurred as a result of the crimes committed during the dictatorship, by aiming for truth and justice. The historical debt incurred by the majority Chilean society in its relationship with the indigenous minority is, however, still outstanding. While governments have attempted to address other crimes of the dictatorship, those committed against Mapuche have barely rated a mention. This is consistent with a broader pattern of erasure of Mapuche history. Ever since the military occupation of Araucanía in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the political and social elites have represented Chile as ‘civilized’ and ‘white’. They have implemented policies and actions that tended to marginalize Mapuche or make them invisible. At the same time the government has attempted to assimilate Mapuche into the Chilean nation.</p>
<p>While the <italic>Concertación</italic> governments have acted in the tradition of a long line of predecessors, they have also pursued policies that recognize Mapuche’s ethnic specificity and which provide solutions to their material poverty. In 1990, a new relationship between the state and Mapuche seemed possible. The first government formed by the <italic>Concertación</italic> seemed to be willing to recognize Mapuche as part of the diversity of Chilean society and to concede that indigenous issues had to be taken into account in the new democracy. The new government was also indebted to the Mapuche because of their struggle against the dictatorship.</p>
<p>The government proposed – jointly with various Mapuche organizations – a constitutional reform to officially recognize Chile’s indigenous peoples. In 1993 the National Congress approved the <italic>Nueva Ley Indígena</italic> (New Indigenous Peoples Act). For the first time in the country’s history, Mapuche demands were recognized as ethnic demands. The law prohibited the sale of indigenous land to non–indigenous persons, and created the Corporación de Desarrollo Indígena (National Indigenous Development Corporation, CONADI), to implement the legislation and design new indigenous policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>But not only was the law a top-down measure designed by technocrats, it also had severe limitations: it recognized indigenous people as <italic>individuals</italic> but did not guarantee their constitutional recognition as <italic>a people</italic>. CONADI’s makeup tended to favour the state’s interests over those of indigenous peoples. The President determined the expenditure of the funds earmarked for indigenous development and appointed the indigenous counsellors. The law did not recognize the original Mapuche territory, nor did it create means that would guarantee Mapuche’s political participation or mechanisms to address conflicts arising from the construction of large hydroelectricity schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X11431336">Namuncura, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11431336">Chihuailaf, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The government did not meet Mapuche expectations of their constitutional recognition as a people in its own right, political autonomy, restitution of ancestral land, control over natural resources, and respect for Mapuche customary law. This has given rise to political activism and social protests, such as road blocks and other forms of civil disobedience, and has led to violence<italic>.</italic> Political activism and social protests commenced in 1992 and have escalated since. Mapuche activists have been persecuted and criminalized by the successive <italic>Concertación</italic> governments, while protests by high-school students, teachers, doctors and truck drivers were tolerated.</p>
<p><italic>Concertación</italic> governments have continued the economic policies begun under the dictatorship which opened the economy to international markets. They welcomed foreign investment because it was thought to be necessary to generate the prosperity and economic stability required for the consolidation of democracy. In the eyes of many Mapuche, CONADI lost credibility and legitimacy when it could not prevent the construction of the Ralco hydroelectric power plant on the upper Biobío River, which forced many Mapuche communities to abandon their land and sacred sites, and displaced scores of families. The discontent of Mapuche grew. They no longer associated with the political parties that identified with their demands, but formed their own organizations which re-wrote the Mapuche discourse and adopted a more radical stance in their confrontation with the Chilean state. They pursued other avenues to solve their problems, such as the recovery of their ancestral lands through occupations. However, this radicalization has not precluded other Mapuche advocating a dialogue with the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>During the second <italic>Concertación</italic> government (1994–2000), hopes for an Indigenous Peoples Act as an instrument to defend the rights of indigenous peoples dwindled. Chile’s growing participation in the global economy, the increasing economic, financial and commercial liberalization, the privatization processes and the authorization of large hydroelectricity and forestry projects, all favoured private investment that would subordinate Mapuche interests to the demands of modernization and economic development. Disenchantment with the political process and a growing awareness about the drafting of international instruments to protect the rights of indigenous peoples led the new representative organizations of the Mapuche people to demand autonomy rather than a better participation within the state, and land rights rather than the safeguarding of their resources. Protests became more violent.</p>
<p>When Ricardo Lagos, a socialist, became president in 2000, Mapuche expectations were once again high<italic>.</italic> He encouraged the formation of the Grupo de Trabajo Sobre Pueblos Indígenas (Indigenous Peoples Working Group) and created the Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato (Commission for Historical Truth and New Treatment) which was in charge of designing a State policy for indigenous people. He sped up the transfer of fiscal land to indigenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11431336">Aylwin, 2007</xref>). The Lagos government’s most important indigenous policy was the Orígenes (Origins) program, which was designed to contain the conflict and overcome prevailing indigenous poverty through ‘development with identity’, which was centred on education, socio-cultural strengthening such as through indigenous education and cultural programs, cross-cultural education and restoration of cultural practices, the encouragement of productive development, the reduction of poverty and the active participation of indigenous people in community development projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11431336">Aylwin, 2007</xref>). The Orígenes program identified health and education as core issues and addressed them by spending large amounts of money in those areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X11431336">Bello, 2007</xref>). But the program did not deal with issues of land rights or political autonomy.</p>
<p>Although Lagos initiated constitutional reform, his government did not consult with indigenous communities and the reforms did not make ‘any reference to collective political, territorial and cultural rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11431336">Aylwin, 2007</xref>). The Lagos government too continued to open Chile’s economy to international markets, and favoured private investment in indigenous territories. When faced with persistent Mapuche protests, in 2001 the government began pursuing a policy of repression. The <italic>Ley de Seguridad Interior del Estado</italic> (Internal State Security Law) enabled the persecution of radical opponents of the government. In 2004, as protests grew, the government used the <italic>Ley Antiterrorista</italic> (Anti-Terrorist Law), which had been introduced during the dictatorship. It made it possible for the state to prosecute Mapuche involved in protests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431336">González et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11431336">Seguel, 2007</xref>), and to increase the sentences of those convicted of acts of ‘terrorism’.</p>
<p>Michelle Bachelet’s government (2006–2010) continued the ambivalent policies of its predecessors. It embraced indigenous groups that accepted integration and persecuted those that challenged its legitimacy. Funds provided by the Inter-American Development Bank to overcome indigenous poverty made possible important advances, including Mapuche access to electricity, housing, distance education and the internet. At the same time, the Orígenes program continued to raise the standard of living of indigenous Chileans and to promote infrastructure projects such as constructing schools, roads, highways, telecommunications and medical facilities in regions with a large proportion of Mapuche.</p>
<p>In 2008, after conflicts between the state and Mapuche escalated further, Bachelet encouraged the direct participation of indigenous peoples in Congress and proposed – unsuccessfully, as it turned out – the creation of an indigenous district that could determine a certain number of indigenous parliamentarians. Although Bachelet was committed to restoring land to over 100 Mapuche communities and to deciding on the requests of an additional 300, the lands delivered by Bachelet were fiscal lands and insufficient for the needs of Mapuche communities. They were not the ancestral lands that their former owners demanded, and thus another round of violent Mapuche protests ensued.</p>
<p>As a result of those failures, the relations between the government and the radical sections of the Mapuche movement deteriorated further. In 2008 a group of Mapuche went on a hunger strike to effect the release of political prisoners, the demilitarization of Araucanía, and an end to the harassment of Mapuche communities by the police. Soon hundreds of Mapuche communities were in a state of open rebellion. In October 2009 the Indian organization Arauco Malleco Coordinator declared war on the state after requiring its members to give up their Chilean nationality. They threatened to wage a struggle for ‘national liberation’ unless the Chilean government agreed to broad changes. Meanwhile, the Bachelet government maintained that Mapuche protests were criminal acts which had nothing to do with the interests and demands of the Mapuche population. According to current President Sebastián Piñeira, ‘the solution to the historical debt owed to the Mapuche will be achieved through unity and dialogue, and not through violence and hunger strikes’ (<italic>La Nación</italic>, 13 September 2010).</p>
<p>Today many Mapuche areas are still occupied by the military; hundreds of Mapuche have been investigated for actions related to the conflict; there have been illegal searches, interrogations, intelligence-gathering operations, use of armed force and human-rights violations. The ambivalent attitude of <italic>Concertación</italic> governments to human-rights violations during the dictatorship has carried over into the present. On the one hand, the governments in power during the transition to democracy believed the Mapuche issue could be solved by social policies that would neutralize the demands for the recognition of specific Mapuche peoples’ rights, without guaranteeing protection under the law, a demarcation of territories, or assurance of their rights over their natural resources. On the other hand, these governments have continued to perpetrate injustices using institutionalized violence and the internal security and anti-terrorist laws, which allow for protestors to be treated as criminals. The <italic>Concertación</italic> governments have made the Mapuche a new internal enemy, which has replaced the communist enemy of the dictatorship era.</p>
<p>The Mapuche believe they are owed a ‘historical debt’ by the Chilean state on account of the latter’s expropriation of Mapuche land and resources. For some Mapuche, integration discourses, either from the Right or the Left, are no longer valid and they now wish to separate from Chilean culture, affirm their own indigenous identity, defend their difference and their right to self-determination, and repel any attempts to assimilate them. Some Mapuche propose a nationalist project based on affirming Mapuche identity as separate from Chilean identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11431336">Foerster, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>For the Chilean state, the Mapuche movement is a potential risk because it has openly criticized the political and economic models which are proven to exclude certain sectors regardless of undeniable economic success and democratic achievements. The Mapuche movement has shed light on critical issues such as the destruction of natural resources, the weakness of democracy, the lack of equal opportunities, social exclusion, respect for citizens’ human rights and, most of all, the political failure to adequately resolve the Mapuche conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X11431336"><title>The continuous mismatch between Chilean society and the Mapuche</title>
<p>The vast majority of Chileans remain indifferent towards the government’s initiatives for the Mapuche population. In the 1990s better access to consumer goods became the central factor of social integration; citizen participation decreased, and the enormous political power of entrepreneurs and mass media conglomerates weakened the institutional system of representation. After 17 years of a military regime and 20 years of <italic>Concertación</italic> governments<italic>,</italic> post-dictatorship Chilean civil society reflects the demands and limitations of the neo-liberal political and economic model. In spite of the achievements of the transition to democracy, Chile is still an authoritarian country in which ‘civil society is weak, underdeveloped and too dependent on the dictates of the State and politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X11431336">Larraín, 2001</xref>: 220). It is a conservative and increasingly intolerant country, which does not want to face conflict-laden social and cultural issues for the sake of peaceful coexistence. Chilean society is deeply influenced by a predominantly conservative mass media, which promotes racist stereotypes and reinforces the image of a Mapuche otherness that does not conform to the image of homogeneity. The media has in fact made possible the state’s punitive measures by stigmatizing the Mapuche movement as ‘violent’, ‘terrorist’ and ‘illegal’.</p>
<p>The reassertion of a Mapuche identity and rights has led to increased Mapuche visibility. There are many communities with Mapuche mayors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 2009</xref>); some hospitals now accept practices carried out by Mapuche <italic>machi</italic> (medicine women), and the number of chemists specializing in Mapuche medicine has increased. Today’s indigenous Mapuche live primarily in Santiago, Concepción and Valparaíso, but they can be found in practically all cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11431336">Saavedra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431336">CASEN, 2006</xref>). According to the 2002 population census, 62.4% of Mapuche live in urban areas, while 37.6% live in the rural areas; 51.4% of those who live in rural areas live in Araucanía (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X11431336">Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 2002</xref>). Mapuche are also active in economic activities and are well represented in cultural occupations. In the cities, many work as labourers in construction, as shopkeepers and technicians. There are also Mapuche intellectuals who engage in public discourse as a strategy to ensure the visibility of their people.</p>
<p>The work profile of the average Mapuche is that of a scarcely qualified individual who works for low wages, long hours, and is discriminated against and mistreated due to their physical appearance. For women, the most frequent occupation is domestic help, securing food and lodging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11431336">Saavedra, 2002</xref>). Most Mapuche live in shanty towns in precarious housing, set apart, where they suffer from the effects of poverty and are discriminated against by their own neighbours.</p>
<p>For the majority of Chileans, the pejorative images of the indigenous world, reproduced repeatedly since the nineteenth and throughout the twentieth centuries, are still in force: ‘Chilean society (popular sectors included) is profoundly discriminatory and bigoted (as) public opinion polls have shown and our everyday experience confirms (for) we live out of common spaces, extolling the indigenous peoples of the past and reviling those of today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431336">Salazar and Pinto, 1999</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>In order to function adequately in an urban environment, on many occasions Mapuche feel compelled to conceal their ethnic identity and thereby conform to the expectations created by the policies of assimilation – and to avoid the stigmatization and discrimination reserved for Chileans who are identifiable as Mapuche:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e are forced to endure red tape in public or municipal offices. Needless to say how we are treated by <italic>carabineros</italic>, detectives, policemen and officers of the courts! Teachers at schools start off under the assumption that Mapuche children are incapable of proper learning and openly mock our beliefs and customs … ! And a Mapuche requesting a loan at a bank must provide proof he or she owns a patrimony more than twice of what is asked of a <italic>huinca</italic> debtor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X11431336">Von Baer, 2003</xref>:17). </p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Historically, the incorporation of Mapuche into economic, social and symbolic systems effected acculturation through monocultural and monolingual education. Migration to the cities accelerated processes of cultural loss. In urban environments, infrastructure that permits a stronger presence of educational, health and consumer services has undermined the traditional authority of figures such as the <italic>lonkos</italic> (political chieftains) or the <italic>machi</italic>. Likewise, better access to consumer goods has led to changes in Mapuche life styles. The contact with urban institutions and values has led some Mapuche to re-evaluate their world views.</p>
<p>Some segments of Chilean society, such as gays or young people in the cities, support the Mapuche struggle and conceive of it as a symbol of rebellion. There is a strong connection between Mapuche and the environmental movement, because their proposals and demands coincide with regard to hydroelectricity schemes that alter ecosystems and push the indigenous population out. The Mapuche movement also receives support from sectors that protest against exploitation and poverty, and the support by Chilean and international NGOs has been crucial. Similarly, leaders and representatives of Mapuche groups are in touch with groups active in promoting indigenous autonomy in Spain, and have established formal partnerships with nationalist and independence movements all over the world.</p>
<p>Identification with the indigenous identity has significantly increased in the last 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431336">CASEN, 2006</xref>). In the context of growing urbanization – almost two-thirds of Mapuche over the age of 14 live in cities – Mapuche have articulated a new discourse that emphasizes ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 2009</xref>). The factors that have contributed to this include a greater professionalization of young Mapuche<italic>,</italic> the exchange of ideas with international indigenous rights movements, access to documents and ideas through the internet, and the emergence of a Mapuche intellectual class capable of dealing with Western codes, but interested in being different rather than belonging to the national culture (Bengoa, 2000; Bengoa, 2009).</p>
<p>Mapuche have increasingly begun to self-identify with a group identity which centres on culture, language, history and memory. This is clearly expressed in Mapuche poetry. Some of its main themes are the recovery of ancestral myths, love of nature, respect towards ancestors, assessment of cultural roots, past history repeated in the present, the fight of a nation for its own land, the role of heroes and the loss of identity. It is a poetry fed by collective and individual experiences and the memory of past struggles, and it highlights the weight of Mapuche history and culture in the context of a fragmented country. Through the pens of the poets, the Mapuche universe is kept alive. These poets are also read by non-indigenous Chileans, as much of their work has been translated.</p>
<p>According to the government, the Mapuche are now recognized because of an emphasis on a society that is tolerant and respectful of ‘difference’, values the expression of particular identities and respects the diversity of lifestyles, stories, memories and customs. Chilean society, however, has failed to achieve an understanding and acceptance of this diversity (which was historically silenced by the state) and is still reluctant to realize that different nationalities can live together. The Mapuche issue is still far from being a national concern. Although the modernization process has increased Mapuche’s social mobility, integration into labour markets and access to consumer goods, it has not yet led to the kind of social and political transformation that is necessary to overcome the history of exclusion of a people who continue to be conceived as dangerous, despicable and threatening.</p>
<p>Most Chileans remain apathetic to the plight of the Mapuche. In the collective imaginary, the Mapuche issue simply does not exist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11431336">Moulin (1997)</xref> has defined Chile as ‘a country of contradictory identity …  [whose exceptionality] was built upon the dangerous mixture of forgetfulness and mystification’ (p. 156). Since colonial times, the idea that Chile is exceptional has been an important part of the country’s self-image. One of the crucial elements of Chile’s supposed exceptionality has been its supposed racial homogeneity. Although Chile shares with other Latin American countries a common identity derived from the fact of having been recognized as an ‘other’ by Europeans, the 300-year conflict with the indigenous Mapuche has shaped the identity of Chilean society, which is based on the contrast between ‘white’ and ‘non-white’. The indigenous people living in the interior were not recognized as citizens until the end of the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431336">Bengoa, 1999</xref>). In Chilean literature, the image of the Mapuche is highly discriminatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X11431336">Antillana and Loncón, 1998</xref>); Chilean primary and secondary school students do not learn about Mapuche history and cultural traditions. There is no history museum dedicated to their past. Until José Bengoa began publishing his research on the relationship between Mapuche and the Chilean state, that relationship had been largely ignored by Chilean historians. Therefore, historical injustice against the Mapuche expresses itself, until the present day, in diverse areas: social exclusion, the negation of their culture, criminalization, and symbolic violence at the hands of the mass media.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961463X11431336" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Chileans face a crucial question: what kind of country do they want? All mapmaking for the future requires an engagement with the past. How could one build a country for future generations without critically examining the past’s shadows, discontinuities and absences? How could one make projections for the future without uncovering the paradoxes and contradictions of the last 200 years? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11431336">Garretón (2003)</xref> has observed: ‘There is no project of a country that does not imply a construction of memory’ (p. 216). This is particularly difficult because of a paradox: today’s Chile bears the weight of the past but is reluctant to acknowledge it. Structural and cultural transformations that have radically modified the direction of the country require an open discussion of the subject of racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11431336">Foerster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X11431336">Montecino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X11431336">Larraín, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The case of the Mapuche in Chile reveals that despite the opportunities provided during democratic transitions to address historical injustices there are potential barriers to such a process. In this case the imperative of the government to further integrate Chile into the world economy resulted in a trade-off: Mapuche were granted symbolic forms of recognition as an indigenous people and limited land and political concessions, but their claims to land earmarked for profitable development were rejected. Despite the transition to a more democratic society, Chileans’ views of indigenous people have hardly changed. That is due to the persistence of a dominant discourse of white Chilean identity, which continues to render indigenous peoples as a violent other. Despite continuing political repression the new democratic context has, however, provided Mapuche an opportunity to articulate a new identity based on memories of the Mapuche past and demands for land rights and political autonomy.</p>
