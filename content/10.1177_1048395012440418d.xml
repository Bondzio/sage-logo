<p>SLPs play a crucial role in the development of literacy skills for children and adolescents with communication disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048395012440418">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2001</xref>). Researchers have indicated that phonological awareness (PA), which is defined as</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the ability to break words down into component sounds, to realize that these units of sound can be represented by letters, to learn letter-sound correspondence rules, to analyze words into component sounds (for spelling), and to synthesize sounds represented into words (for reading),</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>is the major component necessary for developing literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048395012440418">Paul, 2007</xref>, p. 448). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048395012440418">Paul (2007)</xref>, intervention targeting PA can be both preventive and remedial. Furthermore, it can occur within regular classroom teaching or pull-out sessions.</p>
<p>PA acquisition occurs in a hierarchical manner. For instance, children initially develop rhyming abilities prior to syllable segmentation, initial sound alliteration, final sound alliteration, sound segmentation, and sound manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048395012440418">Van Kleeck, 1990</xref>). As rhyming is the foundation of PA and later literacy skills, several therapy ideas will be presented, which target rhyming in a manner of errorless learning.</p>
<p>While introducing these activities, each child can receive his or her own secret rhyming word to use during the games and song to promote errorless learning and increase the child’s feelings of success.</p>

<list-item><p>Duck, Duck, Goose</p>
<list id="list2-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Sit the children around in a circle to play <italic>Duck, Duck, Goose</italic> and select a word family for the game (e.g., the <italic>—at</italic> family). As the child who is “it” moves around the circle, he will say a selected word from the word family instead of saying <italic>duck, duck</italic>, and he will substitute his own rhyming word for <italic>goose</italic>. For instance, the child could circle the group saying, <italic>cat, cat, cat, cat, MAT</italic>. Once the child who is “it” says his own rhyming word, he runs around the circle to take the place of the child he tapped on the head while saying his rhyming word. That child is now “it.”</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Rhyming Song (to the tune of Mary Had a Little Lamb)</p>
<list id="list3-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Select a word family for the song (e.g., the —at family). The teacher/SLP will begin the song by choosing a word with which all of the subsequent words will rhyme. Each child in the group will then take a turn holding up his or her rhyming word, and as a group, everyone will sing the following song. Each child’s name will be substituted into the song as it is his or her turn.</p>

<list-item><p>Set up the room as you normally would for <italic>Musical Chairs</italic>, with one less chair than the number of children playing. Select a word family and instead of playing music, start saying rhyming words as the children walk around the chairs (e.g., <italic>cat, mat, sat, hat, etc.)</italic>. Once you say a word that doesn’t rhyme, the children all find a chair to sit on. After the children become proficient at discriminating rhyming words from words that do not rhyme, they could each take a turn being the person who says the words.</p></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rhyming Hopscotch</p>
<list id="list6-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Set up a hopscotch course and have the children throw a beanbag or roll a die to determine how far they can hop on the course. Have a different rhyming word written on or placed in each individual hopscotch square. Each child will then say or chant the rhyming words as he or she hops throughout the course.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>What Rhyme is it, Mr./Mrs. _____? (Adaptation of the game, What Time is it, Mr. Wolf?)</p>
<list id="list7-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The children all line up at one end of the room, while the teacher/SLP stands with his or her back to them at the other end. After selecting a word family (e.g., the <italic>—at</italic> family), the children take a step toward the teacher/SLP for each word they hear that rhymes. When the teacher/SLP says a word that does not rhyme, the children run back to “safety.” On the children becoming proficient at discriminating rhyming words from words that do not rhyme, they can each take a turn being the caller.</p></list-item>
