<p>In a discourse symptomatic of the era and place, the pseudonymous ‘Sagart’ (Irish for priest) writes in 1922 of the plight of the ‘unmarried mother’. In Ireland, ‘concrete circumstances of life’ have ensured that the response to girls who ‘get into trouble’ fails to achieve ‘the two-fold end of all judicious punishment – the sinner’s conversion and the neighbour’s warning’ (p. 45). Does such a language tell us of the debts that penology owes to religious discourse, or of Ireland’s distance from the secularized world of penology through much of the 20th century? This is but one of the questions that might emerge from a reading of the compelling collection of documents that Eoin O’Sullivan and Ian O’Donnell have collected in this work.</p>
<p>The editors are academics and researchers in respectively social work and criminology. In an article published in this journal in 2007 they set out the justification for amplifying the field of research focused on incarceration to comprehend not only prisons, but other institutions including mental hospitals, juvenile reformatories and homes for unmarried mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474512473900">O’Sullivan and O’Donnell, 2007</xref>). In this book they set out to develop that case by analysis and illustration. Almost one-third of the book is indeed taken up with analysis, through introductory (‘Setting the scene’) and concluding (‘Explaining coercive confinement’) essays in which the editors/authors exploit the riches of Irish social history, ethnography and sociology to explore the escalation and decline of multiple modes of incarceration.</p>
<p>Between these book-ends the editors have assembled a rich collection of documentary material whose rationale is to exhibit the silences and (often forgotten) acknowledgements of the practices and experiences of institutional confinement in post-Independence Ireland. The approach is driven in part by the numerous scandals that have engulfed Irish politics in recent years. A decade long official inquiry on the abuse of children in a range of institutions was reported in 2009. As the editors note (p. 256), every copy of the five-volume report was sold on the morning of publication.</p>
<p>The question so often asked during these years has been why were such things possible, and in such a degree. The texts assembled by the editors tell of the occasional inquiry (some official, some journalistic or the work of advocates) that drew attention to the numbers, the quality of care and the experiences of inmates of these prisons, reformatory and industrial schools, mental hospitals, Magdalen Homes and the few remaining workhouses turned into ‘County Homes’. Others are the voices of the inmates of these places, sometimes texts that have been recovered and published posthumously. It becomes evident that the problem of institutional abuse in its variety of meanings was not absent from the political and ethical discourse of the times – but it lacked a political driver of any moment. And, for O’Sullivan and O’Donnell, this was because Ireland was a particular kind of place, which made use of these institutions for particular kinds of social and economic and political reasons.</p>
<p>In making sense of institutional confinement in Ireland since 1922 it is important to recognize the more general point that the authors want to make about what they call ‘coercive confinement’. They are critical of the recent literature on the expansion of penal institutions associated with the ‘culture of control’ for its too narrow attention to the prison. By examining the full range of institutions in which individuals were held against their will, often for most of their lives, the authors insist that for Ireland at least (the point however could be made more generally, if not to quite the same degree in many other western jurisdictions) coercive confinement contracted radically from the 1950s. Only by taking account of the evacuation of institutions other than the prison, of their very dismantling, does it become possible to understand clearly the relative significance of the growth of the prison in places like Ireland. Their argument then is in part a case for a return to an older sociology of the uses of institutions, a reminder to scholars of penology as well as of welfare to broaden their field of reference to take account of the changes in the modes and uses of confinement. And their insistence on a thoroughly historicized account of the practice of confinement is a powerful demonstration of the importance of connecting the institutional world to its external functions and rationales.</p>
<p>Through that historicized account we come to the crux of their argument (pp. 272–280). Post-Independence Ireland was deeply attached to a social system that has been described by Irish sociologists as ‘rural fundamentalism’. The driving need to secure the family farm, in a society in which small farm owners had achieved a secure foothold by a political revolution since the late 19th century, was in turn a powerful factor driving high rates of coercive confinement of those whose usefulness to this fundamental purpose was in question. As this system eroded in economic purpose in the post-war decades so too the role of institutional confinement changed. If this looks too functional an argument on first appearance, its cogency draws however on a great deal of detailed research on the uses of mental hospitals, juvenile reformatories and even Magdalen Homes, as surveyed by the authors. The peculiar (i.e. constitutionally very powerful) position of the Catholic Church in Ireland combined with a famously austere political vision of the de Valera ascendancy to elevate rural Ireland in ways that served its marginal peoples very poorly indeed. For this reader indeed, the authors perhaps let the Church off too lightly in suggesting that ‘the state’ was all too willing to avoid running many of these institutions (p. 266) – a longer view of the politics of Irish nationalism, going back at least to the 1880s, suggests that the Catholic Church linked its future to the freedom of the Irish nation in ways that made it a heavy burden on future social policy (a fact demonstrated to a powerful degree by the Church’s intervention in post-war maternal and child welfare policy).</p>
<p><italic>Coercive Confinement in Ireland</italic> deserves a readership well beyond its jurisdiction of interest. In particular its reminder that penology and the experience of punishment pertains to a wide range of institutional forms should provoke replication in other settings, in time and place.</p></sec>
