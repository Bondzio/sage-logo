<abstract>
<p>Measles, once a common childhood illness that many older school nurses could recognize without difficulty, needs review again after reemerging from Europe and other continents. A highly contagious disease, which has been referenced since the seventh century, the virus can cause serious illness and death, despite the fact that it is vaccine preventable. School nurses are wise to review the pathogenesis, occurrences, incubation, and communicability as well as methods to diagnose and treat measles in order to prevent an outbreak.</p>

<p>Measles is one of the most highly contagious diseases ever known and despite being vaccine preventable continues to cause serious illness and death. According to the Centers for Disease Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429004">CDC, 2011</xref>), Western Europe has experienced several thousands of cases of measles this year, and the disease appears to be reemerging from years past. In the United States, an average of 70 measles cases per year have been reported since 2001, but measles continues to cause outbreaks in Asia, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429004">CDC, 2011</xref>). Due to the risk of exposure to measles when travelling, a review of measles might help those who are unfamiliar with this once common childhood disease.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840511429004">
<title>Origin</title>
<p>Measles can be referenced as early as the seventh century. The Persian physician Rhazes in the 10th century believed the acute viral disease to be “more dreaded than smallpox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Prior to the availability of vaccine, measles was considered a universal disease of childhood and greater than 90% of persons became immune by 15 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Peter Panum, in 1846, realized that after measles was introduced in a population, fewer cases of measles occurred if some of the population had already contracted the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511429004">Arias, 2010</xref>). This then led to the concept of herd immunity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840511429004">
<title>Pathogenesis</title>
<p>Measles is a paramyxovirus of genus <italic>Mobillivirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). The diameter of the virus ranges from 100 to 200 nm, with a core of single-stranded RNA and is considered to be closely related to canine distemper and renderpest viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Two membrane envelope proteins contribute to the pathogenesis. The F (fusion) protein allows for fusion of the virus with the host cell membranes, viral penetration, and cell breakdown, while the H (hemagglutinin) protein enables the adsorption of virus into the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Measles creates a systemic infection by primarily focusing on the respiratory epithelium of the nasopharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059840511429004">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). After replicating successfully in the respiratory epithelium and regional nodes, the virus undergoes a primary viremia 5 to 7 days later and then causes an infection in the respiratory tract and other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511429004">
<title>Signs and Symptoms</title>
<p>A high fever is one of the first signs of measles, which begins approximately 10–12 days after exposure to the virus and can last for 7 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">World Health Organization [WHO], 2009</xref>). Cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the first stage of the disease, followed by a rash on the face and upper neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840511429004">Figure 1</xref>; Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009). The rash progressively spreads over the trunk and then to the hands and feet, lasts for 5 to 6 days, and then fades away (Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009).</p>

<sec id="section4-1059840511429004">
<title>Complications</title>
<p>According to the CDC (2009) 30% of all reported cases of measles have one or more complications. Measles complications occur most often in children less than 5 years of age and in adults of 20 years of age and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, seizures, otitis media, and pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Pneumonia associated with measles is the most common cause of death and accounts for 60% of all deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Pregnant mothers who contract measles have a higher risk of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low birth weight infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511429004">
<title>Occurrences</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO (2009)</xref>, more than 20 million people are impacted by measles annually. The disease is still quite common and especially frequent in some areas of Africa and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). Severe cases of measles occur more often among poorly nourished children, and especially those who lack sufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDs or other chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). Measles is one of the leading causes of death among children under the age of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). It has been reported that there were 164,000 cases of measles that resulted in death in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). This amounts to almost 450 deaths per day or 18 deaths per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). Those countries that have experienced a natural disaster or conflict are particularly susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). As an example, an outbreak of measles occurred in Haiti as a result of overcrowding in residential camps. There are several ongoing outbreaks of measles in Europe at the present time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Populations being affected are younger than 20 years of age and account for 76% of the cases; 91% of the cases are persons who are unvaccinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840511429004">
<title>Incubation and Communicability</title>
<p>The incubation period for measles from the time of exposure to the time of symptoms averages 10 days, but may be 7–18 days from onset of fever and 14 days post rash, rarely as long as 19–21 days (Heymann, 2009).  The period of communicability is considered to be 1 day prior to symptoms until 4 days after the rash appears (Heymann, 2009). Communicability, therefore, should be considered possible at least 7 days beyond the start of the first symptoms (Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009). The virus is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, close person contact, or via direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2003). The measles virus can remain activated and contagious in the air or on the surfaces for approximately 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). The only natural host is human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840511429004">
<title>Outbreak Control Measures</title>
<p>Any child or adult displaying symptoms of measles should be isolated, excluded, and referred to a health care provider for diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>). Infants and preschool age children are especially vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). School, county, and state guidelines should be followed to notify parents or caregivers of any infected case and those of students not adequately immunized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>). Local health department regulations should be followed for reporting and for readmittance to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>). All students should be observed for potential new cases, and a list of students who lack measles vaccination should be created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>). Students should not be allowed to return to school a minimum of 4 days after rash onset and should check with the health care provider for clearance before returning to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>). Proper hand washing technique should also be reviewed with all school personnel and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429004">Lewis &amp; Bear, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1059840511429004">
<title>Diagnostic Methods</title>
<p>According to the CDC (2009), isolation is not recommended as a routine method to diagnose measles. Virus isolates, however, are very important for molecular epidemiologic surveillance and can help determine the geographic origin of the virus and any viral strains that may be circulating in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Infection with the measles virus can be confirmed via a positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, a marked increase in measles IgG antibody concentration coupled with acute and convalescent serum specimens via standard serologic assay or by isolating the measles virus from specimens of urine, blood, or nasopharyngeal secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). The easiest way to diagnose the disease is by testing for IgM antibody on a single serum specimen when first encountering a person suspected of being infected with measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). According to the AAP (2003), measles IgM assay sensitivity can vary and may be diminished during the first 72 hr after rash onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). If the test is negative for measles IgM and the patient displays a generalized rash that lasts more than 72 hr, the measles IgM test should be repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). Measles IgM can be detected for at least 1 month after the rash appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). Persons who are seronegative for measles IgM, but have a fever and rash, should be tested for rubella using the same viral samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840511429004">
<title>Treatment Recommendations</title>
<p>No antiviral therapy specifically for measles is available at the current time. According to the AAP (2003) the virus shows in vitro susceptibility to Ribaviran which has been given intravenously along with aerosol to treat severely affected children and those who are immunocompromised. Ribaviran is not licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for treatment of measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). </p>
<p>Vitamin A is recommended to be administered to children diagnosed with the disease in communities where vitamin A deficiency exists or where the measles case fatality rate is 1% or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). Two doses of vitamin A supplements given 24 hours apart are recommended and can help prevent eye damage and blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Supportive care, adequate nutrition, and fluid intake can also prevent complications from measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). An oral rehydration solution can replace fluids and other essential elements that are lost through diarrhea or vomiting. Antibiotics should only be prescribed when eye and ear infections occur and or when pneumonia is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429004">WHO, 2009</xref>). </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840511429004">
<title>Epidemiological Considerations</title>
<p>According to the CDC (2009), the number and makeup of outbreak of measles has varied since the 1980s. Before 1989, most of the outbreaks occurred among middle, high school, and college student populations. It was discovered that 95% of persons infected at the time of the outbreaks had received one previous dose of measles vaccine. In 1989, a second dose of measles vaccine was recommended for school-age children. Currently all states in the United States require two doses of measles vaccine for children. It is now rare to have a measles outbreak in school settings in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). It is believed that the increase in the number of cases in 2008 was a direct result of more measles transmission after the virus was imported. The majority of imported cases have occurred among unvaccinated school-age children; many of whom were homeschooled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An international imported measles case is considered to be imported if the source originated outside the country, rash onset occurs within 21 days after entry into the country, and illness is not found to be linked to local transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). An indigenous case of measles is any case that is not imported; however there are subclasses of indigenous cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Measles continues to be designated as a notifiable infectious disease at the national level since it is highly contagious and can lead to serious complications and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1059840511429004">
<title>Recommendations for Prevention</title>
<p>Measles vaccination is the primary public health strategy to reduce global measles deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). According to the CDC (2009), the measles vaccine has been available for over 40 years. The vaccine has proven to be safe, effective, and inexpensive; costing less than 1 U.S. dollar per child.  Due to the fact that approximately 15% of the vaccinated children fail to develop passive immunity from one dose of measles vaccine, two doses are recommended to ensure immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). Measles exposure does not contraindicate immunization to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). Live-virus measles vaccine, if given within 72 hr of exposure to measles, often provides protection in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Ig may be given to prevent or lessen the effects of measles in susceptible persons within 6 days of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>). Ig is recommended for susceptible household contacts of patients with measles, especially for those who are less than 1 year of age, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals when the risk of complications is greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429004">AAP, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The Measles Initiative is a joint effort of WHO, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the American Red Cross, the CDC, and the United Nations Foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). The collaborative efforts of these agencies, along with private and public affiliates, play a major role in promoting a global measles strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>). The strategy includes:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>routine immunization for children at 1 year of age;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>mass vaccination campaigns to ensure that all children get at least one dose of measles;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>ongoing surveillance in all countries to quickly perceive and respond to outbreaks of measles; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>improved treatment of cases with measles, to include vitamin A administration and antibiotics when indicated, and supportive care that reduces complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429004">CDC, 2009</xref>)</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section12-1059840511429004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is important for school nurses to be able to recognize measles when it occurs. Websites such as the CDC, WHO as well as local health departments can provide additional information about measles and show visual images of measles rash to help distinguish it from other rash-type illnesses. It is clear that the disease remains highly contagious and can occur within a community almost overnight. By reviewing the origin of the disease, the pathogenesis, occurrences, incubation, and communicability as well as methods to diagnose measles and treatment options, school nurses can be proactive in preventing an outbreak. Measles remains a leading cause of death among children even though it is a vaccine-preventable disease. Perhaps with responses, such as the measles initiative, more children will become vaccinated against measles and the disease will no longer be as infectious as it presently is.</p>
