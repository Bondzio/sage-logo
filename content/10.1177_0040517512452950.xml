<p>The preparation of water-based disperse inks was made using water and a mixture of 2-propanol/ethylene glycol as the water-miscible solvent. Ethylene glycol acted also as a wetting agent. The surface tension, pH, viscosity and conductivity of the above formulations were monitored over a period of 360 days. The same inks were prepared by adding solutions of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% w/v of fragrance microcapsules, as well as the same concentrations of an antimicrobial agent dispersion as active additives, and the properties were monitored over 360 days. The compatibility of the two additives with the ink ingredients, as well as the suitability of the final inks for ink-jet printing, was confirmed by these measurements. The inks were used (i) for dyeing polyester and polyamide samples and (ii) for ink-jet printing on paper, transfer printing on polyester and thermostabilization. Wash and light fastness were evaluated on the dyed and printed samples according to BS 1006:1990 CO2 and BO2, respectively, and they were found to be very good to excellent for polyester samples, and medium for polyamide samples. Color measurements of the dyed and printed polyamide and polyester samples were made and the results confirmed the high affinity of the two disperse dyes to the non-polar polyester fiber compared to the polyamide fiber. Qualitative and quantitative determination of the agents adsorbed on the dyed and printed polyester samples was made by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy or spectrophotometrically.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040517512452950" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During recent decades, there has been a growing popularity in the preparation of water-based ink-jet inks for textile printing with special properties due to the successful addition of active agents in the ink formulation. Incorporating successfully an active ingredient (e.g. antimicrobial, fragrance) as a component in an ink according to the ink-jet requirements is a challenge to the producer. It gives the possibility of producing innovative personalized finished articles, reducing the production stages and minimizing waste water and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Among the numerous applications, there has been a growing interest in the development of bio-active textile materials with antimicrobial properties. Textile materials in contact with a body provide the ideal environment for growth and multiplication of pathogenic microbes, leading to objectionable odor, dermal infection, product deterioration, allergies and other related conditions. These factors necessitate the development of methods to impart antimicrobial resistance to textiles. Major known antibacterial agents for textiles are compounds including metals, metal-based complexes, phenolic compounds, etc. To be successful in the marketplace, these finishes should be durable and have selective activity towards undesirable organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512452950">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perfume also is widely associated with daily life. Nowadays, more interest is being given to perfumes in the quest for a back-to-nature or healthy life. As most perfumes are volatile substances, their effect is lost very rapidly from the application site. Thus, perfumes (fragrances) are utilized in the form of microcapsules in many areas, including textiles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512452950">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512452950">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this work was the preparation of two water-based disperse ink-jet inks for polyester textile printing with special properties due to the successful addition of active agents in the ink formulation.</p>
<p>Ink-jet printing is one of the fastest growing imaging technologies; compared to conventional printing methods, ink-jet printing generates lower waste and uses lower amounts of energy and water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512452950">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512452950">6</xref></sup> Ink-jet inks must be carefully formulated to yield specific properties that enable optimum droplet formulation within the fine nozzles of a printing head for application at high speed. Such properties are dependent upon the pH, surface tension, viscosity and conductivity of the ink. Furthermore, inks designed for ink-jet printing on textile materials need to satisfy various fastness criteria, namely wash and light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512452950">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512452950">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Water-based ink-jet inks offer environmental advantages over their non-aqueous-based counterparts through reduced emission of volatile organic compounds that otherwise are present in solvent-based formulations. With environmental considerations continuing to have an ever-greater impact upon industry and legislation, textile producers have to examine carefully the environmental impact of the products used. Water-based inks contain typically 30–80% water as a proportion of the total mass of the ink, together with a water-miscible organic solvent, such as monohydric alcohol, the colorant (e.g. disperse dye) and a surface active agent, which in the case of disperse dyes acts as a dispersant for the dye in the aqueous medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512452950">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512452950">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The active ingredients used in this work were: (i) fragrance microcapsules and (ii) the antimicrobial agent triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)]phenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512452950">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The surface tension, pH, viscosity and conductivity of all ink formulations were monitored over a period of 360 days for the fragrance microcapsules and for the antimicrobial agent. The same properties were measured for the reference ink (without active ingredients).</p>
<p>The inks were used (i) for application on polyester samples by exhaustion (dyeing) and (ii) for ink-jet printing on paper, transfer printing on polyester and thermostabilization. Wash and light fastness were evaluated on the dyed and printed samples according to BS1006:1990CO2 and BO2, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512452950">12</xref></sup> Qualitative and quantitative determination was made for the fragrance microcapsules adsorbed on the fabrics by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Indirect quantitative determination was made for the antimicrobial agent by measuring its exhaustion from the dye bath spectrophotometrically.</p>

The antimicrobial additive results in all cases in a slight increase in pH values compared to the reference, due to the phenolic slightly alkaline (pH 7.9) triclosan solution in ethylene glycol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512452950">Figure 4</xref>). The addition of fragrance microcapsules contrarily results in a slight decrease in pH values of formulations 1.2, 2.2, 1.4, 2.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512452950">Table 1</xref>), probably due to the free or esterified acetic, trichloroacetic, butanoic acids detected by GC-MS in a solution of the commercial product. However, these pH values remain acceptable or need a slight correction in the case of the blue inks.</p>
<p>The presence of both triclosan and aroma microcapsules results in an increase in conductivity values compared to the reference, which already presents high conductivity values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512452950">5</xref></sup> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512452950">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512452950">7</xref>). Conductivity increased by time due to the dissociation of the dispersing agent, Alcosperse LFD, a condensation product of formaldehyde sulfonic acid sodium salt, and the presence of charged species in the ink.

<p>The blue dye showed slightly higher conductivity values due to the fact that it is a higher energy disperse dye requiring more dispersing agent at the manufacturing stage and thus showing higher conductivity values than the yellow dye.</p>
<p>Typical surface tension values of commercial ink-jet inks for textile printing are in the range of 21–48 or 30–60 mNm<sup>–1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512452950">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512452950">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512452950">8</xref></sup> As Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512452950">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512452950">9</xref> show, the surface tension values of the inks are of this range. The yellow ink formulations show a sharp increase in surface tension values until day 7, then remaining stable with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512452950">Figure 9</xref>). Surface tension values of the inks with the active agent, triclosan or aroma are lower than those without the active agent, but still in the acceptable range. For the blue ink formulations, surface tension values increase with time for the first 90 or 180 days remaining, then are satisfactorily stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512452950">Figure 8</xref>). The surface tension increased at the early stage and remained relatively constant afterwards, due to the presence of polar groups in the structure of the dyes, such as OH, NH<sub>2</sub>, and the gradual dissociation of the dispersing agent. From Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512452950">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512452950">9</xref> it is concluded that the addition of the active agent, either triclosan or aroma, results in a decrease in the surface tension of the formulations, which favors their wettability on the printed fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512452950">16</xref></sup>

<p>Acceptable viscosity values for ink-jet inks are proposed to be values lower than 2 cp, although it is known for such an ink to have a viscosity up to 3 cp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512452950">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512452950">17</xref></sup> Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512452950">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512452950">11</xref> show that the addition of aroma microcapsules results in a sharp increase in viscosity values of the initial ink formulation until day 7, followed by a decrease until day 90, then remaining stable in the acceptable range of viscosity values.

<p>The viscosity decrease is due to the dissociation of the dispersing agent and the strong dispersing action of the anionic groups. The ink formulations were applied to polyester and polyamide fibers both by exhaustion (dyeing) and by transfer printing and thermostabilization. It was decided to apply the ink-jet printing inks on polyester also by exhaustion in order to investigate if the presence of solvents could have any beneficial effect during exhaustion dyeing. Obviously, the preparation of digital printing inks exclusively targets the market of digital printing. However, the good storage stability of ink-jet printing inks could also be beneficial for the production of stable liquid formulations of disperse dyes for conventional polyester dyeing and printing.</p>
<p>The presence of alcohols in the digital ink formulation was thought to be beneficial to the dyeing of the synthetic fibers by acting as a solvent to the dye, and it may alter the rigidity of the crystalline areas of the polymers.</p>

<p>The wash fastness values of the dyed polyester and polyamide samples are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512452950">Table 2</xref>. The staining of the wool, polyester and acrylic fibers in the multifiber strip was found to have a score of 5 in most cases (cotton, polyester, acrylic, wool). As was expected, the man-made less hydrophilic fibers, nylon and acetate, were stained more by both disperse non-ionic dyes. Color change was also very good (4–5) to excellent (5) in most cases. The good fastness properties after washing are mainly from the dye structure in correlation to the fiber structure. Light fastness of the dyed polyester samples was excellent in all cases, while polyamide samples presented a medium (5, yellow dyeings) to low (2, blue dyeings) light fastness value. The printed samples presented excellent wash and light fastness (scores 5 and &gt;7) in all cases, except for the polyamide samples, which had light fastness scores of 2 (blue samples) and 5 (yellow samples).

<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512452950">Table 3</xref>, the following are concluded: <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values of the polyester dyeing, both blue and yellow, are significantly high (23.3–28.8) depending on the dye used and the presence/absence of the active agent. In particular, in the case of Disperse Blue 60 with the highest molecular weight, the active agent seems to act as a carrier, increasing the <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> value (formulations 1.2–1.7). This could be related to the dye adsorbed on the fiber, since in the range of concentrations the used <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> is proportional to the dye concentration adsorbed on the fiber according to the Equation (2):

where <italic>K</italic> is the absorbance coefficient, <italic>S</italic> is the scattering coefficient, <italic>R</italic> is the % reflectance, <italic>a</italic> is the constant and <italic>c</italic> is the dye concentration %.</p>
<p>The more hydrophilic fiber polyamide presented significantly lower <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values with both disperse non-ionic dyes, especially with Disperse Blue 60 with the highest molecular weight. Consequently, <italic>L</italic>* values for the polyamide samples were higher than those of polyester samples due to the lighter shades produced. With negative <italic>a</italic>* and <italic>b</italic>* values and <italic>h</italic> = 208–243°, the blue polyester and polyamide dyeings lie in the blue–green sector of the color circle. All the yellow polyester dyeings with positive <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> values and <italic>h</italic> = 76.4–95.6° lie in the yellow–red sector of the color circle, with the exception of the formulations with triclosan 2.5–2.7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512452950">Table 1</xref>), which resulted in a slight color shifting towards the yellow–green sector (negative <italic>a</italic> value, <italic>h</italic> value slightly higher than 90°). Contrarily, all the yellow polyamide fibers having negative <italic>a</italic> values and <italic>h</italic> values &gt;90° (98.1–107.2°) show a shift to the yellow–green hue of the color circle, which is also visually confirmed.</p>

<p><italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values of the printed polyester samples were, in all cases, significantly low compared to the samples produced by dyeing, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512452950">Table 4</xref> for both inks, and this can be attributed to the low quantity of colorant, sometimes insufficient, reaching the surface of the sample (droplets through the fine nozzles at high speed). <italic>L</italic>* values for the printed samples were higher than those of the dyed samples due to the lighter shades produced by printing. Positive <italic>b</italic>* values (formulations 1.1, 1.6) and <italic>h</italic> values slightly lower than 180° (164.3° and 168.8°, respectively) show a slight shifting towards the green–yellow sector of the color circle, while the rest of the blue polyester and polyamide printings are clearly found in the blue sector (<italic>h</italic> = 207.8–220.6°).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512452950">13</xref></sup></p>

<list id="list1-0040517512452950" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Many alcohols and essential oils were detected by GC-MS in an aqueous solution of the commercial product – eucalyptol, linalool and its derivatives furanmenthol, camphor, borneol, phytol, terpineol cis‐, beta- as well as free or esterified acetic acids, trichloroacetic, butanoic – lowering the pH of the formulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extraction with hexane of the adsorbed fragrance on the dyed polyester was made after dyeing. In the extract, under the temperature of 120°C and pressure conditions of the dyeing, linalool oxide and derivatives of furamenthol were detected by GC-MS. Polycondensation and dehydrogenation reactions are taking place, thus long-chain alkanes and alkenes are detected: <italic>C</italic> atoms ∼ 800; some cyclizations and couplings are also taking place: cyclohexane and substituents, pentafluoropropionic acid heptade.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The same procedure was followed for the printed polyester sample. Under the severe temperature 200°C and pressure conditions of the transfer printing and thermostabilization, none of the above volatile constituents protected in the microcapsules was detected in the extract. The presence of several sugars – mannitol and derivatives, glyagent citol, sorbitol, galactose and cyclic amines: piperidine, pyrolidine, pyridine and derivatives – were detected, as well as a large number of silane derivatives (substituted, siloxane, silyloxy), apparently due to lubricants on the apparatus used.</p></list-item>

<p>The preparation of water-based disperse inks was made using water and a mixture of 2-propanol/ethylene glycol as the water-miscible solvent. The surface tension, pH, viscosity and conductivity of the above formulations were monitored over a period of 360 days to evaluate the prepared ink stability. The same inks were prepared by adding solutions of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% w/v of fragrance microcapsules, as well as the same concentrations of an antimicrobial agent dispersion in the formulation as active additives, and the properties were monitored over 360 days. The inks were used (i) for dyeing polyester and polyamide samples and (ii) for ink-jet printing on paper, transfer printing on polyester and thermostabilization. Wash and light fastness were evaluated on the dyed and printed samples according to BS 1006:1990 CO2 and BO2, respectively. Light fastness of the dyed polyester samples was excellent in all cases, while polyamide samples presented medium (5, yellow dyeings) to low (2, blue dyeings) light fastness values. Color change after washing was excellent (score 5) to very good (4–5 for the yellow polyester samples). The presence of the active agent did not affect the fastness properties of the samples.</p>
<p>Color strength <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values of the polyester dyeing, both blue and yellow, are significantly high, and the presence of the active agents resulted in a further increase in <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values of the polyester samples. The more hydrophilic fiber polyamide presented significantly lower <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values with both disperse non-ionic dyes. <italic>K</italic>/<italic>S</italic> values of the printed polyester samples were in all cases significantly low compared to the samples produced by dyeing.</p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative determination of the agents adsorbed on the dyed and printed polyester samples was made by GC-MS or spectrophotometrically.</p>
