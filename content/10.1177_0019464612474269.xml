<p>This book begins and ends with cases of contemporary Indian ‘secular’ political culture: the murder of Australian missionary Graham Staines, and the case of N.K. Mukarji, the Cabinet Secretary of Prime Minister Morarji Desai in 1977. They were both Christians, and together with other contemporary cases, are riveting, and exemplify how the author manages to move from the past to the present, covering a large span of time in her history. Her aim is to make sense of the complex story of how Christianity was largely responsible for the particular culture of secularism in India.</p>
<p>Before coming to that argument, however, let me say that Nandini Chatterjee’s book is a contribution not only to the story of secularism, but to the history of Christianity itself. Perhaps it will never be read or included in courses on Christianity, that is, World Christianity, however they may be called, but it deserves to be. In five of the eight chapters, Chatterjee describes in fascinating detail: the law regarding religious endowments, the emergence of Personal Law, the case of educational institutions, the nature of race consciousness and the formulations of faith in the Christian Church in India. Given the colonial history of Christianity in India, beginning with the Charter Act of 1813 when evangelicals succeeded in instating Anglican bishops in India and the East India Company paid for their support (through Indian—that is, Hindu, Muslim, etc.—revenues, of course), the story is naturally one that is <italic>also</italic> of the empire, its law and its racism. Chatterjee’s book is exciting because it constantly draws our attention to the connections between all these processes.</p>
<p>In education, for instance, Christian missionary entrepreneurs found a favourable field because they offered a secular–doctrinal education that was not legally disallowed by the state as religious instruction was. With increasing state sensitivity to its Indian subjects, the rights of the ‘community’ to ensure conformity, among other things, became highlighted. This new definition of religion as the ‘private possessions’ of legally defined communities was furthered by the law regulating religious trusts, also to be controlled by the communities.</p>
<p>Nandini Chatterjee has an excellent corrective, if that is the right word, to the understanding of history itself. Again and again she reminds us, illustrating with well-chosen examples (and digs at those blunter in their sensitivity to historical niceties, such as Homi Bhabha or Gauri Vishwanathan), that each category, such as ‘Christian’ itself, was complex in its experiential reality, and may be used for analytical purposes but only with reflexivity as to the reality it is supposed to define. The experiences of living people—evangelicals, British Christians, Indian Christians—are what the history is about, and not about a thesis regarding colonialism, nationalism and reform. History is for Chatterjee also a relationship—between the Empire and its subjects, on issues of politics, law and race; between the subjects themselves, along caste and class divides; and along the rulers along politics and religious denomination. Finally, history is for Chatterjee very much about agency, and sometimes unplanned results: not about a state or a church plan, but on the upsetting or abortion of the plan.</p>
<p>Because it is a complex story that she tells, we may be diffident in declaring ourselves convinced or persuaded. I found two of the chapters particularly persuasive and valuable to the larger story of nationalism, education and modernity in India. Chapter 4 on St Stephens College presents the particular travails of Christian institutions through the historical processes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The result was the product called the Stephanian, that
<disp-quote>
<p>… consisted not so much of casualness about religious affiliation as a studied denial of its importance to the modern Indian man.… The Stephanian was in some senses a brand, one that was meant to transcend the inherited bonds … uncompromisingly elite, male and, while non-religious, definitely not Christian for most students. (pp. 130–31)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Chatterjee points out that it is not that an institution like St Stephen’s demands a negation of indigenous identity; more importantly, it sets a model for Indian modernity by effacing its sectarian identity as a <italic>Christian</italic> institution. This is the less-known part of the history of Christianity in India, and it makes a lot of sense to scholars of nationalism and modernity.</p>
<p>The second wonderful chapter for me is on ‘Race, Authority and Conflict in the Indian Church’. We have the chronological developments again, and the emergence of familiar issues. There was ‘common sense racism’ that nobody protested: Indian priests could only serve Indian Christians, even if they were educated and English-speaking. Indian Christians, in their turn, wished to control their institutions, and Indian Christian leaders perceived the future of a successful Church as lying in its Indianisation. The unspoken word was ‘racism’ of course. A combination of that with the choice made by Indian Christians to ally themselves with the progressive, reforming new nation that was emerging in the nationalist struggle, made the Church an Indian one only after independence. But alongside, there was also throughout the debate on religious doctrine and its social and cultural expression. This continues over into the next chapter on ‘Rethinking Christianity: Formulating their Faith’ where Chatterjee makes her final point about history: that questions of belief, including esoteric discussions about theology, are inextricably linked to relations of power within which the theological and other articulations are made. Knowledge and power as bound together is, of course, a more familiar position.</p>
<p>Nandini Chatterjee’s book is difficult to read, but a pleasure also. Her narrative powers are delightful. Her sense of the important gets hidden sometimes between the details of the narration and the structure of the book. The production itself could have been different: with wider margins, and footnotes not numbered in a prohibitive sequence. My review has stressed, I hope, that the book is an important one, on the history of Christianity, on ways of doing history, and on the emergence of secularism and modernity in colonial India.</p>
