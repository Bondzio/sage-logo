<abstract>
<p>Childhood and consumption are each firmly established as substantive topics in sociology, yet the relationship between them remains narrowly considered. In this paper I attempt to deepen sociological understanding of one aspect of children’s consumption (their clothing) through reimagining the structure and agency problematic via a novel theorization centred on the concept of determinativity. I do this by engaging in a critical evaluation and adaptive use of existing theories, and by using data from an empirical study to illustrate and strengthen the theoretical claims I make. Children are argued to be exceptional consumers, in that what they come to wear on their bodies is subject to a different set of social processes than is the case for adults. At the same time, the theorization offered in this paper suggests ways forward for rethinking how individuals at all stages of the life course interactively engage in consumer societies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood and consumption are each firmly established as substantive topics in sociology – yet, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453661">Martens, Southerton and Scott (2004)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook (2008)</xref>, the relationship between them remains narrowly considered. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453661">Martens et al. (2004)</xref>, sociologies of culture and consumption have paid relatively little detailed and systematic theoretical attention to children. At the same time, in sociologies of childhood, children’s relationship to cultural phenomena has tended to be viewed primarily in terms of the production and distribution of commodities within the market economy (production of consumption perspectives), rather than in terms of how consumption comes to represent statuses and identities and mediate social interactions within practices of consumption (mode of consumption perspectives). Consequently, children’s own agency and practices have been overlooked, including in terms of the ways they learn to consume, along with the ‘intimate connections’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453661">2004</xref>: 175) between consumption by children and that of their parents.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook (2008)</xref>, the acknowledgement of children’s cultural presence and practices does not merely mean that the sociology of consumption must more often bring children into the frame of culture or must better accommodate children and childhood. Cook argues that, in fact, children and childhood are central to consumption and economic life: ‘Specifically, when children are acknowledged as social-economic actors and beings who are dependent in various ways on the actions of caretakers [especially women], the relational and co-productive nature of acquiring, having or displaying things becomes evident and unavoidable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">2008</xref>: 222). From this perspective, focusing on the relationship between childhood, children and consumption holds the prospect of transforming understandings of the complex relationship of culture to social structures and how culture informs human subjectivity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512453661">Buckingham and Tingstad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512453661">James et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, I develop the notion that cultural consumption is important in contemporary understandings of childhood and experiences of children, and that, in turn, children and childhood are topics with potential for the transformative development of theories and research in culture and consumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook (2008)</xref> has made a case for seeing children and childhood as centrally constitutive of, rather than derivative of or exceptional to, consumer culture. However, it is my contention in this paper that it is, after all, necessary to develop a specific theorization of <italic>children’s</italic> consumption of clothing, because children must be recognized in important respects as ‘exceptional’ consumers, vis-à-vis adults. Through a critical evaluation and adaptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512453661">Layder, 1998</xref>) of existing theories, and using data from an empirical study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512453661">1</xref></sup> on children’s consumption of clothing to illustrate and strengthen my theoretical claims, I set out a theorization of children’s consumption of clothing that brings together perspectives from both cultural sociology and mainstream sociology. I argue that aspects of some existing theoretical perspectives in the sociology of consumption are useful. However, none sufficiently allow for either the structuring effects of discourses of childhood, nor for the foregrounding of the meaningful consumption of clothing by children in relation to ‘aspects of their identity and with[in] their context and everyday experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512453661">Kehily and Swann, 2003</xref>: 275). I suggest that, to deepen sociological understanding of children’s clothing consumption, existing consumption perspectives (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453661">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>) need to be accompanied by perspectives that engage with discursive formations of childhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453661">Archard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453661">James and James, 2004</xref>) and with Goffman’s approach to the self (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453661">1971 [1959]</xref>). The bringing together of sociology of consumption perspectives with broader sociological perspectives leads to my novel theorization of ‘determinativity’ in children’s consumption of clothing. In so doing, I suggest a route to rethinking the ways in which all individuals, at various stages of the life course, interactively engage in consumer culture.</p>

<title>Childhood, Consumption and Clothing</title>
<p>Clothing consumption, the focus of this paper, is a sociologically important practice, and firmly established as a topic of interest for social scientists. First and foremost, in all cultures, clothing (or other forms of bodily adornment) is used to ‘add a whole array of meanings to the body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 33), especially in relation to self and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512453661">Davis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512453661">Finkelstein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512453661">Lurie, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1749975512453661">Wilson, 2003</xref>). Second, the meaningful choice, acquisition and use of clothing is structured: it is a practice subject to social, cultural and moral constraints. What is worn on bodies, and that anything is worn at all, is constrained, for example, by what is available via the market, by access to material resources, by cultural norms or discursive formations about clothing in relation to, say, age and gender, and within particular contexts or locales according to activities undertaken or roles performed there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512453661">Davis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1749975512453661">Wilson, 2003</xref>). Finally, clothing as ‘an apparently high speed, high greed phenomenon, seems to epitomize many aspects of contemporary consumer society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512453661">Edwards, 2000</xref>: 150). Recent trends in the consumption of children’s clothing can be considered as a case in point. In Europe and the US, the market in children’s clothing is considerable, including in branded and designer children’s clothes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512453661">Euromonitor PLC, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1749975512453661">Mintel, 2008</xref>). In such contexts, the marketing term ‘tweenager’ (or ‘tween’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512453661">2</xref></sup> has gained wider currency, as a description of children aged between about 8 and 12 (especially girls) who, like teenagers and adults, are knowing, active consumers of fashion. ‘Tweenagers’, or so it would seem from popular interpretations of market trends (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453661">BBC, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512453661">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1749975512453661">Williams, 2010</xref>), seem less like ‘children’ and more like young adults in their use of fashionable clothing as a means of constructing and presenting self-identity. However, in keeping with the limited attention paid to children and consumption noted above, there has been relatively little scholarly focus on the socio-cultural significance of the relationship between children, clothing and consumption (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512453661">Cahill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453661">Cook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453661">Cook and Kaiser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512453661">Konig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1749975512453661">Swain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1749975512453661">Waerdahl, 2005</xref>). Consequently, and in the light of points made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453661">Martens et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook (2008)</xref>, there is plentiful scope for the development of sociological theorization offered in this paper.</p>

<title>Determinativity: A New Theory of Children’s Consumption of Clothing</title>
<p>The core questions that a sociologically adequate theorization of children’s consumption of clothing must address can be expressed as follows. First, how is children’s consumption of clothing shaped by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453661">James and James (2004)</xref> have called ‘the cultural determinants of childhood’ (social and cultural institutions and structures, and discourses about children in relation to these)? Second, how is children’s consumption of clothing shaped by the ways that children themselves conceptualize and realize who they are or want to be, within the context of their here and now, a here and now which includes the discourses and practices of the cultural determinants of childhood? In answer to these questions and in a reimagining of the structure and agency problematic, I engage in a critical evaluation and adaptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512453661">Layder, 1998</xref>) of existing theories and draw on findings from an empirical study to develop a novel, substantive theorization of children’s consumption of clothing. This theorization centres on the notion of ‘determinativity’, in which different social and cultural processes or frameworks operating at a range of levels are argued to determine (in the sense of defining, qualifying or directing) children’s consumption of clothing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512453661">3</xref></sup> I identify four social and cultural frameworks that together act determinatively to shape children’s consumption of clothing. These are ‘discourses of childhood’, the ‘production-market’, ‘the life world’ and ‘me-making’.</p>
<sec id="section4-1749975512453661">
<title>The Determinative Framework of Discourses of Childhood</title>
<p>My first proposition is that discourses of childhood (as sets of ideas and knowledge about children, and the institutional and social structural contexts and practices within which and through which these ideas and knowledge circulate) are of fundamental importance as a determinative framework of children’s clothing consumption. Indeed, it is discourses of childhood<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1749975512453661">4</xref></sup> which make it necessary to develop a specific theorization in relation to children.</p>
<p>Scrutiny of (re)constructions of childhood through discursive formations circulating in a range of institutional contexts is an established feature of the sociology of childhood (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453661">Archard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512453661">Hendrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1749975512453661">Jenks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1749975512453661">Pilcher and Wagg, 1996</xref>), but this approach is not so evident in relation to children’s consumption of clothing. (An exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453661">Cook (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453661">2004)</xref>, which I consider later in my discussion of the production-market.) In relation to fashion and dress per se, Entwhistle has argued for the value of Foucauldian (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512453661">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512453661">1980</xref>) approaches to discursive formations in providing an analysis of the way different bodies are ‘talked about and acted upon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 40). Such approaches offer insights into the ways age-related power relations act through discourses to contribute to the constitution of the identities of those individuals occupying the life course stage of childhood, their bodies and the clothes that are worn on them. One contemporary example of how discourses of childhood have a defining, qualifying and directing influence on children’s consumption of clothing is captured in the concept of ‘the tweenager’. As noted earlier, there have been publicly expressed and widely reported concerns as to what this development means for contemporary forms of childhood, and especially feminine childhood (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512453661">Department for Education, 2011</xref>). Such expressions of concern need to be understood in terms of dominant discourses of childhood as, especially, a time of ‘innocence’ and ‘incompetence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453661">Archard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512453661">Ennew, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512453661">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1749975512453661">Jenks, 1996</xref>). In the context of these discourses of childhood, clothing consumed by children comes under increased adult surveillance.</p>
<p>Critical appropriations of Foucauldian arguments on the disciplinary power of discourses of childhood in relation to clothing and children must also engage with the enabling and pleasurable aspects of such discourses for children; for example, in relation to children’s enjoyment of and skills in their ‘tribal cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512453661">James et al., 1998</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1749975512453661">Russell and Tyler, 2002</xref>). Findings from our study point, for example, to the pleasure some children experienced in their clothing practices which conformed to elements of dominant discourses of childhood. These children enjoyed playing ‘dressing up’ games involving adult apparel, or the wearing of clothing that displayed ‘cute’ and ‘cuddly’ properties or which depicted characters from children’s media culture in their design and styling. For example, Hayley (aged 8) owned a couple of pairs of high-heeled shoes which she only wore inside her house when she was playing ‘dressing up’. Hayley’s wardrobe also contained what she described as ‘my Tigger stuff’, which she said was ‘comfy’ and ‘cute’ and might be worn when going out to the cinema with her friends. These findings suggest that the social effects of disciplinary discourses are not necessarily experienced by individuals as disabling and/or displeasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 40–41). To paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512453661">Hacking (2004</xref>: 300), we have to go to Goffman (as I do later) to begin to think about how in everyday life individuals come to incorporate discourses as part of their selves, in their practices of what I call ‘me-making’.</p>
<p>Discourses of childhood are not free-floating, <italic>sui generis</italic> phenomena. As my point about discourses and me-making suggests, discourses of childhood ‘are, and indeed have to be, enacted’, or given practical realization and material form through social practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453661">James and James, 2004</xref>: 74). In the following sections, I show how discourses of childhood are enacted and reproduced through social practices within each of the other three social and cultural contexts or frameworks identified in this paper as determinatively shaping children’s consumption of clothing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1749975512453661">
<title>The Determinative Framework of the Production-market</title>
<p>My second proposition is that the ‘production-market’ of children’s clothing is a determinative framework in the consumption of children’s clothing. As suggested in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453661">Cook (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453661">2004)</xref>, this refers to the interrelations of discourses, practices and contexts within the market that combine to produce the prevailing children’s wear ‘offer’ and its subsequent engagement with by consumers and which, in the process, operates as a defining, qualifying and directing influence upon children’s consumption of clothing.</p>
<p>There are examples of ‘production of consumption’ approaches to clothing and fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512453661">Blumer, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453661">Bourdieu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512453661">Kawamura, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1749975512453661">Leopold, 1992</xref>), although, apart from Cook’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453661">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453661">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453661">Cook and Kaiser, 2004</xref>), not in relation to children’s clothing specifically. Cook examines how the discourses of ‘cultural brokers’ within the 20th-century North American children’s clothing industry constructed ‘particular versions of childhood … as sites for commercial activity and expansion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453661">2000</xref>: 112), invoking psycho-medical constructions of the needs and dispositions of ‘the child’ as a gendered and age-differentiated consumer. In general, production of consumption approaches emphasize the role of industry personnel (such as designers and buyers) and their creativity and stimulus for inspiration in shaping what gets offered to consumers, whilst also allowing for the complexity and interactivity of the relationship between producers and consumers in terms of supply and demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1749975512453661">Rocamora, 2002</xref>: 352; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1749975512453661">Miller, 1987</xref>).Clearly, the consumption practices of children, outlined earlier through UK clothing market data and illustrated in this paper by data from our empirical study, are unavoidably embedded in the activities and outputs of actors in the clothing industry, along with other ‘cultural intermediaries’ (for example, in advertising and the media) who produce and disseminate consumer culture imagery and information<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1749975512453661">5</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512453661">Featherstone, 1991</xref>: 84, 87).</p>
<p>Producers of children’s clothing in our study, such as buyers, retailers, and marketers, invoked and reproduced discourses of childhood. Examples included references to the demands of ‘the child’ as a gendered consumer (‘You look at most young girls, when am I getting my first pair of heels?…when can I wear a crop top? …. they absorb [media] influences now much more easily’ – Buyer, supermarket retailer), to ‘tweenaged’ consumers (‘Children are actually making the decisions on what they are wearing a lot earlier’ – Buyer, supermarket retailer) and about ‘the parent’ as a mediator of clothing consumption (‘You’ll see a woman shopping on her own and the trolley will be full of children’s clothing … So the parent is making that decision at that moment in time without the kid being present’ – Supermarket retailer, Store Manager). Such discourses of childhood invoked by buyers, retailers, and marketers as to the needs and interests of the child consumer and of their parents (including in terms of gender) are linked with the adjustment and adaptation of producer offerings in these contexts: ‘We won’t do things that are too short …We wouldn’t do something that was too sheer and see-through’ (Buyer, supermarket retailer).</p>
<p>Findings from our study of producers of children’s clothing point to the children’s wear ‘offer’ being an outcome of a complex mix: of discourses of childhood; of sartorial creativity and groping for the future by designers (‘We do look at the [grown-ups] catwalk … We’ve got designers out in [the Far East] because the [trends], they come a little bit earlier [there]’ – Children’s Wear Design Manager, national clothing retailer); of the constraints of business and market processes, including production and distribution (‘We’ve actually gone to other suppliers as well now to cut that time down, because it was taking months whereas now we’ve got it down to 6 weeks’– Clothing Manager, supermarket retailer); of competition and rivalry between different producers (‘They’ve [supermarkets] had the effect of depressing the market, bringing the average selling price down …it’s actually in kids’ wear that they’ve made the biggest inroads’ – Market Research Manager, national clothing retailer); and of company ‘ethos’ in relation to design (‘Well, we’ve got a brand to protect, apart from anything else’ – Children’s Wear Design Manager, national clothing retailer). As these data extracts suggest, the creativity, intentions and practices of designers, marketers, buyers and retailers and other executive decision-makers, variously positioned within and constrained by business processes and cultures, and in the context of discourses of childhood, in combination produce the children’s wear ‘offer’, which then stretches across time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1749975512453661">Giddens, 1984</xref>) to provide an important element of the context within which children then consume clothing. The importance of discourses of childhood within the production-market of children’s clothing is embedded in the very structure and practices of the industry, from job titles (‘Children’s Wear Manager’) to the square meters of retail floor space given over to ‘children’s clothing’: it is only discourses of gender that have an equivalent role in the structure and practices of the production-market of clothing and fashion.</p>
<p>As necessary and revealing as a focus on the ‘market frame’ of the production of children’s clothing is, its weakness as a stand alone perspective is that it cannot, in and of itself, furnish insight into children’s meaningful choices, acquisition and use of their own clothing in the life world. What is missing from approaches that examine the production side of consumption is an understanding of the ways in which things, once produced, are consumed by actors in the everyday contexts of their lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1749975512453661">
<title>The Determinative Framework of the Life World</title>
<p>My third proposition is that the life world of children is a determinative framework of children’s consumption of clothing. By life world, I mean children’s everyday world of meanings, activities and intentions involving knowledge, experiences, communication and interactions with parents, family, peers and other adults in a range of contexts, and related to the institutional, economic and cultural structures of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1749975512453661">Layder, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the sociology of consumption, it is the ‘mode of consumption’ grouping of perspectives that have focused attention on understanding the meaningful use in the life world of goods or commodities, including clothing, in the marking of social distinctions (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453661">Baudrillard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453661">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512453661">Featherstone, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1749975512453661">Maffesoli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1749975512453661">Simmel, 1957 [1904]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1749975512453661">Veblen, 1994 [1899]</xref>). However, in keeping with tendencies noted in the introduction to be characteristic of the sociology of consumption, these perspectives have rarely focused directly on either children or childhood. Children are largely absent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453661">Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> work on consumption in relation to capital and habitus, but it nonetheless has its uses for explaining aspects of our findings on children’s consumption of clothing in the life world, including in relation to social inclusion/exclusion and relationships with parents and peers.</p>
<p>In Bourdieu’s argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453661">1984</xref>), habitus is experienced, learnt and internalized principally through family relationships, and through education. It is the keystone through which the (re)production of hierarchical social class relations (re)occurs. Bourdieu’s work here is especially relevant to thinking about the relationship between children and consumption: intergenerational family relations are portrayed as central to the learning of habitus, to the transfer of forms of capital and to social reproduction through consumption practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453661">Martens et al., 2004</xref>: 163–4; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512453661">Konig, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from our own study do show that consumption orientations to clothing, including designer clothing, are to some extent shared by parents and children and in ways that do show different holdings of various forms of economic, social and cultural capital. For example, Robert (aged 8) identified 12 designer labels or brands during the course of our fieldwork with him (nearly twice as many as any other child). Robert had a strong interest in clothes, went on frequent clothes shopping trips and had branded or designer label clothing in his wardrobe. Robert’s mother, Kate, was also very interested in fashion and herself had a preference for designer label and branded clothing: ‘I like the label, I like the name and I love the quality of the clothes’. In contrast, Hayley (aged 8) had a low awareness of or at least placed very little significance upon the importance of branded or designer label clothing. When asked if she had any clothing with a logo or a label on, Hayley thought she was being asked if she had clothes with a motif on the outside and/or a label on the inside with laundry instructions. Further questions led Hayley to explain that she thought it was ‘stupid’ for people to want to wear particular brands or labels of clothes: ‘I don’t see what the point is’. Hayley’s ideas were in keeping with those of her mother Janet. She described herself as giving ‘low importance’ to fashion and said that she tried to convey that view to Hayley, too: ‘In little ways, I’m probably trying to suggest that [Hayley] rejects too much emphasis on fashion and judging people by it’. The contrasting orientations to branded clothing exemplified by Robert and Hayley can be argued to reflect their differing economic circumstances, their spatial locations and the differing configurations of family ‘habitus’, in Bourdieu’s terms.</p>
<p>A further expression of family habitus relates to ways in which children’s practices of clothing consumption were the outcome of negotiation with their parents, and especially their mothers, about which items got bought, and when and where items could be worn. For example, Katy (aged 7) said that her mother did not really like her to have clothes with glitter or sparkle on them and that they often argued about the purchase and wearing of tops without any sleeves. In her explanation of why this was the case, Katy’s mother pointed to the ‘tarty’ and ‘revealing’ styling of the clothing: ‘The only time I give in a little bit is the school disco’.</p>
<p>Important as intergenerational family habitus is, thinking about Bourdieu’s work in relation to children also leads to the understanding that their consumption in the life world is subject to ‘extra-familial’ influences, including by peer groups and in school settings. For example, Aisha (aged 12) referred to the importance of the shared valuing of brands with her peers at school: ‘We’ve got the Kookai brand in school, kind of Kookai mania kind of thing’. Similarly, Robert (aged 8) emphasized the importance of children’s peers in valuing what they wear: ‘If you were like going out with your mates, you’d probably wear your cool stuff because you don’t want your mates to say they’re rubbish’. Within the life world of children, marking distinction through consumption may be less about social class and more about their other status-based identities, including gender and age. For example, in keeping with other studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1749975512453661">O’Cass and McEwen (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1749975512453661">Swain (2002)</xref>, we found an association between branded sports clothing and the presentation of masculinity amongst boys. For example, Soccer Sports was named by Todd (aged 10) as his favourite shop because ‘I like sports and it’s got good things’. Likewise Todd’s favorite brands were all sports brands: Nike, Reebok, Adidas. In relation to age, we found that some children used clothing as a way of ‘ageing up’ – not necessarily to teenagehood or adulthood, but away from children younger than themselves. For example, Megan (aged 7) was quite vehement when asked if she had anything in her wardrobe with Barbie on: ‘No, no, no! … Definitely not Barbie. … She’s too little for me’. Similarly, Emma (aged 5) said she disliked Mothercare because the retailer stocked clothes that were ‘too babyish’.</p>
<p>The life world of children is where they encounter and engage with the institutional, economic and cultural structures of society, which includes the determinative frameworks of discourses of childhood and of the production-market. The data illustrate the ways that clothing consumption by children is enacted relationally and co-productively within their everyday life world of meanings, activities and intentions involving their knowledge, experiences, communication and through interactions with parents, family, peers and others.</p>

<title>Children’s Practices of Determinative Me-making</title>
<p>My fourth proposition is that children themselves are determinative agents in the consumption of their own clothing: they define, qualify and direct their clothing consumption in practices of ‘me-making’, or the presentation of their selves to others, interactively, and within a range of locales, contexts and circumstances.</p>
<p>Part of the value of Bourdieu’s work is that it does show that the ‘way we come to live in our bodies is structured by our social position in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 51), including, as I argue in this paper, by childhood. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1749975512453661">Rocamora (2002)</xref> points out, Bourdieu’s approach also tends to portray the body as a ‘mere carrier’ of clothes, and overlooks the complexity of people’s engagement with clothing in terms of situated and interactive practices of embodied identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1749975512453661">2002</xref>: 355, 356–8). For me, such weaknesses in Bourdieu’s approach to consumption reflect his lack of attention to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1749975512453661">Layder (1994</xref>: 157) calls the ‘emergent properties of particular situations’ in face-to-face encounters between individual selves and other social actors.</p>
<p>In contrast, Goffman’s work on the ‘social self’ has particular value in calling forth the meanings given to clothing consumption by individuals, including children, as embodied and emotional selves, situated in the contexts and experiences of their activities and face-to-face relationships (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512453661">Davis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512453661">Finkelstein, 1991</xref>). In various works (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453661">1971 [1959]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512453661">1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512453661">1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512453661">1967</xref>), Goffman portrays individuals as embodied actors, whose identities are interactively communicated and negotiated through ‘presentation’ or ‘performance’ to particular audiences, and ‘framed’ by spatial surroundings. Clothes are central to what Goffman termed ‘the presentation of self in everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453661">1971 [1959]</xref>), through ‘personal front’. These are the ‘items of expressive equipment’ or ‘the complex of clothing, make-up, hairdo and other surface decorations’ on the body that accompany the individual at all times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453661">1971 [1959]</xref>: 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512453661">1963</xref>: 25). Goffman’s account points to the ways clothing is the link between individual identity and the body, in that clothing worn on the body is a costume/prop for the performance of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 47). Clothing is also the link between the social self and the audience that the actor orientates her/his performance to, so as to achieve a shared definition of the situation, in differing spatial locations, and thereby ‘pass’ or ‘fit in’, avoiding social stigma, shame and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512453661">Goffman, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453661">Entwhistle, 2001</xref>: 47, 48; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453661">Frost, 2005</xref>: 78; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512453661">Konig, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1749975512453661">Pugh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Goffman’s approach is valuable in bringing into focus the meanings and understandings of children themselves in the embodied consumption of their own clothing, and in the socio-spatial contexts of their life world, including the important audiences of same-age peers. Findings from our study of children’s clothing consumption show that children aged 6 to 11 are skilled and knowledgeable presenters of selves through their clothing consumption, and that they are reflexive and purposeful about the clothes they had or wanted to have. For example, children in our study grouped their clothes into categories based on their appropriateness for particular contexts, whether this was ‘going out night clothes’ (Megan, aged 7), ‘cool stuff’, ‘sports clothing’ and ‘smart clothes’ (Robert aged 8), or ‘my Tigger stuff’ (Hayley, aged 8). Likewise, Jessica (aged 10) recognized the importance of what you wear in terms of trying to influence how others respond to you: ‘People see what you look like before they realize what you are like, so they judge you before they find out your personality. So you show your personality in what you are wearing.’</p>
<p>Our data show that children in our study had a complex understanding of the ways their consumption practices aided (or undermined) their ‘performances’ and bolstered (or damaged) their emotional well-being and sense of belonging, within a range of contexts and to variegated audiences, including in play, social activities and sport, in school and so on. For example, Hayley (aged 8) said that she ‘just kind of liked’ one item of clothing in her wardrobe ‘because everyone else has got one, so I kind of get one to fit in’. Similarly, Saima (aged 11) spoke of her frustration at not being able to get a particular brand (Nike) of top in her size straightaway when she saw it, and her concern that if she had to wait two weeks for it ‘it would be out of fashion and there would be no point in wearing it’. The symbolic value of being ‘in fashion’ was important to Saima’s presentation of self, in particular to make the ‘right’ impression on her peers.</p>
<p>Children also spoke about clothing consumption and their self in terms of their physical experiences and sensations of the texture, fit and styling of clothing upon their bodies. For example, George (aged 10) gave practical, material reasons for his liking of his Nike top (‘it feels nice’) and Nike training shoes (‘They look good and they are comfortable’), whilst Robert (aged 8) persisted in wearing his ‘Ben Sherman trousers’ despite them being loose and ‘a bit uncomfortable’: ‘once you’ve got used to them they are quite nice’. Robert’s preference for fashionable designer-label clothing seemed to be more important to his sense of self than his physical comfort and ease at wearing them. In contrast, Hayley (aged 8) told us how she rarely wore her short kilt ‘because when I sit down it shows my knickers’ and that ‘if I wear a skirt and I choose to do cartwheels … that kind of gets a bit annoying because my skirt comes up’. Hayley found clothing that ‘showed too much bare skin’ to be problematical, and had a preference for clothing that was ‘more covered’, especially in the context of places such as her church and in her locality. This complex, reflexive and purposeful understanding about their consumption of clothing shown by children in our study incorporated elements of discourses of childhood (as noted earlier, for example, in relation to children’s dressing up games and liking for ‘cute’ designs), including in terms of gender, knowledge of the market’s children’s wear ‘offer’ (including the symbolic value of brands and logos) and of the ways in which their consumption was embedded in family ‘habitus’.</p>
<p>Drawing upon the work of Goffman, then, I argue for the importance of recognizing that children use clothing as a means of presentation of self, or what I call ‘me-making’ and that this is a key aspect of clothing consumption as practice. ‘Me-making’ as a concept encapsulates the way in which children use clothing consumption to, as one boy in our study put it, ‘make me look like me’ (Robert, aged 8), or as Hayley (aged 8) said, make themselves be ‘one of a kind’. In other words, children themselves act determinatively in that they serve to define, qualify and direct their own consumption of clothing in the presentation of their selves to others, interactively, and within a range of locales, contexts and circumstances.</p>

<p>Sophie, though small, was very determined. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1749975512453661">Dick King-Smith, 2001</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the spirit of adaptive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512453661">Layder, 1998</xref>), I have in this paper drawn on complementary approaches and concepts from the sociology of consumption and wider sociological theory and considered these in relation to illustrative data drawn from an empirical study of children’s consumption of clothing. In a reimagining of the structure and agency problematic, I have argued (to quote the children’s novelist Dick King-Smith in a description of his indomitable character, Sophie, aged 5) that in their consumption of clothing children are ‘very determined’. First, they are ‘very determined’ by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453661">James and James (2004)</xref> have called the ‘cultural determinants of childhood’ and which I conceptualize in this paper as discourses of childhood, the production-market, and the life world. Second, children are ‘very determined’ by themselves: through acting as ‘determinative agents’ in the consumption of their own clothing. In my theory of determinativity, children are recognized to be engaged in consumption practices in order to conceptualize and realize who they are or who they want to be, within the context of the here and now of their life worlds and the structuring effects of discourses of childhood and the production-market.</p>
<p>My synthetic theorization, especially of ideas from Bourdieu and Goffman (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512453661">Cahill, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512453661">Garner and Hancock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512453661">Hacking, 2004</xref>), has led to a descriptive, concept-creating and explanatory theorization which acts to sharpen sociological focus on the importance and interrelatedness of discourses of childhood, the production-market and the life world as determinative elements in the consumption of children’s clothing, and, just as importantly, on children as determiners (albeit constrained and restricted) of their own clothing consumption. Alone, production of consumption perspectives and mode of consumption perspectives each miss out on key processes of the consumption of children’s clothing that the other perspective addresses. Equally, alone, general sociological theoretical approaches focusing on discursive formations of childhood, or the presentation of self, each miss out on key processes more effectively addressed by the other. Accounting for children’s clothing consumption requires a multi-level, synthetic theorization, such as is offered in this paper, in order to encompass the various ways in which this practice is both socially structured and the outcome of individual agency by children as embodied, situated and emotional selves.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook (2008)</xref> has made a case for seeing children and childhood as constitutive of, rather than derivative of or exceptional to, consumer culture. In my view, and specifically in relation to the consumption of clothing, children and the childhood they inhabit are both constitutive of and constituted by consumer culture; but as my theorization suggests, they must also be recognized as exceptional in some degree to the consumer culture engaged in by adults. Children, in their consumption of clothing, remain (even in late modern societies) subject to discourses of childhood which include (amongst others) ideas as to their smallness, their immaturity, their vulnerability and their status as unfinished, gendered, people-in-process. Such discursive formations of childhood both frame the creative and productive activities of children’s wear producers and the meaningful, relational, consumption practices by children (and parents) in the life world and so make what children come to wear on their bodies subject to a somewhat different set of social processes than for adults. Acknowledging the exceptional status of children as consumers does not let general consumption theories off the hook when it comes to the need to ‘encode’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453661">Cook, 2008</xref>) children, childhood and notions of relational consumption into conceptualizations of economic, consumer societies. Indeed, as my theorization of children as determinative agents in the consumption of their clothing suggests, one way forward for consumption theory is make more effective use of wider sociological theories as a route to rethinking the ways in which all individuals, and at various stages of the life course, interactively engage in consumer societies.</p>

<p>Data presented in this paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512453661">Hammersley and Atkinson, 1995</xref>) undertaken in England in 2003–4 with eight families. Each family contained at least one child between the ages of 6 to 11, whose consumption of children’s clothing was tracked over a calendar year. The families were selected to be illustrative of key social variables, including income level, gender and ethnicity, urban and rural location. Data collection methods sought to place children at the centre of the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1749975512453661">Pole et al., 1999</xref>) via deploying a range of participatory methods, including drawings, writing and photography. Along with semi-structured interviews with and diary-work by parents, the methods collectively aimed to provide insight into the role of children as consumers of clothing within the context of different kinds of families across a full year. In order to provide an insight into the interconnected nature of children’s consumption of clothing with its production, interviews were held with personnel in the children’s wear industry, including store buyers and other executive decision-makers.</p></fn>

<p>Childhood is, of course, a social construction, a way of making sense of the early phase of the life course. As such, it varies between cultures and over historical time, and is both reflected in and reproduced through multifarious discourses about children and childhood, including in terms of gender, ethnicity, social class and so on. Children are clearly marked by difference and diversity, but as occupants of ‘childhood’, their lives are nonetheless regulated and ordered by discourses of childhood that are to some extent unitary and common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453661">James and James, 2004</xref>).</p></fn>
