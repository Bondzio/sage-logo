<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>The importance of continuing medical education (CME) in updating physicians’ knowledge and improving quality of care can never be overemphasized. This vital stage of medical education continues for the remainder of a physician’s life, ensuring exposure to current, ever-expanding medical literature. Ideally, this information should be incorporated into the physician’s practice, leading to improvement in quality of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612471140">1</xref></sup> Despite some doubts about the effectiveness of CME and reports that show a lack of significant impact on physicians’ practices, a study by Davis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612471140">2</xref></sup> reported that interactive CME sessions have a significant impact on professional practice and health care outcomes.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, CME is a relatively new concept and only a few physicians attend CME programs on a regular basis, mainly because of lack of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612471140">3</xref></sup> Unsuitable scheduling and time restraints are other important reasons for the low physician attendance at CME programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612471140">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612471140">4</xref></sup> In a study by Siddiqui,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612471140">4</xref></sup> physicians agreed on the need for CME programs, with improvement in patient care being the main motivational force for attending these activities. However, in reality, very few physicians in Pakistan attend CME programs regularly.</p>
<p>There is an absence of any structured monitoring system in Pakistan to periodically assess the knowledge and clinical skills of practicing physicians; the quality of health care and, more important, health outcomes can be affected. Medical licenses are renewed by the Pakistan Medical &amp; Dental Council (PMDC) without prior evaluation of physicians’ clinical performance and knowledge. Different approaches have been adopted worldwide to persuade physicians to attend CME activities (eg, financial penalty in the United Kingdom, recertification in the United States). These could be applied in Pakistan with a little modification; the PMDC could demand certificate of attendance of CME programs when doctors apply for renewal of their medical license. Proper advertisement, prior notification, and constant reminders to physicians might increase CME attendance. CMEs should be offered at suitable times for physicians as no one would leave his/her clinical practice to attend a CME session. E-learning is a new emerging format for CME and provides a more efficient and interactive delivery system that can manage complex and layered information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612471140">5</xref></sup> One important advantage of e-learning is that doctors can use this format any time, even from their clinics or homes. To conclude, PMDC can play an effective role by formulating policies to increase CME attendance. Teaching hospitals and medical institutions should organize and promote CMEs more frequently as well as upload CMEs on their Web sites so that physicians may have convenient access to the ever-growing medical literature.</p>
