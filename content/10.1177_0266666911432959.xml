<abstract>
<p>Korea is recognized as one of the most advanced countries in terms of informatization. The development of informatization has impacted all sectors of Korean society, including agriculture, and agricultural informatization has played an important role in bridging of the digital gap between rural and urban areas. The issue of agricultural/rural informatization development has conventionally been examined under the rubric of the digital divide, which generally encompasses two seemingly distinct categories—access (first order) and inequalities in the ability to use digital technology (second order). Further, consumers' recent concerns over food safety have helped to put agricultural informatization back on the national agenda. This study discusses the challenges inherent in agricultural informatization by analyzing both the first-order and second-order effects of the digital divide at the regional level and then addresses the role of the government in narrowing the regional digital divide. The results indicate that Korea has achieved success in terms of access (first-order) but that the second-order effects of this achievement remain in an intermediate stage, particularly in terms of agricultural informatization, thereby creating new challenges for policymakers. The results offer a better understanding of the type and amount of effort required to raise the level of agricultural informatization to bridge the digital divide and provide researchers with some guidelines for examining the digital divide and determining how it influences farmers, villagers, managers, and economies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The issue of agricultural/rural informatization development has conventionally been evaluated using terms such as ‘universal services' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666911432959">Blackman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666911432959">Milne 1998</xref>), ‘the digital divide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666911432959">Compaine 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666911432959">Norris 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666911432959">Xia and Lu 2008</xref>), ‘broadband deployment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666911432959">Sawada et al. 2006</xref>), and ‘e-government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666911432959">Thompson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666911432959">Seifert and Chung 2009</xref>). These terms generally fall into two seemingly distinct categories: access (the digital divide, universal services, and broadband deployment) and applications (e-government and e-commerce) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666911432959">Xia 2010</xref>). Unequal access to digital information and communication technologies can lead to the so-called first-order digital divide and may influence the growth and development of society by empowering some people with access to information while depriving those without such access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666911432959">Gulati and Malhan 2003</xref>). Further, inequalities in the ability to use digital technology among those with access to information can result in the so-called second-order digital divide, thereby influencing the growth and development of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666911432959">Hargittai 2006</xref>). Mitigating this digital divide is likely to bring about a global community based on social interaction, commerce and learning, resulting in improved living standards and social welfare. However, a widening digital divide obviously threatens this outcome and can spark controversy over the best method for bridging the divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666911432959">Dewan and Riggins 2005</xref>). In Korea, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MIFAFF) has made ardent efforts to facilitate comprehensive informatization in agricultural and rural areas since the 1990s. Initially, they focused on three types of infrastructure development to bridge the gap between rural and urban areas: household personal computer (PC) penetration, Internet use, and broadband Internet access. As a result, broadband access in rural areas increased from 81 percent in 2002 to 100 percent in 2007. In addition, a number of u-farm projects have been launched to facilitate ‘intelligent farming’ in the future. However, the MIFAFF now faces novel challenges concerning the applicability of informatization. Accordingly, consumers in Korea and elsewhere have been encouraged to consider the concept of ‘food miles' when purchasing food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666911432959">Ballantyne 2009</xref>). Further, consumers' recent concerns over food safety have helped to put agricultural informatization back on national development agenda.</p>
<p>To address these emerging issues, the present study determines and describes the challenges associated with agricultural informatization by analyzing the first-order as well as second-order effects of the digital divide at the regional level. In addition, we examine the role of the government in narrowing the regional digital divide. We first review the current status of various initiatives undertaken by the Korean government in terms of their role in narrowing the digital divide. In terms of access to and the application of agricultural information, we analyze the extent to which farmers are competent in using, make use of, and are satisfied with agricultural information. We focus on farmers because they are those directly affected by agricultural informatization. In addition, we examine the patterns of agricultural informatization (the growth of which has been expected by experts) based on its characterization. This study is guided by the following research questions: What are the major challenges underlying the current agricultural informatization? What is the role of the government in addressing these challenges and achieving a balanced digital arrangement?</p>
<p>By addressing these research questions, this study offers a better understanding of the type and amount of effort required for raising the level of agricultural informatization to bridge the digital divide and provides some guidelines for researchers seeking to examine the digital divide and determine its effects on farmers, villagers, managers, and economies.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews agricultural/rural informatization in Korea. This is followed by a discussion of the objectives and institutional arrangement of agricultural informatization, including current issues, the information use in rural areas with users' perspectives, and a relevant road map. The following section characterizes the current status of agricultural/rural informatization in Korea. The paper concludes by offering some suggestions for striking a digital balance between rural and urban areas; discussing the study’s limitations; and providing some suggestions for future research.</p>

<title>Background: Agricultural/rural informatization in Korea</title>
<p>The MIFAFF has made ardent efforts to facilitate agricultural/rural informatization in Korea since the 1990s. Korea’s agricultural/rural informatization efforts began with the establishment of the Center for Agriculture Forestry Fisheries Information Service (AFFIS) in 1992 by the MIFAFF. The goal of the AFFIS is to develop agricultural/rural informatization for a vital rural environment and a competitive agricultural sector. Since its inception in 1992, the AFFIS, together with the Rural Development Administration (RDA), has attempted to bridge the digital divide between rural and urban areas and develop informatization protocols for food and agricultural product industries. The AFFIS has approximately 70 employees working on various agricultural/rural informatization initiatives. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666911432959">Figure 1</xref>

<sec id="section3-0266666911432959">
<title>Infrastructure development</title>
<p>The MIFAFF has focused mainly on three types of infrastructure development to bridge the gap between rural and urban areas: household PC penetration, Internet use, and broadband Internet access.</p>
<p>The MIFAFF has implemented several policies to supply PCs to rural areas at low prices or for free. For example, in 2000, the MIFAFF, together with other organizations, launched a campaign called ‘Sending PCs to Rural Areas' to provide rural households with free PCs. Many organizations and individuals responded to the campaign by donating new or used PCs.</p>
<p>The AFFIS implemented the ‘Free Internet Connection Service’ program for rural residents. As a result of these two crucial policies, many farmers received PCs for free (or at a very low price) and were able to access the Internet without charge. These notable policies were accompanied by free education programs about computer/Internet use for rural residents. These customized informatization education programs were designed and provided mainly by AFFIS and the RDA.</p>
<p>Broadband Internet access in rural areas was another major concern of the Korean government from the perspective of the digital divide. The MIFAFF and the MKE (Ministry of Knowledge Economy) asked Internet service providers to extend network access to rural areas and to absorb the increased cost.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266666911432959">
<title>Educational informatization in rural areas</title>
<p>The AFFIS and the RDA have provided a diverse range of customized education programs for informatization in rural areas since 1998. In the initial stages of this education policy, farmers were invited and assigned to a few education centers for lectures. However, in 2000, mobile education centers (on board buses) were implemented to provide farmers with on-the-spot education. This made it possible for farmers to be educated without leaving their farms for extended periods. Through this effort, informatization education programs were provided at 64 sites throughout Korea. In 2001, more than 40 informatization education sites were added. In addition, 22 universities participated in this education program, providing quick services in response to nearby farmers' requests related to IT use.</p>
<p>For computer novices, basic courses were provided, and advanced courses were offered to those who successfully completed basic and intermediate-level courses. Advanced courses included topics such as website publication, website administration, and bulletin board management, among others.</p>
<p>In addition, web-based e-learning systems were launched. These systems provided farmers with free access to all content, which not only reflected the informatization agenda but also covered diverse production and business management techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266666911432959">
<title>Information services and software development</title>
<p>Relevant information is necessary for efficient decision making in business management. In addition, farmers require relevant information in making diverse decisions regarding sowing, weeding, irrigating, using fertilizers/pesticides, and harvesting, among others. In 1993, the MIFAFF and related organizations launched Internet-based information services to facilitate farmers' agricultural decision making. The first information service was the ‘Agro-Products Price Information System,’ which was implemented by the AFFIS in 1993. Information on prices of 20 different crops was provided on a daily basis for farmers. This system enabled farmers to make decisions more efficiently and better select their harvest schedules for increased profits.</p>
<p>Information services for farmers have been extended to diverse areas, including pest management, guidelines for crop quality certificates, geographical information, precision agriculture, and rural tourism, among others. As of 2001, there were 124 information service programs, and since then, approximately 40 government organizations have been offering a wider range of services.</p>
<p>In 2006, the MIFAFF developed a new agriculture/food portal called the ‘Green Net.’ In response to farmers' complaints about too many information services, this portal integrates approximately 150 programs provided by 40 government organizations. This portal is intended not only for farmers but also for consumers, and thus, it allows them to communicate with each other through the site. Moreover, many mobile services are being launched for farmers who have no time to sit in front of a computer.</p>
<p>In addition to these information services, the Korean government developed and distributed various software programs, which were designed to facilitate farmers' decision-making processes. In 2007, the MIFAFF provided financial support to 33 ERP (enterprise resource planning) projects initiated by agricultural corporate bodies and agricultural product processing centers. The MIFAFF currently facilitates (with a budget of USD 50 million) the adoption of RFID and sensor network technologies for the management of supply chains.</p>

<title>Objectives and institutional arrangement of agricultural informatization: Current issues</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, the rural-urban gap or divide in Korea continues to be the reality, despite the country’s massive informatization efforts. On the whole, the level of rural residents' access to and application of digital services is approximately two-thirds that for urban residents. For example, as of 2006, PC penetration for rural households was 50.2 percent, whereas it was 79.6 percent for urban households. Considering regional differences widens this digital divide.</p>
<p>Further, over the past decade, consumers have expressed some concerns over safety because of mad cow disease as well as the recent radiation and dioxin crisis. According to a survey by the United Kingdom Food Standard Agency, 75 percent of consumers in UK were concerned about food safety. In addition, with increased wealth, Korean consumers have paid more attention to the quality and freshness of food. Further, although consumers in urban areas have faced steadily increasing prices of agricultural products, there has been no proportional increase in monetary benefits to farmers in Korea.</p>
<p>The Korean government has been considering various IT-based methods to address these challenges. What information technologies can mitigate consumers' concerns over food safety? How can consumers be provided with fresh food at lower prices while still guaranteeing reasonable monetary benefits to farmers? Since the 2000s, the Korean government has focused on four areas of agricultural informatization to answer these questions. In addition, inefficient logistics systems for agricultural products have been identified as a chronic problem in Korea. That is, distributors have profited at the expense of both farmers and consumers. The MIFAFF has attempted to expand its mandate to cover innovation in agricultural product logistics.</p>
<p>In this section, we review the Korean government’s informatization initiatives in agricultural/rural areas by phase by focusing on agricultural product e-commerce, the Agriculture Integrated Information eXcellent System (AgriX), ubiquitous farming, and the Food Safety and Traceability and Agricultural Road Map, in terms of their objectives, achievements, and institutional arrangements. Despite central planning, there are substantial differences between phases.</p>
<sec id="section7-0266666911432959">
<title>Agricultural product e-commerce</title>
<p>In 1999, the MIFAFF selected 106 farms producing high-quality agricultural products and helped them to construct their websites. In 2000, an additional 200 websites were developed. These websites helped the farmers to market their products. The AFFIS then developed an e-marketplace and connected these websites to the e-marketplace. In support of the efforts of MIFAFF and the AFFIS, the RDA and local governments helped farmers to create websites and developed associated e-marketplaces. As of 2001, a total of 3,000 websites were developed, and among these, more than 1,500 were connected to e-marketplaces for online marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The Korean government shouldered the cost of web hosting and mass marketing for farmers. Farmers focused only on updating product information on their websites and shipping their products.</p>
<p>Although not all farmers were successful, many derived considerable revenues from their e-business. Those farmers who engaged in agricultural product e-commerce formed a new community called the ‘Cyber Farmers Union,’ which now boasts more than 3,000 members. They hold regular meetings several times per year and share their knowledge and experience about e-commerce. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666911432959">Table 1</xref>

<title>Agriculture Integrated Information eXcellent System</title>
<p>In terms of the development of agricultural/rural informatization applications, the MIFAFF introduced the Agriculture Integrated Information eXcellent System (AgriX) as a component of e-government systems. The MIFAFF has implemented a number of initiatives through AgriX to mitigate usage inequalities. AgriX is an integrated information system for the efficient management of agricultural investments and is financed (approximately USD 1.19 billion spent through 2013) by the MIFAFF. At the moment, six projects were completed, and 130 agricultural and forestry projects were available online through a total of four stages, making AgriX the flagship program of the MIFAFF. AgriX is centered around municipal, county, and district offices covering remote rural areas as well in the rest of Korea. The principal objectives of AgriX are to make business operations more innovative, to increase the users' (farmers, public employees of municipal and district offices, and employees of the MIFAFF) satisfaction with its agricultural and forestry projects and to reduce public service employees' workload. AgriX has informatized the multilayered and complex offline management of agricultural and forestry projects into an online format, allowing farmers to submit applications for agriculture-related businesses without paperwork (G2C) and helping government officials to deal with a huge amount of work (e.g. reviewing and selecting applications, financing, and reporting) through an online system (G2B). Government employees connect to the system via an electronic authentication process (public key infrastructure) and manage all related tasks online on a real-time basis.</p>
<p>The major attributes of AgriX can be summarized as follows: (1) the automatic input of detailed applicant information via the linkage to the Government for Citizens (G4C) system (AgriX is linked to the G4C Citizen Information Database of the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs), (2) online qualification screening without the requirement for document submission (data sharing with other institutions means that agricultural land records, agricultural land ledgers, and land registers are available on a real-time basis), (3) fair financial execution through double-checking in advance (many agricultural and forestry projects are implemented simultaneously, and repeated applications are automatically checked in advance to prevent repeated benefits), and (4) the understanding of the real-time application procedure and the printing of reports (the real-time status of projects is available anytime, anywhere). Hence, the status of a project/application can be reviewed easily via the input of related information into the system directly from upper institutions. As a result, transparency is assured, and there is no need for separate reports.</p>

<title>Food safety and traceability</title>
<p>The traceability of food is an emergent issue in many countries, including Korea. Consumers everywhere want sufficient information to make informed shopping decisions about food, but they are unable to do so in most cases because of the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. The Food Traceability System provides detailed information on food production, processing, transfer and distribution, including where an animal was born, its feed, medication, sales date, and slaughter, and other information related to supply chains.</p>
<p>The RDA developed the first public food traceability system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atrace.net">http://www.atrace.net</ext-link>) in 2003. The MIFAFF implemented a traceability system for agricultural products in 2004, expecting to enhance the international competitiveness of Korea’s agricultural products by securing food safety and gaining credibility through organized management and fast responses to food safety problems in the food supply chain (by tracing both backwards and forwards). The system is expected to serve consumers' right to know by providing instant and accurate information on the production, distribution, and merchandising of agricultural products. The MIFAFF announced the guidelines for traceability in September 2004 and launched a beef traceability system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mtrace.net">http://www.mtrace.net</ext-link>) in October 2004. In addition, they amended and promulgated the ‘Agricultural Products Quality Management Law’ in August 2005. Finally, farms have been able to voluntarily adopt a traceability system since January 2006.</p>
<p>Traceability systems provide information on topics such as the name of the producer, the field location, the name of the product, the amount of the product, the fertilizer/chemical used, the equipment used, the place of transfer, the date of delivery, and the name of the seller, among others. Such information is coded using a label, a barcode, or an RFID tag. Consumers can readily access the information through a mobile phone, the Internet, or an on-site kiosk.</p>
<p>The Korean government has been focusing on a traceability system for beef because of Korean consumers' special concerns over the quality and origin of beef since mad cow disease. Since July 2009, all beef produced in Korea has been mandated by law to be registered through the traceability system. Thus, consumers can access all information on beef at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mtrace.net">http://www.mtrace.net</ext-link>. In addition, new technologies such as the RFID and USN (ubiquitous sensor network) technologies have been applied to new traceability systems in diverse areas to provide consumers with relevant and reliable information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0266666911432959">
<title>Ubiquitous farming</title>
<p>Since 2004, the Korean government has encouraged all industries to adopt the USN and RFID technologies. The logistics industry was the first mover because the RFID tag can be a substitute for the barcode. On the other hand, the USN technology is recognized as a critical technology for efficiently object monitoring and controlling, including environments and production, among others.</p>
<p>The MIFAFF elected to adopt the USN/RFID technologies for food and agricultural product industries and launched six ‘u-farm’ projects in 2007. They applied these technologies to traceability systems and barn and green monitoring, among others, investing a total of USD 6.4 million in the projects. This budget was developed and allocated by the MIFAFF, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy (MKE), and local governments' matching funds.</p>
<p>These u-farm projects have been outsourced to several consortia composed of SI (system integration), RFID, USN, middleware, and food firms as well as farmers' unions. Local governments managed each project, and the MIFAFF and the MKE provided supervision for all the projects.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666911432959">Table 2</xref>
, the MIFAFF launched 12 u-farm projects in 2009. In 2009, the MIFAFF initiated diverse plans to develop new technologies for intelligent greenhouses and stalls. In 2011, the MIFAFF strengthened the national ICT development policy and the public-private governance system and implemented a pre-assessment and coordination mechanism for the efficient implementation of ICT development projects to strengthen the relationships between planning, budgeting, and monitoring based on medium- and long-term investment strategies for rural informatization.</p>

<title>Information use in rural areas: The user’s perspectives</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss information use in rural areas from the user’s perspectives. Users' opinions have put agricultural/rural informatization on the national development agenda, mainly because of their recent concerns over food safety and radioactive contamination in agricultural products.</p>
<p>Internet use in rural areas has increased steadily since 1998, when only 0.6 percent of those working in the agricultural sector used the Internet. As of 2006, 29.4 percent were Internet users. In particular, Internet use increased sharply from 0.6 percent in 1998 to 16.2 percent in 2003, and younger generations in rural areas have made particularly active use of the Internet. As of 2007, Internet use in Korea reached 76.3 percent (101.9 percent in metropolitan areas and 71.2 percent in rural areas).</p>
<p>A total of 241,356 farmers participated in various training programs provided by the MIFAFF from 1998 to 2002. Farmers started to manage their own e-commerce sites, and recently, many have been realizing increased profits through their e-commerce sites. In 2008, the MIFAFF announced that approximately 67,000 farmers participated in information education courses.</p>
<p>The MIAFF’s ‘Agro-Products Price Information System’ has enabled farmers to make harvest decisions efficiently, helping them to maximize profits. In addition, food and agricultural product e-commerce among farmers has increased steadily because of the MIFAFF’s continued efforts. As of 2009, e-commerce transactions amounted to approximately USD 1.89 billion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666911432959">Table 1</xref> shows the increase in food and agricultural product sales through e-commerce. Further, based on a recent survey (N=30) by the RDA, farmers reported that their total sales increased by 51 percent after adopting e-commerce for agricultural products. Further, customers' visits to farms increased by 29 percent. More specially, customers come to enjoy the amenities, experience the rural life, and buy products directly. As a result, net profits increased by 48 percent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266666911432959">Table 3</xref>

<p>By adopting advanced ICT, ubiquitous farming has facilitated innovation in decision making in rural agriculture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666911432959">Park et al. (2011)</xref> analyzed the integration of the RFID and USN technologies in an ERP system implemented at Mushheart Corp., one of the largest mushroom production firms in Korea, and found that these informatization initiatives improved the quality of the firm’s decisions, shortened its decision time, and increased the number of its alternatives in terms of its decisions. Further, this integration led to a number of production innovations, including reduced labor costs, increased productivity, and improved mushroom quality.</p>
<p>Farmers' participation in agricultural and forestry projects has increased. In addition, they have made increased use of information because of AgriX’s easy and fast access, including its simple application process with minimal requirements. Further, farmers check the status of projects on a real-time basis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666911432959">Hossain et al. (2011)</xref> found that because of AgriX, users' participation in decision making and policymaking improved and that customers' visit costs decreased through AgriX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666911432959">Hossain et al. 2011</xref>). In terms of return on investment (ROI), AgriX ROI=Net Benefit/Cost = 528 percent. This was possible because both employees of local offices and farmers had appropriate e-skills, owned computers, and had access to the Internet, that is, because of the well-developed socio-technical infrastructure in rural areas. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666911432959">Table 4</xref>

<p>Further, the MIFAFF is reorganizing IT-related entities through close cooperation with various sectors (e.g., public and private sectors, inter-governmental, and infra-capacity-contents, a fundamentally unique industry in the early stages of an information society). However, the government has played a key role not only in implementing initiatives but also in funding informatization projects as a strategic tool for national advancement. Therefore, the MIFAFF has recently been working on identifying new growth engines for rural informatization, with a vision of an advanced knowledge/information society based on creativity and trust that could fulfill the objectives of efficient government: enriching citizens' lives through digital technologies, a trustworthy information society, creative soft power, and an advanced digital convergence infrastructure.</p>

<title>Characterization of the current agricultural/rural informatization</title>
<p>Clearly, the current status of agricultural/rural informatization in Korea indicates at the central level – as shown by the various agricultural/rural informatization initiatives by the Korean government and the vision and objectives of the country’s agricultural/rural informatization road map. Thus, Korea’s agricultural/rural informatization governance efforts have tended to be diversified (or decentralized).</p>
<p>Although maintaining control over the quality and quantity of products in food and agricultural product industries is exceedingly difficult, predictable and manageable outputs are desirable, as in the case of many other industries. That is, managers should be able to control the quality and quantity of their products to some extent. Predictable outputs can help managers to plan marketing, sales, and inbound/outbound ogistics, but food and agricultural product industries face difficult challenges. Various industries have adopted different levels of information system automation and use for quality/quantity control. However, the informatization of food and agricultural product industries has tended to lag behind that of other industries.</p>
<p>An analysis of infrastructure development shows that in 1997, the rate of PC penetration for rural households was just 18.7 percent. However, because of the MIFAFF’s efforts, this rate increased sharply to 50.2 percent in 2006. Although this was still lower than that for urban households (79.6 percent), there was a clear reduction in the digital gap between the two areas.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the INVIL (information network village) project, the PC penetration rate increased further to 72.1 percent in 2001, and the Internet subscription rate reached 66.5 percent. The gap in Internet use between rural and urban areas increased from 16.6 percent in 2001 to 23.7 percent in 2007. These cannot be attributed entirely to the MIFAFF’s ‘Sending PCs to Rural Areas' campaign. Instead, it owes heavily to the AFFIS’s ‘Free Internet Connection Service’ campaign for rural residents.</p>
<p>As a result of the government’s massive efforts, broadband access in rural areas increased from 81 percent in 2002 to 100 percent in 2007, which implies that all Koreans have high-speed Internet access anytime, anywhere. This indicates that the government has been successful in terms of providing access to digital information and communications technologies and demonstrates that Korea’s IT infrastructure ranks at the very top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666911432959">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666911432959">2007</xref>). However, there is some evidence of a fluctuating gap between those with access to ICT resources and those without such access because of gaps in their education, poor digital infrastructure, or the lack of advanced computer equipment.</p>
<p>Korea launched the second Master Plan to bridge the digital divide, aiming to increase the ratio of informatization for the disadvantaged to that for the general public from 53.3 percent as of 2005 to 80 percent by 2010. This ratio increased steadily since 2005, reaching 65.9 percent in 2007. Specifically, the ratio increased from 65.2 percent to 76.0 percent for the disabled, from 64.2 percent to 75.5 percent for low-income individuals, from 41.7 percent to 54.6 percent for rural residents, and from 49.3 percent to 62.6 percent for senior citizens. Nonetheless, good infrastructure and high Internet use rates alone are meaningless without pragmatic solutions and benefits.</p>
<p>In terms of educational informatization in rural areas from 1998 to 2002, a total of 241,356 farmers took various courses on IT use for farm management purposes. Such courses enabled some farmers to manage their own e-commerce sites. As a result, many farmers made huge profits from their e-commerce sites.</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural product e-commerce, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666911432959">Table 1</xref> shows that e-commerce transactions increased sharply since 2001. In addition, food and agricultural product e-commerce has increased steadily but not as sharply as e-commerce transactions. Food and agricultural product transactions increased from USD 203.6 million in 2001 to USD 1.89 billion in 2009, a 9.3 times increase.</p>
<p>Food and agricultural product industries have become more integrated than ever to reduce risks and farm-to-table processing costs. Because their operations, including production, processing, storage, distribution, and management, are dispersed throughout the world, food and agricultural industries depend more than ever on ICT. In response to this trend, the MIFAFF started to emphasize the development of competitive food and agricultural product industries and rural welfare by focusing on infrastructure construction and content development to bridge the digital divide. However, food and agricultural industries presently face several new challenges regarding food safety and traceability. In recent years, food safety has become a major news topic and is regarded as one of the most important issues. For example, Korean consumers are highly concerned about the use of cloned animals, the use of antibiotics/hormones in meat, and food safety/hygiene. In addition to the government, Korea’s food and agricultural product industries have been attempting to adopt ICT to meet the diverse needs of consumers via quality/quantity control activities.</p>
<p>Korea is known as one of the leading countries for high-speed broadband access and has one of the highest rates of Internet use in the world. However, there remains a substantial digital divide between urban and rural areas in Korea. In particular, in terms of applicability, food and agricultural product e-commerce and AgriX projects show a low level of participation by farmers and villagers. This digital divide issue is closely related to the quality of life in rural areas and is regarded as an important factor in rural-urban migration. Today, being a rural resident in Korea typically means the acceptance of extremely unfavorable conditions in terms of almost all socioeconomic aspects, including education, employment, and social inclusion. Evidently, the informatization of rural areas has profound political, economic, and sociocultural implications. Politically, the informatization of rural communities has had considerable influence on citizen participation as well as the democratization process. Economically, rural informatization can promote trade and industrialization in the agricultural sector, and socially, it can facilitate community development and value recognition.</p>
<p>These results indicate that Korea has not been completely successful in terms of addressing the inequalities in the use of digital information and communications technologies. As a result, the second-order effects of inequalities in the ability to use digital technologies among those who do have access are still remaining in an intermediate stage and emerging challenges.</p>
<sec id="section14-0266666911432959">
<title>New challenges: The next move</title>
<p>The government has recognized the disparity inherent in the use of digital information and communications technologies, particularly in agricultural/rural areas. As a result of this realization, the MIFAFF established a TV channel to inspire ICT applications among agricultural and rural communities based on IPTV and digital cable technologies. This project derives from the global megatrend toward the convergence of telecommunications and broadcasting. However, this project poses a new challenge in terms of the target audience of the TV channel. Should it be targeting only rural residents or all audiences? Without the inclusion of urban audiences, it would be very difficult to develop a profit model. The public has little appetite for another tax-wasting government program. Therefore, the MIFAFF needs to develop feasible profit models for a sustainable TV channel.</p>
<p>Farmers who derived sizeable benefits from agricultural product e-commerce are currently focusing on the importance of agricultural and rural community TV channels. They expect to derive further benefits from t-commerce based on IPTV. However, t-commerce requires each farmer to produce consistent quality-controlled products in sufficient amounts, which is not a simple problem limited to the farmers only. Thus, the government should take these diverse issues into consideration to narrow the digital divide of applicability among rural communities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MIFFAF is currently reconsidering the role of the AFFIS, which has been doing an excellent job in agricultural/rural informatization. To date, the core competence of the AFFIS has been the provision of diverse and useful information for farmers via the portal site and the provision of educational opportunities for farmers. However, because of changes in technological and business environments, farmers expect more than these types of services. Many college graduates enter the agricultural sector, but their business focus is not limited only to cultivation. They require professional consulting services, not just management or technical education. In addition, some have questioned the AFFIS’s management of the portal site for farmers, claiming that it could be outsourced at a lower cost. Thus, this raises the question of what the AFFIS’s core competence should be in the future in terms of mitigating the emergent issue of the second-order digital divide. In this regard, Korea must take a new regulatory approach that not only fits this current institutional endowment but also considers the future.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>By considering the emergent issues associated with agricultural/rural informatization, we portrayed the challenges inherent in informatization by analyzing both the first-order and second-order effects of the digital divide at the regional level and examined the role of the government in narrowing the regional digital divide. For this, we addressed the following research questions: What are the major challenges underlying the current agricultural informatization? What is the role of the government in addressing these challenges and achieving a balanced digital arrangement? By addressing these research questions, we reconciled the independent contributions of two streams of informatization research: recommendations concerning how government organizations can raise the level of agricultural informatization in bridging the digital divide and guidelines for researchers assessing the digital divide and its effects on farmers, villagers, managers, and economies.</p>
<sec id="section16-0266666911432959">
<title>Recommendations: Striking a digital balance between rural and urban areas</title>
<p>Recently, the World Bank argued that agricultural development depends to a great extent on how successfully knowledge is generated, shared, and applied and suggested that investments in knowledge creation (science and technology) should take into account rapid changes in the broader agricultural environment (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666911432959">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered a diverse collection of issues and trends pertinent to the cultural/rural informatization agenda for policymakers and researchers. On the basis of the analysis, we present the following recommendations:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>With respect to the disparity in digital applications, the Korean government requires reliable information and knowledge regarding the issue of applicability, particularly because they have achieved success in terms of accessibility. Knowledge is required for applicability and successful communication among rural communities. On its own, more information is not sufficient. That is, there is a need for equality in the application of digital technologies. In addition, a diverse range of knowledge should be obtained from the full spectrum of sources, including farmers, scientists, educators, advisors, and policymakers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>With the changing business environment, farmers and agricultural institutions are going beyond information and knowledge and seeking more and better opportunities to interact with others and question multiple views and perspectives from the periphery to the center. According to the World Bank, these broad changes have increasingly facilitated agricultural and rural development, and knowledge, information, and technology have increasingly been generated, diffused, and applied through the private sector. As a consequence, there is an urgent need for new and innovative ways to activate and communicate the evidence and insights that policymakers require for making difficult decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666911432959">Ballantyne 2009</xref>).</p>
</list-item>

<p>To enhance the applicability of ICT among farmers and rural communities, the government should first empower farming communities to define their own needs. Farmers occasionally have digital information needs beyond those related to agriculture, and hence, the government should take a holistic approach in evaluating the needs of rural communities with respect to information exchange and sharing. The government should pursue policies that promote the exponential growth of digital applications because simple linear growth is not sufficient to catch up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666911432959">Best and Wilson 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The results of this study indicate a need for a better understanding of the digital divide in rural and urban contexts. Although the Korean government has implemented a number of initiatives, much remains to be accomplished, particularly with respect to addressing the disparity in the applicability of digital technologies.<list list-type="bullet">

<p>Interactive digital programs can be used to enhance the skill and knowledge of community service providers through education. In terms of the proper methods for solving these problems, the government plays an important role in providing systematic support to help farmers and rural communities to solve the financial problems related to informatization. Hence, successful informatization at the country level requires well-prepared socio-technical infrastructure development as well as policies for the have-nots, particularly for those in rural areas, where education and e-skill training for both officials and citizens always matter. In terms of e-skills, Feroz et al. (2010) provided a similar conclusion regarding the assimilation of e-government systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666911432959">Khan et al. 2010</xref>). Further, the content and structure of curricula for farmers and rural communities have to be revised in a more systemic manner.</p>

<p>Researchers should consider the indigenous knowledge of farmers and rural communities in diverse settings by employing multiple streams of research to build a cumulative body of evidence that can advance knowledge about the digital divide and provide important practical implications with respect to its effects on farmers, villagers, managers, and economies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666911432959">Water-Bayer et al. (2006)</xref> argued that farmers and local communities are key actors in agricultural innovation systems. However, the research community typically undervalues the indigenous knowledge of farmers.</p>

<p>This study’s findings have a number of policy implications, particularly with respect to the applicability of digital information to the mitigation of the second-order digital divide. First, the results clearly imply the importance of leveraging the interaction effects of farmers and rural communities across informatization. This cross-participation of people and the government offer an effective mechanism for actively managing and narrowing the digital divide. Enhancing the applicability of informatization may not only facilitate digital application penetration but also induce diffusion effects, which in turn may further facilitate individual technology penetration. A profitable model that combines computing with access and user-friendly applications should allow rural communities to internalize the complementarities inherent in diffusion effects to accelerate the narrowing of the digital divide. That is, farmers and rural communities should take a ‘systems approach’ to the promotion of digital access and applications instead of focusing specifically on access. Thus, it may be more effective to push access bundled with applications instead of promoting digital access in isolation. Although this is more a practical issue than a theoretical one in Korea, the integration of access and applications into a single regulatory platform may serve as a test-field for academia and policymakers alike around the world.</p>
<p>In addition, for countries facing first-order disparity, this Korean case offers important insights into how the government can effectively integrate its well-targeted efforts to achieve successful digital access. The highlighted strategies can be employed by other governments to reduce the negative effects of the regional digital divide on access.</p>

<title>Limitations and suggestions for future research</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. First, we employed a descriptive case study to analyze agricultural/rural informatization. Although this design was suitable for addressing this study’s research questions, an empirical study with a cross-sectional survey or a longitudinal research design should provide additional insights into the manner in which various factors and policy initiatives change and interact over time to influence agricultural/rural informatization. Accordingly, the results of this study should be interpreted and generalized with caution. Second, we focused specifically on the digital divide (first-order as well as second-order digital divide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666911432959">Dewan and Riggins 2005</xref>). Thus, future research should consider the direct effects of digital diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666911432959">Dewan et al. 2010</xref>), informatization, culture, and communications differences in rural communities to provide a better understanding of the regional digital divide. Although these topics are beyond the scope of the present study because of data limitations, they provide productive avenues for future research.</p>
