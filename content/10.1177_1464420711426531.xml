<p>In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) approach is used to predict the wear rate of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> metal matrix composites (MMCs). The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs were fabricated using the conventional powder metallurgy route. Different ANN structures were used to develop models for prediction and optimization of the wear rates of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites under dry sliding conditions. The effects of the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates, density, and hardness of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites, as well as the applied pressure, sliding speed, and test temperature on the wear rates were evaluated using the ANN models. The results showed that the developed multilayer perceptron ANN model can be effectively used to predict the wear rates of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs. The generalized radial basis function showed lower prediction performance.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464420711426531" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Aluminium metal matrix composites (MMCs) offer several advantages when compared to unreinforced aluminium matrix such as higher mechanical properties at both ambient and elevated temperatures, lighter density, and improved wear resistances [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711426531">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420711426531">3</xref></bold>]. Aluminium MMCs could be reinforced with continuous and/or discontinuous fibres, whiskers, or particulates. The most common reinforcements used are SiC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and graphite. In order to meet a special target of engineering application, MMCs can be designed by selecting the correct composition and choosing the appropriate manufacturing process. Several methods are currently used to produce MMCs. These methods include stir casting, pressure infiltration, spray forming, and powder metallurgy (P/M) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420711426531">4</xref></bold>]. The P/M method is an effective manufacturing technique for producing high-quality MMCs which are widely used in the industry. However, it is more costly than the casting method of production.</p>
<p>The prediction of wear rate of MMCs is very difficult. This is because that large number of factors and their interactions influence wear [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420711426531">5</xref></bold>]. Such factors may be concerned with the material characteristics (i.e. chemical composition of the matrix alloy, type, volume faction, size, shape of the reinforcement, etc.) or service (e.g. counterface material, applied pressure, sliding speed, temperature, atmosphere, etc.). These large number of factors and their interactions make the prediction of the tribological behaviour of MMCs very difficult using conventional prediction techniques such as conventional curve fitting. The artificial neural network (ANN) is a promising field of research in predicting experimental trends. ANN has become increasingly popular in the last few years [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420711426531">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420711426531">10</xref></bold>]. It can often solve problems much faster compared to other approaches with the additional ability to learn from small experimental data. The principle benefit of ANN modelling compared to other conventional approaches is in its ability to learn from examples. ANNs are also able to catch hidden and strongly non-linear dependencies, even when there is a significant noise in the training set. Moreover, the ANNs can successfully handle irregular or random inputs.</p>
<p>The use of ANNs in prediction of the physical, mechanical, and tribological characteristics of MMCs was reported by many researchers. For instance, Hayajneh <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420711426531">7</xref></bold>] developed a feed-forward backpropagation ANN to predict the mass loss quantities of some Al–Cu-based composite materials reinforced with SiC. Satisfactory agreement between the experimental and ANN results was obtained using this type of neural network. Hassan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711426531">8</xref>] studied the potential of using feed-forward backpropagation ANN in prediction of density, porosity, and hardness of Al–Cu/SiC MMCs synthesized by compocasting method. The developed ANN models showed that maximum absolute relative error for predicted values does not exceed 5.99 per cent. Roberts <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420711426531">9</xref></bold>] investigated the feasibility of using ANN for modelling the damage evolution during the forging of Al–SiC particle-reinforced brake discs. The results showed that even simple static ANNs can be used to make sensible predictions of damage locations in forged products. The simple ANN was able to make reliable predictions based on the maximum strain, strain rate, minimum temperature, maximum tensile stress, and maximum hydrostatic pressure.</p>
<p>In this study, the ANN approach was used to predict the wear rates of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs fabricated using P/M route. The main aim is to develop an ANN model, which might yield reasonably accurate predictions of the wear rate of such composites over a wide range of conditions. Such model is expected to be very helpful to predict the tribological behaviour of MMCs before manufacturing and testing the real material, leading to savings in cost and time.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464420711426531"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title>
<sec id="sec3-1464420711426531"><title>2.1 Preparation of materials and composites</title>
<p>In this study, commercially pure Al powder having minimum purity 99.7 per cent was adopted as a matrix. The Al powder size ranged 5–20 µm. Submicron aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) particulates, with a size of the 0.3–1 µm, were dispersed into the Al matrix. Then, the Al matrix was reinforced with 5, 10, and 15 vol.% of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates.</p>
<p>The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites were fabricated using P/M technique as follows: A certain amount of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates and Al powder was weighed and taken in a plastic container. The combination of both Al and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powders was mechanically stirred for approximately 5 min in order to distribute the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates throughout the Al powder. Subsequently, in order to increase the powder compressibility, the mixed powders were subjected to an annealing heat treatment in a sealed furnace under argon, an inert gas. The powder annealing heat treatment involved heating of the mixture to a temperature of 480 °C, soaking for 1.5 h at this temperature, followed by cooling in the furnace at a rate of approximately 50 °C/h. Such annealing procedure softens the aluminium powder and also reduces the absorbed H<sub>2</sub>O content [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711426531">11</xref></bold>]. All annealed powder blends were poured into plastic containers. About 1 per cent by volume of lubricant oil (paraffin oil) was added to the annealed powders and then mixed again for 5 min. The green powders were put into a cylindrical die made from H13 tool steel. The die cavity has a cylindrical shape with 15 mm diameter and 55 mm length. The green powders were then compacted at about 300 MPa using hydraulic press. Green compacted composite samples having cylindrical shape of 15 mm diameter and 40 mm length were obtained. The compacted samples were subjected to sintering in a sintering furnace at 615 °C for 90 min at argon inert atmosphere. After sintering, the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature in the sintering furnace. Finally, the sintered samples were repressed in the compaction die at a pressure of 300 MPa to ensure geometric continuity between components.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464420711426531"><title>2.2 Microstructural and mechanical characteristics</title>
<p>Microstructural examinations of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs were conducted using <italic>Olympus</italic> optical metallurgical microscope. The metallographic specimens were ground and polished using standard metallographic techniques before the examination. Microstructural examinations were performed in the unetched condition. Vicker’s hardness test measurements were carried out using a load of 10 kg. A minimum of ten readings were taken for each sample and the average value was determined.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464420711426531"><title>2.3 Density measurements</title>
<p>Densities of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs were calculated using water displacement approach (Archimedean density) according to ASTM B311-08. This test method covers the determination of density for P/M materials containing less than 2 per cent porosity. The composite samples were precision weighed using an electronic balance to an accuracy of 0.1 mg. The measured density was compared to the theoretical density value obtained from the rule of mixtures.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1464420711426531"><title>2.4 Wear tests</title>
<p>Dry wear tests were carried out on a pin-on-disc wear-testing machine. The wear tests were carried out under conditions described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420711426531">Table 1</xref>. The chemical composition (wt%) of the 316 stainless-steel counterface disc was 0.08 per cent C, 1 per cent Si, 12 per cent Ni, 17 per cent Cr, 2.5 per cent Mo, and balance Fe. The hardness of the counterface disc is 184 VHN. The wear tests were conducted under dry sliding conditions. The specimens used were of a cylindrical shape having diameter 15 mm and length 20 mm. The specimen’s ends were polished with 1200 grit SiC emery paper and cleaned with acetone. The specimens were weighed before each experiment on a digital balance having accuracy 0.1 mg. The specimens were fixed on a three-jaw clutch. The load was applied to the specimen and the arm of the machine was balanced by means of a counterweight. A fixed track diameter of 100 mm and maximum sliding distance of 3 km were used. The duration of the experiment was controlled by a built-in stopwatch. After conducting each experiment, the specimen is weighed again and the weight loss was calculated. For each test condition, at least three runs were performed. The wear rates (the slopes of the sliding distance <italic>versus</italic> cumulative weight loss curves) of the investigated alloys were calculated using the data after the run-in stage. The composites worn surfaces were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

<sec id="sec7-1464420711426531"><title>3 MODELLING METHODOLOGY OF ANNs</title>
<p>In this study, two ANN models were developed using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the generalized radial basis function (GRBF) network architectures. These networks currently form the basis for the majority of practical applications.</p>
<p>The GRBF network is based on the simple intuitive idea that an arbitrary function <italic>y</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) can be approximated as the linear superposition of a set of localized basis functions <italic>φ<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>). A network diagram, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711426531">Fig. 1</xref>, can represent the structure of the GRBF network [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420711426531">12</xref></bold>]. The architecture of a GRBF network consists of three layers: input, output, and hidden. The hidden layer, situated between the input and output layers, is where the basis functions operate to intervene between the external input and the network output. For most applications, the basis functions are commonly chosen to be Gaussian. Each of these functions, <italic>G<sub>k</sub></italic>, computes a localized function of the input vector. The connecting lines between the inputs and the Gaussian functions represent (a) the elements of the vector, <bold><italic>µ</italic></bold><italic><sub>k</sub></italic>, that describes the location of the centre (in input space) and (b) the elements of the vector, <bold><italic>σ</italic></bold><italic><sub>k</sub></italic>, that describes the width or standard deviation of the Gaussian function (in input space). The lines connecting the Gaussian functions to the outputs represent the weights, <italic>w</italic>, of the neural network, which are comparable to the parameters in the case of curve fitting with simple polynomials. The outputs are then obtained as linear combinations of the values of the Gaussian functions.
<fig id="fig1-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Architecture of high dimensional input and output GRBF network</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The MLP is a network of simple neurons called perceptrons. Each perceptron computes a single output from multiple real-valued inputs by forming a linear combination according to its input weights and then possibly putting the output through some non-linear activation function. Mathematically, this can be written as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1464420711426531"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <bold><italic>ω</italic></bold> denotes the vector of weights, <bold><italic>x</italic></bold> the vector of inputs, <italic>b</italic> the bias, and <italic>φ</italic> the activation function. A typical MLP network consists of a set of source nodes forming the input layer, one or more hidden layers of computation nodes, and an output layer of nodes. The input signal propagates through the network layer-by-layer. The signal-flow graph of the MLP network with one hidden layer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711426531">Fig. 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Signal-flow graph of the MLP network</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To avoid overfitting problems, the experimental data were divided into two sets: a <italic>training</italic> dataset and a <italic>test</italic> dataset. The model is produced using only the training data. The latter is then used to check that the model correctly behaves when presented with previously unseen data. It was decided to use 80 per cent of the data in each dataset for training and the remaining 20 per cent for testing. The training process involves a search for the optimum non-linear relationship between the input and the output data and is computer intensive. Once the network is trained, estimation of the outputs for any given set of inputs is very fast.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the comparisons between output (predicted) and experimental (desired) values for the ANN model, an error evaluation was carried out using mean relative error (MRE). The MRE values were calculated using the following equation
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1464420711426531"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>T<sub>i</sub></italic> is the desired value, <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic> the predicted value, and <italic>n</italic> the number of data. The lower the MRE, the better the network performance.</p>
<p>The input or independent variables used in this study can be classified into two types, typically, material and wear test variables. The former includes the hardness (<italic>H</italic>) in VHN, the volume fraction (<italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) in vol.%, and the density (<italic>ρ</italic>) in g/cm<sup>3</sup> of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMCs and the latter includes the applied pressure (<italic>P</italic>) in MPa, the sliding speed (<italic>S</italic>) in m/s, and the test temperature (<italic>T</italic>) in degrees. The output or dependent variable is the wear rate (WR) in milligrams per metre. Based on the experimental work carried out in this work, wear rate data were collected. Development and training of the ANN models were carried out using STATISTICA neural network facilities.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec9-1464420711426531"><title>4.1 Microstructural characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711426531">Figure 3</xref> shows sample micrographs of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites fabricated in this investigation. It is clearly seen that the distribution of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates inside the Al matrix is fairly uniform. The agglomeration per cent (measured by area per cent) of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates tends to increase when the volume fraction of the particulates dispersed into the Al matrix is increased. However, the maximum agglomeration per cent of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates observed for Al/15 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites was less than 6 per cent. The average size of the Al grains in the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites was not significantly influenced by the volume fraction of particulates.

<sec id="sec10-1464420711426531"><title>4.2 Density of the composites</title>
<p>Density is the physical property that affects the characteristics of MMCs. The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites exhibited measured densities of about 97 per cent–98 per cent of the theoretical density. The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites contain 5, 10, and 15 vol.% of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates exhibited densities 2.671, 2.676, and 2.724 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The Al matrix alloy has density 2.691 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It is clear from the results that increasing the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates increases the density of the composites. The difference between the theoretical and measured values of density that represents the volume fraction of porosity was calculated. All samples remained below 2 per cent, indicating the near net shape forming capability of the processing methodology adopted in this study.</p>
<p>The increase of the density of aluminium alloys due to the addition of ceramic particulates, especially Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiC, was reported by many investigators [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711426531">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711426531">13</xref></bold>]. The results revealed that the reinforcements enhance the density of the MMCs. Moreover, the density of the composites increased with the increase in particulate volume fraction. The increase of in density can be attributed to the higher density of the reinforcement particulates.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1464420711426531"><title>4.3 Hardness of the composites</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711426531">Figure 4</xref> shows the variation of the hardness with the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates. The unreinforced Al matrix exhibited an average hardness of about 22 VHN. The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites exhibited higher hardness values when compared to the unreinforced Al matrix. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711426531">Fig. 4</xref> that the hardness of the composites increases with the increase in the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates.
<fig id="fig4-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Variation of the hardness with the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The increase of the hardness of aluminium alloys due to the addition of ceramic particulates was reported by many investigators [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711426531">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711426531">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711426531">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464420711426531">14</xref></bold>]. The hardness of the composites containing hard ceramic particulates found depends not only on the size and volume fraction of reinforcements but also on the structure of the matrix alloy, the matrix/reinforcement interface bonding, and the processing technique.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1464420711426531"><title>4.4 Wear results and SEM examinations of worn surfaces</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711426531">Figure 5</xref> shows a typical variation of the weight loss with the sliding distance of the Al-unreinforced matrix and the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites at ambient temperature. The reinforcement volume fraction has a large effect on the weight loss of the composites. Increasing the volume fraction reduces the weight losses. The weight loss of the Al sample without reinforcement rapidly increases with the increase in sliding distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711426531">Fig. 5</xref>). The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites exhibited better wear resistance than unreinforced Al matrix under dry sliding conditions. Such an improvement has been observed under all wear test conditions of pressures and sliding speeds as well as test temperatures.
<fig id="fig5-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Variation of the weight loss with the sliding distance at ambient temperature, applied pressure 0.5 MPa, and sliding speed 1 m/s</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>An example of the variation of the wear rate of the unreinforced Al matrix with the test temperature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420711426531">Fig. 6</xref>. The results showed that the wear rate of the unreinforced Al matrix is reduced up to 100 °C; thereafter, it starts to increase again at higher temperatures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1464420711426531">Figure 7</xref> shows the typical curves of the variation of the wear rates with the test temperature at several applied pressures and sliding speeds for the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. The results revealed that increasing the applied pressure, sliding velocity, and temperature increases the wear rate of the composites. The wear resistance of the composites increases with the increase in the volume fraction of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates. Both unreinforced Al matrix and the composites show mild (at low temperatures) and severe (at high temperatures) wear regimes. The transition from mild-to-severe wear depends on the applied pressure, sliding speed, test temperature, as well as the volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates. However, the test temperature has greater influence on the transition temperature than other mentioned parameters. Also, increasing the sliding speed, the applied pressure reduces the transition temperature. Moreover, the transition temperature increases with the increase in the volume fraction of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates. The composites exhibited a transition temperature between 150 °C and 200 °C whereas the unreinforced alloy exhibited a transition temperature between 100 °C and 150 °C. The decrease of the wear resistance of the composites due to the increase of the test temperature is attributed to the decrease of the strength of the composites at elevated temperatures.

<p>For the Al-unreinforced matrix, wear tests performed at temperatures below the transition temperature produced relatively smooth worn surfaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711426531">Figure 8</xref> shows a high-magnification SEM micrograph of the worn surface of Al-unreinforced matrix tested at ambient temperature. SEM examinations showed that the worn surfaces were partially covered with layers of iron oxide. The iron oxides are in the form of equiaxed particles of about 1–5 µm in size. The reduction of the wear rates of unreinforced Al matrix at lower temperatures is attributed to the formation of the iron oxide layer on the contact surfaces. The iron oxides can act as solid lubricants and are expected to reduce the wear rates with temperature, while for the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates at the contact surfaces were fractured during wear. Such particulates act as third-body abrasives and remove the iron oxide layers. Accordingly, unlike the unreinforced material, the wear rates of the composite do not reduce with temperature in the mild wear regime.
<fig id="fig8-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>(a) SEM micrograph shows the formation of the iron oxide layer on the worn surface of Al/15%Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites (a) and EDX analysis results of the particles (a)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The oxide layers (tribolayer) at the contact surfaces were formed as a result of the iron transferred from the counterface due to the high compressive stresses developed at the interfaces. The compacted tribolayer is harder than the bulk material. During sliding metal–metal wear tests of aluminium-based composites, the iron oxide layer formed on the contact surfaces acted as a solid lubricant and improved the wear resistance [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711426531">15</xref></bold>]. The formation of the tribolayers signiﬁcantly increased the surface hardness and played an important role in delaying the mild-to-severe wear transition in aluminium matrix composites. The presence of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles served as a safeguard by generating a hard compacted tribolayer with smooth surface and sufﬁcient thickness to protect the material underneath from excessive subsurface damage by forming a physical barrier of about 10–50 µm thick with the counterface [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464420711426531">16</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>At test temperatures above the transition temperature, the observations indicated that the severe wear of both Al and Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites took place by material transfer to the counterface. The thermal softening due to thermal heating increased the transfer rate of the matrix material to counterface material. The severe wear at elevated temperatures is influenced by the mechanical properties of the matrix [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420711426531">17</xref></bold>]. The presence of secondary reinforcement particulates as well as the tribolayer appears to retard the extent of the plastic deformation imposed on the wearing matrix subjected to elevated temperatures. This explains the high mild-to-severe wear transition temperature of the composites compared with the monolithic matrix. Straffelini <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420711426531">17</xref></bold>] showed that at elevated temperatures and at constant SiC particles size, the thickness of the tribolayer depends on the volume fraction of the ceramic particles. They explained that by the dynamic phenomena which are responsible for the surface damage of the composites: (a) abrasive grooving made by the hard particles in the counterface and (b) the transfer from the counterface material. In this investigation, the composites containing 15 vol.% of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates offered greater resistance to grooving and the rate of transfer of the counterface material is high, which is thus sufficient to allow the formation of a thick tribolayer, protecting the underlying material, whereas in the case of composites containing 5 vol.% of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates, abrasive grooving predominates because of its lower hardness and the rate of transfer is not sufficient to form a thick tribolayer.</p>
<p>The SEM micrographs of the worn surface of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites at 150 °C are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711426531">Fig. 9</xref>. These worn surfaces are characterized by smearing and scratches along the sliding direction. Deep grooves and ductile fragments may result in microwelding spots, which appear as ductile fragment welded to the ductile material of Al matrix alloy. It is clear from the SEM micrographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711426531">Fig. 9</xref> that the Al/15 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites showed much smoother worn surface compared to the Al/5 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. The formation of a thicker layer of oxidized iron in the wear surfaces of Al/15 per cent Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites acted as a solid lubricant and helped to produce smoother worn surfaces than in Al/5 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. The wear surface of the Al/5 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711426531">Fig. 9(a)</xref>) shows distinct parallel grooves throughout the worn surface. These grooves were formed due to the ploughing tendency of counterface steel asperities, whereas the wear surface of the Al/15 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites did not show such grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711426531">Fig. 9(b)</xref>) and large smooth areas were observed on the worn surface. However, some irregular regions of the tribolayer were observed on the worn surface of Al/15 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. It is suggested that these regions are concentrated at Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles agglomeration zones of the surface of the composites. Such zones have higher hardness than the bulk composite material. During sliding at elevated temperatures, such zones remove more material from the counterface, resulting in localized irregular regions of the tribolayer.

<p>Although several investigations were carried out to study the tribological behaviour of Al-based MMCs at room temperature [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711426531">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711426531">15</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420711426531">17</xref></bold>], only limited investigations on their behaviour at elevated temperatures were reported [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464420711426531">18</xref></bold><italic>–</italic><bold>22</bold>]. This is very surprising, especially when it is considered that elevated temperatures are often found in industrial applications. Typical examples are piston liners and cylindrical heads of automobile engines, as well as brake rotors. Singh and Alpas [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464420711426531">18</xref></bold>] studied the elevated temperatures wear behaviour of Al6061-20 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MMC. The results showed that both Al6061 alloy and the particulate-reinforced Al606l-20 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite show a mild-to-severe wear transition when the testing temperature is increased above a certain temperature. This transition occurs at higher temperatures in the composite. The same observation was noticed by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420711426531">22</xref></bold>] when the AA6061/fly-ash MMCs were investigated. The results had shown transition from mild-to-severe wear for unreinforced alloy in the temperature range 200–300 °C. With the addition of ﬂy ash to AA6061, the mild-to-severe wear transition was not noticed even up to 300 °C. In this investigation, a similar behaviour was observed. The Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites exhibited mild-to-severe wear transition temperature between 150 °C and 200 °C, while the pure Al exhibited it between 100 °C and 150 °C.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1464420711426531"><title>4.5 Modelling results</title>
<p>The wear rate data obtained from the experimental work have been preprocessed to the required format for the training procedure. After the repeated training and testing procedure, the configurations of final GRBF and MLP models for the dependence of the wear rate on the hardness, volume fraction, density, applied pressure, sliding velocity, and test temperature were obtained. It is well known that the number of training data plays a key role in determining ANN predictive quality. The more complex the non-linear relation between input and output, the larger the training dataset required. A perfect ANN prediction can be achieved so long as sufficient measuring data are available. Consequently, in this investigation, about 192 wear rates at different dry sliding wear conditions were recorded to develop the ANN models. Also, 80 per cent of these data were used for training and the remaining 20 per cent for testing.</p>
<p>The ANN modelling results revealed that the best MLP network has excellent performance whereas the best GRBF network has considerably lower performance. The comparison of the measured wear rate (experimental data) against the predicted wear rate using both ANN models is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420711426531">Fig. 10</xref>. A perfect prediction would be when all the plotted points were on the 45° line (the solid line). The accuracy of each method can be easily compared by the closeness of the data clusters to this line. It has been found that the MREs of MLP and GRBF models are 7.72 per cent and 28.34 per cent, respectively. According to the MRE values, it is possible to conclude that wear rate can be predicted by MLP model with a high degrees of accuracy.
<fig id="fig10-1464420711426531" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Measured (experimental data) <italic>versus</italic> predicted wear rates resulted from (a) MLP and (b) GRBF neural networks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711426531-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Based on comparison between the target and predicted results, the prediction error has been calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420711426531">Figure 11</xref> shows the error distribution for the prediction resulting from the MLP and GRBF neural networks. In GRBF, more than 80 per cent of the cases have average error of 50 per cent whereas for the MLP neural network more than 75 per cent of the cases have average error 5 per cent. According to the above results, it can be concluded that the MLP neural network model has better prediction capabilities of the wear rate of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites than the GRBF network model. Satisfactory agreement between the experimental and ANN results was obtained using this neural network model. Hence, it can be said that ANN can be efficiently used as a prediction technique in the area of tribology of MMCs. However, the choice of the artificial neural model should be carried out with care and enough data.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420711426531">Figure 12</xref> illustrates an example of the response surfaces developed from MLP ANN for the predicted results of wear rate for Al/5 per centAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite as a function of sliding speed and applied pressure with experimental data (represented by small black circles) at different test temperatures. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420711426531">Fig. 12</xref>, wear rate of the composites is increasing with the increase in both the sliding speed and the applied pressure. However, the dependency of the wear rate of the composites on the sliding speed and the applied pressure is much obviously seen at elevated temperatures.

<p>An example of the variation of the experimental and predicted wear rates with the volume fraction of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1464420711426531">Fig. 13</xref>. It is clearly seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1464420711426531">Fig. 13</xref> that the experimental and predicted values developed from ANNs for the wear rate are very close to each other. The results indicate that increasing the volume fraction of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particulates reduces the wear rate of the composites. It has been observed that, at temperatures up to 100 °C, the MLP ANN model overestimates the wear rate, while at higher temperatures (i.e. 150 °C and 200 °C), the model underestimates the wear rate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1464420711426531">Fig. 13</xref>. The degree of under- or overestimation was small, less than 6.2 per cent of the experimental values. The under- and overestimation exhibited by the ANN model may be explained by the large variation in experimental data used to develop the ANN models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1464420711426531">Figure 14</xref> shows the effect of hardness on the predicted wear rates of the Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites at room temperature. As expected, the wear rate of the composites decreases with the increase in the hardness of the composites. Several investigations reported that the wear resistance of the MMCs increases with the increase in volume fraction of the reinforcement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711426531">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711426531">15</xref></bold>].

The sensitivity analysis examines the effect of varying certain variables from their minimum to their maximum on the resulting network output (wear rate) than the results for other variables. The results showed that the temperature has the maximum relative sensitivity of 64.26. This means that any change in temperature level will have significant effective action on the wear rates than that resulting from changing the levels of the other variables. Similar results were obtained from the experimental measurements and analysis. The sliding speed and the applied pressure practically exhibited the same sensitivity (14.98 and 14.78, respectively), which is much lower than the sensitivity of the temperature. The volume fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> showed a sensitivity 5.98. The hardness and density exhibited the lowest sensitivity (2.45 and 2.8, respectively).

<p>The MLP ANN model developed in this study can be very useful, particularly from the perspective of MMCs design. The model can be used to predict the influence of several parameters on the wear rates of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. The developed ANN model can be used for the prediction of the wear rates of Al/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites with high accuracy only throughout the range of experimental data and it cannot be used to accurately predict extrapolated data.</p>
<p>The tribological behaviour of MMCs is difficult to predict because wear rates and friction coefficients are strongly influenced by several parameters such as the type of testing system (ball-on-disc, pin-on-disc, and block-on-ring) and the testing variables (nominal contact stress, sliding velocity, temperature, and humidity), as well as the composite manufacturing route, and the reinforcement volume fraction, size, and hardness. Accordingly, simple functions cannot account for all the prevailing mechanisms in the process of wear. This investigation showed the capability of the ANNs to predict the wear rate of the MMCs under several conditions of testing and materials parameters with high accuracy. The ANN model developed in this investigation is expected to be helpful not only for designing new materials, but also for further understanding of the modelled non-linear relations of the wear behaviour of MMCs.</p></sec></sec>
