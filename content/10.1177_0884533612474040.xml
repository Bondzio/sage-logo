<p><italic>Background</italic>: C-reactive protein (CRP) is able to bind phospholipids in the presence of calcium. We wanted to investigate the reaction of CRP with various commercial fat emulsions and to explore the impact of CRP agglutination on serum CRP levels. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Serum specimens were mixed with Intralipid 20% (soybean oil–based fat emulsion), Structolipid (structured oil–based fat emulsion), Omegaven (fish oil–based fat emulsion), or SMOFlipid (mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion) in Tris-calcium buffer (pH 7.5). After 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C, CRP-phospholipid complexes were turbidimetrically quantified and flow cytometric analysis was performed. Similarly, CRP complexes were monitored in vivo, following administration of fat emulsion. <italic>Results</italic>: CRP was able to agglutinate phospholipid-containing lipid droplets present in the soybean oil–based fat emulsion and the structured oil–based fat emulsion. To a lesser extent, agglutination was observed for fish oil–containing fat emulsions, whereas no agglutination was noticed for the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion. Results for propofol-containing emulsions were comparable. Agglutination correlated with phospholipid content of the emulsions. When in vivo agglutination occurred, plasma CRP values dropped due to consumption of CRP by phospholipid-induced agglutination. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: In this in vitro experiment, we demonstrated agglutination of CRP with phospholipids in various fat emulsions. Research studies are required in patients to determine which effects occur with various intravenous fat emulsions.</p>

<p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612474040">1</xref></sup> Following infections or tissue injury resulting from a variety of inflammatory diseases, trauma, or burns, human serum CRP concentrations rise rapidly and markedly and may attain levels more than 1000 times a healthy individual’s concentration. The magnitude of the serum CRP response reflects the extent of tissue injury and may predict the course of ensuing illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612474040">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612474040">3</xref></sup> Recently, an association between minor CRP elevation (after excluding active inflammatory conditions) and future major cardiovascular events has been recognized, leading to the recommendation that patients at risk of coronary heart disease might benefit from measurement of high-sensitivity CRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612474040">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612474040">5</xref></sup> As CRP responses occur more frequently in bacterial than in viral infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612474040">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612474040">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612474040"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612474040">8</xref></sup> and values drop rapidly after recovery or treatment, measuring and charting serum CRP level can aid in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>Plasma-derived fat embolism can be caused by agglutination of endogenous fat or exogenous fat emulsion, with consequent embolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612474040">9</xref></sup> This therapeutic complication has been termed <italic>fat overloading syndrome</italic> but bears a clinical similarity to posttraumatic fat embolism. Following trauma, fat embolism is caused by bone marrow components, in the form of cell debris and yellow bone marrow, entering into the systemic circulation and into the parenchyma of the lungs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612474040">10</xref></sup> Calcium-mediated CRP binding to immobilized phosphatidylcholine has been used for assaying CRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612474040">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612474040">12</xref></sup> A previous study has demonstrated the potential use of soya oil emulsions as a functional CRP reagent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612474040">13</xref></sup> Both in vitro and in vivo, CRP has been reported to produce agglutination (“creaming”) of the intravenously administered fat emulsion Intralipid (Fresenius Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612474040">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612474040">15</xref></sup> CRP also produced similar agglutination of isolated normal very low-density lipoproteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612474040">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612474040">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, new types of fat emulsion for intravenous (IV) administration based on soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil have entered the market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612474040">18</xref></sup> These emulsions are characterized by a well-balanced fatty acid pattern, an optimal ω-6/ω-3 fatty acid ratio, and an enhanced vitamin E content. However, the chemical composition shows marked differences. In particular, the chemical nature of the oils used shows a broad variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612474040">Table 1</xref>). As no information was available in the literature regarding the agglutination between CRP and phosphatidylcholine-containing fat emulsions other than Intralipid, we wanted to explore in detail the agglutination reactions between these emulsions and CRP in vitro. Concomitantly, the in vivo formation of CRP-lipid complexes was studied. As circulating CRP might be consumed by administrating phosphatidylcholine fat emulsions, we were also interested in the effect of the administration of these emulsions on serum CRP concentrations.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0884533612474040" position="float">

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Flow cytometric analysis revealed that a calcium-dependent agglutination of the soybean oil–based fat emulsion droplets occurs due to the presence of CRP. The size of the formed complexes increases and the size of the agglutinates largely exceeds the incident wavelength. Following complexation, Rayleigh scattering loses importance and Mie scattering predominates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612474040">22</xref></sup> resulting in a marked increase in the turbidimetric signal. Due to the multimeric structure of CRP, each molecule of this protein possesses multiple binding sites for phosphatidylcholine. The natural lipid droplets, present in the fat emulsions, act as scaffolds for the multivalent display of phosphatidylcholine molecules. The concomitant presence of CRP and lipid droplets allows turbidimetric analysis.</p>
<p>Marked differences were noticed between the various fat emulsions: the soybean oil–based fat emulsion and the structured oil–based fat emulsion showed a strong agglutination, whereas agglutination was weaker for the fish oil–containing fat emulsion and virtually absent in the presence of the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion. The difference in complex formation was confirmed using flow cytometry and light microscopy. The chemical composition of the studied fat emulsions shows a broad variety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612474040">Table 1</xref>): the phospholipid concentration was much lower for the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion, which explains the lesser degree of agglutination. Furthermore, the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion was the only emulsion to contain medium-chain fatty acids. Olive oil (an important constituent of the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion) is characterized by a very low phospholipid content (approximately 21–124 mg/kg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612474040">23</xref></sup> Fish oil contains approximately 1.4 g/kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612474040">24</xref></sup> Soybean oil (the only oil present in the soybean oil–based fat emulsion and a major compound in the structured oil–based fat emulsion) is characterized by a high phospholipid content (total phospholipid content: 11.2 ± 12.6 g/kg, of which ±27% is phosphatidylcholine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612474040">25</xref></sup> The differences in chemical and physical properties of the fat emulsions might explain the observed differences.</p>
<p>Also in vivo, the presence of CRP-lipid agglutinates could be observed in plasma following fat emulsion administration. Flow cytometry confirmed that the soybean oil–based fat emulsion and the structured oil–based fat emulsion gave rise to a pronounced in vivo agglutination in the patients’ plasma. Fish oil–containing fat emulsions gave rise to a weaker reaction, whereas the mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion did not induce major changes. Physiological ionized calcium concentration values (1.17–1.29 mmol/L) are sufficient for allowing the in vivo binding of CRP to phosphatidylcholine and cause an agglutination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612474040">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following soybean oil infusion, plasma concentrations of CRP and complement factors dropped. CRP is consumed by the agglutination reaction and shows an apparent decrease in plasma concentration. This could lead to a false interpretation of improving inflammation. On the other hand, human CRP bound to its macromolecular ligands potently activates the classical complement pathway via C1q. Bound human CRP also binds factor H and may thereby regulate complement activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612474040">27</xref></sup> These effects might explain the observed reduction in plasma complement factors. Turbidimetric monitoring of the reaction kinetics confirmed the presence of a calcium-dependent agglutination between CRP and the phosphatidylcholine-containing droplets: a first-order reaction was observed that was completed in about 45 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612474040">13</xref></sup> In vivo, similar findings could be observed: the presence of CRP-lipid agglutinates in plasma could be observed ±1 hour following the start of the fat emulsion treatment. The kinetics of the observed reaction between fat emulsions and CRP is much faster than the occurrence of the clinical symptoms in fat embolism syndrome, a cascade of events that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612474040">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observations may have important consequences for clinical practice: the observed CRP agglutination in vitro and in vivo may reflect the probability for in vivo CRP-induced fat embolism. The serum of more than half a group of acutely ill patients agglutinated the soybean oil–based fat emulsion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612474040">9</xref></sup> This reaction is precipitated by CRP. Postmortem examinations of patients who had received the soybean oil–based fat emulsion showed evidence of microembolism, which could have been caused by agglutination of the soybean oil–based fat emulsion. If this is the case, then soybean oil–based emulsions (eg, Intralipid or Diprivan, formulated as an emulsion of 1% propofol, 10% soybean oil, and 1.2% purified egg phospholipid) perhaps should not be given to acutely ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612474040">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612474040">19</xref></sup> Apart from the recommendation to improve the physical stability of parenteral nutrition (PN) admixtures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612474040">29</xref></sup> a reduction of the phosphatidylcholine content of emulsions for IV use may contribute to risk prevention of fat embolism. Therefore, flow cytometric monitoring of the CRP-lipid droplets might be useful for early diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome. Future experiments should evaluate the exact size distribution of the large CRP-phospholipid agglutinates to determine if the resultant product exceeds the limits shown in USP 729.</p>
<p>The mixed soybean oil–, olive oil–, and fish oil–based emulsion formulation, which has a much lower ability to form agglutination networks with CRP, has an advantage toward the classical soybean oil–based fat emulsion formulation in patients with a pronounced increase in CRP values. Furthermore, administration of phosphatidylcholine-containing fat emulsions induces marked changes in serum or plasma CRP concentrations. Consumption of CRP by formation of CRP-lipid complexes may have important diagnostic consequences for monitoring acutely ill patients. As CRP is an important marker for inflammation, the temporary lowering of the CRP values due to phospholipid agglutination underestimates the true degree of inflammation. A lowering of serum CRP values in an acutely ill patient may be caused by a reduction in the degree of inflammation or by the consumption of CRP by administering phosphocholine-rich fat emulsions. The underestimation of CRP due to administration of certain fat emulsions may even lead to wrong medical decision making (eg, in the field of monitoring of antibiotic treatment). CRP is characterized by a plasma half-life of 5–7 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612474040">3</xref></sup> This implies that it may take ±24 hours before a steady-state situation between CRP production and plasma CRP levels can be reached again. A recent study showed that early initiation of PN in critically ill adults was inferior to the strategy of withholding PN until day 8. The authors also found that median peak CRP values were significantly higher in the late-initiation group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612474040">30</xref></sup> which led to the conclusion that early PN was associated with less inflammation. However, we hypothesize that this can be explained by agglutination of infused phospholipids with CRP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the reaction between CRP and fat emulsions strongly depends on the kind of oil used. Olive oil–based emulsions are much less reactive toward CRP than soybean oil– or fish oil–based emulsions. Although more studies will be needed to confirm our findings in vivo, we suggest that in studies on fat emulsion administration, lowering plasma CRP may be partly due to CRP-phospholipid complexation, which is a caveat in monitoring ICU infection/inflammation and is associated with fat embolism risk.</p>
