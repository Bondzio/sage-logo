<abstract>
<p>In this article, associations between individual, social, and environmental factors and physical activity among 3,669 women (18-45 years) living in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban and rural areas were compared. In 2007-2008, participants reported levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and transport-related physical activity (TRPA) as well as five individual, four social, and three environmental factors. Physical activity self- efficacy demonstrated stronger associations with LTPA among urban relative to rural women; child care was associated with LTPA and intentions with TRPA among urban women only, and enjoyment was associated with TRPA among rural women only. Correlates of physical activity among urban and rural women were generally similar, although some tailoring of physical activity promotion strategies may be warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical activity is a modifiable behavior that plays an important role in the prevention of a number of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, mental health problems, and some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510393275">Haskell et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the substantial physical and mental health benefits, a significant proportion of the adult population in Western countries do not participate in physical activity at recommended levels; that is, they do not perform at least 30 min per day of moderate intensity activity on most days of the week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510393275">Bauman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510393275">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007</xref>). Of additional concern is that physical activity participation is sociodemographically distributed, with some population groups performing less activity than others. For instance, women are less active during their leisure time than are men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510393275">Trost, Owen, Bauman, Sallis, &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>), and those experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage are less active than those who are less disadvantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510393275">Gidlow, Johnston, Crone, Ellis, &amp; James, 2006</xref>). Women experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage therefore represent a population group at high risk for physical inactivity.</p>
<p>Another population group that may be at high risk for physical inactivity consists of those living in rural areas. People living in rural areas generally have poorer health than those living in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510393275">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510393275">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). It could be hypothesized that a proportion of these health differentials are attributable to lower levels of physical activity, but little descriptive epidemiology of physical activity in rural populations exists. While the limited evidence base is not entirely consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510393275">Brown, Young, &amp; Byles, 1999</xref>), a small number of studies have found urban adult populations to be more active than rural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393275">Badland &amp; Schofield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510393275">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998</xref>). Given these differences in physical activity according to geographic location, it is plausible that the correlates of physical activity may also differ according to urban–rural residence.</p>
<p>Understanding the correlates of physical activity among high-risk populations, such as socioeconomically disadvantaged rural-dwelling women, is important for the effective tailoring of strategies to promote physical activity. Social ecological models provide a useful framework for understanding behaviors such as physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510393275">Sallis &amp; Owen, 2002</xref>). These models posit that individual (e.g., self-efficacy, intentions, enjoyment, behavioral skills, and outcome expectancies), social (e.g., social support from family and friends, accessible child care, and dog ownership), and environmental factors (e.g., aesthetics, personal safety, and presence of footpaths) interact to influence behavior.</p>
<p>We have previously identified that factors from all three domains, but particularly individual and social factors, appear to be important correlates of physical activity among disadvantaged women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, Salmon, Timperio, &amp; Crawford, 2008</xref>); however, rural–urban variations were not examined in those studies and warrant detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Previous studies that have applied the social ecological framework to investigate correlates of physical activity among urban and rural populations have identified a range of factors that may have differential importance across geographic location. For example, one North American study found that although some correlates (social support, age, and the number of barriers to physical activity) were similar across geographic locations, higher education levels, more enjoyable scenery, and more frequently seeing others exercising were positively associated with physical activity among rural but not urban women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox, Castro, King, Housemann, &amp; Brownson, 2000</xref>). Exercising on neighborhood streets has demonstrated positive associations with physical activity among rural but not urban or suburban low-income residents, whereas having friends to exercise with, walking trails, and parks have shown positive associations with physical activity among urban and suburban but not rural residents in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510393275">Parks, Housemann, &amp; Brownson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While the studies described have examined correlates of physical activity among rural residents, this work has focused on older age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox et al., 2000</xref>), has not included an urban comparison group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510393275">Eyler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510393275">Osuji, Lovegreen, Elliott, &amp; Brownson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510393275">Sanderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox et al., 2000</xref>), has not conducted formal statistical tests to examine differences across urban/rural location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510393275">Parks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox et al., 2000</xref>), and has not stratified results by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510393275">Parks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510393275">Plotnikoff, Mayhew, Birkett, Loucaides, &amp; Fodor, 2004</xref>). This latter point is important, given that influences on physical activity differ for men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510393275">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, most studies have examined correlates of leisure or total physical activity, with few studies including other domains of physical activity such as transport-related physical activity (TRPA). Little is known about rural women’s physical activity, about the correlates of rural women’s physical activity, and about whether these correlates are different from those of urban women. This is particularly the case for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Given these gaps in the literature, this study builds directly on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393275">2010</xref>) and aims to (a) describe and compare the distribution of two domains of physical activity (leisure and transport) among urban and rural women, (b) describe and compare the distribution of potential correlates of physical activity among urban and rural women, and (c) determine whether associations between potential self-reported physical activity correlates (individual, social, and environmental) and physical activity differ between urban and rural women.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>During 2007-2008, data for this study were collected as part of the Resilience for Eating and Activity Despite Inequality (READI) Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510393275">Cleland, Hume, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510393275">MacFarlane, Abbott, Crawford, &amp; Ball, 2009</xref>). The Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
<sec id="section3-0013916510393275">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All areas of Victoria were classified using an area-level indicator of disadvantage known as the socioeconomic index for areas (SEIFA). This indicator is based on the population census and considers a range of factors including area-level employment, education, and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510393275">McLennan, 1998</xref>). Those areas within the bottom SEIFA third for Victoria were classified as “disadvantaged” and from these 40 urban and 40 rural areas were randomly selected. The definitions of urban and rural are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510393275">Cleland, Hume, et al., 2010</xref>), but in brief, urban areas included metropolitan Melbourne, rural cities (defined by the Regional Infrastructure Development Act 1999 [Vic]) and all suburbs completely within a 10 km radius of the centroid of these cities, and all suburbs completely within a 10 km radius of the centroid of other Victorian cities with a population of ≥20,000. Rural areas were those falling outside of metropolitan Melbourne and outside of a 25 km radius of the rural cities.</p>
<p>Using the Australian electoral roll (on which registration is compulsory from age 18 years for Australian citizens), 150 women aged 18 to 45 years within these urban and rural areas were randomly identified (<italic>n</italic> = 11,940; some areas had &lt;150 eligible women). Each of these women were mailed a package containing a letter of invitation, a consent form, the questionnaire, and a AUS$1 “scratch and win” token (as encouragement to participate). A total of 4,938 women completed a postal questionnaire (45% response rate after excluding from the denominator 861 women whose surveys were returned marked “return to sender”). Excluded from the study were those who moved from the sampled area prior to completing the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 571), those who were not the intended participant but completed the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 3), those who withdrew their data after completing the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 2), or those who were &lt;17 or &gt;46 years old (<italic>n</italic> = 13). Of the remaining 4,349 eligible participants, those who were pregnant (<italic>n</italic> = 210), had missing pregnancy data (<italic>n</italic> = 40) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) or TRPA data (<italic>n</italic> = 263), or had more than one missing demographic or potential correlate variable (<italic>n</italic> = 167) were excluded from the analyses, leaving 3,669 participants for the analyses.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0013916510393275">
<title>Physical Activity</title>
<p>Physical activity was self-reported using the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510393275">Craig et al., 2003</xref>). This reliable and valid instrument collects information on the duration, frequency, and intensity of past week physical activity within leisure, transportation, occupational, and domestic domains of physical activity. Leisure activity is discretionary and transport activity is being promoted as a way to accumulate more physical activity; these two domains may be more amenable to intervention than occupational and domestic activity and so were the focus of this study. Hours per week of leisure activity and transport activity were calculated, and each of these physical activity variables were categorized because of substantial skewness and the large number of “zero” responses. Data for each physical activity variable was categorized as none (0), with the remaining nonzero data categorized by tertiles and classified as low (1), medium (2), or high (3). This approach was selected because domain-specific physical activity recommendations do not currently exist. For LTPA, the low-, medium-, and high-activity categories represented from 1 to 119 min/week, 120 to 279 min/week, and ≥280 min/week, respectively. For TRPA, the low-, medium-, and high-activity categories represented 1 to 89 min/week, 90 to 209 min/week, and ≥210 min/week, respectively.</p>

<title>Potential Correlates</title>
<p>The self-reported individual, social, and physical environmental factors examined in this study have been described in detail elsewhere and all displayed at least acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s α ≥ .7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2010</xref>). They are described here briefly.</p>
<sec id="section7-0013916510393275">
<title>Demographic factors</title>
<p>Participants self-reported a range of demographic characteristics, including age; height and weight, which was used to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>); marital status (categorized as married/living as married, previously married, or not married); highest level of education (categorized as low = less than Year 12; mid = Year 12, certificate/trade/diploma; high = tertiary); current employment status (categorized as full-time work, part-time work, or not employed); number of hours worked in the last week (0, 1-15, 16-24, 25-34, 35-40, and ≥40); night shift work (never, sometimes, or often/always do night shift); weekend shift worker (never, sometimes, or often/always do weekend shift); number of children &lt;18 years in the household (none, 1, 2, and 3+); age group of any children (≥1 child &lt;2 years, ≥1 child 2-4 years, ≥1 child 5-12 years, and ≥1 child 13-18 years); and country of birth (Australia or outside Australia).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013916510393275">
<title>Individual factors</title>
<p>Participants rated their confidence in being physically active in five difficult circumstances (self-efficacy) on a 5-point Likert-type scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510393275">Marcus, Selby, Niaura, &amp; Rossi, 1992</xref>) and responses were summed (Cronbach’s α = .82). Responses to six items on a 7-point Likert-type scale about enjoyment of physical activity were summed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510393275">Kendzierski &amp; DeCarlo, 1991</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .95), and responses to six reasons for doing physical activity (outcome expectancies) on a 4-point scale were summed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510393275">Lechner, Bolman, &amp; Van Dijke, 2006</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .79). Intentions to be active were reported using a 7-point Likert-type scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510393275">Giles-Corti &amp; Donovan, 2003</xref>) and the sum of two questions about the past week frequency of goal setting and planning for physical activity were used to assess participants’ basic behavioral skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510393275">Giles-Corti &amp; Donovan, 2003</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013916510393275">
<title>Social factors</title>
<p>Participants reported access to child care if they wanted to be active (not applicable, yes, no) and dog ownership (yes, no). Participants were asked how often in the past year family members engaged in physical activity with them or encouraged them to be physically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510393275">Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, &amp; Nader, 1987</xref>); responses to the two questions were summed (family social support; Cronbach’s α = .76). The same questions were asked in reference to friends/work colleagues (friend social support; Cronbach’s α = .69).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0013916510393275">
<title>Perceived environmental factors</title>
<p>An existing measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510393275">Mujahid, Diez Roux, Morenoff, &amp; Raghunathan, 2007</xref>) was adapted to assess perceptions of personal safety, neighborhood aesthetics, and the neighborhood “walking environment.” Participants rated their agreement with statements about their neighborhood on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) and responses were summed. Personal safety was assessed by responses to the following statements: “I feel safe walking in my neighborhood, day or night,” “Violence is not a problem in my neighborhood,” “My neighborhood is safe from crime” (Cronbach’s α = .85). Neighborhood aesthetics were assessed by responses to the following statements: “There is a lot of rubbish on the street in my neighborhood,” “There is a lot of noise in my neighborhood,” “In my neighborhood the buildings and homes are well-maintained,” “The buildings and homes in my neighborhood are interesting,” “My neighborhood is attractive” (Cronbach’s α = .76). The neighborhood “walking environment” was assessed by responses to the following statements: “My neighborhood offers many opportunities to be physically active,” “Local sports clubs and other facilities in my neighborhood offer many opportunities to get exercise,” “It is pleasant to walk in my neighborhood,” “The trees in my neighborhood provide enough shade,” “In my neighborhood it is easy to walk places,” “I often see other people walking in my neighborhood,” “I often see other people exercising (e.g., jogging, bicycling, and playing sports) in my neighborhood” (Cronbach’s α = .80).</p>

<sec id="section11-0013916510393275">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Chi-square tests were used to test for differences in demographic characteristics, categories of each domain of physical activity, and categorical individual, social, and environmental characteristics according to geographic location (urban or rural). One-way ANOVA (for equal variances) or the Kruskal–Wallis equality-of-populations rank test (for unequal variances) was used to test for urban–rural differences in continuous demographic, individual, social, and environmental characteristics, and in physical activity.</p>
<p>To assess for confounding, the association between each demographic factor and the dependent variable (LTPA or TRPA) and the independent variables (each of the 12 individual, social, and environmental factors) was examined. Demographic factors associated with the dependent and independent variables were considered potential confounders.</p>
<p>Multinomial logistic regression was inappropriate because of the ordinal nature of the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510393275">Stata, 2009</xref>), and because the proportional odds/parallel regression assumption was violated for a number of variables (determined from the Brant test of the parallel regression assumption), ordinal logistic regression was also deemed inappropriate. Generalized ordered logistic regression was therefore employed by using the “gologit2” command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510393275">Williams, 2006</xref>) in Stata Version 10.2 (Statacorp, College Station, Texas) to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) separately for urban and rural women. In generalized ordered logistic regression, the actual values of the dependent variable are irrelevant except that it is assumed that larger values correspond to “higher” outcomes. The results of these analyses indicate the odds of participating in increasing levels of physical activity associated with a one-unit increase in the independent variable (e.g., a one-unit increase in self-efficacy). To examine the “main effects,” partially adjusted models examined the association between each individual, social, and environmental factor and each physical activity outcome separately, adjusting for confounding demographic factors and stratified by urban/rural location. All individual, social, and environmental factors were then entered simultaneously into a fully adjusted model (adjusted for confounding demographic factors as described above and all other independent variables) to determine the relative contribution of each factor to physical activity.</p>
<p>Where significant associations were identified between an independent and dependent variable, the equality of the regression coefficients for urban and rural women was tested using the formula described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510393275">Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, and Piquero (1998)</xref>:</p>

<p>This test is appropriate when aiming to determine whether an empirical relationship estimated within two independent samples is equivalent. For example, this test identifies whether a statistically significant difference exists between the regression coefficient estimated for a relationship between an independent variable (e.g., self-efficacy) and a dependent variable (e.g., LTPA) in one group (e.g., urban women) and the regression coefficient estimated for a relationship between the same independent variable and the same dependent variable in another group (e.g., rural women). <italic>p</italic> values of &lt;.05 were deemed statistically significant, but <italic>p</italic> values &lt;.10 were also considered of potential importance.</p>

<p>Compared with urban women, a greater proportion of rural women were married, had low levels of education, had partners with low levels of education, were in part-time employment, had partners in full-time employment, did no paid work, more frequently did weekend shift work, had two or more children, had children aged 5 years or older, or were born in Australia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510393275">Table 1</xref>). Rural women were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) older (35.4 vs. 33.4 years), had significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) higher BMI values (26.5 vs. 25.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and reported significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .04) more LTPA (<italic>M</italic> = 3.5 hr/week, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.6 hr/week) than urban women (<italic>M</italic> = 3.3 hr/week, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.4 hr/week). In contrast, urban women reported significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .02) more TRPA (3.1 hr/week, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.7 hr/week) than rural women (2.9 hr/week, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.5 hr/week).</p>

<p>Compared to urban women, rural women reported significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) higher physical activity self-efficacy (score of 14.1 vs. 13.3), physical activity enjoyment (31.9 vs. 30.9), intentions to be active (5.2 vs. 5.0), family support (6.1 vs. 5.7), personal safety (3.6 vs. 2.8), more favorable neighborhood aesthetics (3.9 vs. 3.5), a more favorable walking environment (3.8 vs. 3.5), available child care where applicable (80.1 vs. 73.6%), and dog ownership (64.1 vs. 44.2%). No significant rural–urban differences were observed for outcome expectancies (18.8 vs. 18.7), behavioral skills (4.5 vs. 4.5), or friend support (4.5 vs. 4.4).</p>
<p>In the partially adjusted (“main effects”) models, similar patterns of association of LTPA with most individual, social, and environmental factors were observed for urban and rural women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510393275">Table 2</xref>). For instance, a one-unit increase in self-efficacy was associated with 25%, 24%, and 23% higher odds of ≥1min/week (vs. &lt;1 min/week), ≥120 min/week (vs. &lt;120 min/week), and ≥280 min/week (vs. &lt;280 min/week) LTPA, respectively, among urban women, and with 19%, 21%, and 18% higher odds, respectively, among rural women. Dog ownership and personal safety appeared to demonstrate associations with some levels of LTPA among urban but not rural women. Similar patterns of association were also observed between TRPA and most individual, social, and environmental factors for urban and rural women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510393275">Table 3</xref>). For example, a one-unit increase in intentions to be active was associated with 18%, 18%, and 22% higher odds of ≥1 min/week (vs. &lt;1 min/week), ≥90 min/week (vs. &lt;90 min/week), and ≥210 min/week (vs. &lt;210 min/week) TRPA, respectively, among urban women, and with 13%, 15%, and 16% higher odds, respectively, among rural women. Personal safety was associated with TRPA among urban women only.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that, on the whole, the associations between individual, social, and perceived environmental factors and LTPA and TRPA did not differ substantially according to urban/rural area of residence. These results were evident despite differences in the distribution of women’s physical activity, which suggested that urban women reported more TRPA whereas rural women reported being more active in their leisure time. Differences in the distribution of the individual, social, and environmental characteristics assessed were also evident, with rural women generally reporting more favorable characteristics hypothesized to influence physical activity. This is one of the few studies in the international literature to explore correlates of physical activity among rural women and whether these differ to those observed among urban women. The results have important implications for the development of physical activity interventions designed for women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, suggesting that these may not require substantial tailoring according to geographic location.</p>
<p>This is one of only a few studies to describe and compare the distribution of two specific domains of physical activity, LTPA and TRPA. Rural women were found to be more active during their leisure time, but urban women reported more TRPA. The former finding is in contrast to previous research in the United States, which has found rural women to be more likely to be classified as sedentary during their leisure time than urban women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393275">Brownson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox et al., 2000</xref>). These disparities may be due to sociocultural differences such as different values placed on and beliefs around physical activity, physical environmental differences such as differences in terrain and climate, or differences in the measures of LTPA used. The results in relation to active commuting are novel as no previous research has compared this type of activity across area of residence. Plausibly, TRPA is more feasible for urban women because their physical environments are more supportive of transport activity, for example, there may be shorter distances to destinations, a greater variety of destinations, or better neighborhood “walkability” (e.g., availability of footpaths and bicycle lanes), all of which are factors that have been associated with active transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510393275">Ball et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510393275">Cleland, Timperio, &amp; Crawford, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, neighborhood aesthetics and safety were not associated with TRPA in the current study, and a positive association was seen among urban and rural women for perceived walking environment.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity of LTPA and TRPA correlates between urban and rural women, a small number of differences were observed that may warrant further investigation. Self-efficacy, enjoyment, intentions, and child care have all been found to correlate with physical activity in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510393275">McIntyre &amp; Rhodes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510393275">Trost et al., 2002</xref>), so it is of interest that differential associations by place of residence were observed in the current study. The association between self-efficacy and LTPA was stronger in urban women than in rural women, but the reasons for these differences are unknown. Rural women in this study had higher levels of self-efficacy to be active, and potentially these high levels generally may not have discriminated between those women who were more or less active. Alternatively, the weaker correlation of self-efficacy with physical activity among rural women may suggest that self-efficacy does not always translate into higher levels of activity for these women, potentially due to the greater influence of other unmeasured factors. The availability of child care was important for LTPA only among urban women, which may reflect the greater availability of child care reported by rural women, the older age of rural women, the higher number of children among rural women, or the older age of rural women’s children who may be less likely to require formal child care. However, each of these factors was adjusted for in the analyses, suggesting that for urban women with children, child care availability is an important facilitator of participation in physical activity.</p>
<p>Among rural but not urban women, enjoyment of activity was associated with achieving higher levels (≥210 min/week) of TRPA. These results suggest that identifying enjoyable activities may play a role in the promotion of TRPA among rural women. The reasons why enjoyment of TRPA were important among rural women are unclear, but it could be hypothesized that rural women need to make more of a concerted effort to participate in active travel behaviors, and therefore rural women who enjoy physical activity generally may be more inclined to make this effort. In contrast, active travel for urban women may be done through necessity or convenience, rather than because of an enjoyment of physical activity generally, which could explain the lack of association among these women.</p>
<p>Intentions to be active were differentially associated with TRPA, with an association identified in urban but not rural women. This result may be related to the comparative ease with which TRPA may be performed in urban compared with rural areas. Active commuting may be more difficult for rural women, given the greater geographical distances to destinations that may represent a barrier that overrides any positive intentions to be active. Comparisons with other studies are difficult because few that have examined urban/rural differences have included assessment of intentions as an explanatory variable, despite it being identified as a consistent positive correlate of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510393275">Trost et al., 2002</xref>) and an essential construct in the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510393275">Ajzen, 1985</xref>). As with the results for self-efficacy and LTPA, it may be that despite greater intentions to be active among rural women, this may not translate into higher levels of activity due to the other barriers that may exert a greater influence on actual participation.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous research, most of the perceived physical environmental factors assessed were not associated with leisure or TRPA in either urban or rural women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510393275">Wilcox and colleagues (2000)</xref> found that more enjoyable scenery (i.e., aesthetics) were associated with leisure activity, but only among rural women, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510393275">Parks and colleagues (2003)</xref> found walking trails and parks to be positively associated with physical activity among urban and suburban but not rural residents. These differences across studies are likely due to the measures of physical activity and the physical environment. For example, the latter study assessed leisure and occupational physical activity, and it could be argued that features of the physical environment (e.g., parks and walking trails) are unlikely to influence occupational physical activity that occurs in the workplace—that is, measures of physical activity should be settings based and context specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510393275">Giles-Corti, Timperio, Bull, &amp; Pikora, 2005</xref>). Reasons why the physical environment was generally not related to physical activity in the current study are unclear but are consistent with two previous studies of women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510393275">Cleland, Ball, et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393275">2010</xref>), both of which found that individual and social but not physical environmental factors were related to physical activity. However, each of these studies (including the current study) used a limited number of self-reported measures of the physical environment, and evidence on the relationship between self-reported and objective measures of the physical environment is mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510393275">Ball et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510393275">Leslie et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, there may be different amounts of variability in rural compared with urban areas in different countries.</p>
<p>There are some limitations of this study that should be considered when interpreting the results. The cross-sectional study design precludes conclusions about the temporal and causal nature of associations. Although the response rate may have resulted in some selection bias, that 45% of potential participants responded could be seen as encouraging given the typically lower response rates observed among populations of low socioeconomic position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510393275">Madigan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510393275">Sheikh &amp; Mattingly, 1981</xref>).The measurement error inherent in self-reported physical activity questionnaires may bias findings toward the null, although the tool used in the current study has demonstrated excellent reliability and acceptable validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510393275">Craig et al., 2003</xref>). The individual, social, and environmental factors that were examined were not exhaustive; there may be other factors that are more important for physical activity in the target populations, although the factors selected were based on a theoretical framework and results from existing literature. Objective measures of the physical environment may have produced different findings, but debate exists over whether perceptions of the actual environment are most important for behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510393275">Ball, Timperio, &amp; Crawford, 2006</xref>). Both appear to contribute useful information, and it is recommended that objective environmental measures are included in future studies of these populations. Prior to doing so, a better understanding of how objective measures of the physical activity environment are operationalized in rural areas is required.</p>
<p>Defining what constitutes a “rural neighborhood” is difficult and definitions are likely to vary within and between countries. A recent review examining how studies conceptualize and measure rural neighborhoods highlighted some of the difficulties encountered in defining rurality, including the lack of uniformity in neighborhood structures and the diversity of distances to closest neighbors, services, and facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510393275">De Marco &amp; De Marco, 2010</xref>). The review noted five different approaches used to define “rural neighborhoods,” including administrative units (census block groups, census tracts, and electoral wards), town segments (parishes, geographic parcels, and small towns), local actor-mapped regions (where key informants defined boundaries), distance from home, and self-definitions (where no definition of “neighborhood” was provided). The parameters used in the current study were developed to ensure a locally relevant definition of “urban” and “rural” neighborhoods and were based on population size within specified distances from cities defined by government authorities as “rural.” As a result of these locally relevant definitions, the findings from this study may not be generalizable to other countries that employ different definitions.</p>
<p>This study also had a number of important strengths. It comprised a large sample of women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban and rural areas, an important high risk target group for physical activity promotion. This is the first study of which we are aware that statistically tested for differences in associations between a range of theoretically driven factors and physical activity across area of residence. Furthermore, this is the first investigation of which we are aware comparing TRPA across urban/rural location. This is important because TRPA may be somewhat discretionary (although the literature is equivocal) and therefore amenable to intervention. Understanding the influences on this domain of physical activity has provided unique insights for effective tailoring of interventions. An additional strength of this study was the description and comparison of the distribution of leisure and transport activity and a multidomain group of potential correlates between urban and rural women, which has not been previously documented.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study found few differences in associations between a range of individual, social, and environmental factors and physical activity among women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban and rural areas of Victoria, Australia. These results suggest that interventions aimed at promoting physical activity among women may not need specific tailoring according to geographic location of residence. However, some differences were noted, suggesting that strategies targeting urban women might consider an additional focus on enhancing self-efficacy, improving intentions, and increasing availability of child care, whereas strategies targeting rural women might consider focusing on promoting enjoyment of activity. Further research should employ longitudinal study designs and employ objective measures of physical activity and the physical activity environment to investigate whether the results observed in the current study are replicable. The appropriateness of these measures in rural populations also requires investigation.</p>
