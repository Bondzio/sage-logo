<title>Background</title>
<p>In England, the Department of Health has called for surveys of bereaved relatives’ views regarding the quality of care received by people at the end of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311405091">1</xref></sup> However, bereavement is associated with suffering for many, with mental and physical health consequences for some.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311405091">2</xref></sup> Bereaved relatives may therefore be a vulnerable group for research purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311405091">3</xref></sup> There is therefore considerable debate as to whether they should be approached to participate in studies at a time that can be difficult for them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311405091">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311405091">6</xref></sup> Despite this, mortality follow-back surveys with bereaved relatives are common; they have been conducted in the USA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311405091">7</xref></sup> the United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311405091">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311405091">10</xref></sup> and Italy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311405091">11</xref></sup> However, evidence on the impact of this study approach is scant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311405091">12</xref></sup> We therefore conducted a study to explore the appropriateness and acceptability of: (i) the questions posed within a survey instrument to be used with recently bereaved relatives; and (ii) engaging them in a study of this nature. The findings from these two aims were used to inform the development of a large-scale mortality follow-back postal questionnaire survey to explore the quality of end-of-life care provided to cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311405091">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion2-0269216311405091">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>The study adopted a cross-sectional approach across two phases to examine bereaved relatives’ views of the survey instrument and their views of engaging in the process of a mortality follow-back survey. In phase I, face-to-face cognitive interviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311405091">14</xref></sup> were employed to explore participants’ immediate reactions and perceptions of the questions within the survey instrument, and to understand in detail their views of the research process. In order to understand how the survey instrument would perform under conditions similar to the planned postal survey, phase II involved a self-completion postal version of the survey instrument. The content of the postal survey was identical to the interview in phase I. Participants in phase II were also asked to take part in a brief follow-up telephone interview to explore in more detail their views of engaging in the questionnaire. Research ethics approval was sought and granted prior to starting the study (REC ref no. 08/H0801/110).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion3-0269216311405091">
<title>Participant identification</title>
<p>Relatives of adult cancer patients, who were seen by a palliative care service from a hospital in greater London, who had lived locally, and who had died within three to eight months were identified by a hospital data analyst. Clinicians from the service screened patients’ next-of-kin to identify those whom they considered would not be unduly distressed by the nature of the study. Invitation letters were then sent by the palliative care consultants on behalf of the researchers to all eligible relatives for phases I and II. These letters enclosed a study information leaflet which stated that unless the relatives indicated otherwise (by sending back a freepost reply slip or by calling the consultants or the researcher) we would assume they wished to participate in the study and would contact them. Information about grief and local bereavement support services were offered to all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion4-0269216311405091">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>The process of data collection involved the following. In phase I participants were offered time to familiarize themselves with the study and discuss any outstanding concerns. They were then asked for their written consent. Once the interview started, participants were asked to respond to questions within the survey questionnaire with cognitive probing in order to explore their understanding and views about the questions, as well as their responses. At the end of the interview participants were asked to respond to the following questions: (i) <italic>Did you find this questionnaire upsetting?</italic> and (ii) <italic>Did you find this questionnaire helpful?</italic> Additional probing was conducted as appropriate. In phase II, a postal questionnaire with identical questions to those used in phase I was self-completed by participants in the absence of the researcher. This was returned to the research team in a freepost envelope. Each questionnaire was checked for completeness and screened for any answers and comments indicative of participants’ distress. The researcher then conducted a follow-up telephone interview with participants expressing written consent for this to take place. The telephone interview attempted to understand any missing information, and assess the extent of participant distress. The answers were added to the questionnaire and field notes were kept of the conversation. Information was shared on sources of bereavement support if needed.</p>
<p>Content analysis examined the transcribed cognitive interviews and the free-text comments within the postal questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311405091">15</xref></sup> To address issues of analytical rigour and trustworthiness, a selection of the interviews were reviewed by a second researcher (JK) and discussed. Where coding differed areas were reconsidered until consensus was achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion5-0269216311405091" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In phase I, of the 16 bereaved relatives who were approached to participate in the face-to-face interview, nine agreed. These interviews lasted approximately 90 minutes. In phase II, of the 17 bereaved relatives who were approached to self-complete the postal survey questionnaire, 11 returned the questionnaire of whom five agreed to the follow-up telephone interview (these lasted approximately 10 minutes). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311405091">Table 1</xref> presents the characteristics of those who participated in phases I and II. Of the 13 who did not take part, three were unreachable and four volunteered reasons for refusal. Reasons for this included finding the survey too stressful to recall the suffering of their relative’s terminal illness, or believing they would not cope with it, either because events had happened very quickly, or because their loss was still too recent. The remaining six cases were ‘silent refusals’ for which we do not know the reasons to account for their non-participation.</p>

<title>Helpful but sometimes distressing</title>
<p>Eleven out of the 20 participants felt it was helpful to take part in the study. Of these, six did not consider it distressing at all, and a further five stated whilst it had been distressing, it had also been helpful to them. Of the remaining nine bereaved relatives who did not find the survey helpful, five indicated they also found it distressing. Reasons for this included reawakening upsetting inner thoughts.</p>
<p>During the cognitive interviews participants were asked to reflect in detail on the content of the questionnaire and the process of engaging in this research approach. Responses varied: a number stated that it involved ‘<italic>bringing back (painful) memories</italic>’. These sentiments related to bad experiences of care including experiences of late diagnosis or slow appointments. Other participants referred to ‘<italic>personal failures’</italic>, and their relatives’ experiences of distressing symptoms towards the end of life. They found these very upsetting. Specific questions on the last week before death were considered to be distressing by two relatives. They stated that the interview ‘<italic>opened up wounds</italic>’ and ‘<italic>dredged up memories which were partially buried’.</italic> Indeed, one relative experienced a high level of distress that led her to keep the questionnaire, whilst expressing the wish for an edited transcript of the interview to be used to improve the survey methods and questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion7-0269216311405091">
<title>Altruistic and therapeutic</title>
<p>In spite of the distress experienced by some, sentiments about being involved in the research were not always negative. Indeed, four relatives referred to a sense of altruism through sharing their account (participants 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311405091">Table 2</xref>). They believed their individual contribution to the research findings would ‘<italic>help to improve the system</italic>’ or ‘<italic>help others in their situation</italic>’. One relative said she wanted to share her experience since she had been ‘<italic>treated very well’.</italic> Without this degree of satisfaction during her mother’s end-of-life care she suggested it would have been unlikely that she would have contributed to the study. A further eight relatives reported direct benefits from taking part in the research. For one relative this made her think in a ‘<italic>more logical way</italic>’ about her loss. For another, it ‘<italic>helped to put memories in order, instead of random thoughts’.</italic> Another relative suggested the interview actually ‘<italic>felt like a therapy session in itself’.</italic> Although the process of being compelled to consider the last period of his father’s life was perceived as being ‘<italic>confronted</italic>’ with stark reminders of the circumstances of his illness and final death, this bereaved son still found the interview was very helpful. Moreover, he added he had previously avoided ‘<italic>thinking about (his loss) before in much detail</italic>’. Lastly, we identified that the absence of a prior relationship between the relatives and the researcher contributed to their willingness to share intimate, and at times distressing, accounts without being judged or unnecessarily protected from the reality of what happened. To this end, a widow stated it was ‘<italic>easier to talk with a stranger without having to put a front on</italic>’ (participant 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311405091">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that we know little about those who chose not to participate in the study. We can postulate that the duration of time between death and being invited to be interviewed or respond to the postal questionnaire may have influenced some relatives’ willingness to share their views; shorter periods possibly being too upsetting to contemplate involvement. This highlights the mixed evidence of the best time to make contact with potential participants for follow-back surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311405091">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311405091">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst some found the prospect of the interview or questionnaire too upsetting, they were free to decide not to engage in the study (as stated both in the invitation letter and in the participant information leaflet). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the response rates (56% in phase I and 65% in phase II), were higher than in previous population-based and service-based surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311405091">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311405091">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study provides important new evidence that although engaging in mortality follow-back surveys can evoke distressing emotions to some bereaved relatives, many find it a positive and useful experience. This finding has implications for the perceived vulnerability of this group and the ethical debate about engaging them in research. We believe that this approach is acceptable when conducted sensitively.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the interviews and questionnaires were not experienced consistently among the relatives and that in one situation a relative experienced severe distress during the course of the interview; we believe this reflects the reality that it is difficult to predict all responses. We therefore recommend that researchers take time to prepare potential participants prior to taking part in studies of this nature; they should ensure all are aware that the research process may touch topic areas that may prove to be sensitive or distressing to them. Researchers may also wish to consider preparing the relatives either in the body of a self-completion questionnaire or a face-to-face interview for particularly sensitive questions and prompt them to carefully consider the implications of thinking about and responding to them. In summary, our findings identify that mortality follow-back research can be a helpful vehicle for some bereavement-related distress to be channelled positively. This can be achieved by helping relatives to reconstruct their memories and loss, and by giving them an opportunity to contribute towards improving research and care in the future.</p>
