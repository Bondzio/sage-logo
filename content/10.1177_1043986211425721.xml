<abstract>
<p>Understanding police decision making has been a priority for policing scholars since the middle part of the 20th century. Recent emphasis has focused on examining the decision to search drivers and vehicles during pedestrian and traffic stops. The current study contributes to this body of literature by testing a series of hypotheses based on Skolnick’s notion of “symbolic assailants” and Smith and Alpert’s social conditioning model. Using data gathered from a large, Midwestern municipal jurisdiction over an 8-month period during 2005 and 2006, we estimate a series of hierarchical models to assess the relationship between discretionary searches and driver, vehicle, stop, and officer characteristics. Results indicate that specific driver groups including young, Black males are more likely to be searched for discretionary reasons. This relationship is further conditioned by officer assignment. Policy implications and suggestions for future research are also discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Concerns of racial/ethnic disparities in police encounters have been woven into the fabric of research on officer decision making. Based on discretion studies and against the backdrop of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, a body of research developed that focused on explaining coercive outcomes of police–citizen interactions that could be easily counted using official data sources (i.e., citations, arrests, use of force, searches). This research examined, nearly exclusively, whether drivers’ characteristics influenced police behavior (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425721">National Research Council, 2004</xref>). From simple bivariate comparisons of police decisions and driver characteristics, this body of research evolved into the use of multivariate statistical techniques in an effort to isolate the effects of extralegal factors (e.g., drivers’ race/ethnicity, age, gender, demeanor, etc.) on police decision making, after controlling for legal factors. After 5 decades of research examining police behavior, studies have demonstrated some racial, ethnic, and gender characteristics that may, on occasion, influence officers to take coercive actions against drivers, but the explanatory power of these extra-legal factors is small compared with the influences of legal and other relevant factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425721">National Research Council, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Most recently, officer decisions to search drivers and vehicles during pedestrian and traffic stops have generated substantial research interest. This body of research generally suggests that minority drivers are more likely to be searched compared with White drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425721">Engel &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>); however, there are several theoretical and methodological limitations of this research that suggest a more detailed examination of officers’ decision to search is required. First, many of the available studies do not separately consider mandatory and discretionary searches. Mandatory searches are dictated by organizational policy and do not allow an examination of the core issue—officer discretion. As a result, analyses of all searches may reveal more about organizational responses toward driver behavior than about officer decision making. Second, statistical analyses of searches have potentially suffered from model misspecification. Little attention has been given to examining specific groups of drivers, such as young, Black males and their experiences with search activity. Analyses of other poststop outcomes (i.e., warnings and citations) indicate that this specification is important to fully understand minority experiences during traffic stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425721">Tillyer &amp; Engel, forthcoming</xref>). Other variables not considered include vehicle characteristics and driver demeanor, which have been linked with other poststop outcomes, such as arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986211425721">Engel, Klahm, &amp; Tillyer, 2010</xref>). Third, examinations of officer search behavior have been predominately executed using pooled variance models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986211425721">Alpert, Dunham, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425721">Lundman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425721">Moon &amp; Corley, 2007</xref>). However, this approach does not address the nested nature of traffic stop data that requires the use of hierarchical models to disentangle encounter-level effects from officer or neighborhood factors and has important implications for understanding the relationship between officer characteristics and discretionary searches. Finally, consistent calls for the use of theory have largely gone unheeded in past research on search and seizure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986211425721">Engel, Calnon, &amp; Bernard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986211425721">Tomaskovic-Devey, Mason, &amp; Zingraff, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We address these limitations using official data collected during traffic stops conducted by Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) officers. A synopsis of past literature on search activity provides context for our study. We model discretionary searches separately from those conducted for mandatory reasons to better specify officer discretion. Second, we explore the relationship between specific minority groups (i.e., young, Black male drivers) and discretionary searches while also considering the effect exerted by vehicle characteristics and driver demeanor. Furthermore, we examine the potential for cross-level interactions between driver characteristics and officer characteristics, which have not been explored in previous research. These models are estimated using a hierarchical approach to properly reflect the nested nature of traffic stop data. Finally, we link Skolnick’s classic work on stereotypes with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">Smith and Alpert’s (2007)</xref> more recent discussion of the social conditioning model to ground our hypotheses in a theoretical framework to assist in interpreting our results.</p>

<title>Patterns of Search Activity</title>
<p>The majority of research examining search activity during traffic stops indicates that minority drivers are more likely to be searched compared with other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425721">Engel &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986211425721">Roh &amp; Robinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986211425721">Rojek, Rosenfeld, &amp; Decker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425721">Withrow, 2004</xref>). This effect has been documented across settings, with various analysis techniques, using both official and nonofficial data. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425721">Engel and Johnson (2006)</xref> reported higher rates of minority searches compared with Whites across 12 different state highway police/patrol agencies whereas Moon and Corley’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425721">2007</xref>) of a university setting indicated that Black students, and more specifically Black male students, were more likely to be searched compared with White students. Analyses of discretionary searches in Oakland using propensity score matching indicated that Black drivers were twice as likely to be searched for probable cause reasons compared with White drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986211425721">Ridgeway, 2006</xref>); interestingly, no effect was discovered when consent searches were examined. Analyses of survey data from the Police Public Contact Survey (PPCS), a supplement of the National Crime Victimization Survey, indicated that younger drivers, male drivers, and minority drivers all reported higher rates of search compared with other drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425721">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>). Other significant factors included officer suspicion, more passengers in the vehicle, and interactions between driver race/ethnicity and driver gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425721">Lundman, 2004</xref>). In particular, Black male drivers and Hispanic male drivers reported increased rates of search when using arrest as a proxy for mandatory searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425721">Lundman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>More recent research has begun to disentangle the relationship between officer discretion and search activity (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close &amp; Mason, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986211425721">Engel, Cherkauskas, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986211425721">Engel, Cherkauskas, &amp; Tillyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell, Mosher, &amp; Pratt, 2009</xref>). One approach has been to use arrest as a method to differentiate between mandatory and discretionary searches (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986211425721">Higgins, Vito, &amp; Walsh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425721">Lundman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425721">Withrow, 2004</xref>). A limitation to this approach, however, is the inability to establish the temporal ordering of events within traffic stops. It is unknown if arrests lead to searches (i.e., mandatory searches incident to arrest) or if searches lead to arrests (i.e., discretionary searches that result in the discovery of contraband and subsequent arrest).</p>
<p>Others have addressed this issue by separately analyzing mandatory and discretionary searches. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell et al. (2009)</xref> disaggregated searches conducted by the Washington State Police into low-discretion and high-discretion searches. Their pooled regression models demonstrated that Black and Hispanic drivers were more likely to be searched compared with White drivers, regardless of the search type. Results also suggested that officers did not act differently toward any specific racial group when they had more discretion to search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close and Mason (2007)</xref> examined traffic stop data collected from the Florida Highway Patrol by disaggregating searches into consent and nonvoluntary searches. Using the outcome test and multivariate models, the results indicated that Black and Hispanic drivers were more likely to be searched compared with White drivers, regardless of search type. When the race of the officer was taken into account, some models indicated there were significant differences in search behavior depending on the officer’s race/ethnicity. Although minority drivers were more likely to be searched in general, the effect was even greater when the searching officer was White. This result, which is contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell et al.’s findings (2009)</xref>, underscores the importance of studying the impact officer characteristics may have on officer behavior.</p>
<p>Although the majority of statistical findings demonstrates racial/ethnic disparities in search rates, a handful of studies have reported null effects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425721">Smith and Petrocelli (2001)</xref> reported that Black drivers were not more likely to be involved in consent searches compared with White drivers. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425721">Schafer, Carter, Katz-Bannister, and Wells (2006)</xref> concluded Black drivers were more likely to be searched for mandatory reasons (e.g., in conjunction with an arrest) compared with White drivers, but this effect was not present in discretionary searches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425721">Schafer et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that examining interaction terms may be an important next step in understanding the correlates of search and seizure. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425721">Paoline and Terrill (2005)</xref> demonstrated that non-White citizens were not more likely to be searched compared with White citizens; however, citizens’ gender, age, socioeconomic status, and displays of resistance did significantly influence searches. Driver demeanor is potentially a key predictor not widely used in traffic stop research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986211425721">Engel, Cherkauskas, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986211425721">Engel, Klahm, &amp; Tillyer 2010</xref>) but found to be consistently important in other studies of officer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986211425721">Brown &amp; Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425721">National Research Council, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986211425721">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425721">Worden &amp; Shepard, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>More recent research has also explored the use of qualitative data to contextualize research findings regarding officer behavior. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986211425721">Brunson (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986211425721">Brunson and Weitzer (2009)</xref> conducted in-depth interviews with adolescent males residing in St. Louis, Missouri, to determine their perceptions of the police and their behavior. Using an all Black sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986211425721">Brunson (2007)</xref> reported that many respondents had experienced pedestrian or traffic stops, or knew someone who had been stopped when, from their perspective, there was no basis for suspicion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986211425721">Brunson and Weitzer (2009)</xref> included White male adolescents in their sample and reported the risk of White youths being stopped increased when they were accompanied by young, Black males, in racially mixed or predominately Black neighborhoods, or dressed in “hip-hop apparel” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986211425721">Brunson &amp; Weitzer, 2009</xref>). This implies that police may view specific subgroups more suspiciously based on their race/ethnicity, gender, age, or the situational context.</p>
<p>Collectively, quantitative research on search activity generally suggests that differential treatment does exist, and it may be more pronounced depending on driver characteristics. Moreover, the degree of officer discretion, as indicated by search type, must be considered to properly disentangle these relationships. Officer characteristics appear to present another dimension that may influence search activity. These findings and the broader issue of officer decision-making during citizen encounters may be partially explained by Skolnick’s classic perspective on the role of stereotypes and symbolic assailants in police decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043986211425721">
<title>Explanations for Search Activity</title>
<p>Prior to the rise of “racial profiling” as a social concern and a focus of research efforts in the mid-1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425721">Sklonick (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425721">1994</xref>) and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986211425721">Muir, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986211425721">Rubinstein, 1973</xref>) theorized that police use citizen race/ethnicity to develop stereotypes that assist in identifying potentially dangerous situations. Accordingly, police conceptualize certain types of citizens as “symbolic assailants,” those who need not be legitimately criminal “but need merely to conform to the stereotype” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425721">Skolnick, 1994</xref>, p. 212). The characterization of a symbolic assailant is particularly germane to police search activity, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425721">Skolnick (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425721">1994</xref>) contested that “African Americans who live in black ghettos are especially prone to being searched according to a ‘reasonableness-of-the-search’ standard” (1994, p. 212). Thus, if police consciously or subconsciously regard African Americans as “symbolic assailants,” the search rates for this subgroup of society would be higher compared with other racial groups.</p>
<p>More recently, interest in the idea of stereotypes influencing behavior has been reinvigorated with the introduction of the social conditioning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2007</xref>). Drawing from a large body of research on cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986211425721">Allport, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986211425721">Drass &amp; Spencer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425721">Good &amp; Brophy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986211425721">Hill, Harris, &amp; Miller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986211425721">Huesmann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986211425721">Lippman, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425721">Lurigio &amp; Carroll, 1985</xref>), this approach suggests an officer’s behavior is influenced by unconscious, preexisting schemas of certain demographic groups within society that operate as a cognitive shorthand to assist in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986211425721">Katz &amp; Braley, 1933</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">Smith and Alpert (2007)</xref> suggested that these profiles reflect the cumulative effect of personal experiences, vicarious experiences, and media exposure to certain subgroups within society. For example, some argue that minority status has been linked with criminal activity due to racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986211425721">Bobo, Kluegel, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>) or a process of racial typification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986211425721">Chiricos, Welch, &amp; Gertz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425721">Scheingold, 1984</xref>), and this image is reinforced through vicarious experiences and media exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425721">Barlow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986211425721">Entman, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986211425721">1992</xref>). Importantly, the social conditioning model suggests that if officers are exposed to such a schema, their behavior may be influenced by these unconscious beliefs and lead to differential treatment of specific subgroups.</p>
<p>Extending the principles of the social conditioning model beyond race/ethnicity to include age and gender, recent empirical analyses report young, minority male drivers were more likely to be warned and less likely to be cited compared with other similarly situated drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425721">Tillyer &amp; Engel, forthcoming</xref>). Officers may rely on these unconscious stereotypes to initiate traffic stops expecting to discover criminal activity among the young, minority male group; however, this schema may be inaccurate and result in warnings rather than citations issued by officers. This result may be partially explained by the additional scrutiny officers sometimes receive when initiating encounters with minorities.</p>
<p>These processes can also apply directly to discretionary search behavior. Officers may engage in discretionary searches more frequently when the driver possesses specific demographic attributes based on the perception of a “symbolic assailant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425721">Skolnick, 1966</xref>) or the influence of unconscious stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2007</xref>). The qualitative findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986211425721">Brunson (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986211425721">Brunson and Weitzer (2009)</xref> further suggest that officer suspicion is queued when interacting with specific types of people thereby identifying the “symbolic assailant” and/or igniting the unconscious stereotype.</p>
<p>Others have also suggested that officer suspicion is a key mechanism influencing officer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986211425721">Smith, Makarios, &amp; Alpert, 2006</xref>). Built on the principles of script theory, officer suspicion may be raised when an encounter involves an individual who possesses specific characteristics that match the officer’s cognitive schematic. In such situations, officer suspicion operates as a causal link between the officer’s underlying perception of the driver and the officer’s behavior. Thus, when an officer possesses discretion to search, their unconscious stereotype regarding specific driver groups heightens their suspicion and increases the likelihood of a search. Although we are unable to directly test these theoretical propositions in our study, they provide a foundation for developing testable hypotheses regarding discretionary search behavior and interpreting the results of empirical analyses.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Rooted in the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425721">Skolnick (1966</xref>) and the recent contribution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">Smith and Alpert (2007)</xref>, this study examines the effects of driver, vehicle, stop, and officer characteristics on an officer’s decision to search a driver and/or vehicle. Using official data gathered during traffic stops by Cleveland Division of Police officers, we hypothesize that minorities, men, and younger drivers will be searched at higher rates for discretionary reasons compared with other drivers. On the basis of Smith and Alpert’s social conditioning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425721">2007</xref>), these demographic characteristics should also interact to produce differential driver treatment during traffic stops. Therefore, we also hypothesize that young, minority male drivers specifically will experience a higher likelihood of discretionary searches beyond the direct effect of those characteristics.</p>
<p>Building on Close and Mason’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">2007</xref>), we estimate a series of cross-level interactions within hierarchical models to more fully explore the relationship between officer characteristics and the likelihood of discretionary searches. All hypotheses are tested using multilevel models to reflect the nested nature of traffic stop data and eliminate the methodological threat of correlated error across level-one (i.e., driver, vehicle, and stop characteristics) and level-two (i.e., officer characteristics) predictors. We also add additional theoretically relevant factors that have been previously unmeasured in traffic stop studies, including officers’ perceptions of drivers’ demeanor, vehicle condition, and aftermarket vehicle modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986211425721">Engel, et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data analyzed represent police–citizen encounters recorded during officer-initiated traffic stops in the city of Cleveland, Ohio between July 1, 2005 and February 28, 2006. Police–citizen encounters resulting from a citizen request, stemming from a police checkpoint (e.g., registration, DUI, seat belts, etc.), or initiated by a traffic accident were not included in these data. According to the 2000 Census, the city of Cleveland contained roughly 500,000 residents with the following racial/ethnic composition: 51% Black, 42% White, and 7% Hispanic. In 2003, the Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) was composed of slightly more than 1,800 sworn officers with the majority male (80%) and White (approximately 65%). Black officers comprised roughly 30% of the force.</p>
<p>Information was collected on a traffic stop form and included the resolution of the traffic stop, a series of driver, vehicle, and stop characteristics, and an officer identifier (i.e., badge number). These data were subsequently transferred to an electronic database using a Scantron machine and subjected to a thorough and consistent data-auditing process to assess the validity of the information collected. A department-wide training session and pilot test were also undertaken to identify and eliminate data-collection problems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425721">Engel, Frank, Tillyer, &amp; Klahm, 2006</xref> for additional details).</p>
<p>During the 8-month study period, the CDP reported 43,707 traffic stops of drivers. Initial analyses indicated that at least one citation was issued to the driver in 96.7% of the traffic stops reported. This finding suggests that the purpose and design of the original data-collection effort (to capture information on <italic>all</italic> traffic stops, regardless of formal dispositions) was potentially compromised; however, these data do offer an opportunity to study officer decision making when a formal disposition was issued. The data-cleaning processes eliminated 3,014 (6.9%) traffic stops because the officer who initiated the traffic stop conducted less than 30 traffic stops during the study period. Due to the use of the multilevel modeling strategy employed in this analysis (described in detail below), each officer had to initiate a minimum number of traffic stops (i.e., cases) for those cases to be included in the models. Thirty traffic stops per officer was selected as the threshold to ensure robust, stable model estimates. An additional 1,687 (3.9%) cases were removed due to missing data on relevant variables, which resulted in 39,006 cases remaining at Level 1 (i.e., traffic stops) and 236 cases at Level 2 (i.e., officers).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043986211425721">1</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-1043986211425721">
<title>Searches</title>
<p>The reason for search was captured on the traffic stop form in nine categories (canine alert, consent, incident to arrest, inventory, odor, plain view, probable cause, search warrant, and other), where officers could select multiple reasons for an individual search. These searches were divided into two categories: mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory searches included those conducted incident to arrest, based on inventory procedures or as the result of a search warrant. Discretionary searches occurred when an officer possessed probable cause to conduct a search (including plain view and drug odor), when a canine alerted to the presence of contraband or when driver consent was given.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043986211425721">2</xref></sup> If both mandatory and discretionary reasons were indicated for an individual search, the search was classified as mandatory. Based on this classification system, traffic stops resulting in a discretionary search were coded as a “1” and all remaining cases were coded as a “0” (including mandatory searches). An examination of the 39,006 traffic stops revealed that 857 (2.2%) officer-initiated traffic stops resulted in a discretionary search. Of these searches, 19.3% were of White drivers, compared with 77.7% of Black drivers, 2.7% of Hispanic drivers, and 0.4% of “other” drivers (i.e., Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Middle Eastern).</p>

<p>Driver characteristics included measures of race/ethnicity, gender, age, and demeanor. Specifically, driver race/ethnicity was based on officer perceptions and operationalized as a series of dichotomous variables capturing the following racial/ethnic groups: White, Black, Hispanic, and Other (includes Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Middle Eastern). The officer recorded driver gender and age from the driver’s license. Although driver age was originally measured as a continuous variable, it was later recoded into a dichotomous variable (1 = <italic>15 to 29 years of age</italic> and 0 = <italic>30 years of age or older</italic>). One additional driver variable, young, Black male, was created from driver race/ethnicity, gender, and age variables.</p>
<p>Driver demeanor was originally captured by officers as civil, disrespectful, noncompliant, verbally resistant and/or physically resistant (mark all that apply). Drivers were considered civil if they complied with the officer’s requests and deferred to their authority. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425721">Worden and Shepard (1996)</xref>, officers recorded the driver as disrespectful if they demonstrated any behavior (verbal or nonverbal) that was discourteous, rude, or indicated an unwillingness to defer to the officer’s authority. Noncompliant drivers were defined as those who refused to comply with officers’ requests or refused to answer officers’ questions. Verbally resistant drivers were those who were verbally abusive, including cursing at or threatening the officer. Finally, officers recorded the driver as physically resistant if he or she attempted to flee, physically threatened an officer, or assaulted an officer. For analysis purposes, driver demeanor was recategorized as disrespectful or noncompliant/resistant.</p>
<p>Vehicle characteristics were based on officer perception and included vehicle modifications, vehicle condition, number of passengers in the vehicle, and vehicle registration. Vehicle modifications included vehicles that possessed aftermarket modifications such as tinted windows, high-performance exhaust systems, or aftermarket rims. Vehicles in poor condition were defined as possessing visible cosmetic defects including broken head or taillight(s), mirror(s), muffler, window(s), or severe body damage. The number of passengers in the vehicle was recorded as a continuous variable and vehicle registration measured valid vehicle licensing.</p>
<p>Stop characteristics included the location, time of the day, day of the week, road type, and reason for the stop. The location of the stop indicated whether the traffic stop occurred within the same jurisdiction as the driver’s home address. In addition, location was measured as the type of roadway (main road or interstate vs. local road). Time of day was captured as two dichotomous variables measuring daytime (between 0700 and 1900), and more specifically, rush hour (0700-0930 or 1600-1830). Day of the week was collapsed into a dichotomous weekend/weekday variable.</p>
<p>The primary reason for the stop was captured as a speeding violation, moving misdemeanor, equipment violation, license or registration violation, preexisting police information regarding the vehicle, and “other.” For any encounter, an officer could identify more than one reason for the stop.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043986211425721">3</xref></sup> A continuous variable measuring the number of violations was also created.</p>
<p>Officer characteristics included information regarding their race/ethnicity, gender, assignment, years on the force, and context of their traffic stops. Officer gender and race/ethnicity were measured as dichotomous variables (i.e., race measured as White/non-White). Officer assignment was measured as traffic/nontraffic detail; years on the force was measured as a continuous variable reflecting the number of years of service to the agency. Finally, to measure the context within which these cases were initiated, an average measure of racial composition within the census tract of the traffic stop was generated. This measure was calculated by aggregating all traffic stops to the officer level while taking the mean of the percentage Black within those census tracts. This variable does not reflect the number of stops the officer made in a Black neighborhood; rather, it identifies officers who made stops in areas of higher Black concentration. Higher values on this variable indicate an officer who, on average, made stops in areas with higher rates of Black composition. For example, an officer with a value of 4.7, on average, made his or her traffic stops in neighborhoods with roughly 5% Black population; conversely, a value of 98.5 reflects an officer whose stops, on average, occurred in neighborhoods with a large majority of Black citizens.</p>
<p>Initially, a series of bivariate analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between discretionary searches and driver race/ethnicity. Results suggested that White and Hispanic drivers were less likely to be searched for discretionary reasons, whereas Black drivers were more likely. Although these results indicated a potential effect of driver race/ethnicity on discretionary searches, more sophisticated analytical techniques accounting for the nested nature of traffic stop data were necessary to properly test the hypotheses.</p>

<sec id="section8-1043986211425721">
<title>Analytic Technique</title>
<p>Traffic stop data, containing driver, vehicle, stop, and officer characteristics, are inherently hierarchical due to their nested nature and the fact that single officers initiated multiple traffic stops within the study period. Thus, a multilevel modeling approach that locates driver, vehicle, and stop characteristics at Level 1 and officer characteristics at Level 2 is required. We explored the correlates of discretionary searches by estimating a series of hierarchical logistic models using HLM 6. This approach allows for proper model specification when dealing with nested data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425721">Luke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425721">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For all models, statistical tests were performed to check for multicollinearity and all levels were found to be within acceptable parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043986211425721">4</xref></sup> A correction for overdispersion was required because the standard error exceeded the mean of the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986211425721">Hanushek &amp; Jackson, 1977</xref>). All Level 1 variables were group mean centered to control for contextual effects across Level 2 units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425721">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>); previous research has demonstrated the appropriateness of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986211425721">Ingram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425721">Tillyer &amp; Engel, forthcoming</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref> reports the coefficients for all variables and the odds ratios for statistically significant effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043986211425721">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>The analytic strategy employed the following steps. First, an unconditional model (i.e., intercept only) was estimated to examine if variation existed in discretionary searches across officers. Thereafter, Level 1 predictors were included to assess whether variation in discretionary searches remained once these encounter-level effects were considered (analyses not shown, available from authors on request). Officer variables were added to the model to understand the relative contributions of Level 1 and Level 2 variables in explaining the occurrence of a discretionary search (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, Model 1). Thereafter, this model was reestimated with the inclusion of the young, Black male driver interaction term (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, Model 2). Throughout these models, all Level 1 variables were fixed, reflecting the assumption that the specific variation of any variable does not vary across officers. To test the third hypothesis, the young, Black male interaction term was allowed to vary across officers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, Model 3). In essence, this tests the supposition that this variable has differing effects on the likelihood of a discretionary search depending on officer characteristics. Finally, we explored whether any of the officer variables contributed to the variation of the interaction term in understanding the occurrence of a discretionary search (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, Model 4). Only statistically significant cross-level interactions were reported.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results from these analyses demonstrated several important findings. First, the likelihood of a discretionary search occurring varied significantly across officers, and this result was consistent after the introduction of Level 1 predictors and despite the inclusion of officer characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, Model 1). As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref>, the first model reported several significant driver, vehicle, stop, and officer characteristics that predicted discretionary searches. Key relationships included the higher likelihood of discretionary searches of male drivers (3.6 times more likely than female drivers) and younger drivers (1.5 times more likely than drivers more than 30 years old). Conversely, drivers of “other” race/ethnicity were 3.6 times less likely to be searched for discretionary reasons; however, this group only represented 1.5% of all cases, requiring some caution when drawing conclusions. Of note, Black and Hispanic drivers were not more likely than White drivers to be subjected to discretionary searches after controlling for other factors. In addition, drivers demonstrating disrespectful or noncompliant/resistant demeanor were also not more likely to be searched for discretionary reasons compared with civil drivers. Traffic stops involving vehicles in poor condition and those with more passengers were at higher risk for discretionary searches. Several stop characteristics were also positively related to discretionary searches, including stops initiated on nonmajor roads (1.3 times more likely), nonspeeding initiated stops (i.e., ranging from 1.9 times more likely to 3.3 times more likely), and stops involving multiple violations. White officers were 2.9 times more likely to initiate a discretionary search compared with non-White officers, whereas officers assigned to a traffic detail were 9.6 times less likely compared with nontraffic officers. Officers with fewer years on the force were significantly more likely to engage in discretionary searches compared with officers with more years on the force. Finally, officers that, on average, initiated traffic stops in areas of higher Black concentration were more likely to conduct discretionary searches, although this effect had minimal substantive effect.</p>
<p>To test our second hypothesis, we included the young, Black male interaction term in Model 2. Results indicated that this subgroup was at a higher risk (1.5 times) of being searched for discretionary reasons. Of note, the direct effect of young drivers was rendered nonsignificant, suggesting that the majority of this effect was influenced by race. Conversely, Black drivers were 1.4 times less likely to be searched for discretionary reasons indicating that the young, Black male drivers were treated differently from other Black drivers. While there was slight variation in the strength of the other relationships, no significant changes exist when the results from Model 2 were compared with Model 1.</p>
<p>Models 3 and 4 explored whether there was support for our third hypothesis by allowing the slope of the interaction term (young, Black male drivers), to vary across Level 2 units (i.e., officers). As evidenced by the statistically significant result in the random effects section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425721">Table 2</xref> (Model 3), officer characteristics exerted an influence over the strength of the relationship between young, Black male drivers and discretionary searches. As reported in Model 4, officer assignment was statistically significant; specifically, traffic officers strengthened the relationship between young, Black male drivers and discretionary searches. Importantly, officer assignment did not explain all the variation in the relationship between young, Black male drivers and discretionary searches, as evidenced by the statistically significant effect for this relationship reported in the random effects section of Model 4. Other officer characteristics were modeled to explain this remaining variance, but no statistically significant effects were found. In effect, the increased likelihood of discretionary searches experienced by young, Black male drivers was not conditioned by officer race/ethnicity, gender, experience, or neighborhood context.</p>
<p>Due to the statistically significant cross-level interaction of officer assignment, the negative direct effect of traffic officer on discretionary searches increased from 9.5 times less likely in Model 2, to 14.5 times less likely in Model 4. This result suggests that traffic officers were more likely to engage in a discretionary search when interacting with a young, Black male driver.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies of police officer decision making have evolved over time and now focus on understanding the use of discretion within traffic stops. Examinations of these police–citizen encounters have largely targeted poststop outcome activity, such as police-initiated searches, to explore whether minorities experience differential treatment. The general consensus of research to date indicates that minorities are more likely to be searched compared with Whites; however, this conclusion needs to be contextualized due to the limitations of previous research.</p>
<p>Using a theoretical framework, we posited several hypotheses to expand our knowledge regarding the correlates of discretionary searches. Our initial hypothesis suggested that minority drivers, men, and younger drivers would be searched for discretionary reasons at higher rates compared with other drivers. Results of the hierarchical models provide only partial support for this hypothesis. Drivers of “other” race/ethnicity (i.e., Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Middle Easterners), men, and drivers below 30 years old were more likely to be searched for discretionary reasons. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, Black and Hispanic drivers were <italic>not</italic> more likely than White drivers to be searched for discretionary reasons when other factors are controlled. In fact, Black drivers were significantly less likely to be searched for discretionary reasons once the effect of young, Black males was introduced. Although these results initially appear inconsistent with the bulk of studies examining searches conducted by state highway police/patrols (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close &amp; Mason, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell et al., 2009</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425721">Engel &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>), a handful of studies have also reported no race effect on searches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986211425721">Alpert, Smith, &amp; Dunham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425721">Smith &amp; Pertocelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Differences across data sets may explain the differences between our findings and those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close and Mason’s (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerill et al.’s (2009)</xref>. These earlier studies examined traffic stop data collected by state patrol agencies (i.e., Florida and Washington), whereas our data were drawn from a municipal (city) police department. State patrol agencies typically perform traffic-related functions, whereas municipal agencies often perform crime control and service functions, in addition to traffic-related duties. Moreover, state law enforcement agencies patrol urban and rural areas, with the latter having significantly different geographic and social compositions. Our data capture traffic stops in the city of Cleveland and thus reflect a strictly urban environment with a high percentage of minority citizens (based on the 2000 Census, roughly 51% of Cleveland residents are Black, 62% of the recorded traffic stops by CDP officers involved Black drivers, and 77.7% of discretionary searches conducted were of Black drivers). By comparison, most state agencies report significantly smaller percentages of minorities that are stopped and searched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425721">Engel &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond differences in data sources, neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close and Mason (2007)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerell et al. (2009)</xref> employed a hierarchical approach to estimate their models; thus, the threat of inflated standard errors influencing the achievement of statistical significance was not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425721">Luke, 2004</xref>). In other words, the failure to consider the nested nature of traffic stop data raises the possibility of unstable variable estimates in those analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425721">Luke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425721">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These disparate findings raise several questions for future research. For example, how do different policing priorities (i.e., traffic control vs. crime control) influence the use of officer discretion and the occurrence of discretionary searches? Alternatively, perhaps the distinction is not rooted in policing emphasis but affected by differences between rural and urban environments. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986211425721">Klinger (1997)</xref>, the social environment may also influence police behavior, including search activity, through the development of work groups.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis suggested that young, Black male drivers were more likely to be searched for discretionary reasons, beyond the direct effects of these individual driver characteristics. Our findings demonstrate support for this hypothesis, as young, Black male drivers were at an elevated risk to be searched for discretionary reasons, net of controls, and at even higher risk once officer assignment conditioned the relationship. This result mirrors similar findings demonstrating the importance of driver interaction terms reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425721">Moon and Corley (2007)</xref> in a university sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425721">Lundman (2004)</xref> using self-reported data, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425721">Tillyer and Engel (forthcoming)</xref> using official data. Collectively, this body of research suggests that the discussion of minorities as one collective group can be misleading and that the likelihood of a minority driver receiving disparate treatment during a traffic stop varies based on combinations of their race with gender and age. We also found a negative, direct relationship between Black drivers and discretionary searches once young, Black male drivers were considered, suggesting that race alone is not driving these relationships. This is similar to findings regarding the importance of race–sex–age interaction terms in explaining judicial decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986211425721">Tillyer &amp; Hartley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also have theoretical implications for the social conditioning model and the contention that officer behavior is influenced by unconscious stereotypes. The increased likelihood of discretionary searches of young, Black males is consistent with theories suggesting that this group, in particular, is presented in the media, and perhaps through vicarious and personal experience, as being involved in criminal activity at higher rates compared with other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425721">Barlow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986211425721">Entman, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986211425721">1992</xref>). In essence, officers may be focused on young, Black males and therefore engage in discretionary searches at higher rates when compared with others, due in part to unconscious stereotypes formed over time. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425721">Tillyer and Engel (forthcoming)</xref>, qualitative data from interviews and focus groups with officers are necessary to more fully explore the veracity of this theoretical explanation.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis suggested that officer characteristics would condition (i.e., strengthen or weaken) the relationship between driver’s race/ethnicity and discretionary searches. Previous research explored officer characteristics as direct effects on search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425721">Pickerill et al., 2009</xref>), but no study has modeled these effects using a hierarchical model and cross-level interactions. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425721">Close and Mason (2007)</xref> reported that White officers were more likely to search Black drivers, they did not employ a hierarchical model, which is necessary given the nested nature of traffic stop data.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that White officers were more likely to conduct discretionary searches (i.e., direct effect), but officer race/ethnicity did not condition the effect of the relationship between young, Black male drivers and discretionary searches. After exploring other officer variables as potentially moderating this relationship, we found that traffic officers strengthened the relationship between young, Black male drivers and discretionary searches, independent of the direct effect of officer assignment. This finding has both theoretical and practical implications.</p>
<p>The varied experiences of traffic and patrol officers might actually play a role in how they develop search cues and techniques. For example, patrol officers, who more routinely work the same beat and encounter similar individuals, might develop more precise cues of suspicion for criminal activity based on these interactions. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986211425721">Klinger’s (1997)</xref> view that “officers know by sight many individuals whom they suspect or know to be criminals––for example, burglars, drug dealers, and prostitutes––who operate in their districts, as well as individuals on probation and parole who reside and/or work there” (p. 288). Conversely, neither do officers assigned to traffic duties have the same level of repeat interactions with citizens nor do they experience citizen behavior across multiple contexts (i.e., traffic stops, responding to calls, proactively initiating encounters, etc.). Traffic and nontraffic officers are seemingly influenced by their varied experiences, and this may translate into differences in discretionary search patterns.</p>
<p>With respect to Skolnick’s observations, it is possible that patrol officers’ susceptibility to vicarious images of the “symbolic assailant” is muted as a result of their direct experiences with this subset of the population. After repeated contact, across a variety of settings, patrol officers might rely on these characteristics <italic>less</italic> when deciding to search because they have developed better indicators of who might be carrying contraband. However, given the rather monotonous nature of traffic officers’ interactions with citizens, they might be more vulnerable to vicarious images developed through repeated exposure to media images of young, Black males being threatening and prone to criminality.</p>
<p>These findings also have implications for the social conditioning model, which suggests that personal experiences, vicarious experiences, and media exposure coalesce to form stereotypes regarding certain groups of individuals. Similar to the process described above, traffic officers may primarily form stereotypes based on vicarious experiences and media exposure rather than personal experience (at least when investigating criminal activity). As already described, young, Black males are often presented in the media as being more involved in criminal activity compared with other citizens. Traffic officers may be more likely than patrol officers to unconsciously view this group as more likely to be engaged in criminal activity. As traffic officers have less criminal activity–related interactions compared with most urban patrol officers, this stereotype may be more influential in their decision making. Patrol officers, however, have more personal experience on which to form stereotypes and may develop more accurate cues of suspicion as a result. If accurate, this suggests that the elements of the social conditioning model may need to be prioritized. It is possible that personal experiences are more critical in developing stereotypes than vicarious experiences or media exposure. For example, it is possible that officers enter the job with preconceived notions of criminal activity based on vicarious experiences and media exposure, and these schemas are either reinforced or contradicted by personal experiences. To properly explore this possibility, longitudinal data regarding preexisting attitudes and beliefs of officers would need to be coupled with work histories of training and assignment.</p>
<p>Practically, these findings suggest the traditional conceptualization of police experience, measured in years of service, is no longer adequate for understanding a construct that is multidimensional in nature. Using the conventional measure of officer experience might constrain our understanding regarding how direct, hands-on experiences with citizens influence the skill sets developed in the field and how those skills are used. For example, officer experience (measured in years of service) was only weakly correlated with searches. Thus, we contend that it is not merely a matter of length of service but rather <italic>how</italic> the officer spends his or her years of service that really influence decision making. Although officer assignment might contextualize officer experience, this too does not likely tell the full story. Efforts to adequately measure officer experiences would undoubtedly be challenging because such a measure would ideally incorporate elements of training (types and hours), activities (traditional vs. proactive approaches), as well as how past experiences condition future ones. Simply relying on years of service as a proxy for “experience” assumes that officers with a greater number of years of employment are more experienced than those with fewer years on the police force. However, this ignores the possibility that other experience-related factors vary across officers.</p>
<p>Research interest in officer decision making is not likely to wane anytime soon, but as these results indicate our attempts to understand this process may require more complex explanations and data that better reflect the dynamic nature of police–citizen encounters. Moreover, the discussion regarding these interactions frequently includes sweeping references to driver and officer characteristics, as if these groups are monolithic. Our results suggest that future discussion and analyses of traffic stops and other police–citizen encounters reflect the important differences not only between but also within these groups.</p>
