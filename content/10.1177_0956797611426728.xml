<abstract>
<p>Preschools may reduce inequalities in early academic achievement by providing children from disadvantaged families with higher-quality learning environments than they would otherwise receive. In this study, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of more than 600 twin pairs were used to estimate the contributions of genes, the shared environment, and the nonshared environment to cognition and achievement scores in children enrolled versus not enrolled in preschool. Attending preschool at age 4 was associated with reductions in shared environmental influences on reading and math skills at age 5, but was not associated with the magnitude of shared environmental influences on cognition at age 2. These prospective effects were mediated by reductions in achievement gaps associated with minority status, socioeconomic status, and ratings of parental stimulation of cognitive development. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower rates of preschool enrollment, which suggests that the very children who would benefit most from preschools are the least likely to be enrolled in them.</p>

<p>Children’s academic skills at kindergarten entry predict their continued academic success throughout their school years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611426728">Duncan, Dowsett, et al., 2007</xref>). Social inequalities in family-level, school-level, and community-level environments have all been implicated as contributing to disparities in early achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611426728">Duncan, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Klebanov, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611426728">Huston &amp; Bentley, 2010</xref>). It is well established that children from low-income families attend lower quality schools than those attended by children from higher-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611426728">Huston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611426728">Meyers, Rosenbaum, Ruhm, &amp; Waldfogel, 2004</xref>). Yet despite the robust associations between socioeconomic privilege and school quality, some researchers have characterized schools as “equalizers” of social disparities in achievement. Supporting this seemingly paradoxical perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611426728">Downey, von Hippel, and Broh (2004)</xref> reasoned that “some children may have relatively poor school experiences, but the disadvantages in their non-school environments may be even more severe . . . In this way schools can favor advantaged students, yet still serve as equalizers” (pp. 613–614).</p>
<p>This same rationale suggests that early organized child care prior to kindergarten entry (i.e., preschool) may be particularly effective in reducing social disparities in skills at kindergarten entry, specifically by benefiting children being raised in poorer homes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611426728">Barnett (1995)</xref> commented, “the best predictor of the size of [preschool] program effects may be the size of the gap between the program and home as learning environments . . . Thus, effects might be expected to be largest for the most disadvantaged” (p. 43). Indeed, the findings of previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611426728">Bassok, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611426728">Geoffroy et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611426728">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611426728">Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, &amp; Waldfogel, 2004</xref>) indicate that the immediate benefits of center-based care are larger for racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups than for nonminorities and nondisadvantaged groups. For example, using data from more than 12,000 American children, Magnuson and colleagues (2004) reported that the positive associations between enrollment in center-based day care during the year prior to kindergarten and achievement-test scores during kindergarten were stronger for children from impoverished families and children with poorly educated mothers.</p>
<p>Previous studies, however, have been limited in three respects. First, they have not examined whether the relation between preschool enrollment and the magnitude of achievement gaps emerges prospectively or exists in full prior to the preschool years. In order to infer causation rather than selection as the basis for the relation between preschool enrollment and the magnitude of achievement gaps, the relation would have to exist only after the beginning of the preschool years. Second, because previous researchers have used data from only one child per family, they have been unable to estimate the effects of preschool on the total extent of between-family variation. Third, the specific characteristics of families examined have typically been macro-level characteristics, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and race, but not more proximal indices of the home environment, such as cognitive stimulation by parents. On the basis of previous work implicating more proximal learning environments, particularly parenting behaviors, as critical mediators of racial and socioeconomic disparities in achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611426728">Duncan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611426728">Guo &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611426728">Lugo-Gil &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 2008</xref>), one might expect preschool enrollment to diminish the influences of minority status and SES on child development, in part by reducing the influences of more proximal parenting behaviors.</p>
<p>To address these outstanding issues, the current project used longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins nested within families. The twin design was used to separate disparities in achievement associated with the between-family environment from disparities in achievement associated with the unique (within-family) environment and with genes. In addition to estimating the relation between preschool attendance and the total amounts of between-family environmental variation, I also estimated the associations between preschool attendance and the sizes of achievement gaps related to minority status, SES, and parental stimulation of cognitive development. Thus, this project examined the extent to which total between-family variation in achievement was reduced by preschool attendance and the extent to which these reductions could be accounted for by reductions in the associations between both macro-level characteristics of families and a proximal index of parenting. Moreover, by measuring children at ages 2, 4, and 5, I was able to estimate the extent to which the patterns observed were evident prior to preschool enrollment (which would be consistent with a selection but not causation account) or only after preschool enrollment (which would be consistent with a causal account of preschool enrollment in attenuating achievement gaps).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participant data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) twin sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797611426728">Snow et al., 2009</xref>), which was representative of twins born in the United States in 2001. The sample was 61% White; 16% African American; 16% Hispanic; 3% Asian; 1% Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaska Native; and 4% multiracial. Fifty-one percent of the twins were male, and 49% were female; 25% were at or below the poverty line at study entry. The analyses reported here were conducted using data from three waves: age 2 years in 2003 and 2004, age 4 years (preschool age) in 2005 and 2006, and age 5 years (kindergarten age) in 2006. Zygosity diagnoses and preschool information were available for 1,200 twins from 600 families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797611426728">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Zygosity (2 years)</title>
<p>Using the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797611426728">Tucker-Drob, Rhemtulla, Harden, Turkheimer, &amp; Fask (2011)</xref>, I classified zygosity on the basis of physical similarity ratings that had been made by trained observers. Zygosity classifications from physical similarity ratings such as these have been consistently shown to be more than 90% accurate when cross-validated using twins of known zygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611426728">Forget-Dubois et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611426728">Goldsmith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797611426728">Price et al., 2000</xref>). Same-sex pairs who received a dizygotic classification were eliminated from analyses if their parents indicated that there was a medical reason for their dissimilarity. Thirty percent of twins in the final sample were diagnosed as monozygotic, 30% were diagnosed as same-sex dizygotic, and 40% were opposite-sex dizygotic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0956797611426728">
<title>Preschool enrollment (4 years)</title>
<p>When the twins were 4 years old, parents were asked whether each of the twins was enrolled in center-based child care on a regular basis. Parents reported that 15% of twins were enrolled in the federally funded Head Start program, 61% of twins were enrolled in other forms of center-based care, and 26% were not enrolled in any center-based care. A twin was considered enrolled in preschool if he or she was enrolled in any form of center-based care (including Head Start). There were six pairs in which only one of the twins was enrolled in preschool; these pairs were eliminated from analyses. Eliminating children attending Head Start from analyses produced similar results to those reported here.</p>

<sec id="section6-0956797611426728">
<title>Early mental ability (2 years)</title>
<p>At 2 years, ECLS staff individually administered to each twin the Bayley Short Form–Research Edition (BSF-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611426728">Andreassen &amp; Fletcher, 2007</xref>), a shortened form of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611426728">Bayley, 1993</xref>). Item response theory was used to create a mental-ability score, which was based on items tapping the quality of exploration of objects, early problem solving, the production of simple sound and gestures, and receptive and expressive communication with words. The reliability estimate for this score was .88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611426728">Andreassen &amp; Fletcher, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0956797611426728">
<title>Early academic achievement (4 years and 5 years)</title>
<p>During the preschool wave, children’s early math skills (including number sense, counting, operations, patterns, and spatial sense) and reading skills (including letter recognition, letter sounds, phonological awareness, matching words, and receptive vocabulary) were assessed. Separate math and reading scores were derived for each child using item response theory. Reliability estimates for both scores were .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611426728">Najarian, Snow, Lennon, &amp; Kinsey, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797611426728">
<title>Minority status</title>
<p>Minority status was dummy-coded as 1 for White and 0 for non-White. Racial minorities were coded together because there were not enough twin pairs from the different minority groups to confidently estimate effects for each race and ethnicity separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0956797611426728">
<title>SES</title>
<p>SES was indexed from parental reports of paternal and maternal education, paternal and maternal occupation, and family income at the 4-year wave. Each of these five variables was standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 in the complete ECLS-B sample, and then averaged to create the SES composite score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0956797611426728">
<title>Parental stimulation of cognitive development (4 years)</title>
<p>At the preschool wave, each twin separately participated in a 10-min semistructured activity with his or her parent. These interactions were video-recorded, and trained coders rated the interactions on a number of different dimensions using 7-point Likert-type scales. This project focused on ratings of parental stimulation of cognitive development, which is the extent to which the parent taught the child in an effortful, developmentally appropriate manner to enhance cognitive, language, and perceptual development. Interrater reliability of this rating was estimated at greater than 90% for both waves of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611426728">Andreassen &amp; Fletcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611426728">Najarian et al., 2010</xref>). Scores for each twin pair were averaged and then centered at the mean (by subtracting 4.276) to obtain the most reliable index of parental stimulation at the family level.</p>

According to genetic theory, additive genetic variation is correlated at 1.0 for monozygotic twins and at .50 for dizygotic twins.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797611426728">Table 3</xref> presents parameter estimates from the application of Model 1 to mental-ability scores at age 2 and to reading and math scores at ages 4 and 5. First, although the logistic regression analyses reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797611426728">Table 2</xref> indicate that there are, in fact, family and child characteristics that systematically predict the likelihood of preschool attendance, the magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on mental ability at age 2 did not significantly differ by subsequent preschool enrollment status (i.e., the <italic>a</italic>′, <italic>c</italic>′, and <italic>e</italic>′ coefficients were not significantly different from zero). The shared environment accounted for 58% of the variance in BSF-R scores among 2-year-olds who were not enrolled in preschool at age 4, as compared with 60% among twins who were enrolled in preschool at the same age. That a Shared Environment × Preschool interaction does not occur when cognition is measured prior to the preschool years suggests that later Shared Environment × Preschool interactions are not simply manifestations of preexisting interactions.</p>

<p>Second, at 4 years, shared environmental influences on math and reading scores began to differ by preschool attendance, although these differences were not statistically significant for reading and only marginally significant for math. For math scores, the shared environment accounted for 74% of the variance among children who did not attend preschool at age 4 and 55% of the variance among children who attended preschool at age 4. For reading scores, these proportions were 82% and 63%, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, by 5 years, shared environmental influences on math and reading scores differed sharply between children who attended preschool at age 4 and those who did not. The shared environment accounted for 72% of the variance in math scores at age 5 among children who were not enrolled in preschool versus 47% of the variance among those who were enrolled the previous year. For reading scores, these proportions were 73% and 43%, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611426728">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this pattern by showing the unstandardized variance in math and reading scores accounted for by the shared environment at ages 4 and 5 by preschool enrollment. The magnitude of shared environmental influence on these two outcomes began to differ at age 4, with the difference growing substantially over the 1-year interval. By age 5, family-level influences on achievement were substantially lower for children who had attended preschool during the previous year.</p>

<p>The Shared Environment × Preschool interaction is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797611426728">Figure 2</xref>, which plots math and reading scores at age 5 as a function of latent shared-environment factor scores and preschool enrollment. The relation between scores on the latent shared-environment factor and achievement scores is steeper for children who had not attended preschool than for those who had. For very low scores on the shared environment (1.5 standard deviations below the mean), children who had been enrolled in preschool scored approximately 0.8 points better in math and 0.9 points better in reading than those who had not been enrolled in preschool. For very high scores on the shared environment (1.5 standard deviations above the mean), there was no appreciable achievement disparity between children who had attended preschool and those who had not. In the next set of analyses, I sought to clarify these results by examining measured rather than latent characteristics of families.</p>

<p>Finally, the <italic>c</italic>′ parameter represents the extent to which the remaining shared environmental influences (i.e., unmeasured family-level variation unaccounted for by the measured covariates) are lower for children who had attended preschool at age 4. In all cases, this parameter was attenuated relative to its corresponding estimate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797611426728">Table 3</xref>, which indicates that the interactions between the measured covariates and preschool accounted for some of the Shared Environment × Preschool interactions. When measured covariates were not included in the model, the <italic>c</italic>′ coefficient was −0.256 for math scores at age 5 and −0.278 for reading scores at age 5. For models that included minority status, SES, and parental stimulation, these estimates were −0.142, −0.152, and −0.203, respectively, for math scores at age 5, and −0.189, −0.152, and −0.224, respectively, for reading scores at age 5.</p>
<p>The interactions between preschool and minority status, SES, and parental stimulation of cognitive development are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797611426728">Figure 3</xref>. Each panel in the figure plots the model-implied average achievement-test scores at age 5 for children who had been enrolled in preschool at age 4 and those who had not, stratified by different levels of the measured covariate. For both math and reading scores, preschool provided greater benefits for children who were non-White, from a lower-SES family, and raised by a parent rated as less cognitively stimulating. In other words, differences in early math and reading scores associated with race, SES, and parental stimulation are reduced among children who attended preschool.</p>

<title>Stepwise analyses</title>
<p>A stepwise approach was used in the final set of analyses to sequentially add minority status, SES, and parental stimulation to the models of reading and math at 5 years. Details on these analyses and their results are described in the Supplemental Material available online. In summary, when all three interactions were included in a simultaneous model, none of the interactions was individually significant. This indicates that the interaction effects largely represent an overlapping set of family-level influences that are together attenuated by preschool enrollment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major finding reported in this article is that preschool enrollment at age 4 was prospectively associated with substantially reduced family-level influences on early reading and math skills at age 5. Among children who attended preschool at age 4, shared environmental influences accounted for 47% of the variance in math scores and 43% of the variance in reading scores at age 5. In contrast, among children who did not attend preschool at age 4, shared environmental influences accounted for 72% of the variance in math scores and 73% of the variance in reading scores at age 5. The magnitude of shared environmental influences on cognitive test scores at age 2 did not differ by subsequent preschool enrollment, which suggests that the interaction effects observed at age 5 were not simply manifestations of preexisting interactions.</p>
<p>Preschool attendance was prospectively associated with enhanced reading and math skills, particularly for racial and ethnic minorities, children from lower-SES families, and children whose parents were rated as less cognitively stimulating. It was primarily the overlapping effect of minority status, SES, and parental stimulation that was attenuated by preschool enrollment. Moreover, SES significantly predicted the likelihood of being enrolled in preschool, a fact suggesting that the very children who would benefit most from preschools are those who are least likely to be enrolled in preschools. Therefore, differences in the rate of preschool enrollment across families may actually serve to perpetuate achievement disparities at the population level.</p>
<p>Previous research on the role of early child care in equalizing between-family disparities in academic achievement has used designs with only one child per family. As a result, these studies were able to examine only whether preschool enrollment attenuates the impact of specific, measured family characteristics. In contrast, the current study used twin data, which allowed estimates of the total effect of family-level influences on achievement to be made. The method applied relies on the standard assumptions of the twin approach. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611426728">Loehlin, Harden, and Turkheimer (2009)</xref> have demonstrated that interaction-effect estimates in twin models are far less influenced by violations of standard assumptions than are main-effect estimates. Because the current study was primarily concerned with interaction effects (specifically, the Shared Environment × Preschool interaction), the current findings can be considered robust.</p>
<p>Because data were available from multiple waves, including a wave preceding preschool enrollment, the current study was able to test whether there were preexisting differences in the magnitude of shared environmental influences associated with later preschool status. The absence of such preexisting differences strengthens the inference that the observed interaction effects were indeed caused by preschool attendance. In theory, an even stronger causal inference could be made using a randomized experiment, such as a lottery for preschool vouchers, combined with methods to examine treatment-effect heterogeneity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797611426728">Tucker-Drob, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this study was unique in examining multiple measured family-level covariates as modifiers of preschool effects, a limitation is that specific characteristics of preschools were not examined. One might expect that the greatest preschool boost would occur for the few disadvantaged children who are fortunate enough to attend high-quality preschools. Previous work has shown that several indices of child-care quality, including live observer ratings of preschool teachers’ sensitivity, responsivity, and stimulation of cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611426728">Dearing, McCartney, &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>), are specifically associated with reduced achievement gaps. Other factors associated with reduced achievement gaps at school entry include earlier age of enrollment in child care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611426728">Caughy, DiPietro, &amp; Strobino, 1994</xref>), being in a full-time rather than a part-time program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611426728">Geoffroy et al., 2007</xref>), being in a formal center-based program rather than an informal program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611426728">Geoffroy et al., 2010</xref>), and being exposed to more school-transition practices, such as preschoolers spending time in the kindergarten classroom and teachers visiting the home at the beginning of the kindergarten school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797611426728">Schulting, Malone, &amp; Dodge, 2005</xref>). Future longitudinal studies should chart the achievement gap prior to and following preschool enrollment. Although empirical research on school and home quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611426728">Dowsett, Huston, Imes, &amp; Gennetian, 2008</xref>) has found that preschools “offer more opportunities for cognitive and intellectual development than do the home-based settings . . . that are typically used by low-income parents” (p. 90), it is possible that the preschool-associated gap reductions found in the study reported here were primarily driven by those preschools meeting a minimum threshold of quality.</p>
<p>Finally, although this study examined (and detected) effects of preschool on achievement gaps in academic achievement in kindergarten, it is unknown whether gap reductions would be maintained into later childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The vast majority of previous experimental and quasiexperimental studies have reported large immediate benefits of preschools on impoverished children’s achievement, but only a select subset (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611426728">Campbell, Ramey, Pungello, Sparling, &amp; Miller-Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797611426728">Schweinhart et al., 2005</xref>) have found the effects to persist in the long term. Many other studies have found that the effects fade out over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611426728">Currie &amp; Thomas, 1995</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611426728">Leak et al., 2010</xref> for a meta-analysis). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611426728">Barnett (1995)</xref> speculated that differences in quality and funding across programs may help to account for differences in long-term effects. It is also likely that inequalities in children’s experiences following preschool serve to wash out early gains and that maintenance of gains among low-income children would generally require amelioration of inequalities that exist during the elementary school, middle school, and high school years. Notwithstanding this latter issue, economic analyses have indicated that there are long-term monetary benefits of investing in preschool programs for impoverished children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611426728">Barnett, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611426728">Duncan, Ludwig, &amp; Magnusson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611426728">Heckman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results reported here suggest that preschool attendance may help to reduce achievement gaps associated with multiple measured and unmeasured family-level variables. However, because lower-SES families are less likely to send their children to preschool, the equalizing effects of preschools at the population level may not be fully realized. It remains unclear what specific aspects of preschools are responsible for these effects or whether the immediate benefits of preschools for reducing achievement gaps would persist in the long term.</p>
