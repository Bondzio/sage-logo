    <p>Examining caste, the most coercive and asymmetrical feature of Indian society, from a Dalit
      lens has offered us some of the most nuanced and dense studies in the recent past. In the
      history of modern India, what Bengal has signified for gender, Maharashtra has meant for
      caste, each providing much of the theoretical constructs, and one needs to ask if a Rammohan
      Roy there and a Bhimrao Ambedkar here played a critical role in this. Rao’s incredible text
      too relies on moments, events and individuals in the history of Maharashtra between the 1880s
      and the 1990s, intricately weaving history and anthropology to highlight how we can ‘rethink
      India’s political modernity from the perspective of the Dalits’ (p. xii). Temptingly,
        <italic>The Caste Question</italic> challenges the association of subalterns, here
      specifically Dalits, with non-modernity, tradition, ‘pasts’ and community. Instead, it places
      them squarely within the paradigm of India’s democracy and secular modernity, with anti-caste
      radicals constantly negotiating with the state, and in the process, transforming conceptions
      of nation, citizenship and political rights (p. 11). Going a step further, breaking from any
      ‘provincialisation’ of caste, Rao not only sees radical anti-caste thought as offering a
      critique of colonial and nationalist frames, but also locates it within a global history of
      political thought.</p>
    <p>The recent upsurge of works on Dalit life testimonies and autobiographies stress how
      narratives of pain and suffering are often their cultural capital. However, for Rao, it is not
      so much experiences of pain that undergird resistance, but rather those of quotidian and
      routine caste violence, through which stigma is carried in, on and through the Dalit body, and
      becomes a constant source of humiliation. The book is methodologically divided between the
      historical and the ethnographic, with social and intellectual history in Part 1, and legal
      case studies and analysis of violence in the second. Through fragmented histories, it maps
      attempts at <italic>becoming</italic> Dalits, whereby a ‘negative description’ was converted
      into a ‘confrontational identity’ (p. 1) and a ‘positive political value’ (p. 2). The three
      chapters in the first section, aptly called ‘Emancipation’, focus much more on the colonial
      moment, and tell us how Dalits offered public-political critiques of their stigmatised
      existence and launched struggles for rights and social recognition from the late nineteenth
      century to the period of constitutional law making between 1947 and 1950.</p>
    <p>In line with the landmark works of Eleanor Zelliot, Rosalind O’Hanlon and Gail Omvedt, the
      first chapter focuses on Satyashodhak Samaj and the writings of Jotiba Phule (1827–90), Gopal
      Bana Valangkar (?–1900) and Shivram Janbe Kamble (1875–1942). Rao shows how the dynamic growth
      of print facilitated and nurtured the rise of a distinctive Marathi non-Brahmin and Dalit
      political counter cultural and public sphere. Broadening other works, Rao argues that Phule’s
      writings against Brahmanism utilised forms of speech and rhetorical styles associated with the
      rustic language of peasants, but infused them with demands for human rights and social
      equality that bore the influence of non-conformist Christianity, thus endowing elements of
      popular culture with a unique discourse of caste radicalism (p. 39). I think that this is the
      most powerful chapter of the book as it goes on to underscore the contradictory effects of
      social reform of gender by caste radicals. Rao documents how Satyashodhak activists evolved a
      new gendered language to contest their marginalisation. On the one hand, they ridiculed the
      upper castes for the treatment meted out to widows, and on the other, Satyashodhak marriages
      eliminated the need for a Brahmin priest and emphasised self-respect and equality within
      marriage. But, argues Rao, though caste radicals were preoccupied with challenging caste
      ideology by rethinking marriage, they were by no means immune to the extension of novel
      patriarchal practices into their own households. Thus, they also tried to modify Dalit
      intimate relationships and enhance the authority of male Dalit reformers by regulating
      sexuality. This illuminates the complex and contingent processes by which a powerful critique
      of the association of gender, caste and Hindu religion could co-exist with a commitment to
      ‘gender reform’ which, Rao notes, essentially set the stage for a Dalit public sphere rendered
      male (p. 54).</p>
    <p>Rao moves in the next chapter to Dalit claims to the Chavdar water tank as public property
      and to the temple door, where there was a simultaneous politicisation and privatisation of
      spaces. Water and temple entry <italic>satyagraha</italic>s exposed contradictions between
      nationalist and Dalit conceptions of rights. Dalit demands for social inclusion, couched in
      terms of civic rights and natural justice, were recast by courts as claims upon private
      property. Rao argues that the moral hegemony of nationalism not only rendered invisible the
      structural violence of the caste system, but also often delegitimised even symbolic forms of
      resistance by the Dalits. No book on Dalits would be complete without underlining the
      remarkable theoretical contributions and the practical political actions of B.R. Ambedkar. Rao
      shows in the next chapter how Ambedkar played absolutely the central role in imagining the
      Indian citizen as a political subject (p. 122), and how that helped in shaping and
      articulating a new and distinct Dalit identity, organised around rights claims. Ambedkar
      especially sought to convert the structural negativity of the Dalit into positive political
      value, a process that Rao terms <italic>vernacularisation of political
      universals.</italic></p>
    <p>The second half of the book opens up the paradox of being a Dalit, where emancipation and
      empowerment has incongruously also left them more vulnerable. It offers an engaging assessment
      of new forms of violence by bringing out the organisational shape of Dalit politics and
      changing structures of Dalit life in Maharashtra over the last 40 years. Rao argues that the
      postcolonial Indian state faced the challenge of transforming Dalits from ‘stigmatised
      subjects’ into ‘citizens’. This entailed a redefinition of ‘untouchability’ from a form of
      social–religious experience to a form of vulnerability that necessitated the formation of
      special laws to protect Dalits against violence from non-Dalits. She begins, therefore, with a
      theoretical inquiry into the connections between caste, social recognition, law and protected
      minorities. Rao then moves on to the new directions of Dalit life and cultural politics in
      Maharashtra in the 1970s. The new configurations between anti-Dalit political violence and
      Dalit countercultural forms, for example, in the 1974 Bombay riots between Dalit Panthers and
      Shiv Sena, codified political and sectarian differences. The chapter has a fascinating section
      on a symbolically charged struggle to rename (<italic>namantar</italic>) Marathwada University
      after Ambedkar in 1977, which signified real and virtual control over space.</p>
    <p>The last two chapters of this phenomenal book centre on the connections between violence,
      intimacy, sociality and politics. Chapter 6 on the sexual politics of caste reads like a
      thriller of ‘violent’ proportions, interspersed with the daily diary of the narrator, legal
      records, testimonies and press reportage. As an investigating anthropologist, Rao explores the
      intersections of local, caste and family relations with the legal apparatus through the
      well-known 1963 case, in which four Dalit women were dragged out of their home, stripped and
      paraded naked by the village residents of Sirasgoan, in Aurangabad district. Leaving one
      deeply disturbed, it chillingly marks how caste power is gendered. Continuing this trajectory,
      the last one is on the policing, legal action and publicity surrounding the 1991 killing of
      Ambadas Sawane, a Dalit <italic>kotwal</italic> (village level police officer) on the steps of
      a Hanuman temple in Parbhani district, Maharashtra, which again vividly brings out the
      relationship between Dalit bodies, violence and politics.</p>
    <p><italic>The Caste Question</italic> represents a political history that weaves in the
      intimate. In the process, the book appears to often stress collective rights and emancipation
      rather than individual autonomy and freedom, at times marginalising the efforts that have been
      made, particularly by the Dalit woman, at personal-private assertion, which may at times
      challenge collective identities. While very dense, the one troubling question that I have
      about this book is its language. Do we evolve a particular language in which we articulate
      Dalit political rights? What are its links to terminologies and aesthetics of Dalit writings?
      At places the book appears to be cultivating a new language, which nonetheless is at times
      obscure and impenetrable.</p>
    <p>It is in the theorisation of violence, not just as ethnic conflict, terrorism or communalism,
      but as anti-Dalit structural violence, and its links to local and national public spaces, and
      through it to the state, that the book derives its sharpest edge. Violence, according to Rao,
      became the hinge that articulated the spheres of production and reproduction of the Dalit body
      (p. 216). The use of visuals in the book is engaging. All in all, this is a far-reaching work,
      which will be constantly referred to by scholars of various hues for a very long time to
      come.</p>
