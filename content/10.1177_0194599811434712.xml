<p><italic>Objective</italic>. No study has done a comparative analysis of radiologic imaging findings between primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma (PNL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The purpose of this study was to analyze computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images and to evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT between PNL and NPC, knowing the imaging features that distinguish PNL from NPC.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Cross-sectional study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. University tertiary care facility.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. The authors analyzed the features on CT, MR imaging, and PET/CT of 16 patients diagnosed with PNL and 32 patients diagnosed with NPC histopathologically.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Patients with PNL had a larger tumor volume and showed symmetry of tumor shape than did patients with NPC. Patients with PNL also had higher tumor homogeneity than NPC patients on CT, T2-weighted, and postcontrast MR images. All PNL patients showed a high degree of enhancement without invasion to the adjacent deep structure. The involvement of the Waldeyer ring was significantly higher in PNL patients. Cervical and retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy and PET/CT SUV max showed no significant difference between PNL and NPC.</p>

<p>Most non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the head and neck region develops in the extranodal lymphatic system of the Waldeyer ring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434712">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434712">2</xref></sup> Within the Waldeyer ring, the nasopharynx is the second most common site of disease after the tonsil. In those patients with multiple sites of tumor in the Waldeyer ring, the diagnosis on imaging is usually straightforward. The difficulty arises in those patients who present with primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma (PNL).</p>
<p>Primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma has been defined on the basis that patients present with symptoms of a nasopharyngeal tumor, and the tumor is centered with its greatest bulk in the nasopharynx, as assessed by endoscopy and imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434712">3</xref></sup> Primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma is much less common, occurring in only 8% of all NHL of the head and neck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434712">2</xref></sup> and clinically is more likely to be diagnosed as an undifferentiated or squamous cell nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Comparative image analysis of PNL and NPC can be helpful in differential diagnosis and is important clinically because they require completely different treatment regimens. Previous reports of imaging NHL have described tumors in the Waldeyer ring in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811434712">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434712">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images and to evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT between PNL and NPC, knowing the imaging features that distinguish PNL from NPC.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the medical records and imaging findings of 16 patients diagnosed with PNL and 32 patients diagnosed with NPC histopathologically between January 1999 and January 2009 at Pusan National University Hospital.</p>
<p>Patients diagnosed with PNL were aged 8 to 68 years, with a mean age of 42.4 years (10 males, 6 females). Patients diagnosed with NPC were aged 23 to 79 years, with a mean age of 50.7 years (21 males, 11 females).</p>
<p>The immunophenotypes of PNL included diffuse large B cell (10 cases), natural killer (NK)/T cell (4 cases), follicular B cell (1 case), and peripheral T cell (1 case). Among patients diagnosed with NPC by histopathologic examination, 8 cases were keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 6 cases were nonkeratinizing SCC, and 18 cases were undifferentiated carcinoma. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National University School of Medicine.</p>

<sec id="section3-0194599811434712">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The CT (n = 12), MR (n = 11), and PET/CT (n = 5) images of 16 patients with PNL and the CT (n = 20), MR (n = 25), and PET/CT (n = 21) images of 32 patients with NPC were available for evaluation. Seven patients with PNL and 13 patients with NPC underwent both enhanced CT and MR examination. Direct CT examinations were performed on either of the 2 scanners after injection of contrast material: SOMATOM Definition Dual Source 64 (Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) or SOMATOM Definition AS+128 (Siemens). Their parameters were as follows: field of view (FOV) 200 × 200, KVp 120, mAs 120, and slice thickness 2 mm. All patients received a total of 120 mL of nonionic contrast agent (iopromide, Ultravist 300; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) through an 18- or 20-gauge angiographic catheter inserted into a forearm vein, using an automated injector at 2.5 to 3.0 mL/s. Single-phase contrast-enhanced scans were obtained with a scanning delay of 75 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed using the 3T MR scanner (Magnetom Tim Trio; Siemens). Magnetic resonance imaging parameters were as follows: for T2 coronal and axial images, TR = 5462 to 5500 ms, TE = 92 ms, FOV = 190 × 210 for the coronal image and 199 × 220 for the axial image, slice thickness = 4 mm, NEX = 3 for the coronal image and 2 for the axial image, and phase/frequency encoding steps = 384 × 244. For T1 axial images, TR = 591 to 600 ms, TE = 9.4 ms, FOV = 199 × 220, slice thickness = 4 mm, NEX = 1, and phase/frequency encoding steps = 384 × 244. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed in 12 patients with PNL and 24 patients with NPC using an echo-planar sequence. The imaging parameters were as follows: an FOV of 230 × 230 mm, 128 phase-encoding steps, a section thickness of 5 mm, a gap of 0.1 mm, and an acquisition matrix of 192 × 192. The diffusion sensitizing gradient was oriented at the 3 axes with b values of 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was obtained simultaneously with custom software. Contrast-enhanced axial and coronal images were obtained with 2 mmol/kg gadolinium (Magrevist; Bayer Schering Pharma). Postcontrast axial images were obtained with the same parameters as the precontrast T1-weighted (T1WI) image plus fat suppression. Postcontrast coronal images were obtained with the following parameters: TR = 600 ms, TE = 10 ms, FOV = 190 × 210 mm, slice thickness = 4 mm, phase/frequency encoding steps = 320 × 203, NEX = 2, and fat suppression. Positron emission tomography CT imaging was performed without iodinated contrast using a Gemini PET/CT scanner (Philips, Milpitas, California). Patients were instructed to fast for 6 hours, and blood glucose was measured to ensure a level lower than 11 mmol/L prior to injection of 370 to 444 MBq18F-FDG. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–PET/CT acquisition protocol included an initial CT (140 Kv, 80 mA, 2 slices helical, 0.5 seconds per rotation, pitch 6:1, slice thickness 5 mm), followed by FDG-PET acquisition in 2-dimensional mode for 4 minutes per field of view.</p>
<p>An experienced head and neck radiologist with 20 years’ experience in imaging the head and neck and 2 otolaryngologists with 10 and 25 years’ experience in the field of rhinology reviewed all images retrospectively by consensus. Images were assessed for tumor volume, symmetry, homogeneity, degree of enhancement, invasion to the adjacent structures, Waldeyer ring involvement, retropharyngeal and cervical lymphadenopathy, and PET/CT SUV max. Tumor volume was measured by region-of-interest (ROI) measurement in the PACS (picture-archiving communications system) program. It was calculated by multiplying the axial cross-sectional area by the interval of the slice (mm) and the number of every slice showing mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811434712"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Tumor symmetry was classified as asymmetric or symmetric. If the volume of one side was within 10% of the other side, the tumor was considered symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811434712"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Tumor homogeneity was classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous on CT and MR images, respectively. If tumor density or signal intensity was within 10% of median values on 90% of voxels within the tumor, the lesion was considered homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811434712"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The ADC value was obtained in the ADC map images with the manual drawing of ROI. At least 3 consecutive slices of the ADC map images were selected and the whole area of the lesion was included in the assessment of the ADC value, and mean ADC values were tabulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811434712"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Degree of enhancement was divided into 3 groups of high, intermediate, and low. <italic>High</italic> was defined as the degree of enhancement that was the same or higher than the nasal mucosa. <italic>Low</italic> was defined as the degree of enhancement that was the same or lower than the adjacent muscles. <italic>Intermediate</italic> was defined as the degree of enhancement that was between the nasal mucosa and adjacent muscles. Waldeyer ring involvement was defined as the involvement of other sites in the Waldeyer ring such as the palatine and lingual tonsils.</p>

<title>Tumor Volume and Symmetry</title>
<p>Compared with NPC, PNL showed a large exophytic mass that occupied most of the nasopharyngeal airway. Primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma ranged in volume from 0.97 to 8.64 × 10<sup>4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup> (3.19 ± 2.14 × 10<sup>4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>), and NPC ranged from 0.24 to 5.99 × 10<sup>4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup> (1.45 ± 1.46 × 10<sup>4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>). There was a significant difference in tumor volume between PNL and NPC (<italic>P</italic> = .035) that did not reach statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. In tumor symmetry, 11 of 16 (68.8%) PNL cases showed symmetry of tumor, although none of the NPC cases showed symmetry of tumor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811434712"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Tumor Homogeneity</title>
<p>Because all MR images in both PNL and NPC revealed intermediately hypointense signal intensity on T1-weighted (T1WI) and intermediately hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted (T2WI) images, we analyzed tumor homogeneity to know whether the tumor was homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Although retropharyngeal and cervical lymphadenopathy was high in PNL, there was no significant difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811434712"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>PET/CT SUV Max</title>
<p>The PET-CT SUV max ranged from 7.2 to 10.8 (8.5 ± 1.6) in PNL and from 2.2 to 25.0 (7.9 ± 5.5) in NPC. There was no significant difference in PET/CT SUV max between PNL and NPC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811434712"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nasopharyngeal masses are difficult to diagnose because of their deep location and silent growth. Initially, they may present with nonspecific symptoms such as chronic rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction that are commonly encountered in daily practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434712">1</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal masses includes NPC, adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma, metastases, and PNL. In these cases, the principal differential diagnosis is between NPC and PNL.</p>
<p>In general, NHL of the nasopharynx has been reported as a homogeneous tumor that tends to diffusely involve all walls of the nasopharynx and spreads in an exophytic fashion to fill the airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434712">3</xref></sup> In contrast, NPC has a propensity to invade deeply and to spread superiorly into the skull base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434712">6</xref></sup> Although the definite distinction between PNL and NPC is very difficult without histopathologic examination, characteristic imaging features can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal tumors. As for diagnostic procedures, imaging studies such as CT and MR imaging are crucial not only to provide clues to the diagnosis but also to demonstrate the extent of the disease. However, no study has done a comparative analysis of the radiologic imaging findings between PNL and NPC.</p>
<p>In this study, PNL had a larger tumor volume than NPC, and PNL showed a larger exophytic mass that occupied most of the nasopharyngeal airway. With regard to tumor shape, 68.8% of the PNL cases showed symmetry, but none of the NPC cases showed symmetry.</p>
<p>A previous study reported that PNL shows a sharp- margined homogeneous tumor with moderate signal intensity on both T1WI and T2WI, and NPC shows unsharp-margined inhomogeneous necrotic tumor with same signal intensity as PNL on both T1WI and T2WI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811434712">7</xref></sup> In diffusion-weighted MR imaging results for the 3-nodal cancer, the ADC value for lymphoma was less than that for NPC and SCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811434712">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study showed that PNL had a higher tumor homogeneity than NPC on both CT and MR images, especially T2WI and postcontrast images. Also, PNL showed lower ADC values and a marked higher degree of enhancement than NPC. However, deep tumor invasion into the adjacent structure bordering the nasopharynx was not present in all patients with PNL. In contrast, NPC invaded the adjacent deep structure, such as the sphenoid sinus, the clivus, the cavernous sinus, the petrous bone, and the sella turcica. Therefore, a highly enhanced homogeneous tumor without invasion of adjacent deep structures may suggest PNL rather than NPC.</p>
<p>In this study, the involvement of the Waldeyer ring was significantly higher in PNL than in NPC. Primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma more frequently extended superficially along the pharyngeal wall to involve the palatine tonsil, which is the most frequently involved site of tumor spread in patients presenting with PNL.</p>
<p>Nodal involvement has been found at presentation or during the course of disease in half of all patients with extranodal NHL of the head and neck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811434712">9</xref></sup> However, cervical and retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy was common in both PNL and NPC patients in this study. The PET/CT SUV max showed no significant difference between PNL and NPC. Therefore, lymphadenopathy and PET/CT SUV max were of no significant value in making this distinction because they were common features in both diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, this study showed that tumor symmetry, tumor homogeneity on T2WI and postcontrast MR images, low ADC values, high degree of enhancement, and Waldeyer ring involvement were the most important criteria to distinguish PNL from NPC.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the clinical features make it difficult to distinguish PNL from NPC, if the images present a bulky symmetric nasopharyngeal mass with marked homogeneity, low ADC values, a high degree of enhancement especially on T2WI and postcontrast MR images, and high Waldeyer ring involvement combined with no invasion into the deep structures, PNL should be considered over NPC.</p>
