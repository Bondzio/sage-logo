<p>With the development of technology and globalization, different modes are widely used in representation and communication. Multimodal production has resulted in new environments for meaning and knowledge-making. To deal with the situation, Kress presents in this book a new social semiotic framework for thinking about multimodal representation and production in contemporary discourse.</p>
<p>Kress starts with an introduction to the joint use of multiple modes in communication (Chapter 1). To Kress, modes are the result of a social and historical shaping of materials for representation. He argues that signs are motivated conjunctions of form and meaning based on the interest of the sign-maker, using culturally available resources.</p>
<p>The book is characterized by five features. First, it addresses the importance of knowing the dominant features of the world for a social-semiotic theory of multimodal discourse. Kress discusses the social environment of contemporary communication and sets out some of the social, economic and political reasons for the emergence of design as the central term in semiotic production (Chapter 2). He regards communication as joint and reciprocal semiotic work and as a complex interaction (Chapter 3). In Kress’s words, communication involves two stages. The first stage is dominated by the interest of the initial maker of the sign-complex and the second stage focuses on the interest and attention of an interpreter.</p>
<p>Second, the book proposes the framework of a social-semiotic theory of multimodality (Chapter 4). The fundamental assumption is that signs are always newly made in social interaction and are thus motivated. Kress declines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">De Saussure’s (1959)</xref> idea of the arbitrary relation of signifier and signified and advocates the replacement of arbitrariness by motivation.</p>
<p>Third, the notions of mode and naming are important in the theory. To Kress, what counts as mode depends on a community’s representational needs, and the capacity to represent ideational meaning, interpersonal meaning and textual meaning (Chapter 5). Kress also sets out names for some central concerns, and argues that names are needed to describe the functions and purposes of multimodality and the processes and features of all modes (Chapter 6).</p>
<p>Fourth, Kress pays special attention to design, arrangements, frames and orchestration of meanings. Kress’s analysis shows that design has become a major factor in the shaping of social relations, and their semiotic realization and arrangements are the semiotic face of social organization (Chapter 7). Texts are seen as complexes of signs in terms of arrangements and movement, but framed by power, metaphor and so on. Kress also looks at multimodal orchestration and ensembles of meaning and takes aesthetics as the politics of style, style as the politics of choice and ethics as the politics of evaluation (Chapter 8).</p>
<p>Lastly, Kress illustrates the application of the theory to learning (Chapter 9) and the analysis of convergent mobile devices (Chapter 10). He regards teaching and learning as instances of communication. The sign which the child has made can indicate his/her stance in the world. Kress also gives an analysis of Nokia N95 in terms of its design, affordances, software and main functionalities.</p>
<p>All the chapters in this book centre round the proposed social semiotic theory of multimodality. They enable us to realize that new social and semiotic conditions have led to the rearrangement of power relations, and influenced conceptions of learning, knowledge and the formation of identity and subjectivity. We need to bring all modes of representation and all areas of meaning within one theoretical and practical frame. Theoretically, what is unique in the book is that it highlights the interests of the sign-maker, the process of meaning-making in a social environment, the semiotic resources available and their respective potentials as signifiers. As the use of modes is related to the ideological and ontological organizations of a society, the book looks at meaning as a whole and examines how meaning is handled modally across different modes. This implies that it is not plausible to restrict notions of effective communication to the mode of language alone and that semiotic action is becoming selection-driven. So this will motivate us to reconsider both the role of language in communication and our existing theories about language.</p>
<p>A wide range of modes are covered, including images, gestures, facial expressions, speech, writing and music. Key concepts and new terms in the theory are introduced to deal with the present semiotic situation and many of the ideas are supported by examples and personal experiences, which help readers to understand the theory more easily and utilize the theory as a tool of describing and analysing practices and principles of multimodal text-making.</p>
<p>The book does not stop at the theoretical level, in that it has two chapters which apply the theory to learning and mobile devices. However, it lacks an analysis of the interaction and integration of different modes to construct meaning in a multimodal text. Readers would benefit from a demonstration of how to analyse a multimodal text.</p>
<p>The theory of social semiotics presented in this book can bring real benefits in understanding apt forms of communication and it opens the route to a clearer view of evaluation in different modes. The book has provided categories that can be used to describe forms and meanings appropriate to the specificities of a given mode and deal with issues common to all modes and their relations. This book will be useful to faculty and students in the disciplines of semiotics, communication, discourse analysis and language teaching, and to anyone who is eager to know why and how different modes are jointly used to construct meaning in discourse.</p>
