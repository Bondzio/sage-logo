<p>This issue of <italic>Business Information Review</italic> (BIR) includes views on increasing value from information investments; threats to information supply; clues for information professionals on dealing with information obesity; the prospect of a transformation – indeed a revolution – in the way we use information through its miniaturization; and examples of the motivators that influence the career paths of business information professionals. <italic>Initiatives</italic> features the importance of social media as an information resource; big data and the opportunities for information professionals in the intelligence arena; UK and EU moves towards open data and towards open access publishing of academic research; the dynamism and competition in the content market place both for news and research resources; and the importance of new search technologies. Social media content is also not to be ignored as a resource for information professional development.</p>
<p>One quote from the promotional material featured in <italic>Information World Review</italic> for the 2011 UK Online conference has stayed in our minds:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Information Management isn’t a back office function anymore; it’s an essential part of the successful delivery of front line services.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Alexis Castillo-Soto of the UK’s Department for Education went on to say ‘Selling that concept isn’t easy and only an innovative service will convince the sceptics’. Castillo-Soto was previewing his session on enhancing the business environment with personal technology – but the quotation can be easily repositioned in the world of external information supply in the business environment. It prompts the question ‘What is the core mission of an external information specialist in today’s world?’ <italic>BIR</italic> identifies four important strands of this mission:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>To stimulate innovation;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To increase the productivity of knowledge workers – now the majority of the workforce;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To enable organizations to take soundly-based decisions that reflect the direction of their current and potential external environment and take advantage of their own knowledge and experience – this includes the opportunities in business intelligence;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>And, of course, to operate cost effectively.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Each of these strands provides a route for business information professionals to deliver best value to their organizations from investments in business information personnel and content.</p>
<sec id="section1-0266382112460942">
<title>Improving the value of content investment for specific business processes</title>
<p>Examples of good business information practice often demonstrate three features:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Focusing on realistic investment in external information, ensuring that only essential content is purchased, and that access to this content is directed at those who need it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Establishing services that deliver content directly into the work processes of the organization.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Identifying just where the business is experiencing pain from poor information provision.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The first article of this issue contains a case study from Merck Serono that exemplifies all these features.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical research and development is a long and expensive business. From the synthesis and identification of 50,000 potential candidates for new medicines, just one is likely to emerge as a marketable candidate after years of testing. The decisions to take a candidate into the late stages of testing – the clinical trials in patients – and then to plan to market the medicine – and where to sell it are the most important ones that a company makes. The knowledge base on which these decisions are made must be accurate, current, objective and credible. It needs to embrace both published and internal information.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to optimize the use of external information investment in content sources and in commissioned information capture and analysis, Denise Carter of the Merck Serono Business Intelligence team identified opportunities to improve the robustness of data on the prevalence of a disease in different countries – a core strand of information for portfolio development decisions.</p>
<p>The development of databases blending commercially available information with internal knowledge and including a validation tool to differentiate the reliability of specific sources have transformed the objectivity of the forecasting process, raising the profile and the value of the impact of the information professional. The unit has also developed a Market Attractiveness Platform, working with business colleagues to develop an online resource that consolidates data on the key parameters that contribute to assessment of market attractiveness. This has required using a wide range of external sources as well as internal knowledge in a structured and consistent way. The initiative assembles data, usually looked at only by individual country, in a centralized and organized format allowing comparison and ranking of countries. The results? Real budget savings, increases in the use of purchased content, reduction in the repetition of analyses, improved corporate memory – and business sponsors for these activities. An example of effective information sourcing and analysis playing a real part in the development of the biopharma business and creating supportive stakeholders for the knowledge analytics function.</p>
<p>Stimulating innovation, increased productivity, enabling decision-making and providing value for money are themes not just for business information specialists but for content and technology providers. Competition for market share is intense; delivering services that can be embedded in work flows is a key opportunity for product differentiation. Developing services that integrate with the work processes of ‘user practitioners’, specifically procurement and sales and market specialists, was addressed two years ago in <italic>Business Information Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266382112460942">Green, 2010</xref>). In this issue, Liz Blankson-Hemans considers the importance of citation analysis in workflow tools for lawyers. Such tools are aimed at enhancing lawyer productivity through improving document drafting and review. Much of a lawyer’s work is based on precedent; these precedents, often decided in court cases or laid down in legislation, are frequently referenced in legal writing to support points of law being made in the documents or agreements. Being able to check references for accuracy and also reliability (has the citation been superseded by later judgements?) reduces the risk of using old material and improves cost efficiency of the work process, important for the client as well as the firm.</p>
<p>Blankson-Hemans provides an overview of the citation tools currently available, the essential features needed, and current products. LexisCheck, JustCite, BriefTools/WestCheck/KeyCite are highlighted as tools that will work with UK and European law. LexisCheck is covered in more depth highlighting the characteristics that differentiate it from competitors. The general conclusions? Citation tools are now essential and the legal information market is a fertile area for improving the performance of law firms. Effective information access and management continue to be a competitive weapon for supplier and user alike.</p>

<title>The potential from miniaturization of information</title>
<p>Roger James presents our published information world with a new concept – the information quantum. Stimulated by the introduction of Google Drive, James predicts a shift from organizing digital information in documents, files and books to its access at the quantum level – sentences, paragraphs and tweets – small elemental pieces of information irrespective of their type and devoid of their ‘container’. Use of microformats will conquer the current limitations of hypertext and its links at the container level. This ‘<italic>is about mixing and matching writing, images and audio as pieces drawn from the individual’s work and that of others and pulled from books, journals, blogs and tweets. The quantum metaphor suggests a creative mongrel of information synthesized from multiple sources; it recognizes the challenges of ownership and pedigree but is the key to releasing the potential of digital scholarship</italic>’. A new referencing system is needed but appears to be feasible.</p>
<p>Are information professionals, information creators and publishers and others ready to deal with this transformation? The information quantum concept has the potential to transform the creation of bodies of knowledge. Collaborating groups will be able to ‘<italic>combine their writing and reading paths through the full corpus of their field and not just popularly quoted material</italic>’. Publishers will be able to make their material available in quantum MicroFormat, open to re-mixing and capable of seamless integration.</p>
<p>These are concepts which challenge the nature of ownership, originality and accessibility, but which can be used to create links and paths through new information to its original foundation – transforming our current approaches to research.</p>

<title>Information obesity – the challenge for the information professional</title>
<p>Information obesity is now a well established syndrome – the inability to make sense of or act effectively on information – i.e. the inability to turn information into knowledge. Given that information professionals are concerned to deliver targeted and filtered information to their organization and to organize information so that retrieval is focused and accurate, it is ironic that our personal potential for obesity is high. A case for ‘physician – heal thyself’! Information overload and the ubiquity of information is one cause but Scott Brown identifies a number of other triggers specific to our profession that influence the onset of information obesity:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Professional uncertainty – the pressures of observing/experiencing downsizing – continued changes in information work.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uncertainty – what are the boundaries and expectations of our roles – how can we handle increasing breadth of activity?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Rapidly developing technology – and the need to ‘keep up’ with content developments and organizational changes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The innate tendency to perfection – to provide all the information needed.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Tackling obesity in ourselves requires willpower and focus. Scott presents sound practical advice. Actively manage your attention span; reflect on what you really need to track – be more discerning; turn off less important news feeds; improve use of personal information tools; replace scanning with sense-making; practice good enough; and join the slow information movement – easy to say but more difficult to do!</p>

<title>Professional advancement – lessons from experience</title>
<p>The job market appears to be on the move again for information professionals and with new opportunities in the information management space as well as desk research, content procurement and information skills training. Vendor roles in content management, business development and publishing are commonly seen as are opportunities for knowledge analysts to capture, store, analyze and synthesize data. Bloomberg’s recent announcement that it intends to establish a global industry research service staffed by more than 100 research professionals confirms the value of information skills (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c86ba5ea-bedf-11e1-8ccd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rVvPx39">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c86ba5ea-bedf-11e1-8ccd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rVvPx39</ext-link>) for the financial and other sectors. Reports from Gartner and AIIM, featured in <italic>Initiatives</italic> are similarly encouraging. So the prospect of a career in information appears much more positive.</p>
<p>A recent role as a recruitment manager provides Sue Edgar with valuable perspectives on career advancement as do her recent in-depth interviews with a sample of business information professionals. Echoing Scott Brown, Edgar observes that downsizing has reduced some information services beyond the point of effectiveness with staff stretched so thinly that services cannot be sustained. These services have reached a tipping point – a warning to others to focus on real priorities rather than attempting to sustain everything when being downsized. Outsourcing has seemingly provided more cost-effective solutions for some organizations and strategies demonstrate both successes and damaging loss of core information expertise. She laments the lack of understanding of the value of information to the organization, often exhibited by the senior managers responsible for the function. Nevertheless she advocates that managing through such changes and shifts in the profession strengthens the competencies of information managers and colleagues. It also stimulates information functions to prioritize activities with their customers.</p>
<p>Career planning is sensible if based on knowledge of personal strengths, weakness, dislikes and passions. Competence and capability that are visible at the highest levels of an organization are more likely to bring new opportunities. Doors can shut as well as open; personal circumstances may change and hinder advancement. Continuous learning, gaining knowledge on the periphery of ‘traditional’ functional skills, team playing, the ability to present and interview well – all these help. As does curiosity – and the ability to identify good challenges within and outside your current organization.</p>

<sec id="section7-0266382112460942">
<title>Professional advancement – lessons from IT</title>
<p>Building on Edgar’s perspective on skills, we recently noted a commentary on the soft skills needed by IT folk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-highly-valued-soft-skills-for-it-pros/3353?tag=nl.e101">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-highly-valued-soft-skills-for-it-pros/3353?tag=nl.e101</ext-link>). Mary Shacklett has highlighted skills that often feature in classic information professional lists – communication, vendor management, and contract negotiation. The list also includes: deal-making and meeting skills (essential to find common ground with customers); political skills (the ability to forge relationships across organizations); teaching, mentoring, and knowledge sharing (requiring ‘willingness to share and the ability to listen and be patient with others as they learn’); the ability to resolve ‘grey’ issues (bringing them out into the open and sorting them out); and, ergonomic sensitivity (empathizing with end-users and understanding their working conditions when designing new services). These are all skills that information professionals can make use of. And we must continue to focus on our most vital role – helping organizations understand the potential of information as a corporate asset which is essential for business effectiveness, success, and operational efficiency.</p>
