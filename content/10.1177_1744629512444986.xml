<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the use of restraint with disabled adults and children and uses a case study of one particular child to explore issues related to the use of restraint, including the consent of the person subjected to restraint, their human rights, and the balancing of these rights with the need to reduce the risk of harm. The case study involves a young woman who requested to be restrained in a particular way and the challenges this posed to the staff caring for her. The article concludes that in many complex situations there is no clearly right approach to take, and each situation involving restraint must be considered on an individual case-by-case basis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of physical restraint with disabled people is often seen as controversial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512444986">Deb and Roberts, 2005</xref>). At the extreme end of the controversy are reports of excessive physical restraint being used in a cruel and demeaning manner, such as with the residents of Winterbourne View, as reported in various sections of the media in 2011 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512444986">BBC, 2011</xref>). However, physical restraint remains an apparently necessary technique when working with disabled people, including children. This article is based on a case study of one particular child who was assessed as needing to be physically restrained. The point of this article is not to defend what took place in the case study or to argue that what happened was the best outcome available; rather it is to highlight the difficulties that can arise when working with some young children with especially challenging or violent behaviour and how issues of consent, human rights and reduction of risk can impact on decisions related to restraint. The case study highlights several questions, including consideration of when the use of restraint is justified, how the rights of individuals to freedom of movement and expression can be balanced with the right to remain safe from harm, how the views of the person being restrained can be taken into account, and how staff might be affected by having to restrain vulnerable children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1744629512444986">
<title>Restraint</title>
<p>As indicated above, physical restraint can result in the person restrained being placed in cruel and degrading situations as well as causing them physical harm or even death (for example, Gareth Myatt, aged 15, died whilst being restrained in Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre in 2004). However, physical restraint in the most general sense refers not (just) to these kinds of wrongdoing but to the practice of rendering people harmless by means of restraining movement or to the restriction of movement in order to achieve a set goal. This more general sense of restraint includes many common examples that are generally not thought of as being restraint. For example, newborns are often made to wear mittens (restricting the movement of their fingers) in order that they do not scratch themselves; bed railings are used to prevent hospital patients from rolling out of their beds; toddlers are placed in playpens to stop them moving freely around; and people using wheelchairs often wear lap belts (or use other types of straps) to help prevent them from falling out. This type of restraint is considered so benign as to rarely be thought of in these terms. There are two reasons that seem to explain why this type of restraint is considered so benign: firstly, no physical harm is caused to the person being restrained; and secondly, the restraint is clearly undertaken in the person’s best interests. It would surely be the case that if this type of restraint were not employed, the risk of harm would increase (a newborn could scratch themselves, a hospital patient may fall from their bed and so on) and the person responsible for <italic>not </italic>implementing the restraint would be at least partially liable for any injury the person did incur. For example, if a nurse neglected to use bed railings correctly and a hospital patient fell out of bed and sustained an injury, the nurse would likely be held accountable. Indeed, in theory, we would hope that all types of restraint should meet this definition of being in the restrained person’s best interests and of reducing the overall risk of harm rather than increasing it. This is where situations such as the death of Gareth Myatt can quite clearly be seen as not just wrong in principle but wrong in practice, as the risk of harm caused by the restraint so vastly outweighed the supposed harm that would occur without any restraint (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512444986">Hantikainen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>However, when most people think of restraint, it is unlikely that they are thinking of such benign actions as placing a toddler in a playpen. It is more likely that the word ‘restraint’ will be taken as meaning such situations as the police restraining a suspected criminal or medical staff restraining a patient with mental health difficulties. Guidelines for the use of restraint by the police are set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers and they dictate that restraint (by which they mean the use of leg and arm restraints) should only be used when prisoners are acting violently (interestingly, not when a prisoner appears likely to act violently, only when they are <italic>already</italic> acting violently). Medical restraint is usually used to prevent patients from harming themselves or others. This type of restraint could involve physical restraint but could also include restraint via chemical or medical means. For example, benzodiazepines can be administered to patients in order to sedate them. These more ‘typical’ types of restraint would struggle to meet the first criterion set out above for benign restraint, that of causing no harm to the individual being restrained. For example, police handcuffs may rub on a person’s wrists and cause relatively minor harm, and a patient being administered a sedative may suffer side effects such as drowsiness or dizziness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512444986">Tasman and Lieberman, 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>The case study presented in this article probably sits somewhere between the two extremes of relatively benign restraint (putting mittens on a newborn) and significant restraint as used by the police or medical staff (placing handcuffs on a prisoner or prescribing a sedative to a patient with mental health difficulties). The type of restraint in the case study is actually relatively common and often involves education or social care staff working with young people and children with severe behavioural difficulties. Generally, the restraint is implemented without the use of implements and certainly without the use of medication. Instead, a number of adults will hold the young person in certain prescribed ways to restrict their movement; this type of restraint usually relies on having a high ratio of staff to children in order to ensure the restraint can be implemented safely, both for the child and for members of staff. The use of restraint in these types of settings is relatively widespread: approximately 70 percent of teachers or teaching assistants working with students with severe behavioural difficulties report using physical restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512444986">Goldstein and Brooks, 2007</xref>) and many believe that it is essential in order to maintain the safety and order of a classroom environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512444986">Ryan and Peterson, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, there are around 2500 different restraint techniques that educational and social care staff can be trained in, often by private companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512444986">O’Hara, 2005</xref>). Organizations such as mental health trusts, schools (including primary schools), prisons, foster carer organizations, colleges, local authorities, charities, nursing homes, the police, residential children’s homes and training centres typically have policies and procedures regarding the use of restraint by their staff, indicating how widespread the practices may be.</p>
<p>One common thread between all types of restraint is that ethically and legally, the person or people administering the restraint are responsible for the wellbeing of the person being restrained. This responsibility extends beyond the period when the person is actually being restrained; for example, when a person’s rights and freedoms have been compromised (such as by being restrained), an effective remedy should be available to them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512444986">Howard League for Penal Reform, 2006</xref>) and one can make a convincing argument that the responsibility for ensuring the restrained person is aware of this falls onto the restrainer(s).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1744629512444986">
<title>Consent</title>
<p>Note that in the discussion above regarding whether restraint is benign or not, no reference was made to the consent of the person being restrained. Thus, whilst the consent of the person being restrained may help in assessing whether the restraint is justified and acceptable (such as an adult who enjoys bondage), a lack of consent does not necessarily mean that implementing restraint is not benign, especially when it is determined that the person being restrained lacks the capacity to make an informed decision. The toddler being placed in a playpen whilst their carer goes into another room may strongly express a desire to be let out of the playpen and would be unlikely to voluntarily enter the playpen if asked to do so (unless enticed with some reward). Similarly, a hospital patient could request not to have bed rails in place but this request would most likely be refused; the hospital would surely argue that they would remain liable for any injury caused and their policy dictates that all patients must agree to reasonable requests for safety measures to be in place.</p>
<p>However, what does it mean to talk about consent? Any such discussion will inevitably raise questions of capacity to make informed choices. Again, the toddler’s consent to be placed in a playpen is largely irrelevant because they lack the capacity to understand and make such a choice. Guidelines on seeking consent when working with children were issued by the Department of Health in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512444986">2001</xref> and the law presumes that children are competent to give or withhold consent to things such as medical treatment when they reach 16 years of age. However, the guidance also rightly encourages all ‘competent’ children to be involved in decision-making processes that affect them. Although the Mental Capacity Act 2005 refers to adults rather than children, the five underpinning principles also offer a good basis for considering the issue of consent. As with the Department of Health guidance, the first principle of the Act is that capacity to make informed decisions must be assumed unless it is proven that a person lacks such capacity. The other principles are that people must be given help to make decisions if required, that individuals have the right to make eccentric or ‘unwise’ decisions, that everything must be done in the best interests of a person who is deemed to lack capacity; and that the presumption must be for the least restrictive intervention. I will return to these principles when discussing the case study, which is introduced below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1744629512444986">
<title>Case study</title>
<p>SM is a 14-year-old young person with autism, learning difficulties and severe behavioural difficulties. When distressed, angry or upset, SM will often self-harm by hitting herself on the head with her fists, biting her arms, scratching herself or banging her head on nearby objects such as walls. SM will also present with violence towards other people in the vicinity, hitting, scratching or biting them. SM has a tendency to target the most vulnerable people in the vicinity such as young children or people with physical disabilities who are unable to move away or easily defend themselves. SM attends a variety of social activities organized and run by the local disabled children’s team. Staff at the centre know SM well and have in place a well developed behaviour management plan, which includes the use of physical restraint once certain criteria have been met (such as SM has begun to self-harm or is indicating that self-harm is imminent). The behaviour management plan is clear that physical restraint should only be used as a last resort, and other methods, including de-escalation techniques, should all be employed before restraint is considered. Although SM does not use expressive verbal communication, staff do try and explain the use of restraint to SM as best they can, using simple language, symbols and pictures to show her what they will do and ensuring that they talk to her about being restrained when she is calm as well as when she is angry and upset. It is generally agreed that SM cannot give her informed consent to being restrained due to her learning difficulties. However, from her response to being restrained, it is clear that SM does not want to have her movement restricted in this way, although it does seem an effective way of calming her down. On balance, the risks of not restraining SM seem greater than the risks of restraining her, although the risk of causing harm from restraint is not negligible either.</p>
<p>SM’s parents are in agreement with her behaviour management plan and it is regularly reviewed to ensure it is still necessary and up-to-date. Several significant ethical questions may already be obvious from the case study as set out so far, but the situation changed when SM began arriving at school and other activities with her hands tied behind her back with a pair of mittens. The result of this was that SM could not freely move her hands and it was immediately obvious that SM would not have been able to tie her own hands together in this way. The care staff removed the mittens and reported this to SM’s social worker. However, very soon after the mittens were removed, SM indicated to the staff that she wished for her hands to be tied again. SM seemed worried that she would otherwise hurt herself and this would lead to her being restrained, which she did not want to happen. SM’s social worker contacted SM’s parents who explained that they had tied SM’s hands together at her request and that this appeared to be a more positive way of preventing SM from harming herself and others than by repeated physical intervention. SM’s parents were quick to stress that as soon as SM asked to be untied (for example, if she wanted to drink, eat or use the toilet) they would do so, but SM would then prompt them to tie her hands back again once she was finished.</p>
<sec id="section5-1744629512444986">
<title>SM’s state of mind</title>
<p>What might have prompted SM to ask to be restrained in this fashion, and what implications might this have for making an ethical judgement about whether or not this should be permitted? From a behaviourist viewpoint, it seems relatively straightforward: SM had been conditioned to understand that certain types of behaviour (self-harming or harming others) lead to a predictable outcome (being restrained). SM found the restraint to be, at the very least, unpleasant and SM considered an alternative that she found more palatable – self-restraint. If this supposition were correct, SM’s behaviour would seem to be very reasonable, at least from her point of view. However, it is possible that her state of mind was not as clear as a behaviourist interpretation might suggest; from a psychodynamic viewpoint, it could be suggested that SM has internalized a view of herself as ‘dangerous’ (to herself and others) and this leads her to feel that she needs to be restrained. If this supposition were correct, SM’s behaviour would appear to be much more concerning. In other words, although SM is consenting to being restrained in this manner (by having her hands tied behind her back), as indicated above, the consent of the person being restrained is not the only factor that needs to be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744629512444986">
<title>What is different between self-restraint and imposed restraint?</title>
<p>The dilemma for SM’s social worker and for the care staff was as follows. As part of her behaviour management plan, it is envisaged that SM will need to be restrained at various times, depending on her behaviour and other factors. If this part of the behaviour plan is accepted, the decision is not whether or not to use restraint but what kind of restraint is most justified. The professionals’ view was that SM benefited from being restrained because this reduced the overall risk of harm to her. The type of restraint that SM indicated she preferred (tying her hands with mittens) appeared to be effective at preventing SM from harming herself and others but could have the potential to cause her harm. It could also be seen as less dignified, in that SM would essentially be restrained for a majority of the time rather than just for short periods. However, it also seemed to cause her less discomfort and distress. Tying someone’s hands increases the risk of harm because if SM were to fall over, she would be unable to break her fall. In terms of the purposes of the two types of restraint, it cannot be said with any great degree of confidence that restraint by tying SM’s hands and restraint by trained staff are the same. SM’s aims of asking for her hands to be tied could be to negate the need for her to be restrained by staff, a subtle but significant difference from the aim of preventing her from harming herself and others.</p>
<p>The other main difference between the two approaches was that SM apparently gave her explicit consent to having her hands tied whereas she objected to being restrained by other people. This difference leads onto a consideration of the subjective experience of being restrained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1744629512444986">
<title>What is it like to be restrained and to restrain?</title>
<p>In a study of patients and staff in inpatient psychiatric units, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512444986">Bonner et al. (2002</xref>) found that incidents of restraint caused strong emotional reactions in both the patient and the staff. Patients reported that they valued the attention of staff but only received intensive amounts of attention whilst being restrained. They reported feeling ashamed after periods of restraint and that post-restraint debriefing was an important mechanism for processing these strong emotions. Perhaps most worryingly, patients reported feeling afraid of the possibility of being restrained and patients and staff worried that being restrained recalled previous traumatic experiences for the patients. It is important to note that nothing in the study indicates that restraint in this particular unit was being used in any way inappropriately. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512444986">Strumpf and Evans (1991</xref>) found that informed consent to restraint was a significant factor in whether elderly patients felt restraint improved or decreased their quality of life. Another study confirms that autonomy is important but also found that staff and patients value a proportional assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of using restraint; and ensuring that everyone involved is clear about this assessment, and that it is reviewed regularly, can help the experience of being restrained to be less traumatic (Gastmans and Milisen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512444986">2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1744629512444986">
<title>What is the right thing to do?</title>
<p>Given the above, what would be the right thing to do for SM? This question can be answered by considering which of SM’s human rights are given priority. If autonomy and informed consent are the most pressing rights, then SM’s choice to have her hands tied together should be respected, especially if this form of restraint completely negates the need for other forms of restraint, which SM was so keen to avoid. SM’s preference would also seem to be more beneficial based on an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages. By using SM’s chosen method, her fear of being restrained would also seem to be reduced, and it would appear to be less traumatic for the staff as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1744629512444986">
<title>The five principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005</title>
<p>As noted above, the five underlying principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 would seem helpful in considering the case study of SM. To recap, the five principles are:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>a presumption of capacity</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the right for individuals to be supported to make their own decisions; people must be given all appropriate help before anyone concludes that they cannot make their own decisions</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>that individuals must retain the right to make what might be seen as eccentric or unwise decisions</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity must be in their best interests</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity should be an option that is as unrestrictive as possible, as long as it is still in their best interests.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Based on these, one can clearly see that the presumption must be that SM does have capacity to decide for herself to tie her hands together with mittens and that what might seem like eccentric or unwise action on her part should have no bearing on whether it is allowed to continue or not. However, it is less clear what action should have been taken because of the other principles, most notably the one regarding actions of least restriction. One could argue that allowing SM to make her own choice about the method of her restraint is unrestrictive in the psychosocial sense but more restrictive in the physical sense (in that she is restrained for the majority of her waking life, rather than for short periods only).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1744629512444986">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A longer term view of SM’s circumstances might accept that whilst it was necessary to allow SM to tie her own hands at the time, this situation only emerged because of the longer-term failure of the adults in her life to provide any better alternatives. Various studies have shown that focusing on the behavioural competence of care staff usually results in a reduction in their reliance on methods such as restraint (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512444986">Donat, 2005</xref>). It could be seen as an ethical failure on the part of the agency responsible if they do not enable their care staff, via training or other methods, to have the skills to avoid needing to use restraint. Given that SM presented with challenging and aggressive behaviour for many years, it is at least unfortunate that physical restraint of any kind was still required. It is also notable that at no point was an ethics committee involved in a discussion of the situation. Such a discussion would have been useful. However, despite the reductions seen in the incidence of restraint when the skills of staff are improved, this does not mean that restraint is automatically precluded as an option for every individual and in every situation.</p>
<p>In the case of SM, the social work team and her parents did agree that the best option was to continue tying her hands together as and when she requested it. Efforts were also made to encourage SM to only ask for her hands to be tied when she felt that she was liable to become distressed and then aggressive, rather than having her hands tied all of the time.</p>
