<p>MR. WILLIAM HARRIS (Luling, Louisiana): I think it is very appropriate to introduce a compliance chamber, in this case the Better Bladder™. With kinetic-assisted venous drainage using a centrifugal pump, there are two trains of thought. One is that we can use a centrifugal pump without any kind of compliance chamber, no matter what model of centrifugal pump is being used. The other train of thought, and I agree with this one, is a compliance chamber in a closed system with a centrifugal pump is probably a necessary addition. You have demonstrated really well in your study that you probably do dampen the high peak pressures and you also minimize gaseous microemboli (GME) by incorporating a compliance chamber. I think more studies have to be done before we can go ahead and just agree to that statement. Also, you had an arterial filter in your mini-system. The bubble counts were done distal to the arterial filter. Was air allowed to escape through a purge line attached to the filter before you did the measurements of GME?</p>
<p>MR. PATRICK WEERWIND (Wychen, The Netherlands): If it is not necessary, we never purge the arterial line.</p>
<p>MR. HARRIS: I noted that you had negative pressures of −80 to −100 mmHg, where some studies have shown that, with kinetic-assisted venous drainage, you can actually achieve negative pressures of well below that in the range −600 to −700 mmHg. Sometimes we do not see those pressures because they appear so quickly. I was wondering about your measurement technique and if that might have been a flaw in your study?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: What I showed was the mean value. Our lowest values were −300 mmHg.</p>
<p>CO-MODERATOR IAN SHEARER (Durham, North Carolina): Did you use bovine blood in your study?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: We used human blood.</p>
<p>CO-MODERATOR SHEARER: There seems to be more widespread application of minimized circuits in Europe compared to the United States. Can you comment on some strategies to safely incorporate minimized circuits into a new program?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: It is very important to have good communication with the surgeons and anesthesia personnel, because you are using the patient’s body as a reservoir.</p>
<p>CO-MODERATOR CARMEN GIACOMUZZI (Portland, Oregon): How many cases do you really think it takes for the team to feel competent and really comfortable doing these types of cases?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: In our clinic, there are only four perfusionists and three surgeons involved in using this system. You need to have really close communication. I think it will take at least 50 cases to get the experience.</p>
<p>CO-MODERATOR GIACOMUZZI: What you are saying is that you really need to be able to do this with some consistency to feel good about what you are doing?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: Yes, that is true.</p>
<p>MS. LINDA MONGERO (Locust Valley, New York): I have so many thoughts because I really believe in this technology, but it has been difficult for us.We have had the same problems that you have had. Have you incorporated the Better Bladder™ into your miniaturized circuit?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: Yes, we do.</p>
<p>MS. MONGERO: What are we missing? What is the safety piece that we are missing to advance the miniaturized circuit?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: What do you mean?</p>
<p>MS. MONGERO: You seem to believe that you need to do these kinds of cases all the time. You cannot just do one or two a month, with which I totally agree. It is a more sophisticated circuit and, even though it is smaller, things happen much more quickly and communication does have to be much better. It is not a forgiving circuit. What could make it safer for all perfusionists in every setting to use?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: It is difficult to say. I think it is also determined by the interests of the perfusionist. If you are really interested in taking care and looking at the patient, then that is very important. If you feel yourself more comfortable with a larger circuit and larger prime volumes, then probably you will not like this miniaturized circuit. It takes more attention by the perfusionist because your safety is limited and the margin is not there anymore. So, it depends.</p>
<p>MR. ERIC JENKINS (Dexter, Michigan): I am concerned about the miniaturized circuits. What procedures are you performing with this circuit? It seems to me that they have a very limited application. Complicated cases involving circulatory arrest or double valve replacement or arch reconstruction would not be done with this system.</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: At present, we use it for coronary surgery, aortic valve surgery, and combined aortic valve and coronary surgery.</p>
<p>MR. JENKINS: I noticed that the negative pressures that you find acceptable, for example,−80 to −100 mmHg, are much beyond what we would find acceptable. When we do vacuum-assisted venous drainage, we do not go below−30 mmHg. When we used to perform veno-veno bypass for liver transplantation, the maximum suction was −75 mHg. Otherwise, we would be very concerned about generating gaseous microemboli. What is your acceptable negative pressure with that circuit?</p>
<p>MR. WEERWIND: When using the miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) system (Maquet), it would be −80 to −100 mmHg. It depends also on the cannula, because the surgeons use very small venous cannulas when using the miniaturized circuit.</p>
