<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12454592">Ray Bromley (1978)</xref>, in his study of Cali, Colombia, distinguishes three types of street vendors: commission sellers, dependent workers, and the independent, truly self-employed. The latter deal mainly in uncooked or cooked foodstuffs, secondhand goods, or assorted small items; they buy from a variety of intermediaries or make their own merchandise. Traditional conceptualizations of the informal sector have, in error, considered them the prototype of street hawkers. In contrast, commission sellers and dependent workers have dependency linkages with suppliers, which may be large, medium-sized, or small firms in the formal sector, multinational businesses, or purveyors of illegal goods. Commission sellers sell goods for which they receive a commission for each item sold for their suppliers. Beach vendors selling sunglasses imported from China were among the few vendors who were commission sellers. Dependent workers often depend upon a supplier for credit to obtain merchandise but do not receive a fixed commission on each item. Resellers could also be conceived of as dependent workers, since they are dependent upon a wholesaler or retailer for their trade. Both commission sellers and dependent sellers are, in Bromley’s conceptualization, essentially “disguised wage laborers” working for their suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12454592">Wilson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The beach vendors and vendors on marinas that are ubiquitous in the sun-and-sea tourist resorts of Mexico are primarily dependent sellers, marketing the wares of national and sometimes transnational companies. For example, in eight tourism centers in Mexico, beach and marina vendors from 2002 to 2007 sold lengths of cloth, often dyed with Mexican themes such as portraits of Pancho Villa or Frida Kahlo, that are made in Indonesia and distributed by a Mexican importer who also advertises his wares on a web site. More recently a cheaper version of Indonesian cloth, usually cut into sundresses, has become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>The vendors’ activities are often curtailed by the government or overregulated, given the small amounts of income that they generate. Some attempt to evade this formalization in the form of acquiring licenses and paying taxes and may be arrested and fined for doing so. Most of the beach vendors in Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta have migrated there from Guerrero, whose tourist center, Acapulco, is flooded with vendors. Some have tried a number of tourist centers in Mexico before establishing themselves, usually through network-mediated migration, in a final place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12454592">Wilson, n.d.</xref>). Very few now sell handicrafts that they themselves make, although lengths of cloth may be cut into miniskirts or sundresses and semi-precious stone beads are often assembled into necklaces by the vendor. Although many of these stones are of Mexican origin, some are imported from Asia and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12454592">Cowen, 2005</xref>). Photos of some of beach and marina vendors follow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X12454592">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X12454592"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X12454592"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X12454592"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X12454592"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0094582X12454592">6</xref>).</p>
