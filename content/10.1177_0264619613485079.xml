<abstract>
<p>For wayfinding at museums, galleries, and heritage sites, the majority of people who are blind or partially sighted favour verbal directions over tactile maps. Those who provide such directions are usually fully sighted. Can we assume that details considered important by those with vision are equally helpful to those without? This article presents a study comparing descriptions of familiar routes recalled by fully sighted, partially sighted, and blind participants, highlighting the differences in navigation strategies. All participants cited landmarks, but those with impaired vision also detailed significantly more objects, or ‘milestones’, en route. In the absence of such milestones, they relied on metrics that were often environmental or body-based. Distances were precisely specified, rather than ‘vague’. Landmarks and milestones were accessed multimodally by blind and partially sighted participants, or a combination of landmarks and milestones were sought for corroboration. In contrast, fully sighted participants reported predominantly unimodal information, that is, visual. The findings may have practical implications for improving the type of verbal orientation information provided to assist blind or partially sighted people.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In museums, galleries, and heritage sites, provision of orientation information to assist wayfinding is one method to improve access for blind and partially sighted (B&amp;PS) visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264619613485079">Handa, Dairoku, &amp; Toriyama, 2010</xref>). An important question, then, is how best can people with sight problems be helped to navigate from one part of the site to the next? Research for the Talking Images project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264619613485079">Royal National Institute of Blind People [RNIB], 2003</xref>) showed that 66% (137/208) of the B&amp;PS respondents found tactile maps of no benefit. Instead, verbal directions of the kind included on an audio guide were considered more helpful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264619613485079">Golledge, Marston, Loomis, and Klatzky (2004)</xref> also found that people with impaired vision preferred speech input to guide them, and more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264619613485079">Neuville and Trassoudaine (2009)</xref> showed that words were considered preferable to a directional, non-verbal audio signal. If there is a consensus that verbal directions are better, what elements should they include? In a museum environment, those who provide wayfinding information are likely to be education officers or audio guide writers/producers. Such people are unlikely to be experts in orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) and almost invariably have full sight. Can we assume that details considered important by those with vision are equally helpful to those without? This article presents a study comparing descriptions of familiar routes recalled by fully sighted, partially sighted, and blind participants, highlighting the differences in navigation strategies. The findings may have practical implications for improving orientation information intended to assist blind or partially sighted people.</p>

<title>Wayfinding for people with sight</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264619613485079">Gibson (1986)</xref> cites the philosopher Bishop Berkeley who, in 1709, claimed the chief role of vision was for animals ‘to foresee the benefit or injury which is like to ensue upon application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance’ (p. 232). Gibson applied Berkeley’s idea to his own theory of affordances such that ‘to see things is to see how to get about among them’ (p. 223). Sight is presumed to be crucial to wayfinding, in particular, ‘the ability to orient with respect to a known object or vista of a scene, which requires memory for a particular landmark or view’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619613485079">Foo, Warren, Duchon, &amp; Tarr, 2005</xref>, p. 195). Landmarks have two functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264619613485079">Allen, 1999</xref>): They allow people to orient themselves in a particular direction and provide reassurance that they remain on the correct route. An alternative to a landmark-based navigation strategy is ‘path integration’ or ‘dead reckoning’, which uses proprioceptive information such as muscle movement and linear and angular acceleration of the body to constantly update position and distance travelled from a known starting point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619613485079">Foo et al. (2005)</xref> noted the use of such a strategy by fully sighted people when asked to journey across a virtual desert without obvious landmarks. They concluded that people can ‘fall back on . . . path integration if landmarks are absent or perceived as unreliable’ (p. 213). While other senses such as sound and smell can provide information about features of the environment, non-visual modalities have been deemed to be significantly less precise (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264619613485079">Chandler, Grantham, &amp; Leek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264619613485079">Waller &amp; Greenauer, 2007</xref>). This might suggest that people with a visual impairment rely on path integration. Yet 40 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264619613485079">Foulke (1971)</xref> noted the use of landmarks by blind people. Indeed, ‘using landmarks and cues’ is one of the nine spatial concepts O&amp;M trainers deem necessary for students with no or low vision to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264619613485079">Wall Emerson &amp; Corn, 2006</xref>). This begs the question of what constitutes a landmark for a person with impaired sight? Which modalities are used to encode landmarks in the memory? In particular, what contributions to wayfinding are made by senses other than vision?</p>

<title>Wayfinding for people with impaired vision</title>
<p>Navigation difficulties have been identified as one of the main hindrances to independent living for people who are blind or partially sighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264619613485079">Golledge, 1993</xref>). Yet those with impaired vision are still able to integrate spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264619613485079">Ungar, 2000</xref>) such that they can encode a mental map, recall a route, give directions, and point out shortcuts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619613485079">Passini &amp; Proulx, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264619613485079">Rieser, Guth, &amp; Hill, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264619613485079">Rieser, Lockman, and Pick (1980)</xref> showed that when estimating distances between landmarks, blind participants performed as well as fully sighted participants for functional (route-based) distance. However, congenitally blind participants were significantly less good than those with acquired blindness or fully sighted participants at estimating Euclidean distances (as the crow flies). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264619613485079">Ungar (2000)</xref> found almost all estimates made by visually impaired participants were closer to functional than Euclidean distance. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264619613485079">Bigelow (1991)</xref> asked children to point to objects along a familiar route, those with congenital blindness invariably pointed along the route they would take to reach a landmark, rather than pointing towards the landmark itself.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264619613485079">Brambring (1982)</xref> compared descriptions given by blind and fully sighted people along a specific route. Blind participants reported less about their environment, but their descriptions gave more specific information about distance and body rotation and were generally more detailed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619613485079">Passini and Proulx (1988)</xref> showed that blind and fully sighted participants were almost equally good at creating a map of an indoor route, 250 m long, that they had been guided along twice and completed once alone. When asked to verbalise their journey, blind participants cited a greater variety of ‘small features, such as a radiator, a doorframe, or an ashtray, that went unnoticed by the sighted wayfinder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619613485079">Passini &amp; Proulx, 1988</xref>, p. 243).</p>
<p>These studies suggest that what fully sighted people traditionally conceive as landmarks (i.e., large-scale, visually distinctive objects at key turning points) need to be reconsidered in the context of wayfinding without sight. In O&amp;M terminology, ‘<italic>landmarks</italic>’ are defined as ‘any familiar object, sound, odor, temperature, tactile, or visual clue that is easily recognized, is constant, and has a discrete permanent location in the environment that is known to the traveller’. Landmarks are contrasted with ‘<italic>information points</italic>’ that are clues to location provided by two or more sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264619613485079">Hill &amp; Ponder, 1976</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613485079">Blasch, Wiener, &amp; Welsh, 1997</xref>, p. 42). However, this may be a false distinction given that a landmark is also likely to be perceived through more than one modality. A long cane, for example, is a navigation aid that provides both tactile and auditory information and both are necessary to the user for accurate identification of objects at key points on a journey. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264619613485079">Schenkman (1986)</xref> demonstrated that ground surfaces encountered with a cane when either auditory or haptic–tactile information was deliberately suppressed were often identified incorrectly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613485079">Blasch et al. (1997)</xref> distinguish between ‘<italic>primary landmarks</italic>’ that are constant, and ‘<italic>secondary landmarks</italic>’ that may be intermittent or easily missed. However, in understanding differences in navigation strategies according to acuity of sight, it may be more useful to distinguish between landmarks of any size that allow people to orient themselves in a particular direction and ‘<italic>milestones</italic>’ that are encountered along the pathway between landmarks, that is, objects that, in the absence of a vista, assist in path integration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613485079">Blasch et al.’s (1997)</xref> manual is still one of the primary textbooks used for training O&amp;M practitioners in the United States and the United Kingdom. Their recommendations include orientation techniques based on auditory location, kinaesthetic, haptic, and tactile discrimination. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264619613485079">Pavey, Dodgson, Douglas, and Clements (2009)</xref>, in a report for the RNIB, describe such methods as ‘relatively untested in their suitability for the U.K. traveller with a visual impairment’ (p. 23), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619613485079">Dodgson and McCall (2009)</xref> describe O&amp;M as ‘a rehabilitative intervention that appears to have changed little since the 1940s’ (p. 160). It is important therefore to see whether blind people who are experienced independent travellers find such methods useful enough to employ in their day-to-day journeys.</p>

<title>Comparing navigation strategies</title>
<p>Empirical studies designed to compare the effectiveness of wayfinding strategies often rely on laboratory situations that do not translate well to the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264619613485079">Kitchin &amp; Blades, 2002</xref>). Real environments tend to provide more multisensory feedback that may be particularly helpful for people with impaired vision. The studies cited above compared fully sighted and blind participants undertaking the same route. Building on Brambring’s research design, this article presents a study in which nine fully sighted (FS) participants and nine participants with impaired sight were free to describe any journey with which they were familiar. This allowed individuals to recall a route they knew extremely well. The expectation was that they could recount such a route more fully, thus allowing a comparison to be made as to the type and number of navigational cues encoded in the memory. To aid comparability and usefulness, participants were asked to recall a journey made on foot. According to the RNIB, walking is the most frequently used method of locomotion by people whose vision is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264619613485079">Worsfold &amp; Chandler, 2010</xref>). Walking binds other journey elements together but is currently that part of a journey ‘where there is the least amount of information or assistance to help the individual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264619613485079">Worsfold &amp; Chandler, 2010</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Previous studies have concentrated on what features of a route blind and fully sighted people identify. This study was explicitly concerned with <italic>how</italic> such features are identified through a range of multimodal cues. In line with previous studies, it was expected that participants with impaired sight would report more small-scale features of their route compared with sighted participants. In particular, they would report more milestones along the pathway. Landmarks and milestones were likely to be close to hand and identifiable by modalities other than vision. This study received ethical approval from Goldsmiths College, University of London.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0264619613485079">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Nine volunteers with impaired sight took part. Participants were known to the first author (L. F.) through her work as an audio describer and were selected to cover a range of sight conditions (congenital blindness, early blind, late blind, and with varying degrees of sight acuity). All had been registered blind for at least 10 years, were experienced long-cane users, and were judged to be skilled, independent travellers. All had completed a school education, and 8 of 9 participants had a college degree. Nine FS volunteers were recruited of comparable age, gender, and educational background. This resulted in the following sample: <italic>N</italic> = 18; B&amp;PS = 9; FS = 9; females = 6, males = 12; age: 31–75 years, <italic>M</italic> = 50.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 16.91 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0264619613485079">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0264619613485079">3</xref> of <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0264619613485079">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviewed individually, each participant was asked to imagine undertaking a familiar journey and to describe the route. Descriptions were recorded using Audio Engineering’s Field Recorder i-phone application, FiRe! Recordings were transcribed by the first author (L. F.). A clear protocol for route terminology was determined, as detailed below. Route descriptions were analysed for quantitative and qualitative differences in landmarks and milestones reported and the modality through which they were identified. Information on distance was also noted. B&amp;PS participants were also given the chance to talk about wayfinding in general. These additional comments inform the discussion section.</p>

<title>Route terminology</title>
<sec id="section8-0264619613485079">
<title>Route complexity</title>
<p>Participants were given no limitation on the length or type of route they described. The only stipulation was that it should be ‘familiar’. It was, therefore, possible that some journeys would be longer than others. Route complexity was determined by the number of junctions/turnings specified rather than distance travelled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0264619613485079">
<title>Landmarks</title>
<p>Landmarks were defined as objects that served an orienting purpose at, or immediately prior to, a change of direction, for example, ‘At the pub I turn right’ (B&amp;PS1). ‘Distal’ landmarks lay beyond the subject’s immediate space, for example, ‘by the white house on the corner’ (FS4). ‘Proximal’ landmarks lay within reach and could be touched either directly by hand or felt underfoot or indirectly by long cane, for example, ‘at the end of the hedge, there’s a tree and I walk round the tree’ (B&amp;PS9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0264619613485079">
<title>Milestones</title>
<p>Milestones were defined as objects along the pathway where no change of direction was required. As with landmarks, milestones were divided into distal, for example, ‘I go past some industrial buildings’ (FS1) and proximal, for example, ‘on your left is a container for Metro papers’ (B&amp;PS5). There was an additional category of obstacles, that is, milestones to be avoided, for example, ‘you walk across the forecourt – avoiding bollards and lamp posts’ (B&amp;PS2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0264619613485079">
<title>Distances</title>
<p>Metrics were defined as ‘<italic>objective</italic>’, for example, metres/yards, ‘<italic>body-based</italic>’, for example, paces/steps, or ‘<italic>environmenta</italic>l’ meaning items encountered along the route, for example, ‘I count 4 dips in the pavement and those are dips for car drives where cars can drive in’ (B&amp;PS8). Distances were ‘precise’, for example, ‘exactly 100 steps’ (B&amp;PS7), or ‘vague’, for example, ‘after about 10 yards’ (FS7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0264619613485079">
<title>Modality</title>
<p>Modality of landmark or milestone identification was either explicitly stated, for example, ‘you might hear the children out playing’ (FS9) or inferred. Vision, for example, was taken to be the relevant modality when a landmark could be identified only by appearance, for example, ‘a small, flint cottage in the shape of a church’ (FS6). Information pick-up was deemed multimodal if more than one modality was specified, or if no specific modality was stated, for example, for FS participants, a busy road could be heard and seen.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0264619613485079" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The number of words used by participants ranged from 151 to 994. However, one participant (B&amp;PS1) used 2690 words. The <italic>z</italic>-scores showed this description to be an outlier (<italic>z</italic> = +3.66). The participant was excluded from the quantitative analysis but retained for illustrating qualitative differences between the two sight groups (B&amp;PS/FS). The total sample was small, and the data were not normally distributed, so quantitative differences were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and the median is the average used throughout. Most participants described their journey in the first person; four participants (three FS, one B&amp;PS) used ‘you’ as though they were describing the route for someone else to follow. This difference between groups was not significant.</p>
<sec id="section14-0264619613485079">
<title>Route complexity</title>
<p>There was no significant difference between sight groups in the number of junctions/turnings specified: B&amp;PS median = 2; FS median = 2; <italic>U</italic> = 23.5, <italic>z</italic> = −1.24, n.s., <italic>r</italic> = −.30. This suggests the routes described were of similar complexity. However, the B&amp;PS group provided significantly longer descriptions (median = 461 words) compared with the FS group (median = 212 words), <italic>U</italic> = 12, <italic>z</italic> = −2.31, <italic>p</italic> = .021, <italic>r</italic> = −.56.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0264619613485079">
<title>Landmarks, milestones, and obstacles</title>
<p>There was no difference between sight groups in the total number of landmarks reported: B&amp;PS median = 8.5; FS median = 10; <italic>U</italic> = 26.5, <italic>z</italic> = −.92, n.s., <italic>r</italic> = .22. For the B&amp;PS group, landmarks were significantly more likely to be proximal: B&amp;PS (median = 5); FS (median = 3); <italic>U</italic> = 17.5, <italic>z</italic> = −1.80, <italic>p</italic> = .037, <italic>r</italic> = .22. The B&amp;PS group also reported a significantly greater number of proximal milestones (median = 14.5) compared with the FS group (median = 6); <italic>U</italic> = 14, <italic>z</italic> = −2.14, <italic>p</italic> = .036, <italic>r</italic> = −.52. They also mentioned obstacles, whereas the FS group did not: B&amp;PS median = 3.5; FS median = 0; <italic>U</italic> = 13, <italic>z</italic> = −2.30, <italic>p</italic> = .027, <italic>r</italic> = −.56. However, the FS group reported a significantly greater number of distal milestones (median = 7) compared with their B&amp;PS peers (median = 4.5), <italic>U</italic> = 14, <italic>z</italic> = −2.14, <italic>p</italic> = .036, <italic>r</italic> = .52.</p>

<title>Modality</title>
<p>The modalities in which landmarks and milestones were reported, as a percentage of the total, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0264619613485079">Table 1</xref>. Unsurprisingly the FS group were more likely to identify waymarkers by sight: visual landmarks: FS median = 4; B&amp;PS median = 0; <italic>U</italic> = 0.00, <italic>z</italic> = −3.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = −.89; visual milestones: FS median = 10; B&amp;PS median = 0; <italic>U</italic> = 0.00, <italic>z</italic> = −3.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = −.89. By contrast, the B&amp;PS group identified more waymarkers using a combination of two or more modalities such as sound and touch, sound and smell, or sound, touch, and body-based information: multimodal landmarks: B&amp;PS median = 5.5; FS median = 1; <italic>U</italic> = 11, <italic>z</italic> = −2.48, <italic>p</italic> = .015, <italic>r</italic> = .60; multimodal milestones: B&amp;PS median = 9.5; FS median = 2, <italic>U</italic> = 7.5, <italic>z</italic> = −2.77, <italic>p</italic> = .004, <italic>r</italic> = −.67. Absence of milestones was also noted by the B&amp;PS group (median = 3) but never by the FS group: <italic>U</italic> = 16.5, <italic>z</italic> = −2.10, <italic>p</italic> = .05, <italic>r</italic> = .50 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0264619613485079">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0264619613485079">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Verbal orientation information is known to be a useful aid to independent travel for people who have visual impairments. However, providers of orientation information tend to be fully sighted and, in the absence of formal O&amp;M training, are likely to use their own navigational strategy as the basis to determine what information to convey. This study analysed verbal descriptions of familiar routes walked by blind, partially sighted, and FS people in order to compare differences in navigational strategies. The routes encompassed both rural and urban environments.</p>
<p>The journeys were of similar complexity, judged by mentioning a similar number of junctions and a similar number of landmarks along the route. However, in line with previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264619613485079">Brambring, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619613485079">Passini &amp; Proulx, 1988</xref>), the B&amp;PS group used over twice as many words in their descriptions as the FS group. It is possible that people with impaired vision are simply more verbose. However, it is more likely the difference in word length reflects a greater level of detail. B&amp;PS participants reported significantly more milestones than their sighted peers. They also included more references to distance, and these were specified with greater precision. It is likely that B&amp;PS people are more used to verbalising their journey, either as a deliberate encoding strategy, or because, when negotiating a route for the first time, a fully sighted guide or an O&amp;M trainer has described the route aloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264619613485079">Martinsen, Tellevik, Elmerskog, &amp; Storlilokken, 2007</xref>). For those with full sight, orienting towards a vista allows much of the information along the pathway to remain implicit. However, landmarks are pointed out at a turning point, that is, the moment when one uninterrupted vista is exchanged for another.</p>
<sec id="section19-0264619613485079">
<title>Modality of information pick-up</title>
<p>Confounding the assumption that vision is necessary for landmark navigation, both groups referred to similar numbers of distal landmarks. However, the B&amp;PS identified significantly more proximal landmarks and relied on significantly different modalities. FS participants referred specifically to visual information pick-up for 82% of landmarks, for example, ‘an untidy front garden’ (FS8) or ‘a white house’ (FS3). A total of 2% of landmarks were identified by audition alone. The remaining 16% were identified by multimodal means either explicitly, for example, with visual clues corroborated in sound: ‘The school is on the corner, so you might hear the children out playing’ (FS9), or implicitly, for example, by visual information that could also be perceived through other, body-based information: ‘You go down a dip’ (FS3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264619613485079">Spence and Gallace (2011)</xref> suggest that we switch our attention to whichever sense is most accurate. Fully sighted participants generally reported information in the visual modality, even though congruent information was perceived via other senses. This suggests that fully sighted people may need to make a particular effort to include information from non-visual modalities, when providing verbal orientation information for those whose sight is impaired.</p>
<p>The B&amp;PS group relied on multimodal sources for 82% of landmarks. As the majority were proximal, this may be explained by the use of the long cane, which provides auditory and tactile feedback, together with proprioceptive information through the angle of the wrist or arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264619613485079">Sauerburger &amp; Bourquin, 2010</xref>). As one man reported, ‘So then I’ll check with my white cane and ‘plonk’ if I hear the railings then I know where I am. Once the railings stop and my white cane goes round the corner . . . I know I’m at the pavement’ (B&amp;PS8). Similar to vision, the cane provides information in advance, for instance, preparing the user for a change of surface underfoot:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just inside after about a metre is a piece of carpet . . . and I tap my cane on that and the texture is obviously different from the pavement and from the tiled floor of the shop so that confirms where I am. (B&amp;PS8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, for receiving information in multiple modalities, B&amp;PS participants often cited more than one landmark at the same location. As one partially sighted participant reported, ‘The next landmark I notice is another drain on the ground and I know that at that point I’ve got to turn slightly right and also I can see that it’s lighter because there’s no building there’ (B&amp;PS1).</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, purely auditory information was used as rarely by B&amp;PS participants as by their fully sighted peers, again for only 2% of landmarks. This may be because sound can be considered both helpful and a hindrance. For one participant, the increasing volume of traffic noise indicated that she was approaching a busy road: ‘so gradually the traffic gets louder and when it gets louder I slow down [because] I’m looking for the dropped kerb on my right’ (B&amp;PS1). However, sound is hard to isolate. A loud sound source, for example, can obscure more subtle auditory cues. As one man put it, ‘My obstacle sense is slightly impaired by the roar of traffic to my right’ (B&amp;PS7). Quieter cars, however, can also be a problem in judging when to cross the road:
<disp-quote>
<p>In years gone by I would then stand and listen to traffic. When it was quiet and I couldn’t hear any vehicles coming then I’d cross. These days with Prius cars and the like which are very quiet and quite quick I tend to stand there and wait for the kindness or generosity of strangers. (B&amp;PS8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Silent obstacles can obscure auditory information reflected from the surrounding environment. Another participant explained, ‘a parked car . . . blocks sound, so then you can’t hear where the wall is when you cross over’ (B&amp;PS4). A further explanation for auditory information rarely appearing as a unimodal source may be because it is bound to other modalities. For instance, sound may be triggered by an action, such as reverberating footsteps or the strike of a cane, which may simultaneously provide body-based or tactile cues.</p>
<p>While fully sighted people showed a similar pattern in preferred modalities for both landmarks and milestones, B&amp;PS people showed a wider disparity between the two. In particular, unimodal sources were cited for 18% of landmarks but 45% of milestones. It is possible that detection of milestones is deemed to be less critical than landmark detection. As almost twice as many milestones were reported than landmarks, there was also a greater likelihood that if one was missed, another could compensate. A total of 11% of milestones were detected through audition alone (compared with 2% of landmarks) and 2% of milestones were detected by olfactory information (compared with 0% of landmarks). These were references to shops identifiable by smell: ‘I quite often know roughly where we are on that street because there’s a butcher’s and I can smell it and there’s a Subway and I can smell that as well’ (B&amp;PS1). As with sound, smell was deemed by some participants to be unreliable. One woman commented, ‘smells can be quite deceptive because sometimes you can have one smell and the next day . . . it could be covered by rain, it could be covered by somebody chopping that tree down or something’ (B&amp;PS4). Nonetheless, olfactory information featured in three B&amp;PS participants’ route descriptions (B&amp;PS1, B&amp;PS2, and B&amp;PS7). By contrast, smell was never mentioned by FS participants.</p>

<title>Body-based sensory information</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264619613485079">Waller and Greenauer (2007)</xref> found that, for sighted people, wheeling participants along a route made little difference to accuracy of their spatial memories. They speculated that ‘the transient nature of body-based information may render it particularly unsuitable for storing an enduring mental representation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264619613485079">Waller and Greenauer, 2007</xref>, p. 331). This study casts doubt on that suggestion. B&amp;PS participants mentioned the use of body-based information when identifying 16% of landmarks and 28% of milestones, in particular, reporting small changes of level, such as negotiating front door steps or stepping up onto the kerb. Three blind participants (B&amp;PS2, B&amp;PS4, and B&amp;PS5) also referred to orientation of their bodies in relation to fixed points such as walls or kerbs or to changing the angle in which they were travelling: for example, ‘I angle myself inwards towards the shop-line’ (B&amp;PS2). There were no references to speed of movement from the FS group, but two of the B&amp;PS participants commented on change of pace along certain sections of their route, for example, ‘I then reach a lamp-post conveniently sited in the middle of the pavement. This I generally slow down for and keep to the inside of’ (B&amp;PS5). Rather than body-based information being unsuitable to store in long-term memory, it is perhaps more readily accessed when external sensory information is absent or unreliable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0264619613485079">
<title>Types of landmarks, milestones, and obstacles</title>
<p>Roads were mentioned as landmarks and milestones by both sight groups, either generically, for example, ‘the main road’ (FS1) or by name, for example, ‘Geoffrey Road’ (B&amp;PS5). While sighted people might look for a sign to identify a road, for blind people this was not an option. However, knowledge of a road name was still deemed useful. One participant explained that it allowed route-details to be checked with a passer-by if necessary (B&amp;PS4). Presumably, a name may also provide a useful tag for accumulated multisensory information. Proximal landmarks and milestones that were mentioned by both groups included pedestrian crossings, gates, or flights of steps. In line with other studies, however, for the B&amp;PS group, proximal waymarkers also included smaller items of street furniture such as rubbish bins or lamp posts and continuous elements, that is, ‘<italic>shorelines</italic>’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613485079">Blasch et al., 1997</xref>), including kerbs, walls, hedges, or railings that could be followed for a particular stretch of the route. Although providing useful reassurance that they were on the right path, 75% (6 of 8) of the B&amp;PS participants referred to street furniture as obstacles to be avoided, for example, ‘There are a lot of things in the way including posts, poles and various other bits of street impedimenta but when I have negotiated all those with the stick and with my ears I carry on’ (B&amp;PS7). Moveable elements were especially problematic, for example,
<disp-quote>
<p>In spring and summer there are restaurants which have tables outside the restaurant as well as metal A-boards and God knows what else . . . And so in spring and summer after about 9 or 10 double steps, I move to the right a little bit. (B&amp;PS8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Atmospheric and temporal conditions not only alter the location of milestones but also the ability of B&amp;PS participants to identify them in a number of modalities: for example,
<disp-quote>
<p>I can detect objects by the change in the sound if the conditions are good and it’s not very windy and it’s not, say, raining. (B&amp;PS2)</p>
<p>It was very grey when I went out . . . the colours were just grey, brown, a bit of green but it was dark green so they began to merge together and I found it quite difficult to distinguish between the hedge and the ground which rather alarmed me. (B&amp;PS9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This would suggest that navigation strategies are adjusted not just according to the demands of the route, but according to the weather, ambient light conditions, the season, or time of day.</p>
<p>There was no mention of obstacles by fully sighted people presumably because sight enables a traveller to steer easily around them without consciously registering their presence. Fully sighted people may not commit moveable items to memory precisely because they are not always in the same place. However, for people with impaired vision, it is important to remember stretches of route where unpredictable objects might be encountered, in order to limit the chance of collision. It is possible that small-scale objects of the type relied on by those with impaired sight are more susceptible to change than, for example, a building or a geographical feature. Again, the number of milestones mentioned by the B&amp;PS group may reflect the fact that some might not be encountered every time that journey is undertaken. Researchers recognise that, for fully sighted people, routes are easily disrupted if a landmark or other information is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264619613485079">Bennett, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264619613485079">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>). This study confirmed that, for B&amp;PS people, the absence of milestones/obstacles can be especially problematic, for example,
<disp-quote>
<p>the pavement slopes up to the right and there’s grass . . . which is also a bit confusing. If you land on that grass you could end up skittering about for quite a bit before you get back onto your proper path. (B&amp;PS6)</p>

<title>Metrics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619613485079">Foo et al. (2005)</xref> argue that for fully sighted people, routes are best remembered as a topological network, with connectivity and ordinal relations taking preference over precise geometric relationships. They liken the resulting mental map to ‘a cartographic map printed on a rubber sheet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619613485079">Foo et al., 2005</xref>, p. 196). In this study, the FS group made equal use of specific and vague metrics, on average mentioning three of each type, and in general referring to much longer distances: ‘I follow this track for about ¾ mile’ (FS6). As it is likely that a track would offer plenty of milestones over such a distance, it seems safe to conclude that for fully sighted people, metrics, however vague, are used instead of milestones. Time is another vague metric commonly used by fully sighted people (e.g., I walk for about 5 mins) although it was not mentioned by any of this particular sample.</p>
<p>The B&amp;PS group made significantly more references to metrics overall, and these were more likely to be specific rather than vague. While the FS group used metrics in preference to milestones, B&amp;PS participants used metrics for stretches of journey where no milestones were available:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am absolutely at the door of the bank after I’ve counted 100 steps. I have got a clue at 30 steps, a zebra crossing with a butcher’s shop that I can smell and then the last 70 steps I have to count. (B&amp;PS7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the absence of environmental information, then, B&amp;PS individuals resort to abstract methods of dead reckoning, often at considerable cognitive cost: ‘I count [paces] . . . and if I’m interrupted by somebody who knows me who stops to say hello, somehow my mind now clamps onto the last number in my head so I can just pick it up’ (B&amp;PS8). Although B&amp;PS people sometimes reported vague metrics, these tended to refer to very small distances, for example, ‘I go slightly to the left’ (B&amp;PS1), whereas fully sighted people were vague about long stretches of route: ‘When I get to the end after probably 500 metres, I then turn right’ (FS1). In addition, the B&amp;PS group was more likely to report body-based metrics. Although these may seem ‘vague’ compared with objective measurements, they could be specified with great precision: for example, ‘it is normally about 25 paces . . . if I’m wearing boots it’ll be 23 or 24’ (B&amp;PS8).</p>

<sec id="section23-0264619613485079">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This was a small-scale study using participants with diverse sight characteristics describing a wide variety of routes. Participants were free to interpret the task as they wished. There was no specific instruction to give as much detail as possible. However, B&amp;PS people clearly described much more information about their journeys than their sighted peers. Assigning modality of landmarks and milestones was problematic given the potential multimodal nature of much of the information, especially that transmitted by the use of a cane. While some of the B&amp;PS group specifically referred to this, others did not, perhaps assuming knowledge on the part of the researcher who has had 20 years experience working with people with visual impairment. For the purpose of this study, all references to identification by cane have been treated as multimodal. Similarly all cues reported by fully sighted participants were regarded as multimodal unless they contained solely unimodal information, such as the colour of a building, which could only be accessed by vision. Participants were asked to describe routes that were familiar. It is likely that B&amp;PS participants had developed idiosyncratic landmarks and milestones over a length of time that may be hard to transfer to novel routes and unfamiliar environments. However, it is hoped that the general findings in terms of the importance of milestones, the types of objects and modalities of information pick-up used, can be applied in other settings.</p>

<sec id="section24-0264619613485079">
<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>The RNIB is currently exploring ways of aiding B&amp;PS people in wayfinding. One suggestion is to provide a ‘help me’ service, where a (presumably) fully sighted ‘buddy’ would provide information about a location. As irrelevant information is perceived as tiring in terms of cognitive effort and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264619613485079">Ross &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>), it is especially important that the ‘buddy’ knows what type of information is required. The same is true for those who provide orientation information for audio guides at museum and heritage sites or for curators or guides who may be asked for directions face to face. Despite the caveats above, this study suggests that highlighting small-scale milestones can help blind people keep on track between major landmarks on their journey. Descriptions should refer to multimodal characteristics, with more than one object mentioned at key points en route for the purpose of reliability and corroboration. This helps accommodate individual user differences (such as multiple sensory disability, for example, hearing loss in elderly blind people), changes in temporal or atmospheric conditions, or the exact placement of moveable objects. As fully sighted people absorb path-based information implicitly, fully sighted ‘buddies’ should be trained in making details explicit through verbalisation. Distances should be specified precisely, ideally using environmental or body-based metrics. As body-based metrics rely on individual user characteristics, however, environmental metrics may be preferable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264619613485079">Swobodzinski and Raubal (2009)</xref> point out that minimising distance (i.e., finding shortcuts to maximise speed) is not a primary objective for blind people. Instead, safety and confidence of successfully arriving at the target destination is of greater importance. Understanding the role of milestones, and recognising that small-scale ‘obstacles’ are helpful to the wayfinding process, may be the key to building confidence, allowing for successful navigation in those with impaired sight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0264619613485079">
<title>Suggestions for future research</title>
<p>This study was devoted to outdoor wayfinding techniques. This may have a direct application in terms of navigating from home to a museum, or even between buildings or around the grounds of a heritage site, but be less applicable to interior locations. Moving between galleries within a museum building, for example, may call for different techniques. Future research might compare differences in navigation strategies between internal and external environments. For instance, temperature and ambient light may provide useful cues when travelling from a large open foyer into a dimly lit gallery space. As temperature and light levels in galleries are often strictly controlled, they will be less prone to seasonal variation than similar environmental cues in outdoor settings. In addition to information content in verbal orientation guides, future research might compare the density of information, given the possibility of cognitive overload. It may also consider navigational differences according to types of mobility aid used by the traveller. In this study, all B&amp;PS participants were long-cane users. As guide dogs can provide some of the functions of vision (such as obstacle avoidance) it may be that in navigation strategy, guide dog users more closely resemble their FS rather than their B&amp;PS peers. With regard to O&amp;M trainers, one participant in this study mentioned combining learned techniques with strategies she had developed for herself (B&amp;PS4). It may be useful to identify novel solutions used on a day-to-day basis by B&amp;PS travellers. The results may be fed back into O&amp;M training courses, so that new techniques could be developed, especially in the face of changing environments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although vision is assumed to be essential for landmark identification, this study shows that people with limited or no sight successfully use landmarks as part of their navigation strategy. In contrast to fully sighted people, however, landmarks are identified through non-visual modalities, occasionally unisensorily but more often in combination. In the absence of a vista, orienting towards a landmark, and judging progress towards it by non-visual means, is accomplished by the use of multiple small-scale landmarks (milestones) along the way. Metrics are specified where milestones are not available. In descriptions given by fully sighted people, multisensory information is rarely made explicit, milestones are overlooked, and metrics are vague and sketchy for long stretches of the route. When compiling orientation information to assist those with impaired vision, details considered important by fully sighted people may not be enough. Recognising the differences in route recall, and replicating navigation strategies used by B&amp;PS people, can result in improved orientation information that is fit for purpose.</p>
