<p>As the U.S. prison population exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, sociologists of punishment focused their attention on the back-end of the penal system, seeking to comprehend the causes and consequences of mass imprisonment. With the exception of policing, the front-end of the system has received comparatively limited scrutiny. As a result, there is a dearth of rich, nuanced analyses of pretrial release practices, jail conditions, and court processes in the contemporary era. Ursula Castellano’s refreshing and insightful book, <italic>Outsourcing Justice</italic>, shows that major changes are afoot in the front-end of the system, each of which has major scholarly and policy implications.</p>
<p>Castellano conducted approximately two years of intensive fieldwork to understand the characteristics, functions, and effects of nonprofit pretrial release programs in an anonymous California county she calls “San Miguel.” In the wake of the “bail reform movement” of the 1960s, these programs developed as alternatives to financial bail. Their main functions were to evaluate low-income defendants and recommend “good cases” (i.e., those defendants who were likely to show up for court) for pretrial release without monetary bond (officially termed “release on own recognizance” and abbreviated as “OR”). As the programs spread (there are now roughly 300 in the United States), their responsibilities grew beyond evaluation and recommendation to monitoring and disciplining “clients” in the community.</p>
<p>Although Castellano’s specific focus is the role of these programs in contemporary criminal courts, her more general concern is the outsourcing of justice to nongovernmental entities—a phenomenon exemplified in pretrial release programs, but also common throughout the penal system, as seen with therapeutic courts, the bail bond industry, and private prisons, to name a few. <italic>Outsourcing Justice</italic> demonstrates that pretrial release programs (at least in San Miguel) have become central to the functioning and character of criminal courts. Castellano studied four programs, which have specific duties, organizational cultures and practices, and target populations, but “operate on the same core operating principle: to evaluate defendants for OR in lieu of bail. Caseworkers fulfill similar functions of interviewing defendants in jail; compiling an OR case with the necessary forms, references, and documentation; presenting cases to judicial authority; and supervising newly-released defendants to ensure they return to court” (p. 23). In “widening the net of possible releases,” the programs not only assist detainees who cannot afford bail, they also act as a release valve for jam-packed jails. This release function, Castellano suggests, is absolutely pivotal for counties, such as San Miguel, with persistent jail overcrowding problems. (Based on Castellano’s analysis, I imagine that California’s recent experiment with “prison realignment,” which mandates the incarceration of low-level felons in county jails rather than in state prisons, makes the pretrial release programs more critical than ever).</p>
<p>Along with facilitating and expanding non-financial pretrial release and getting defendants to court, program caseworkers routinely participate in the adjudicative process, along with judges and attorneys. They are “legal advocates” involved in pretrial conferences, providing information about defendants (gleaned through evaluations for OR) and pressing judges to divert individuals to treatment programs and away from formal prosecution and potential jail sentences. The caseworkers also assist judges and defense attorneys during plea negotiations. Because they gather extensive information on defendants and have connections to community programs (e.g., chemical dependency, work training, and housing), the caseworkers are invaluable to overtaxed (or undermotivated) court actors. Castellano gives the impression that counties with strained criminal courts and heaving jails absolutely need the pretrial programs to stay afloat.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating that the pretrial release programs are integral to San Miguel’s criminal courts, Castellano shows how they subtly challenge and obstruct the spreading of managerial (or “new penology”) practices within the courts. As in many legal institutions, there is a push toward “objective” risk management and actuarial justice within the courts. Expectedly, judges in San Miguel push pretrial release caseworkers to quantify risk and make release recommendations accordingly. With social work orientations and social justice aspirations, the caseworkers are reluctant to serve as risk managers. And though they must talk the language of risk management and proffer spreadsheets indicating released defendants’ return to court, the caseworkers thoroughly evaluate each case, considering a wide range of personal and contextual factors (many of which would not fit into rigid risk assessment tables)—that is they engage in <italic>individualized justice</italic> commonly associated with the old penology. Moreover, the caseworkers continually (and often successfully) encourage bail commissioners and judges to divert defendants to treatment in the community rather than jail. In these ways, the pretrial release programs infuse the courts with a treatment-oriented ethos commonly associated with a bygone era.</p>
<p>Whereas the caseworkers stunt managerial tendencies within the courts, they intensify them in the community. Castellano skillfully shows that the nonprofit workers (as they struggle for legitimacy in the eyes of traditional court actors) put enormous effort into monitoring and disciplining “clients” in the community. They continually check up on defendants, giving them drug tests and insisting that they participate in chemical dependency and other programs. In this regard, the caseworkers are actually stricter than judges, who simply want defendants to make their court dates and not commit new crimes. Castellano forcefully concludes that the pretrial release programs raise “the spectre of coercive compliance when justice is outsourced to nonprofit agencies” (p. 141). Outside the courts, then, caseworkers personify the new penology.</p>
<p>In all, <italic>Outsourcing Justice</italic> persuasively argues that these nongovernmental programs are consequential in the San Miguel criminal courts. At times, however, Castellano seems to overstate their power. For example, in the concluding chapter she argues that caseworkers “dictate with relative autonomy how the courts function” (p. 144). This seems hyperbolic when we consider that the previous chapter explains that the caseworkers cannot remand individuals back to jail—in other words, they have the authority to monitor defendants, but absolutely no power to force the court to re-incarcerate them. It is clear throughout the book that judges rely on caseworkers; but the caseworkers do not dictate how judges (or lawyers) operate. Notwithstanding this small criticism, Castellano makes an important contribution to the sociology of law and punishment, leaving no doubt that we disregard the front-end of the penal system and the growing tendency to outsource justice at our own peril.</p>
