<abstract>
<p>This article uses 21 in-depth interviews with viewers of the British soap opera <italic>EastEnders</italic> to investigate the extent to which it can be described, in particular through its handling of social issues, as a site of cultural citizenship and, via the concept of public service, of resistance to the current neoliberal hegemony. The article’s analysis of viewers’ talk confirms previous claims that <italic>EastEnders</italic> mobilises a nostalgic sense of community with which viewers identify, and goes on to argue that this is in fact a cultural expression of a social-democratic worldview which has lost its once-hegemonic position. Following a comparison of the British and the highly commercialised Spanish media ecosystems and their corresponding popular public spheres, the article concludes that a commitment to public service ideals contributes to sustaining spaces which, like <italic>EastEnders</italic>, can work as counter-hegemonic sites to the cultural logic of late capitalism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The live episode of <italic>EastEnders</italic> screened on BBC One on 19 February 2010 – aired to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the production – attracted an audience of 16.6 million people, with a further 1.4 million watching the repeat on BBC Three later in the evening. Although this was just over half the record audience achieved by the Christmas Day episode shown in 1986 (30.15m), it was still by a very long margin the largest audience for a television drama broadcast of any kind in the UK for almost seven years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549412457479">1</xref></sup> Outside exceptional episodes such as this, <italic>EastEnders</italic> routinely shares top position in the ratings with its great rival <italic>Coronation Street</italic>, with current figures of around 10–11m viewers, showing that even in an era of multichannel supply and fragmenting audiences it remains one of the most important cultural phenomena in British society today. In this article we investigate <italic>EastEnders</italic> not simply as a cultural phenomenon, but primarily as an equally important site of resistance (however passive) to neoliberal ideology and, via the concept of public service, of (at least potential) cultural citizenship.</p>
<p>Our argument is not that popular culture as a whole remains a locus of opposition to this ideology – indeed, we will show unequivocally that this is not the case – but similarly, we reject any suggestion that the media in general merely operate as a kind of ‘neoliberalized sediment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367549412457479">Phelan, 2011</xref>: 128), and would wish to eschew any unidirectional ‘monolithic grand narrative about the relationship between neoliberalism, media and democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367549412457479">2011</xref>: 130). What we will argue is that certain conditions, among them the persistence of a public service ethos, can enable the maintenance of popular cultural (televisual) spaces where such opposition can be identified just as clearly: this allows us to problematise the concept of a neoliberal hegemony as such. In classic Gramscian terminology, hegemony is achieved when there is very widespread support ‘throughout society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457479">Gramsci, 2000</xref>: 306) for the societal project of the political and economic elites. In this sense, the postwar social democratic settlement in the UK was indeed a hegemony: it enjoyed extended support among all social classes and ‘broadly a spirit of “consensus” prevailed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412457479">Marwick: 1991</xref>: 16). However, our analysis of <italic>EastEnders</italic> will suggest that while neoliberal ideology may remain dominant – with of course a certain amount of variation and inflection over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457479">Harvey, 2005</xref>) – at the level of political rhetoric, it has not achieved truly hegemonic status in the UK, since it has failed to successfully colonise important sectors of popular culture and civil society more generally and, as Gramsci has argued, hegemony requires ‘the “accrediting” of the cultural fact, of cultural activity, of a cultural front alongside the merely economic and political ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457479">2000</xref>: 194).</p>
<p>In this article we attempt above all to respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457479">Livingstone’s (1998)</xref> earlier call for a research agenda which connects audience research not just with production studies and textual analysis, but also more importantly with an examination of the broader media policy context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457479">Livingstone, 1998</xref>), in order to understand better the complex dynamics between communication policies and the ways in which people and/or communities tend to interpret media texts. This article offers a modest contribution in that direction: the audience research findings analysed here are approached both from within and from beyond the main traditions of theorising media texts, with at least a partial aim of suggesting questions for further research.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367549412457479">
<title>Citizenship, resistance and the public sphere: concepts in transition</title>
<p>In contemporary understandings, ‘citizenship’ connotes either active engagement with the already existing institutions of civil society and with formal political processes – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549412457479">Habermas’ (1989)</xref> idealised bourgeois public sphere – or, more recently, various forms of grass roots activity operating outside, and to some extent in opposition to, those established institutions and procedures. In both of these meanings it is now seen by many as somehow under threat, facing the imminent (or already present) ‘replacement of the Citizen by the Consumer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1367549412457479">Wray, 2001</xref>: 138). However, what is clear is that active citizenship of either of these kinds is not simply a question of legal entitlement: it requires access to a range of resources. These can be financial – it is not for nothing that the poor in many countries are referred to as ‘second-class citizens’ – but also can be educational and, at a time of increasing mediatisation of public and private life, above all, cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549412457479">Dahlgrén, 2006</xref>). Here, we will follow Van Zoonen’s suggestion that, far from being legal-technical in nature, ‘citizenship is not something that pertains if it is not expressed in everyday talk and actions, both in the public and the private domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1367549412457479">2005</xref>: 123). News, current affairs and other classic public service formats have long been seen as the traditional vehicles for such ‘public talk’, while popular media genres, with a few exceptions, have been largely ignored in these debates. This article, by contrast, addresses <italic>EastEnders</italic> itself as a form of public service, raising issues not just of private but also of public concern. We agree here with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457479">Hermes (1998)</xref> that popular cultural formats such as soap operas, with their very precise focus on ‘everyday talk and actions’, indeed can offer a contribution to citizenship: in this case, to a cultural citizenship expressing adherence to an identifiable model of society that is, in important senses, at odds with the individualising discourses of neo-liberalism.</p>
<p>The concepts of resistance and active audience, both connected to the notion of active citizenship, have been subjected to a great deal of criticism arising from research showing that resistance and subversion among audiences are not necessarily as challenging as they sometimes had been taken to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1367549412457479">Schiller, 1989</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457479">Livingstone, 1998</xref>). For example, in his study of the 1999 Brazilian serial <italic>Terra Nostra</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367549412457479">Porto (2005)</xref> agrees that the <italic>telenovela</italic> genre is a fundamental part of the Brazilian public sphere, and that viewers frequently see <italic>telenovelas</italic> as authoritative sources of information about the world of politics; however, he also argues that by presenting restricted content within a single interpretative frame, <italic>Terra Nostra</italic> contributed to narrowing the range of interpretations available for viewers to make sense of political issues.</p>
<p>Here, Porto rehearses the well-known problematic of the constraining power of textual structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457479">Roland Barthes’ (1972)</xref> ‘readable/writable’ dichotomy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549412457479">2</xref></sup> was among the first theorisations in the second half of the 20th century to open up a space for the ‘reader in the text’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457479">Eco’s (1979)</xref> ‘lector in fabula’ – although ‘writable’ texts were, in Barthes’ view, beyond the reach of the ‘average reader, who can only grasp a median portion of the plural’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457479">1972</xref>: 6). For Porto, the <italic>telenovela</italic> remains a ‘readable’ (Barthes) or ‘closed’ (Eco) text, channelling audience interpretation through its internal structural imperatives. Our focus in this article is not so much on any inherently constraining (or otherwise) potentialities of the <italic>EastEnders</italic> text (although we agree that this is an important consideration, and do address it to some extent). Rather, it is on what the <italic>audience</italic> – or at least what specific audience members – do with that text, on the ways in which they are able to make connections between that text and broader social issues and, above all, on how the macro-media environment affects that overall relationship.</p>
<p>The question of broader sociopolitical and media environments and how individuals relate to these discursively takes us inevitably to a consideration of the public sphere. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549412457479">Habermas’ (1989)</xref> strictures on the deterioration of the classic bourgeois public sphere following the emergence of the commercial press in the 19th century are well known: he argues that conversations informed by a logic of rational debate have been appropriated by news organisations driven by profit, and required as a result to shape their texts to what they perceive to be their readers’ preferences and/or their advertisers’ needs. These increasing concerns regarding the ongoing first and now the second internet-driven structural transformation of the classic bourgeois public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549412457479">Blanken and Deuze, 2007</xref>) have been accompanied by growing interest in alternative public spheres – or even ‘sphericules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549412457479">Cunningham, 2001</xref>) – as sites where engagement with public debate remains alive using different strategies and resources. Our aim in this article is to examine <italic>EastEnders</italic> through its relationship with its audience as a key player in the British <italic>cultural</italic> public sphere, as defined by McGuigan:<disp-quote>
<p>The concept of a cultural public sphere refers to the articulation of politics, public and personal, as a contested terrain through affective (aesthetic and emotional) modes of communication. The cultural public sphere trades in pleasures and pains that are experienced vicariously through willing suspension of disbelief; for example, by watching soap operas, identifying with the characters and their problems, talking and arguing with friends and relatives about what they should and should not do. Images of the good life and expectations of what can be got out of this life are mediated mundanely through entertainment and popular media discourses. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457479">2005</xref>: 434)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, we view <italic>EastEnders</italic> as a cultural resource contributing not so much to the classic public sphere as to what is increasingly known as the popular public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549412457479">Buonanno, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412457479">Lamuedra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549412457479">O’Donnell, 2007</xref>), itself a subsection of the cultural public sphere, and thereby enabling both meaningful forms of cultural citizenship and (at least to some extent) resistance to current neoliberal discourses. We agree with the conclusion drawn by Tufte in his study of Brazilian <italic>telenovelas</italic>, that ‘in some cases television fiction becomes politically more influential than news broadcasts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1367549412457479">2000</xref>: 227), and that ‘on a macro-sociological level, television fiction influences the construction and articulation of cultural citizenship and the sociocultural and symbolic construction of modern and democratic societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1367549412457479">2000</xref>: 227). Therefore, our overall approach is broadly neo-Gramscian, seeing popular culture and the cultural public sphere as key sites where the negotiation of social values – that is, the struggle for hegemony – takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457479">Gramsci, 2000</xref>: 364–370).</p>

<title><italic>EastEnders</italic> and its audience</title>
<p>What follows is an analysis of 21 interviews undertaken with viewers of <italic>EastEnders</italic>. Despite its continuing dominance of the ratings, academic interest in the relationship between <italic>EastEnders</italic> and its audience has been relatively sporadic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457479">Buckingham’s (1987)</xref> early study, based on 12 focus groups bringing together 60 young people between the ages of seven and 18 – an interesting but relatively small sector of the overall audience – was followed a year later by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457479">Livingstone’s (1988)</xref> broader analysis, using written responses, of why British viewers of the 1980s watched soap operas in general, <italic>EastEnders</italic> among them. Two later studies were based on surveys and involved no direct contact with audience members or offered any opportunity to experience the discourses that they use to talk of their relationship with the programme: one was entirely quantitative in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549412457479">Middleham and Mallory Wober, 1997</xref>), and the other adopted a more qualitative, grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457479">Madill and Goldmeier, 2003</xref>). A piece of research commissioned by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367549412457479">National Family and Parenting Institute (2002)</xref> focused primarily on how soaps in general can be used to stimulate family discussion of often-difficult topics, a similar focus to the British Broadcasting Standards Commission’s study of the same year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367549412457479">Millwood Hargrave and Gatfield, 2002</xref>). The chapter on audience response in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457479">Henderson’s (2007)</xref> more recent study of social issues in television fiction is dedicated entirely to the now defunct UK soap opera, <italic>Brookside</italic> (1982–2003).</p>

<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>The participants consisted of 11 men and 10 women aged 18–55 and from a range of social classes. The interviews were carried out in 2008 among regular viewers of <italic>EastEnders</italic>, that is those who watch most episodes or catch up through the weekend omnibus editions. They took place in London and in the mainly rural Devon area. Fifteen of the participants were of English origin, although only four of these had been raised in the London area. There was also one Welsh and one Scottish interviewee and a further four from Ireland, Argentina, Spain and Paris who had lived in the UK for more than 10 years. Participants were selected using snowball sampling techniques. The interviews lasted between 40 and 100 minutes and were semi-structured, but interviewers were instructed to make sure the conversation included the following six areas or themes:</p>
<list id="list1-1367549412457479" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>general habits regarding television consumption;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>particular habits regarding the consumption of <italic>EastEnders</italic> (how often they watched it, with whom, whether they talked to others about it);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what they liked and disliked in the soap;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether they considered <italic>EastEnders</italic> to be realistic, and if so in what ways;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>which characters they liked most and least and why; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>viewers’ notions of public service television, and whether they viewed <italic>EastEnders</italic> as being in any way a public service programme.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The interviews were designed to be carried out in this order when possible; however the interviewers were professionals trained to respect the flow of conversations, let the viewers speak and encourage ‘vividness, nuance and detail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1367549412457479">Rubin and Rubin, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The project on which this article is based was itself part of a much larger comparative study of the relationship between producers, television texts and viewers in Spanish public service television (TVE) and the BBC, covering their respective soap operas and news output. Although our focus here is primarily on <italic>EastEnders</italic>, we will bring in insights from the overarching study as and when appropriate.</p>

<title>Findings and discussion</title>
<sec id="section7-1367549412457479">
<title><italic>EastEnders</italic>, realism, social issues and the news</title>
<p>As Longhurst correctly points out, ‘Realism is one of the most disputed terms used in cultural analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412457479">1987</xref>: 634), and indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412457479">Hall (2004)</xref> enumerates no fewer than six criteria for evaluating the realism of televisual texts – plausibility, typicality, factuality, emotional involvement, narrative consistency and perceptual persuasiveness – none of which quite seem to work in the present participants’ understanding of the <italic>EastEnders</italic> text.</p>
<p>Analysis of the interview data shows a significant bifurcation in the ways in which viewers judge <italic>EastEnders</italic> to be realistic or unrealistic, although we should note that there is no evidence that they experience this as being in any way an unresolvable contradiction. It is abundantly clear that there is a level at which they do not find the programme remotely realistic or believable; the terms most frequently used in this respect being ‘exaggerated’, ‘far-fetched’, ‘stretching things’, ‘over the top’, ‘overboard’, ‘extreme’, even ‘ridiculous’ or ‘surreal’. These evaluations of the programme refer without exception to the density of its narrative fabric, the sheer number of (mostly ghastly) things going on simultaneously in the compressed space of Albert Square, for example: ‘There’s no way that you can have that much happen in one square’ (Robert, vessel maker, 25). Although no one views this as in any sense realistic, there is widespread understanding that it is the entirely expected result of the requirements of producing entertaining drama:<disp-quote>
<p>If it was exactly like real life no one would watch it. All that would happen would be what happens to people in their everyday lives. There has to be a story, a plot, or something interesting. (Angela, social worker, 50)</p>
<p>Since it’s a soap it’s obvious everything’s exaggerated, but everything has to be exaggerated because it only lasts half an hour. (John, high school administrator, 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite this, there is just as widespread agreement that <italic>EastEnders</italic> is realistic in other aspects (e.g. its characters, the London setting), the way in which it works social issues into its narratives being above all what gives it its greatest sense of realism. Indeed, this was the factor that achieved the greatest level of unanimity among the participants (20 out of 21) as a sign of realism, with some offering more detailed explanations of how the programme ‘reflects’ elements of British society:<disp-quote>
<p>It all happens to the same person so, you know, I’m not convinced that that bit is realistic, but the issues that people have affairs … people have teenage pregnancies, etc … people get AIDS, people do have breakdowns or whatever – they all happen, so they are realistic. (Ian, IT technician, 43)</p>
<p>There is this group of kids, but you know, you find them everywhere in London and you see them around the UK, where you’ve got … a large group of teenagers of maybe 11 years old to 16 years old, and they would pick on someone: like in this case there was an elderly lady, and they scared her into leaving her house, they broke into her house, and you hear about these kinds of things every day on the news really … those kinds of things are tried to be portrayed to the viewer like on the news. (Rose, civil servant, 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this last quote suggests, there was a notable tendency among the participants – reflecting the findings of a number of academic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457479">Henderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457479">O’Donnell, 1999</xref>) – to link the social issues covered by <italic>EastEnders</italic> with the news. Without being asked about this or being prompted in any way to do so, four participants offered quite explicit references to this link. One volunteered the following:<disp-quote>
<p>At the moment they’re doing a story on … a teenager and a knife in London. It’s pretty realistic … That happens all the time. So, things like that, yeah. They do … tend to go along with what’s going on in the news and things like that. (Steve, investment manager, 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another agreed that the issues raised were the same as those appearing in ‘recent stories in the media’, while a further two used more general terms such as ‘topical issues’ or ‘what’s happening right now’. Thus while for some academic commentators the news is becoming a form of soap opera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1367549412457479">Piedrahita, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1367549412457479">Sanctorum and Thevissen, 2009</xref>) – a development that they view as inherently negative – for some soap opera viewers these productions fulfil at least some of the functions of the news: a situation which they do not find in any way contradictory. In fact at least one industry insider, Pepe Enberg, chair of the Swedish publishing giant MTG Media, felt that soap operas were more successful at raising certain public issues than the news:<disp-quote>
<p>I was on the lead group for the news bulletin <italic>Rapport</italic> when they were looking for some help in understanding why they had lost a quarter of a million viewers to the soap opera <italic>Friends and Enemies</italic>, which was on at the same time. One reason is that I think that <italic>Friends and Enemies</italic> is a better news programme. If anything is socially aware it’s a programme where people talk and talk about human relations, crime, racism, big questions, existential questions. You can find something like that in every line in soaps, and in a way which people can understand. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549412457479">Lahger and Svensson, 2003</xref>: 244)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The connections that participants see between soaps and news point clearly to viewers’ ability to exploit them as sources of information about their society which are ‘more open than the news’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457479">Henderson, 2007</xref>: 9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549412457479">3</xref></sup></p>

<title><italic>EastEnders</italic>: a form of public service?</title>
<p>The low social prestige enjoyed by television serials in general (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457479">Eco, 1985</xref>) – and the defence mechanisms of irony and appeals to entertainment or escapism, which at least some viewers mobilise to justify watching them, described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549412457479">Ang (1985)</xref> in her study of <italic>Dallas</italic> under the heading ‘The Ideology of Popular Culture’ – are well known, and we had relatively little expectation that viewers would see <italic>EastEnders</italic> in terms of public service. It came as no real surprise that seven out of the 21 participants responded in the negative to a question regarding the existence of such a relationship, adducing the expected arguments of lack of seriousness – seen as the prerogative of news and current affairs – and a focus on entertainment and/or escapism:<disp-quote>
<p>I think [public service] means those … they have lots of those kind of educational shows which educate the public, you know. It’s a public service, so they should do everything that they can for us. (Liz, carer, 32)</p>
<p>Public service? The obvious one is news. News, the main issues … Public service is, you know, not necessarily, but generally actuality goes first. Documentaries. (William, accountant, 40)</p>
<p>Well, I think a public service programme has to be less fictional … like the news, maybe. News-type programmes, some styles of documentaries, maybe <italic>Panorama</italic>, that kind of thing, I don’t know. Some other kind of hard talk programmes. (Harry, NGO administrator, 37)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A further four also answered the question ‘Do you think that <italic>EastEnders</italic> is a public service programme?’ in the negative, albeit in a rather more hesitant manner: although they acknowledged that <italic>EastEnders</italic> raised important social issues, they felt that the mere fact of being a soap opera probably put it beyond what they understood as public service:<disp-quote>
<p>No [laughing] … I should say ‘maybe’, but no, it doesn’t – but in a way I can see that it could be for some people. (Liz, carer, 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such hesitancy suggests a concept in a process of change, to some extent supporting Bourdon’s recent conclusion that in an era of reality TV, ‘the public can no longer identify [public service television] clearly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412457479">2011</xref>: 229).</p>
<p>Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412457479">Ofcom’s (2004)</xref> study of public service broadcasting in the UK showed that audiences took the view ‘that some early-evening programmes, including soaps, have an important social role to play in airing complex and controversial issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412457479">2004</xref>: 10), that they ‘offer more than simply entertainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412457479">2004</xref>: 52) and that there is ‘a widespread view that soaps can bring important social benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412457479">2004</xref>: 58). This was reflected in the present study, with nine participants agreeing that <italic>EastEnders</italic> could be classified as a public service programme: they variously described the topics raised as ‘serious’, ‘relevant’ or ‘important’, and did not find this to be in contradiction with its entertainment function:<disp-quote>
<p>They also bring in real-life problems … at the end of the programme they’ll give a helpline number, so that if anyone who is watching is affected by those problems they can call and get help. It can be disabilities, blindness, accidents – all those things are reflected, and in that way they do offer a public service. (Liz, carer, 32)</p>
<p>Yes … it covers a lot of social issues. (David, chef, 26)</p>
<p>Yes, probably it is because … it tries to reflect a lot of what is going on in our society today, and yes, I really, really do … enjoy it, and I find it rather entertaining to watch. (Nick, student, 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such views, we would argue, have partly to do with the nature of the BBC itself as seen both by its producers and viewers. The BBC has long been the recipient of much criticism from British academics, especially in the 1990s, for being too managerialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412457479">McGuigan, 1996</xref>), centralist and elitist (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549412457479">Born, 2003</xref>). However, while we do not underestimate in any way the force of such criticism, it would be quite wrong to suggest that a commitment to a public service ethos has disappeared entirely, taking the institution as a whole: in fact, at many levels it remains very much alive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412457479">Levy, 2008</xref>), and this sense of a public service ethos is not limited to factual programming such as the news. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549412457479">Castelló et al’s (2009)</xref> interviews with scriptwriters of soaps commissioned by public service broadcasting corporations in both Catalonia and Scotland revealed a marked sense of public service at work there too. Neither is such an ethos limited to the BBC: it is precisely such a public service ethos, operating within a broader public service broadcasting ecosystem, that explains the British Broadcasting Standards Commission’s initiative to undertake a qualitative study ‘which looked at the role of soap operas within the family to see how far the public at large would support the complaints that the Commission receives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367549412457479">Millwood Hargrave and Gatfield, 2002</xref>: 2), which was the driving force behind Ofcom’s three-phase study (2004–2005) of public service television broadcasting itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367549412457479">4</xref></sup></p>

<title><italic>EastEnders</italic>, the BBC and active cultural citizenship</title>
<p>It is of course possible to view <italic>EastEnders</italic>, as Porto sees the Brazilian <italic>telenovelas</italic>, as a site of popular culture where opposition to elite hegemony is contained and to some extent structurally neutralised, or as characterised by Williams’s ‘indicative’ realism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1367549412457479">1979</xref>: 218), which offers no sense of alternatives to the status quo. Longhurst argued that ‘soap operas block collective solutions to social issues and raised problems by resolving these within the confines of the home and the tight-knit community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412457479">1987</xref>: 634), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549412457479">Geraghty (1995)</xref> contended that the social and political issues raised by soaps such as <italic>EastEnders</italic> are constantly deflected and contained by being placed firmly within the framework of the family. In addition, if everyday viewing and talking about <italic>EastEnders</italic> were to be read as what Nick Couldry has defined as a ‘media ritual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457479">2003</xref>: 24), any sense of outward linkages between text, viewers and society more generally would be lost. According to Couldry, media rituals are one of the ‘practices through which the arbitrariness of the limits around participation in the media sphere – that is, media institutions’ heavy concentrations of symbolic power – is naturalised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412457479">2003</xref>: 29). All media claim to speak for us all, thereby naturalising the fact that generally we do not speak for ourselves, a process connected to the management of conflict and the masking of social inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412457479">Couldry, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, on the basis of the present interviews, this claim appears to be hard to substantiate. Using Eco’s terminology, television news can be argued – at least from the perspective of many of its potential viewers – to be a closed text: the producers retain a tight grip on the provision and sequencing of information, and while contending arguments are routinely heard, they remain resolutely within Hallin’s ‘sphere of legitimate controversy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549412457479">1989</xref>: 117). The visual and linguistic aspects of the production (the studio décor and technology, dress and speech codes) are alien or even intimidating for many viewers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549412457479">O’Donnell, 2007</xref> for a detailed analysis), and the <italic>dramatis personae</italic> can seem far removed from viewers’ everyday lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549412457479">Morley, 1999</xref>). The present interview data suggest, in contrast, that <italic>EastEnders</italic> appears to offer a number of mechanisms which allow its viewers to ‘enter into’ the text and use it to interpret their own lives and place in society, as well as those of others: its sense of audience-near ‘realism’ (as defined above), characters and settings which in some way seem ‘familiar’, and forms of language that its viewers do not associate with positions of authority. It also clearly offers them resources for forms of active engagement. The following quote is particularly interesting, as it shows how one participant was able not only to relate a particular storyline to his own life, but was able to learn how to deal with the issue in question from it:<disp-quote>
<p>You know, there was the [story about] the bloke who used to batter his missus, and … oddly enough there was … a friend of mine … who was in a similar relationship and … she just couldn’t, you know, ‘Oh no, I failed – oh no, I did this’ … Then it was suddenly on the television and … two weeks after <italic>EastEnders</italic> tackled this, someone knocked on the door about two in the morning, and she said: ‘I left him – you were right, please can I stay?’ <italic>…</italic> She stayed with me for, say, two or three weeks … I got a lot of what I did to try and help her from the television … She got her life back in general, she got married … she’s got kids now and [is] happy as Larry, but … a soap opera had never done or … I’d ever seen this sort of thing being shown on the telly. (Ian, IT technician, 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Comments such as these recall similar opinions voiced in Gauntlett and Hill’s longitudinal study of 500 UK television viewers:<disp-quote>
<p>A few years ago we seen [<italic>sic</italic>] a Down’s syndrome [person] was featured for one or two episodes, <italic>EastEnders</italic> showed a disabled person in a wheelchair. I have set myself a task to help such people gain access which isn’t easy – I am well aware that when some people see cerebral palsy, they say it disgusts them, but television can help to abolish ignorance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549412457479">1999</xref>: 133)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another of the participants – quite explicitly mobilising the window metaphor first attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412457479">Thomas Hutchinson (1946)</xref>, and now often applied to news and documentaries by their producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367549412457479">Mehl, 1992</xref>) – suggested that although the soap did not deal with issues from her own life, it did relate to those of others:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s difficult to say [what is most realistic], in a way it’s interesting learning about things not necessarily related to your life, but you could say that could happen in someone else’s life. So that’s more like … a window into what could happen in others’ lives, more than relating to yours. (Harry, NGO administrator, 36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whatever the structural limitations of the soap opera form itself may be, viewers seem able to use <italic>EastEnders</italic> to relate to issues that go beyond their own personal experience, being located in a community which transcends them, and whose effects impact individuals or groups with whom they may have no direct contact. However, there is more to the phenomenon than this.</p>

<title><italic>EastEnders</italic>, nostalgia and ideological resistance</title>
<p><italic>Coronation Street</italic>’s origins in a ‘Northern realism’ aesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412457479">Dunleavy, 2005</xref>: 372) were influential in the way that it ‘looks back nostalgically to the days of the supposed organic working class community in closely packed terraced streets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412457479">Longhurst, 1987</xref>: 638), and although <italic>EastEnders</italic> was designed originally to ‘adopt a setting and themes that allowed consistent focus on “contemporary reality”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367549412457479">Palmer, 1991</xref>: 157), it has been clear from the outset that its peculiar brand of realism also contained a heavy dose of similar nostalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457479">McGuigan, 2005</xref>). A key element for our overall analysis is that this was picked up by a number of the participants who felt that, rather than ‘reflecting’ London as it is now, <italic>EastEnders</italic> offered a view of the city and, above all, of community life which they located more as in the past, as looking ‘like the East London of 10 years ago’ (Sara, membership assistant/acting student, 26) or dealing with ‘the morals of years ago’ (William, accountant, 40):<disp-quote>
<p>When I was a child growing up [in London] … you could have lifted it from the set of <italic>Coronation Street</italic> … you know, streets and in the back the next house and stuff, and you knew everybody. When we moved away from London [then] when I came back and suddenly nobody, literally nobody, would talk to anybody, you know – you had to go to a pub I don’t know how many times before they … you become sort of part of the furniture and then, you know … people would talk to you but it was very odd … so <italic>EastEnders</italic>, you know, I didn’t recognise that, oh everybody going into everybody else’s house … I’ve never known a London like that, but I do believe that it was the stereotype of what London was like in the 1960s and 1970s. (Ian, IT technician, 43)</p>
<p>I like … the community, the community they’ve got there … I’m not sure it’s still like that in real life, with people sharing their problems, and although lots of horrible things happen in the square they’re still very close-knit, and if anyone has a problem they respond as a community. There seems to be a link binding them together, although later on they’re at each other’s throats. Deep down they seem to care for each other and the community where they live. I think, I don’t know, I think there are still communities somewhere, I don’t think they’ve disappeared altogether, but I think it’s a bit exaggerated in the soap … it seems more like something from the 1960s or 1970s where everyone pulled together in a community, and when something bad happens everyone seems to get together and help out, although at other times they hate each other. (Angela, social worker, 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How are we to account for this combination of acknowledged (unrealistic) nostalgia with the strong sense of realism found in other parts of the production – one of a number of apparent contradictions which the participants do not appear to find incompatible? We would like to suggest an explanation at the level of discourse and ideology rather than at the level of any simple realism. This recollection of a ‘London of the past’ in <italic>EastEnders</italic> recalls a kind of ‘memory magic’ also found in ‘real life’. In her study of the inhabitants of the district of Hillesluis in Rotterdam – a district which many older residents no longer ‘recognised’ due to very significant changes in the ethnic make-up of its population – Blokland’s participant observation identified similar reminiscences:<disp-quote>
<p>It used to be good place to live, they agreed. ‘You never locked the front door. People popped in and out each other’s houses. There was trust. Everybody knew each other. No one could rob you [in broad] daylight without anybody helping you, back then.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412457479">2005</xref>: 123)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as Blokland demonstrates in her research, this vision of the past is essentially mythic. This collective reconstruction of a homogeneous working-class community (which never in fact existed as such) is, she argues, both a symptom and an expression of loss of identification, and even to some extent of control:<disp-quote>
<p>The image of decaying neighbourhoods as once local, close-knit, working class communities is often inaccurate … and reflects the representations of those who dominated discourses at the time and are now used as sources. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412457479">2005</xref>: 124)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the context is different, we can offer a similar tentative interpretation of the old-world feel of <italic>EastEnders</italic> and its close-knit community, its <italic>Heimat</italic>-like ‘mythical bond rooted in a lost past, a past that has already disintegrated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367549412457479">Morley and Robbins, 1993</xref>: 7). <italic>EastEnders</italic> offers neither a representation of London as it is now, nor even of London as it ever was. On the contrary, it is the expression of a community-oriented worldview that is in many ways at odds with the dominant individualising discourses of neo-liberalism: while class structures in postwar social democratic Britain remained firmly in place, the dominant discourse then was ‘of “fair shares”, equal citizenship and pulling together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412457479">Marwick, 1991</xref>: 15) and of ‘running the country in the best interests of everyone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412457479">1991</xref>: 16), while the dominant discourse of the neo-liberalism which replaced the social democratic settlement in the last quarter of the 20th century was one where ‘[a]ll forms of social solidarity were to be dissolved in favour of individualism, private property, personal responsibility, and family values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457479">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 23). Indeed, with its proliferation of small businesses and local markets, <italic>EastEnders</italic> remains at a narrative level located in a pre-neo-liberal, pre-multinational past. Therefore <italic>EastEnders</italic>’ ‘realism’ is not one based wholly on either the current or previous versions of the referent ‘London’, but on the programme’s ability to re-present a community-oriented worldview with strong social democratic connotations: as O’Donnell put it on the basis of his wide-ranging analysis of European soaps in the 1990s, ‘soaps in Britain are the symbolic refuge of an embattled social-democratic worldview’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457479">1999</xref>: 225). They are pre-Thatcherite rather than post-Thatcherite, a ghost in the neo-liberal machine, waiting for the return of better days.</p>
<p>This view, then, sees <italic>EastEnders</italic> as a site of resistance to the currently dominant (although not fully hegemonic) neo-liberal worldview, in the same fashion that soaps have been described as a site of resistance to male hegemony, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549412457479">Brown, 1994</xref>), or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549412457479">Fiske (1987)</xref> has understood popular media texts more generally. Its sheer longevity shows that in this case at least, neo-liberal ideology has not succeeded in ‘marginalizing and obscuring those aspects of social life … that are inconsistent with its own totalizing assumptions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1367549412457479">Phelan and Dahlberg, 2011</xref>: 22), and that there remain places where, as Harvey argues, ‘consent … has failed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457479">2005</xref>: 40). The present participants value <italic>EastEnders</italic> as a form of (alternative) public service and as an element of a popular cultural public sphere which allows them to link with their society on a broader level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1367549412457479">
<title>Texts, readers and media ecosystems</title>
<p>Returning to our earlier statements regarding audience analysis, we would like to suggest an additional approach to the text–reader relationship to those mentioned above: one which, as Livingstone suggests, attempts to place this within a larger institutional and societal framework, and thereby helps us to map out <italic>EastEnders</italic>’ role better as a site of ideological resistance.</p>
<p>In their study of European soaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549412457479">Livingstone and Liebes (1998)</xref> concluded that community soaps such as <italic>EastEnders</italic> tend to be produced in a spirit of public service broadcasting and so are more likely to problematise, for example, gender issues in a conscious attempt to transmit social messages. Such a commitment to a broader public service ethos is not only to be found in Britain: for example, recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412457479">Castelló (2010)</xref> has shown that in Catalonia – the region with the most solid public service broadcasting tradition in Spain – the producers of the community soaps <italic>El Cor de la Ciutat</italic> and <italic>Ventdelplà</italic> were careful and conscientious about the soaps’ role in society, ‘about showing all points of view’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412457479">2010</xref>: 214), about sending a message concerning domestic violence or following the cultural policy of promoting the Catalan language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412457479">Castelló, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, where a well-established and institutionally supported public service ethos is either absent or weak, audiences’ readings of television serials appear to move in quite a different direction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457479">Giomi’s (2005)</xref> study of the Italian community soap <italic>Vivere</italic>, for example, argues that while the community it creates is similar to that found in other European soaps in that it offers a network of mutual solidarity, audience reception data shows that this was not the main reason why viewers said they liked it. Instead they stressed the role of the family and its lower level of sexual promiscuity, when compared to American serials, as the ways in which they recognised it as being closer to ‘home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457479">Giomi, 2005</xref>). This way of offering the public some recognisable ‘Italianness’ had to coexist with production values modelled on those of the American serials: the mansions, good looks and stylish clothes had been so internalised by the audience members who took part in Giomi’s research that they were not even commented upon, the social hold of the American productions being illustrated clearly by the fact that the American soap <italic>The Bold and the Beautiful</italic> was referred to spontaneously as a benchmark by all participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457479">Giomi, 2005</xref>). This difference from <italic>EastEnders</italic>’ reception can be explained at least partially by the fact that from the mid-1970s onwards, the transition from a monopoly broadcasting system to a mixed public service/commercial one in Italy resulted in increasing numbers of foreign TV films and series, which weakened the narrative force within TV national fiction.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, for several decades Spain has been characterised by one of the most liberalised media systems in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1367549412457479">Zallo, 2010</xref>), its programming having been profoundly marked by the entrance of commercial channels in the early 1990s. In particular, when compared with its British counterpart, the Spanish broadcasting ecosystem – including the public service broadcaster TVE, whose funding regime was until recently heavily dependent on advertising – was not only highly commercialised but also significantly unregulated, with an at-best confused and underdeveloped sense of public service; and in the case of the commercial channels, this sense being almost entirely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1367549412457479">Piedrahita, 2010</xref>). Our interviews with the scriptwriters of the historical soap <italic>Amar en tiempos revueltos</italic> (broadcast during 2007–2008) show that they valued what they saw as the quality of British series and dramas and the resources the BBC invests in them. They also valued the Spanish series made by TVE in the 1970s and 1980s, complaining that the arrival of commercial television in Spain in the early 1990s and the deregulation which accompanied it stalled the production of national fiction for a number of years. Some took the view that by undertaking radical reform in 2006 in order to improve its public service profile (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549412457479">Bustamante, 2006</xref>) TVE was finally starting to invest again in high-quality national fiction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367549412457479">5</xref></sup> with an identifiable public service dimension, offering its viewers resources to understand better the recent history of Spain and stimulating debate around the values on which Spanish society should be built.</p>
<p>In that media context, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412457479">Lamuedra’s (2007)</xref> study, during the first years of the 21st-century celebrity shows occupied the same central place in the Spanish media landscape in terms of both scheduling and popularity – and indeed in the Spanish popular public sphere more generally – as soaps occupied in the UK. Lamuedra’s study analysed more than 50 viewers’ comments in relation to the peculiarly Spanish phenomenon of <italic>famosillos. Famosillo</italic>, the pejorative diminutive of <italic>famoso</italic> (‘famous’), captures their status concisely: the <italic>famosillo</italic> is not even ‘known for his well-knownness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549412457479">Boorstin, 1962</xref>: 67): their fame derives entirely from a relationship with some other famous person. The televisual texts relating to these minor celebrities were extraordinarily lax, even incoherent at times, not only inviting audience participation but also (quite deliberately) open to unscripted audience intrusion of all kinds. Neither Barthes’ ‘writerly’ category nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549412457479">Eco’s (1989)</xref> concept of the ‘open work’ seem adequate to grasp the tumultuous nature of some of these texts, with their tangled skein of speculations, jokes, accusations and vociferous opinions. Despite the extraordinarily ‘open’ nature of these texts, they could not be interpreted in any sense as celebratory instances of resistive public engagement with dominant values – reinforcing the conclusion of Couldry et al.’s study that while ‘the news media support and stimulate [civic] participation (although not necessarily public action), interestingly, an interest in celebrity undermines it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549412457479">2010</xref>: 171). On the contrary: these programmes were deeply colonised by the ideology of the free market (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549412457479">Gilbert, 2011</xref>), with actions of all kinds, including the morally reprehensible, being evaluated in terms of the likelihood of financial return. While the readers or viewers of such texts at no times mobilised a consciously neoliberal discourse, their comments foregrounded the importance of personal success no matter what the cost, and showed a wide acceptance of the priority of the market over broader ethical considerations, revealing some level of acceptance of that ideology.</p>
<p>Therefore, this last group of texts complicates existing concepts and vocabulary even further: ‘writable’ yet resolutely low-brow, ‘open’ to the point of caricature – they might be characterised as ‘gaping’ rather than merely ‘open’ – yet suffused by hegemonising neo-liberal values. In addition to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457479">Cubells’ (2003)</xref> study, based on her own experience as a producer of television shows of this kind, reveals that the extraordinary openness of these texts is part of a deliberate strategy by commercial television companies to generate conflict and attract the interest of other media, thereby leading to increased audiences and profits.</p>
<p>That the concept of public service cannot be viewed in isolation from the broader media ecosystem, a point argued consistently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412457479">Bourdon (2011)</xref>, can be seen by comparing the British and Spanish media systems: while in the former the most popular media entertainment format pays attention to its social role within the broader ‘national’ community, in the latter – at least between 2000 and 2008 – the most popular format was used to talk about and come to terms with the ethos of a neo-liberal culture in which the economic prevails.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section13-1367549412457479">
<title>Enabling cultural citizenship</title>
<p>This reminds us of how important public service values are in media systems, in their formats and in the way that they circulate certain discourses and values and prompt social debate and talk, all of which contributes to the creation of social identities and the furtherance of cultural citizenship. Media formats should not be studied in isolation, solely in terms of their textual structure or even of the ways in which they are received and interpreted, but as pieces of larger media ecosystems in which the presence or absence (or strength or weakness) of a professional deontology enforced to at least some degree by public service media corporations, among other institutions, is highly influential. When the participants discussed <italic>EastEnders</italic> and the values that it defends, far from aligning themselves uncritically with current neo-liberal discourses, they talked about their belief in values that are closer to those of social democracy from which current definitions of public service broadcasting historically derive, such as solidarity, dialogue and engagement with the community.</p>
<p>It may seem that British soap operas have always been about community and solidarity, but this is not the case: the current dominance of community-value-based soaps is the result of a lengthy process of expulsion of those soaps which did not embrace this view. The list of casualties is a long one, ranging from offerings such as <italic>Compact</italic> in the 1960s (1962–1965) <italic>Triangle</italic> (1981–1983), <italic>Eldorado</italic> (1992–1993), <italic>Castles</italic> (1993), <italic>Night and Day</italic> (2002–2003) and the attempts to relaunch <italic>Crossroads</italic> in the early 2000s (2001 and 2003). While further research is needed to understand this dynamic more fully, it is a matter of historical record that without fail, UK soaps not complying with the ideology of community have been cast out into the cold while those which have moved from a community-based narrative to one more focused on individual advancement have suffered a similar fate: <italic>Brookside</italic> (1982–2003) being the most emblematic example.</p>
<p>The connection that viewers are able to make between the broadly social democratic, community-oriented discourse of the soaps and the concept of public service leads us to conclude that much of the debate surrounding public service cannot be properly understood in terms of its nominal referent, or the degree to which it does or does not correspond to that referent’s ‘founding values’: the defence of public service itself is best seen as a defence of an enlightened (even if to some extent paternalistic) social democratic worldview and the notions of public rather than uniquely market-oriented institutional activity that it has generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412457479">Collins, 2004</xref>). If <italic>EastEnders</italic> can be read as a site of passive resistance to the neo-liberal project while simultaneously a locus of ongoing cultural citizenship, it is not despite the UK media structure. Rather, it is because the UK broadcasting system – in which the BBC continues to be a major player – is one in which the ideology of public service remains, even if clearly contested, nonetheless strong.</p>
