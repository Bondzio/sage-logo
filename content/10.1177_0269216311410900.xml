<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Motor Neurone Disease (MND), also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), is a neurological condition with progressive degeneration of motor neurones. The symptoms vary depending on which motor neurones are affected, but all patients experience a significant loss of function. There is no curative treatment and over 50% of patients die within three years of the onset of their first symptom. MND affects 6 in 100,000 in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311410900">1</xref></sup> and 1 in 1000 UK death certificates record MND as the cause of death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311410900">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final days of life for people MND can be devastating for both the patient and the carer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311410900">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311410900">4</xref></sup> Due to the complex nature of the disease and frequent rapid decline, the final stages of MND often leave patients and families unprepared and present numerous challenges for professionals endeavouring to provide support and care at this traumatic time. The need for specialist palliative care in MND has been widely acknowledged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311410900">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311410900">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311410900">9</xref></sup> and palliative care guidelines for MND exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311410900">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relatively few studies have investigated the end-of-life period for people with MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311410900">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311410900">16</xref></sup> A number of issues, including limited, inconsistent provision of palliative care services and unmet patient needs, have emerged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311410900">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311410900">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311410900">15</xref></sup> Qualitative studies, with a focus on the palliative phase for people with MND, remain particularly scarce. Swedish researchers have investigated patient and family perspectives;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311410900">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311410900">18</xref></sup> carer perspectives during the final stage of the disease have been explored in Australian studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311410900">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311410900">20</xref></sup> This limited evidence base is likely to result from the practical and ethical difficulties frequently encountered when undertaking research with this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311410900">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent UK government document<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311410900">22</xref></sup> has highlighted the need for improved end-of-life care for all patients, setting out guidelines that aim to ensure access to appropriate care in respect of an individual’s choices, regardless of the condition they are experiencing. There is emphasis on the need for research into end-of-life care for diseases other than cancer, with a specific focus on the following areas: advance care planning; communication about end-of-life issues; understanding current care provision; support for carers (during a patient’s illness and after bereavement); and care in the last days of life. In light of these recommendations, a study evaluating the experience of the time leading up to and beyond the death of a person with MND from multiple perspectives of patients, carers and bereaved carers was considered necessary. This article represents one part of a wider project exploring whether health, social and palliative care services are meeting the needs of people with MND and their family carers throughout the entire disease trajectory.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>Using a qualitative approach we explore the experiences of people with MND, as well as current and bereaved family carers, of the final stages of the disease.</p>
<sec id="section3-0269216311410900">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A sample of 24 people with MND and 18 current and 10 bereaved family carers were recruited through a MND Care and Research Centre in Northwest England that serves a population of 1.8 million (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311410900">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311410900">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311410900">3</xref>). Specialist nurses informed patients and carers of the study and if they showed an interest in taking part, they were subsequently approached by the research team. Other recruitment strategies included the placement of notices in relevant newsletters and the distribution of information sheets by allied health professionals who were in regular contact with patients. Maximum purposive sampling allowed for the inclusion of a broad range of participants, incorporating a range of experiences (type of illness, illness duration, severity and the Primary Care Trust provider).</p>

<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>National Health Service (NHS) ethical approval was obtained and appropriate NHS Research and Development approval was also obtained. Due to the vulnerable nature of the participants, great care and attention was made to meet with the requirements outlined in the NHS Research Governance guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311410900">23</xref></sup> Participants were fully briefed regarding the study requirements prior to agreeing to take part. Process consent was obtained, enabling the renegotiation of consent at different stages of the interview and study duration, ensuring sensitivity to participants’ needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311410900">24</xref></sup> Interviews were conducted in participants’ own homes or care homes to ensure privacy and access to treatment if necessary. All recruited participants were given assurances of their entitlement to withdraw at any stage without affecting their care. Emotional support was available through the MND Care and Research Centre, should taking part have a detrimental effect on participants. Confidentiality and anonymity was ensured through restricted access to data, deletion of digital files following transcription and removal of any identifying features.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311410900">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>As the aim of the study was to gain a greater understanding of the experiences of living with MND, a qualitative, phenomenological approach was deemed the most appropriate method. Narrative interviews have been utilized in the field of health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311410900">25</xref></sup> and have previously been adopted in studies with people with MND,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311410900">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311410900">27</xref></sup> allowing participants greater control over the telling of their story. Interviews ranged from 45 minutes to two hours. A list of subjects was developed in the event that participants required a prompt. To incorporate the narratives of patients with severe speech difficulties, interviews were also conducted by email. The option to complete a personal diary (handwritten, computer typed, tape recorded or series of face-to-face interviews) was offered to patients and current carers so that their experiences of services could be documented for a period of up to one year to provide insight into how these experiences may have altered over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216311410900">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Thematic analysis was considered the most suitable approach for organizing the data as a result of its highly sensitive and flexible nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311410900">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311410900">29</xref></sup> Transcription of the data was carried out and identifying information was removed. QSR Nvivo 8, a computerized data analysis tool, was used to assist the analytic process. Transcripts were read through a number of times; initial codes were identified, reviewed and revised. From these codes, overarching themes were then constructed that were considered to capture the ‘<italic>richness of the phenomenon</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311410900">30</xref></sup> To increase rigour, the initial three transcripts were analysed first, discussed by three members of the research team and a coding frame was created that was then used to aid the formulation of themes in the remaining interviews and diary extracts. In order to ensure that the themes provided an authentic account of the individuals’ narratives, verification was obtained from some of the participants; due to the terminal and debilitating nature of the disease it was not possible to do this for all involved in the study.</p>

<title>Anxieties</title>
<p>Patients and carers experienced a wide range of fears and anxieties regarding the final stages of the disease. The uncertainty of how much time they had left and the variability in prognoses was anxiety provoking for many people (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 1). Experiencing ongoing deterioration and continual loss of abilities was difficult for patients, leading to a fear of what the future might hold for them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 2). There was concern that as the disease progressed, the loss of physical abilities and communication capabilities would result in loss of personal control and with it the ability to have a say in decision making (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 3). Carers also often voiced worries and fears for the future. These focused on feelings of uncertainty about what was to come and whether they would be able to cope as the disease advanced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 4). Even though the death of the patient was anticipated, carers were uncertain how they would respond to bereavement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 5). There was concern about how children would cope with the loss of a parent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 6), which also applied to adult children. Participants frequently expressed fears and anxiety about the actual circumstances of death, that is, how it would occur, which played on their minds throughout the latter stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311410900">Table 4</xref>, quote 7).</p>

<p>There was criticism of the standard of the service provided by paid-for home care; staff often appeared unskilled in the care of the dying. Having experienced nurses to see to the patient’s needs took some of the burden from family carers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216311410900">Table 6</xref>, quote 7). Bereaved carers reported that the burden and strain on them at this point was excessive. However, the process of organizing support could be protracted. One bereaved carer had been offered nursing care in the very final stages of his wife’s illness. Leaving it to such a late stage to implement care led to difficulties, as the care staff struggled to become accustomed to the patient’s needs and the carer found it difficult to become used to a new care set up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216311410900">Table 6</xref>, quote 8). There was a distinct feeling amongst bereaved carers that being able to access more nursing support would have made a real difference to the end-of-life care and have been of immense benefit; one bereaved carer believed it could have enabled her husband’s wish to stay at home to die (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216311410900">Table 6</xref>, quote 9). Another bereaved carer felt that the intervention of Marie Curie nurses enabled her husband to have a ‘peaceful death’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216311410900">Table 6</xref>, quote 10).</p>

Not being provided with support in the early days following her husband’s death was exceptionally distressing for one bereaved carer.

<p>Feelings of being a burden to others within the family could lead to euthanasia appearing like a viable option. One participant revealed, in a diary, how her guilt at being reliant on her family had accumulated to the extent of considering desperate action (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0269216311410900">Table 8</xref>, quote 5). For another, the thought of long-term survival was terrifying as prolonged living with the disease was viewed as adding to others’ burdens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0269216311410900">Table 8</xref>, quote 6). When asked if there was anything that could be done to help his condition, the response was assisted suicide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0269216311410900">Table 8</xref>, quote 7).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of the issues regarding care and treatment received by people and their families approaching the end of their lives have recently been emphasized by the UK Department of Health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311410900">22</xref></sup> and strategies for reform of end-of-life services have been recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311410900">23</xref></sup> In an attempt to remedy the shortage of qualitative studies investigating end-of-life issues in MND, this study has recorded the personal perceptions of patients, carers and bereaved carers during the final stages of the MND trajectory and explored their experiences of health, social and palliative care services.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that many people with MND, and their carers, experience a great deal of anxiety approaching the final stages of the disease. These anxieties are quite varied and mainly result from uncertainties surrounding the disease itself (e.g. length of prognosis). Other sources of anxiety are common to any terminal disease, including fears of not having wishes taken into account or worries of what will happen to the family. It has been suggested that increased discussion with professionals could relieve people’s anxieties at this stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311410900">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of advance care planning tools, such as the PPC documentation, have been widely recognized as a useful means of enabling people to outline their wishes regarding end-of-life care and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311410900">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311410900">36</xref></sup> This study illustrates that such a document is perceived by patients and carers as an aid in planning for the future and thereby reducing their anxiety. However, it is evident that a lack of awareness of the documentation amongst health care professionals sometimes resulted in difficulties in its implementation, with consequent disregard of the patient’s wishes. This supports previous findings demonstrating complications in its use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311410900">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>To ensure that people with MND receive optimal care at the terminal stages of the disease, the need to introduce palliative care services early in the disease trajectory has been emphasized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311410900">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311410900">39</xref></sup> It appears from the data, however, that for some people, supportive services were not introduced until very late on, frequently exacerbating the trauma of caring for a loved one dying of MND. The wish to remain at home to die was cited by both patients and carers during the study. The findings suggest that more needs to be done to support carers to do this; the application process for continuing care was regarded as complicated and lengthy, particularly when the disease has such a rapid rate of decline. In addition, carers were often reliant on support provided by care agencies, whose staff were regarded as having limited knowledge and skills in caring for people with MND. Although nurse-led care provided by specialist palliative care nurses was deemed as extremely beneficial in providing the complex nursing support required at the later stages, access to these services was not universal, endorsing previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311410900">10</xref></sup> Close liaison with the GP and community health and hospice teams during the palliative phase has also been advocated;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311410900">39</xref></sup> however, our findings suggest this does not always take place and indicates a need for earlier and greater involvement in patient care from district nurses and GPs.</p>
<p>A number of bereaved carers described the final stages of the disease as harrowing and revealed that the experience of caring for someone with MND had a lasting impact. Watching the suffering of the patient without being able to alleviate it and the high degree of strain and pressure they were under led to some carers perceiving a hastening of death of their loved one as a release for all involved. Understandably, therefore, following bereavement, carers were left with mixed emotions including grief, anger and guilt. There remains a need to implement bereavement support for this client group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311410900">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216311410900">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Factors associated with a patients’ wish for euthanasia and assisted suicide have included a sense of hopelessness and perception of burden on family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311410900">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216311410900">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311410900">44</xref></sup> The study findings suggest that patients do contemplate assisted suicide as a realistic possibility for the above reasons. Excessive burden and fatigue were voiced by many carers and previous research has shown that patients are very perceptive of this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311410900">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311410900">46</xref></sup> As this study has highlighted a number of gaps in the provision of palliative care and support for carers at the end of life, it is likely that carer distress and patient-perceived burden are exacerbated during this period.</p>

<sec id="section14-0269216311410900">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>A framework for end-of-life care has recently outlined the way in which services can operate more effectively for people with neurological conditions in the final stages of their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311410900">46</xref></sup> The importance of this document is evidenced by this study, as it is apparent that the needs of people with MND and their carers during this period are not currently being adequately met. Our findings suggest that earlier implementation and increased, co-ordinated support from palliative, health and social care services would relieve excessive strain and fatigue amongst carers of people with MND. More support from staff trained in palliative care is particularly required. By easing carer strain, such an intervention would perhaps, in turn, decrease patients’ perceived sense of burden and distress and the desire for assisted suicide expressed by some patients. Furthermore, our findings support the use of advance care planning tools in order to reduce levels of anxiety and enable future planning; the need to raise awareness of the documentation in all relevant health departments is also indicated. A lack of guidance for the psychological treatment of patients with MND and a need for these aspects to be incorporated into their physical care has been previously highlighted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216311410900">47</xref></sup> Psychological therapies have been advocated as a useful means to enable patients with other diseases to find meaning and thereby decrease the sense of hopelessness they may experience;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216311410900">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269216311410900">49</xref></sup> from this study it appears that such an approach might also be beneficial in alleviating the anxiety and distress experienced by MND patients and their carers and it should also be incorporated into bereavement support for carers.</p>

<sec id="section15-0269216311410900">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>These findings cannot claim to be representative of all people living with MND and are limited to those who participated in the study, as is the nature with all qualitative research. The study was carried out in one geographical area and the sample was obtained from one care centre, which further limits the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, those who have had negative experiences of services may have been more motivated to take part in the study, in order to tell their story, which could have impacted on the data. Conducting interviews with patients and carers separately was not always possible due to participants’ needs or wishes; by meeting these needs it is possible that some quality in the data may have been lost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269216311410900">50</xref></sup> As with previous studies with this client group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311410900">20</xref></sup> although home visits or telephone interviews were provided as options, recruiting current carers remained difficult.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has identified a number of issues people with MND and their carers face in the final stages of MND and has indicated some ways in which the health, social and palliative care services could be improved or co-operate more effectively in order to better meet their needs.</p>
