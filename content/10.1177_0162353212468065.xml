<body>
<p>In recent years, an increased interest in the issue of ability has been observed in Poland. This is the result of changes that were introduced to the structure of the Polish system of education since 1991. Those changes have been influenced by the policy of the European Union (EU), the aim of which is to prepare common educational principles and structures for Europeans.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162353212468065">
<title>Ability</title>
<p>Ability is understood as individual characteristics or traits that cannot be narrowed to formed habits, but which can form various habits and skills. In Poland, a generally accepted definition is as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Abilities mean those individual differences which cause persons with equal motivation and prior preparation to achieve different results in learning and performance under similar external conditions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212468065">Pietrasinski, 1976</xref>, p.736).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Polish, several terms are used to define ability: <italic>zadatki wrodzone—</italic>capacity; <italic>naturalne zdolnosci, sklonnosci—</italic>aptitude, gift, natural ability; <italic>zdolnosci—</italic>giftedness, gifted, ability, skills; <italic>uzdolnienia—</italic>ability, skills; <italic>uzdolnienia kierunkowe—</italic>specific ability; <italic>talent—</italic>talent, talents; <italic>zdolnosci tworcze—</italic>creative ability; <italic>wybitne zdolnosci—</italic>exceptional talent; <italic>cudowne dziecko—</italic>child prodigy; <italic>geniusz—</italic>genius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212468065">Limont, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The terms <italic>giftedness</italic> and <italic>gifted</italic> are usually associated with general, academic, or school abilities, and intelligence as they are related to the speed of learning, remembering, and logical thinking. The term <italic>ability</italic> is understood as a specific ability or talent that is a characteristic of an individual that allows for high achievement in a specific domain of activity, such as mathematics, music, or visual arts. An important term in the context of ability and education of the gifted is <italic>creative ability</italic>, which is a characteristic that allows for finding problems and solving them in a new, unique, and original way.</p>

<sec id="section2-0162353212468065">
<title>Educational Laws in Poland</title>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of Poland ensures equal access to education for citizens of various educational needs. As a result of reforms of the educational system, new acts have been introduced, including an opportunity for the education of the gifted. Article 1 of the Polish School Education Act of 7 September 1991 says that the system of education shall ensure “support for highly gifted students by enabling them to follow individual study programs and graduate from any kind of school in a shortened time.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468065"><italic>Dziennik Ustaw</italic>, 1996</xref>). <italic>The Ordinance of the Ministry of National Education and Sport of 19 December 2001</italic> added thereto that students’ specific abilities and interests shall be developed by adjusting the scope and speed of learning to students’ individual needs and capabilities. Abilities shall be identified by means of psychological and psychopedagogical criteria. The psychological criterion measures the levels of intelligence and specific abilities, including character and personality traits. The psychopedagogical criterion refers to students’ achievements. The needs of gifted students are supported by the Polish national scholarship systems, subject olympiads, tournaments, contests, the activity of <italic>Towarzystwo Szkol Tworczych</italic> (the Association of Creative Schools), <italic>Krajowy Fundusz na Rzecz Dzieci</italic> (the Polish Children’s Fund), and the activity of educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212468065">Ministerstwo Edukacji Narodowej, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In Poland, a gifted pupil has the right to an individualized education program in one, several, or all compulsory subjects. Such a program allows for an early graduation from school. During one school year, a pupil can complete at least a 2-year study program, be exempted from compulsory participation in classes included in the study program for his or her grade, attend selected educational classes at higher grades or schools, or complete the study program on his or her own. At present, the Polish Ministry of National Education (MEN) is introducing changes to special education, which includes highly gifted pupils. Ministerial documents state that the characteristics of a highly gifted pupil include a high intelligence level, creativity, and strong motivation for learning. He or she can display various abilities, such as linguistic, logical and mathematical, visual and spatial, kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, scientific, existential, and spiritual ones. Gifted pupils have specific needs that should be identified and met in their educational programs. Due to the specific personality traits, it is important to ensure pedagogical and psychological support for a gifted pupil. Presently, MEN together with the Centre for Education Development are working on a project of a comprehensive system for working with a gifted pupil that is to be completed in 2014.</p>

<title>The System of Education in Poland</title>
<p>Since May 5, 2006, there have been two separate ministries in Poland: the MEN and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The MEN is responsible for nearly the whole system of education, with the exception of higher education that is under the supervision of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. Vocational schools that were run by other ministries in the past are now the responsibility of the MEN. At present, only a few schools (artistic—only with respect to artistic subjects as well as correctional institutions) are under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Justice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162353212468065">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212468065">Polish EURYDICE Unit, 2011</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Full-time compulsory education (to be received in school) covers children and young people aged from 6 to 16 years, whereas part-time compulsory education (to be received in school or nonschool settings) is required for young people aged from 16 to 18 years. Compulsory education includes the final year of preprimary education, 6 years of primary education, and 3 years of lower secondary education. <italic>Przedszkole</italic> (nursery school), <italic>szkola podstawowa</italic> (primary school), and <italic>gimnazjum</italic> (lower secondary school) are administered by the <italic>gmina</italic> (commune) authorities. <italic>Szkola srednia</italic> (upper secondary school), which is not compulsory, is attended by the vast majority of the population in the age group from 16 to 20 years and is administered by the <italic>powiat</italic> (district) authorities. Autonomous higher education institutions offer mainly first-, second-, and third-cycle programs (long-cycle master’s degree programs are available only in a few fields of study). Adult education is provided by continuing education centers, practical training centers, and furthermore, and in-service training centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212468065">Polish EURYDICE Unit, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0162353212468065">
<title>Preprimary Education</title>
<p>Enrollment in public nursery schools is provided on a free-access basis. The age of a child is the main criterion—children must be at least 3 years old. The main aims of preschool education are as follows: to build a system of values, develop social and personal skills, construct children’s knowledge about the world, and shape a sense of belonging in a community, family, peer group, or national community. Nursery schools’ offerings for gifted children include additional extra paid classes in music, visual arts, ballet, and English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353212468065">
<title>Primary Education</title>
<p>General education in primary school is divided into two stages: The first stage of education includes Grades I to III of primary school (integrated teaching) and the second stage of education includes Grades IV to VI of primary school. The main aims of general education in primary school are as follows: Pupils are to acquire a basic set of information/knowledge on facts, theories, and practice related, in particular, to topics and phenomena close to their experience; acquire skills related to the use of knowledge and information in carrying out tasks and solving problems; and develop attitudes related to efficient and responsible functioning in the contemporary world. Gifted pupils can attend interest clubs for Polish, English, mathematics, and fine arts, which prepare them for content and subject olympiads.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162353212468065">
<title>Lower Secondary Education</title>
<p>The study covers Grades I to III (pupils aged 13-16) and it is not divided into stages. Lower secondary school ends with an external exam giving access to upper secondary education. Education in lower secondary school, while supporting pupils’ personal development and introducing them to active participation in the society, aims in particular, at introducing them to science, developing their individual interests, introducing them to the world of culture and art, and developing social skills. Schools offer subject modules and complementary subjects that are open to selection, artistic classes, and practical and technical classes. Moreover, a highly gifted pupil can attend additional classes, the aim of which is to increase educational opportunities in Polish and mathematics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353212468065">
<title>General Upper Secondary Education</title>
<p>The following general upper secondary school is open to candidates who have successfully graduated from lower secondary school: <italic>liceum ogolnoksztalcace</italic> (3-year general secondary school)—a full-time general upper secondary education for students aged 16 to 19. A student of such a school should complete one or three subjects from the extended curriculum. Gifted students are offered extracurricular activities that enrich their knowledge of selected subjects. Students choose one of the subject modules—history and society or natural science as well as artistic classes and economy in practice. There are specialized classes at lower secondary school and general secondary school, which allow students to choose their own educational directions. At lower secondary school, students’ strengths and weaknesses are identified. At general secondary school, students’ individual interests and skills are developed; <italic>technikum</italic> (4-year technical secondary school)—general and specialized upper secondary education for students aged 16-20. Both of the types offer the <italic>Matura</italic> examination necessary for admission to higher education institutions and a professional qualifications diploma; z<italic>asadnicza szkola zawodowa</italic> (2- or 3-year basic vocational school)—ends with an examination for a professional qualification diploma.</p>

<title>Postsecondary Nontertiary Education</title>
<sec id="section9-0162353212468065">
<title>Szkola policealna (postsecondary school)</title>
<p>Due to the type of qualifications it offers, it is included as part of the secondary education in the Polish classification. Postsecondary schools are organized for young people (aged 19-21) and adults, and provide courses in more than 20 groups of specialization: arts, economics and administration, medical studies, technology, agriculture, forestry and fishery, transport and communication, services, and others.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353212468065">
<title>Tertiary Education</title>
<p>There are more than 100 institutions of higher education in Poland. The majority of Polish universities have adjusted their study structure to the 3+2+4 (year) model. The education is provided by both public and nonpublic university and nonuniversity higher education institutions that comply with relevant requirements, including first-cycle programs (bachelor’s degree), which take 3 to 4 years and end with the <italic>licencjat</italic> degree or 3.5 to 4 years, which end with the <italic>inzynier</italic> degree, depending on the field of study; second-cycle programs (master’s degree), which take 1.5 to 2 years and end with the <italic>magister</italic> or an equivalent degree, depending on the field of study; long-cycle programs (master’s degree), which take between 4.5 and 6 years and end with the same <italic>magister</italic> degree (medicine, theology, arts). The third-cycle (doctor’s degree), which takes 4 years is dedicated to the ablest graduates. Highly gifted students are given an opportunity to study according to individual plans and programs within the interdepartmental studies program or they can select and study any two majors at the same time. Gifted students can also be granted permission to create an individualized course of study.</p>

<sec id="section11-0162353212468065">
<title>Specialized Schools for Gifted Students</title>
<p>In Poland, there is a specialized school system for children and adolescents who are artistically gifted or gifted in sport. Artistic schools allow highly gifted children and adolescents to pursue individualized education in music, visual arts, ballet, and circus arts. The managing body of artistic schools is the Ministry of Culture with the support of subordinate institutions, such as the Department of Art and Culture Education and <italic>Centrum Edukacji Artystycznej</italic> (the Centre for Artistic Education).</p>
<sec id="section12-0162353212468065">
<title>Music Schools</title>
<p>The music school system constitutes a separate system that provides musically gifted children and adolescents a free individual music education. The system is based on a three-degree education model, including primary school (first degree), secondary school (second degree), and a higher education institution (academy of music). Beside specialized music schools, there are also <italic>ogolnoksztalcace szkoły muzyczne</italic> (general education music schools) of the first and second degrees. Depending on the age, students of the first degree schools follow a 6-year education cycle (children) or a 4-year one (adolescents). Music schools admit those applicants aged from 6 to 16 who have successfully passed the examination of musical abilities, psychophysical health condition and predispositions to play a specific musical instrument. General education music schools of the first degree follow a general education program that corresponds to the education program for the 6-year primary school. The schools admit only children aged 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Music schools of the second degree admit applicants aged from 10 to 21 years who have successfully passed the entrance examination. The school education takes 6 years. Students can graduate with a title of a professional instrumental musician, vocalist, eurhythmics teacher, or violin maker. After graduation, they have an opportunity to apply to academies of music. Apart from the artistic education, general education music schools of the second degree follow general education programs of lower secondary school and general secondary school. Students have an opportunity to graduate with a title of a professional musician and with the <italic>Matura</italic> diploma. Those schools admit applicants, based on their results of the entrance examination, who in a given year are not more than 14 years old and who have graduated from a 6-year general education music school of the first degree or a 6-year primary school. In Warsaw and Poznan, there are <italic>Szkoły Talentow</italic> (Talent Schools) where students receive individual education in artistic and general education subjects in accordance with the specialized education programs that develop their exceptional musical abilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0162353212468065">
<title>Visual Arts School</title>
<p>The visual arts school system has a two-degree structure including <italic>ogolnoksztalcaca szkola sztuk pieknych</italic> (general education school of fine arts) or <italic>liceum plastyczne</italic> (secondary school of visual arts), and academies of fine arts with a 5-year education cycle.</p>
<p>Secondary visual arts schools follow both general education and artistic education programs. Students can graduate with a title of a professional artist in the following specializations: photography, marketing of works of art, visual advertising, graphics, sculpturing, renovation, stage design, and industrial design. Applicants to visual arts schools take practical exams that measure their artistic skills and aesthetic sensitivity. After graduation, students take a diploma exam that consists of practical and theoretical parts. After receiving the diploma, they take the external <italic>Matura</italic> exam. General visual arts schools admit applicants who have graduated from primary school, where education takes 6 years. Secondary schools of visual arts admit applicants who have graduated from lower secondary schools, where education takes 4 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0162353212468065">
<title>Ballet Schools</title>
<p>The ballet school system has a two-degree structure and includes <italic>ogolnoksztalcaca szkola baletowa</italic> (general education ballet school) or <italic>szkola sztuki tanca</italic> (dance art school), and <italic>akademia muzyczna</italic> (academy of music) with a 5-year education cycle. Ballet schools and dance art schools admit applicants based on their dancing skills. Ballet schools provide education in professional dancing. General education ballet schools with a 9-year cycle follow the program of artistic education and general education for primary school Grades IV to VI, lower secondary schools, and general secondary school. To be admitted to the 9-year ballet school, it is necessary that an applicant is not older than 10 years old in a given calendar year. Education at the school allows for obtaining a title of a professional dancer and the <italic>Matura</italic> diploma within the external examination system.</p>
<p>Dance art schools with a 6-year cycle or a 9-year cycle follow the program of artistic education only. To be admitted to that kind of school, it is necessary that an applicant be at least 6 years of age and not older than 16.</p>
<p>Circus art schools follow a 4-year education cycle and provide education in professional circus performance. Applicants are admitted on the basis of their skills. The condition is that they are at least 15 years of age and not older than 21.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0162353212468065">
<title>Sports Schools</title>
<p>Children talented in sport have the opportunity to pursue education at <italic>szkola sportowa</italic> (sports school) <italic>szkola mistrzostwa sportowego</italic> (sport championship schools), and sports classes. Sports schools and sport championship schools operate on various educational levels, that is, as primary schools, lower secondary schools, and general secondary schools. From the first grade, sports schools, sport championship schools, and sports classes follow a general sport education program in all sports disciplines and specialized sports education program only for early school disciplines, such as swimming, artistic gymnastics, sport gymnastics, acrobatic gymnastics, figure skating, alpine skiing, and table tennis. Lower secondary school follows a specialized training in the early school disciplines and also education program for other sports disciplines, which is later continued at secondary schools.</p>
<p>Sports schools admit applicants who are in very good health, have received good results in a physical fitness test, and have a written consent from their parents or legal guardians.</p>

<sec id="section16-0162353212468065">
<title>Projects Supporting Actions for Gifted Students</title>
<p>Because of the initiative of the MEN, projects supporting innovative actions of schools are launched on an annual basis. In 2009, a project called <italic>Rok Kreatywnosci i Innowacji</italic> (the Year of Creativity and Innovation) was implemented, during the 2010/2011 school year <italic>Rok Odkrywania Talentow</italic> (the Year of Discovering Talents) was announced, and in 2012, a project called <italic>Szkola z Pasja</italic> (School with Passion) is being implemented.</p>
<p>Currently, the Center for Education Development together with the MEN are running a project connected with preparing a comprehensive system for working with gifted students. Legislative and methodological changes are being introduced; the analyses of the current educational system and organization of subject olympiads, tournaments, and contests are being carried out. Training is being provided for those who are responsible for preparing the criteria for indentifying abilities and creating appropriate conditions for their development. Moreover, some actions are being conducted, the aim of which is to make a vast group of people aware of the special educational needs of highly gifted children. Within the project mentioned above, specific tasks are being performed, such as <italic>Miejsce Odkrywania Talentow</italic> (the Places of Discovering Talents) and <italic>Szkoly Odkrywcow Talentow</italic> (The Schools of Discoverers of Talents), the aim of which is to create a network of institutions and places that support the development of abilities of children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Subject-oriented, professional, and interdisciplinary olympiads; tournaments; and contests, which are organized on an annual basis, constitute an important part of the educational system of gifted students. Apart from general and specialized education and ministerial projects, in Poland there are numerous places, higher education institutions, the Copernicus Science Center in Warsaw, youth culture clubs and clubs that offer enrichment programs in various areas of activity.</p>
<p>Thanks to intensive actions within the project discussed above, society’s attitude toward the academically gifted is gradually changing from the unwilling or indifferent one to accepting and supporting actions for the education of the academically gifted students.</p>
<p>The weakest aspect of gifted education in Poland is teacher preparation to work with the gifted. Currently, teacher training standards do not include any module related to teacher training in that respect. Teacher preparation to work with the gifted takes place during short workshops organized by regional teacher training centers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162353212468065">
<title>Examples of Good Practices</title>
<p>Some of the teacher training centers run projects related to gifted education. They include DIAMENT (Lesser Poland Province), zDolny Slazak (Silesia Province), WARS i SAWA (Warsaw) and Mazowieckie Talenty (Masovia Province). Those are local projects and their activity is limited to a specific town or province. Unique and significant—in the context of Poland—projects for gifted education covering all of Poland are discussed below. They include two schools for highly gifted students: one for the academically gifted and the other for the artistically gifted, and two nongovernmental projects running since the 1980s. Students under the presented educational programs are very successful in national and international competitions and subject olympiads. Due to the uniqueness as well as efficiency and impact of those projects, they are discussed below as examples of good practices.</p>
<sec id="section18-0162353212468065">
<title>Gimnazjum i Liceum Akademickie (GiLA) in Torun (The Academic Secondary School of Nicolaus Copernicus University)</title>
<p>Highly academically gifted students may pursue their education at <italic>Zespol Szkol Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika, GiLA</italic> in Torun. <italic>GiLA</italic> is a general lower and upper secondary school with a dormitory for gifted students from ages 13 to 19 who are recruited from all over Poland. Applicants undergo a multistage recruitment process that includes (a) initial verification of applicants based on submitted documents; (b) psychological tests, including interests, motivation, personality, and intellectual and creative abilities; (c) test of knowledge of humanities and mathematics; and (d) the analysis of applicants’ achievements, including results in the primary school graduation exam. Winners of regional and national contests in Polish, history, mathematics, and biology are exempted from the exam. The managing body is the Nicolaus Copernicus University (<italic>UMK</italic>) in Torun and there is also <italic>Rada Programowa</italic> (the Program Council) composed of the <italic>UMK</italic> professors. The education program is followed within the framework of specialized paths in humanities, science, and mathematics. The school also offers individualized education—students may participate in optional classes in subjects they have individually selected. In higher grades, students take part in seminars, and an enriched and accelerated educational model is followed. Starting from the second grade of lower secondary school, students expand their knowledge according to their abilities and interests by participating in two selected subjects of individual education. During the educational process, student grouping is applied according to the levels of students’ knowledge and abilities as well as peer tutoring connected with substantive and emotional support provided to younger students by older ones. Students also have an opportunity to participate in selected classes at <italic>UMK</italic> as regular university students. Students’ interests are also stimulated by a series of thematic lectures delivered at school. Students participate in scientific research and artistic workshops taking place in university labs. <italic>GiLA</italic> follows programs connected with raising gifted students’ awareness about social problems and engaging them in prosocial activity, such as volunteer work and humanitarian action. During 12 years, the school has educated more than 150 laureates and winners of subject olympiads and more than 800 laureates and winners of subject contests. The school experience is popularized during national conferences dedicated to the education of gifted students and in publications based on participants’ articles. University workers also train teachers in the pedagogy of ability and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212468065">Limont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212468065">Limont &amp; Cieslikowska, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>A significant example is a network of schools educating gifted students, which are members of <italic>the TST</italic>,), <italic>Towarzystwo Szkol Aktywnych</italic> (Association of Active Schools; TSA), and <italic>Stowarzyszenie Nauczycieli Olimpijskich</italic> (Association of Subject Olympiad Teachers; <italic>SNO</italic>). The movement, as a nongovernmental organization, was initiated by Danuta Nakoneczna in 1983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212468065">Nakoneczna, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212468065">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the <italic>TST</italic> is cooperation to continuously improve teaching and educational processes by developing and implementing pedagogical innovations. The main principles of the schools are “maximum integration—minimum segregation” and the idea that a good open school is the best environment for developing exceptional abilities.</p>
<p>Secondary schools that are members of the <italic>TST</italic> supervise primary schools and lower secondary schools both in cities and villages. The later established <italic>SNO</italic>, the members of which are teachers of winners of national and international subject olympiads, has similar objectives. The aim of the <italic>SNO</italic> is to facilitate cooperation and mutual support of teachers of gifted students in meeting their educational needs at the highest level. The movement initiated by Nakoneczna involves introducing innovations, such as individual program classes created by form-teachers at school with the active engagement of pupils and parents. The teaching and educational process also includes a relaxed lesson system to facilitate individualized teaching and a possibility of combining education at primary school, lower secondary school, secondary school, and higher education institutions. Moreover, educational programs include tasks related to scientific research in university labs and research institutions, and participation in scientific camps. An important element of the educational concept is peer tutoring. What has also been introduced is a descriptive assessment of knowledge, skills, and student behavior, which allows for shaping ethical and moral behavior as well as engaging students in actions for other people. A system of educating gifted individuals has been prepared on the basis of the principle of individualization, which allows for accelerated and enriched education. Specific educational strategies have been devised as well as a teacher training system that is based on teachers exchanging knowledge and experience in pedagogical practice. Another implemented educational strategy is based on the cooperation between master teachers and students who act as assistants. At schools that are members of the <italic>TST</italic>, there are <italic>Kluby Promocji Talentow</italic> (Talents Promotion Clubs) and <italic>Szkoly Zimowe</italic> (Winter Schools), which follow enrichment educational programs.</p>

<title>Krajowy Fundusz na Rzecz Dzieci (The Polish Children’s Fund)</title>
<p>An important Polish project initiated by Ryszard Rakowski in 1983 is <italic>Krajowy Fundusz na Rzecz Dzieci</italic> (the Polish Children’s Fund, <italic>KFnRD</italic>), which offers numerous enrichment programs and support for gifted pupils. The objectives of the Fund are to bring attention to specific educational needs of highly gifted children and adolescents, and methods of working with them and to create the atmosphere of acceptance and understanding of support for gifted pupils. Significant aims also include creating institutional and financial conditions that facilitate the development of pupils’ abilities and interests. The Fund participates in creating a coherent system of supporting the development of highly gifted individuals, which embraces the whole educational process until they start their own professional career. The Fund also aims at supporting the development of highly gifted primary school children and secondary school pupils with cognitive, technical, musical, ballet, and visual arts abilities. The support for gifted children takes various facilitating forms, depending on the type of ability. For individuals with cognitive and technical abilities, seminars are organized as well as specialized workshops and research internships, general education and scientific camps, participation in camps, conferences and international meetings, and consultation at universities. Individuals with music abilities are offered participation in music workshops, concerts, financial aid enabling them to attend music courses and contests, as well and to purchase musical instruments and accessories. Individuals gifted in ballet have an opportunity to receive financial aid enabling them to participate in courses and international contests. Pupils gifted in visual arts participate in workshops and outdoor art workshops, exhibitions, and consultation at academies of fine arts. All the scholars of the Fund may participate in language camps and subscribe to magazines. Former and present program participants assist in organizing workshops and camps, and teach classes as part of peer tutoring. They also organize activities and camps for their younger peers and invite secondary school graduates—former scholars—to summer scientific camps of <italic>Collegium Invisibile</italic>.</p>
<p>The last two projects have been evaluated by the Ministry of Education—next to competitions and subject olympiads—as the most important offers securing the needs of highly gifted students.</p>

<title>Future Directions for Research and Program Development</title>
<p>As mentioned before, in recent years, Polish scientists have become more and more interested in the concepts of ability and gifted education. It results from the necessity of adjusting education to the standards and educational policy of the EU. The project that is now being implemented by the Polish MEN and which is related to the preparation of a complex system for working with a gifted student should be expanded to include support and education for the gifted in the life span perspective. It would be significant due to the changes that are occurring in the society; namely, the extended educational period including compulsory education of ever-younger children as well as an increased number of older people active in the labor market, and the extending life expectancy of the Europeans. Another argument is the EU’s introduction of the <italic>Lifelong Learning Program</italic>, with the educational offers related to the improvement of the quality of education of adults by means of the European cooperation and responding to the educational challenges of the Europe’s aging population. To complete those tasks, it is necessary to have a group of teachers, psychologists, and pedagogues competent in the gifted education for people of different ages. Accepting a proper definition, theory, and concept of ability will allow for seeking solutions connected with exploiting an individual’s potential while changing a discipline and area of interest. It will also allow for finding an answer to the question of the predictors and profile of the personality of the gifted with different structures, levels, and types of ability. An important scientific trend should also refer to the issues of interpersonal relations, motivation, emotions, abilities, creativity, and self-fulfillment of the gifted. The research should also include an individual direction of development of each person toward achieving balance between intellectual, emotional, aesthetic, and moral functioning. What should also be emphasized is the developmental balance between preferred and held values as well as satisfaction and happiness with personal and professional life, and social functioning.</p>
