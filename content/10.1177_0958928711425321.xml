<title>Comparing Bismarckian welfare states</title>
<p><bold>John D. Stephens</bold></p>
<p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA</p>
<p>This edited volume consists of country studies of social policy reforms in most continental European – or ‘Bismarckian’ – welfare states over the past decade and a half. In addition, it contains chapters on financing the welfare state, employment policy, and the role of social partners in administering social policy, an introduction and summarizing conclusion by the editor, and a prologue by Gøsta Esping-Andersen. It is the companion volume to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711425321">Palier and Martin (2008)</xref>. In that volume, the chapters are cross-country comparative analyses of policy areas (pensions, healthcare, and so on).</p>
<p>The theoretical point of departure of the volume is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711425321">Esping-Andersen’s (1996)</xref> essay, in which he outlines the maladies of the continental European welfare states: low levels of labour force participation particularly among women, youth and older men; high payroll taxes; resort to labour shedding policies to deal with unemployment; and rigid labour markets with strong insider–outsider divisions due partly to strong employment protection laws. Despite the fact that the problems of these welfare states were worse than those of his other two regimes, these regimes seemed incapable of reforming themselves. Esping-Andersen characterized them as ‘frozen’. Several volumes that surveyed welfare state reform in a large number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries at the turn of the century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928711425321">Huber and Stephens 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425321">Pierson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711425321">Scharpf and Schmidt, 2000</xref>) agreed with Esping-Andersen’s diagnosis. The inability of these welfare states to reform themselves appeared to stem directly from some features of the structure of Bismarckian transfer programs. The contributory financing systems created a perception of entitlement on the part of the employees who had paid the payroll contribution, and the role of the social partners, particularly the unions, in administering the programs created interest groups with a strong stake in defending the existing system and benefit levels.</p>
<p>The main point of this volume and its companion is that viewing the continental welfare systems as frozen misses the profound – and similar – changes that all of these systems are undergoing. Part of the reason why the turn of the century volumes were off the mark in this regard is that many, though by no means all, of these changes have occurred since the turn of the century. In this volume, the country chapters are all authored by scholars who are recognized experts on the social policies of the countries they analyze. This is the rare volume – the only other one I can think of is Volume II of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711425321">Scharpf and Schmidt (2000)</xref> – in which the country analyses are strictly comparable, covering the same topics in the same format using the same historical institutionalist analytical framework.</p>
<p>According to contributions in this volume (for example, see Palier, p. 33 and Hinrichs, pp. 41–2), the main transfer programmes (pensions, work injury, sick pay, and unemployment) in Bismarckian welfare systems have the following characteristics: (1) The benefit levels are based on the recipient’s work and contribution record; (2) they are financed by contributions of employers and employees (that is, by payroll taxes); (3) the benefits are earnings-related and designed to protect income levels in the case of work interruption or termination; and (4) they are administered by the social partners (employer organizations and unions). The healthcare systems in these countries often have characteristics number 2 and number 4 also. Three other characteristics, which appear in many of the contributions, appear to me to be constitutive features of the systems: (1) the transfer systems are pay as you go (PAYG); (2) they are predicated on the male breadwinner and stay-at-home mother family system; and (3), relatedly, they do not provide a wide range of state delivered health, education and welfare services (in sharp contrast to the Nordic welfare states). The aim of the systems is to provide income security for male employees and their families.</p>
<p>The historical point of departure of the essays is the success of these welfare states at the end of the Trente Glorieuses. In Palier’s words (p. 359), the continental welfare state achieved Beveridgean goals through Bismarckian means as entitlements were progressively extended to more and more occupational groups until they achieved near universal coverage; the differential benefits and qualifying conditions between occupationally specific schemes were gradually reduced or eliminated; and family members were covered indirectly through the male breadwinner. However, demographic change (for example, decline in male breadwinner households as the modal family type) and economic change (deindustrialization, expansion of the service economy, decline in growth rates, increased female labour force participation) created ‘new social risks’ with which the Bismarckian system was poorly equipped to deal. In the case of the defined benefit PAYG pension systems, the decline in wage growth and in fertility rates radically changed the basic assumptions on which the systems were designed such that, even in the best case, they were unviable.</p>
<p>To briefly summarize the argument of the book, in part spurred on by the coming of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the key actors – the main political parties and the social partners – increasingly recognized the maladies of the system and in an incremental fashion introduced changes to it. A key step was the recognition that the first reaction to the unemployment crisis, labour shedding, was a dead end. In the second stage, this policy was reversed and the parameters of the main transfer programs were changed (contributions and contribution periods increased, replacement rates lowered, and so on). In the next stage, new benefits, often targeted, were introduced to address the needs of new social risk groups and new taxes were introduced to finance these benefits and to make it possible to reduce payroll taxes. More timidly, work and family reconciliation policies were introduced to increase women’s labour force participation and fertility. In the end, a new dualistic system began to emerge in which labour market insiders were still covered by the Bismarckian system but often with lower replacement rates in the pension systems, necessitating the introduction of tax-subsidized funded tiers. Outsiders were covered by tax-funded basic security systems and subject to positive and negative activation measures.</p>
<p>Palier’s conclusion and the other three cross- cutting essays are not, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711425321">Skocpol’s (1984)</xref> terminology, the most similar case or the most different case designs, but instead ‘parallel demonstrations of theory’. This is generally thought to be the weakest design of comparative historical methodologies, because simply showing that the same thing occurred in yet another case does little to pinpoint which of a number of possible factors were the causes of the outcome. However, the design has considerably greater power in this case, because the volume covers the near univers of cases to which Palier claims the causal argument applies.</p>
<p>The design does have some limitations, however. It is perhaps unfair to criticize a volume that is so comprehensive for not being yet more comprehensive, but comparisons with other systems, if only in the conclusion and the comparative essays, would have allowed one to pinpoint more precisely what aspects of these systems led to their crises. Let us take the perhaps the most prominent feature, the labour shedding strategy and the resulting crisis of inactivity. A comparison with the Nordic countries suggests that this had nothing to do with the Bismarckian design of the transfer system. The first three features of Bismarckian transfer programs listed above are also characteristic of the Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian pension, sick pay, and work disability systems and they were defined benefit PAYG systems as well, so if these were so central to problems of the continental welfare states, then these countries should have suffered from the same problems – which they did not. It is actually the second (male breadwinner) and third (low levels of public employment) additional characteristics I listed above that were responsible for the low levels of (women’s) labour force participation in comparison with the Nordic systems.</p>
<p>Second, I would have argued that at least one of the comparative essays be devoted to explaining differences between the countries covered in the country essays. The most obvious one is the contrast between Southern Europe and the rest of the continental countries. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425321">Ferrera (1996)</xref> and others have pointed out, the Southern European countries never reached ‘Beveridgean goals through Bismarckian means’. Significant proportions of the populations of these countries fell outside the transfer system’s safety net; they were dualistic at the outset. The second difference is the contrast between Switzerland and Austria, who have always done better with regard to unemployment, and now the Netherlands, which has joined those two countries in that regard, and the rest of the continental countries. These three countries along with the Nordic countries, who also perform well in employment and unemployment, were designated by the comparative political economy literature of the 1980s (for example, Cameron, Lehmbruch, Katzenstein) as corporatist political economies, which suggests that their good economic performance has something to do with the bargaining structures and political exchange between the labour market partners and the government characteristic of corporatism. Belgium is the sick man in this group, and the obvious hypothesis there is that the ethnic conflict corroded corporatist political exchange.</p>

<title>An institutionalist explanation of welfare state reform in continental Europe?</title>
<p><bold>Kees van Kersbergen</bold></p>
<p>Aarhus University, Denmark</p>
<p>According to the established wisdom of the welfare state literature of the 1990s and early 2000s, continental Europe’s malfunctioning social systems were like a maximum security prison from which no escape was possible. Ruthless institutional fortifications and callous political wardens conspired to preserve this Alcatraz of ‘welfare’ without work. Neither the lives of the inmates (the insiders, mainly male workers and employees) nor the lives of those on the outside (mostly the inmates’ wives and family members) were particularly pleasant. The convicts living inside were lucky if they could find a job and hold on to it. But very often they were confined to utter, albeit relatively painless because paid, idleness from a young age. This was called ‘early exit’, which – seen from the prisoners’ point of view – was a rather cynical if not to say sadistic name. The insiders were organized, on the basis of status, into various prison gangs, which were called unions and whose power and money depended on their successful defence of the stratified status quo. The inmates paid their contributions and respect in return for which the gangs promised to defend their and their relatives’ interests. Outside prison there were no jobs at all and survival depended on whatever the prisoners would make inside and could smuggle out. The outsiders, especially young women, had a bizarre desire to become inmates themselves and many acted correspondingly, albeit rather desperately. Most, however, were punished with a life of dependency and jobless inactivity and focused on other social roles, such as motherhood. The powerful yet conflictual alliance of rigid institutional rules, self-interested political wardens and myopic gangs created a grim jail, which effectively the participants came to support themselves, in very much the same way as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711425321">Foucault’s (1979</xref>: 201) Benthamian panopticon, where ‘the inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers’. Reform of the penitentiary was virtually unimaginable and deemed downright impossible.</p>
<p>This picture was not only much too gloomy, it was also greatly exaggerated and to a large extent simply wrong. The description of extreme stalemate does not even characterize well the 1990s, arguably the pinnacle of institutional confinement and political gridlock in continental Europe, for it completely ignored the very real changes that – even in Germany – were going on. The institutionalists are to be blamed here for what we can now identify – admittedly with some benefit of hindsight – as a reprehensibly misleading approach to the development of welfare states. Too many analysts got stuck in the fad of institutionalism and focused almost exclusively on typically institutionalist questions of stability, such as explaining why welfare state reform is so difficult or slow, or, if one was still affected with the Marxist virus, why the predicted definitive breakdown of welfare capitalism had not yet occurred.</p>
<p>In other words, the institutionalists studied the statics of the welfare state, while at the same time the very real dynamics of ongoing reform was producing piecemeal solutions of a sort for adaptive problems. Such reforms, in turn, created a mass of anomalies for the institutionalists, which they initially chose to ignore until, I guess, it became nonsensical to do so. The fad may now finally be over so that we can return to what we should have been studying all along, namely why and how the welfare state, this complex amalgam of social policies, institutions, programmes and interests, is continuously adapting to the endogenous and exogenous changes, which now usually are referred to as ‘challenges’ or sometimes ‘threats’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928711425321">Stein Ringen (2006 [1987]</xref>: xlvi) had written 25 years earlier: ‘The welfare state is reform on a grand scale. It is an attempt to change the circumstances individuals and families live under without basically changing society. No less; no wonder it is controversial. <italic>If the welfare state works, reform works</italic>’ (my emphasis). Since the welfare state kept on functioning (and it actually did pretty well in many cases!), we can infer that there must have been a whole lot of reform.</p>
<p>This, I admit, is a bit of a long prologue to introduce my comment on Bruno Palier’s edited volume and its contribution to understanding reform processes and possibilities in continental welfare states (the task specifically assigned to me here). Let me start by saying that this is a very well organized, carefully edited and very informative book on welfare state change in continental Europe. It teaches us a lot about the intricacies of reform: its politics; the preferences and indifferences; the hurdles and facilities; the opportunities and constraints; the timing and interruptions; and the histories and prospects. The book remains squarely faithful to the historical institutionalist approach to the welfare state, epitomized by the way it constructs the very analytical puzzle. It starts by reiterating that the continental welfare states in the 1990s needed structural reform the most, but paradoxically were also the ones least likely to adapt quickly and smoothly to the new challenges. Yet, at least since the early 2000s, it has become clear that a vigorous and – for the institutionalists – surprising reform activity has swept the Continent. Moreover, there seems to be a puzzling coherence in the reform trajectories that the welfare states are taking.</p>
<p>This double observation might (and should) have led to a serious questioning of the analytical value of the historical institutionalist approach in the first place, but interestingly enough the book takes precisely the opposite direction in arguing that recent developments in the approach now also make it possible to understand ‘substantial and transformative policy change’ in terms of a ‘cumulative effect of successive smaller reforms’ (p. 21). Although I think this book is exceptionally rich in its presentation and descriptions of social policy reform in Bismarckian systems, I remain sceptical about the added value of the historical institutionalist tool kit and the usefulness of its particular lingo. ‘In our cases’, writes Bruno Palier in the introductory framework chapter of the book, ‘we see no instances of brutal departure from the Bismarckian ways of thinking and doing, but rather a progressive change of these’ (p. 31). And further: ‘the orientation of reforms has changed only progressively, by a succession of measures that build on the consequences of the preceding ones. In all cases studied in this book, changes have been implemented through a succession of reforms and not through an abrupt paradigmatic change’ (p. 31). But who else than the institutionalists themselves suggested that change cannot occur because of institutional constraints and the new politics? And who else than the institutionalists themselves argued that if structural reforms occur, they must emerge as a result of a revolutionary epoch of paradigm change, also known as a ‘critical juncture’. Since, in the light of the permanently adapting and reforming systems, this was not true all along, I find it difficult to see what deep insight we can take from the sudden realization that apparently change happens all the time and in a certain sequence that takes into account the results from earlier changes. History matters, institutions matter, yes, sure, but how does that help us explain the reforms that are happening? What is pulling? Who is pushing?</p>
<p>The book’s framework and contributions are very strong where they describe the elements that the welfare systems in continental Europe have in common and what it is that makes them ‘Bismarckian’. But – and I realize that I sound much too grumpy and that I am not doing justice to the book’s many other great qualities and contributions – it is weakest in that it derives the central hypothesis from this: ‘the similarity of welfare conceptions and institutions largely explains the similarities in the problem profiles and in the developmental trajectories of these welfare systems’ (p. 25). How do institutions explain (institutional) reform? The book does not give an answer other than that ‘welfare institutions structure debates, political preferences and policy choices’ (p. 27). But how, under what conditions and in what direction does this happen? Again, no answer: ‘Depending on how these different variables are set, different patterns of support and opposition are likely to be encountered’ (p. 27). The book, in other words, is silent on the real explanatory issue, namely what explains why and how conditions for reform are set differently in comparable institutional settings? What explains the start and direction of a reform trajectory given institutional constraints? The book is (<italic>excusez le mot!</italic>) locked-in in the descriptive jargon of historical institutionalism because it tries to explain what, in light of the very same analytical framework, earlier were still inexplicable reforms. It uses the causally open and not particularly enlightening notion of path dependency, albeit with a little twist, the deep insight being that small and incremental changes can lead to transformative changes that ultimately can be recognized as institutional evolution. In short, I am still waiting for the book that explains what drives such an evolution.</p>

<title>The dualization of continental European welfare states?</title>
<p>Anke Hassel</p>
<p>Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>The transformation of European welfare states and labour markets has been a central theme of comparative politics and comparative political economy over the last decade. Twenty years ago, scholars began to realize that the sustainability of European welfare states was in peril. As Gosta Esping-Andersen succinctly summarized, ‘The real crisis of contemporary welfare regimes lies in the disjuncture between the existing institutional construction and exogenous change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425321">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>: 5). But at the time, given the institutional set-up and powerful veto points of welfare recipients – particularly in Bismarckian welfare states – scholars assumed that the status quo was likely to prevail well into the future. Most agreed that it was largely impossible to render structural reforms in a continental welfare setting, despite the massive problems these countries faced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425321">Pierson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Much has happened since. Despite institutional barriers and the popularity of many aspects of European welfare states, the reform of programmes has begun, largely in an incremental fashion. As this comprehensive and extremely knowledgeable volume edited by Bruno Palier makes clear, the overall reform trajectory of most continental welfare states following the alleged ‘golden age of the welfare state’ and the oil crisis in 1970s has been remarkably similar. A phase of negotiated retrenchment began in the early 1990s, following a phase of preserving old institutional logic by means of labour shedding and further increases in social contributions in the 1980s. During this second phase, reform measures by and large aimed at stabilizing or cutting social expenditure and left the overall structures of social transfers untouched. Subsequently, minor reforms of social insurance programmes were negotiated with the social partners, who made sure that the costs for labour market insiders remained low.</p>
<p>At the same time, a new realm of tax-financed benefits and welfare programmes developed alongside the social insurance welfare state. As unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, continued to rise and employment rates declined, social insurance contributions soared. The funding mechanism of insurance-based welfare had reached its limits. A third phase of welfare restructuring started in the mid 1990s. Reforms included a more fundamental attack on the traditional pillars of the Bismarckian welfare states, targeting changes in financing mechanisms or governance arrangements. The social partners’ involvement was reduced and tax financing increased, and now, since the early 2000s, we are witness to a fourth phase that has seen reforms move beyond the incremental adjustment of the Bismarckian welfare state to structural change. They include funded pension schemes, activation policies, professionalization of care systems and the increasing privatization of health provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711425321">Palier and Martin, 2008</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>The nature, scope and direction of this ongoing reform process in many continental European political economies is described in this volume as a process of multiple dualization. As Palier puts it in his concluding chapter:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The development of two worlds of welfare within the public system; the addition of a private component to the public system; and the division of the population between insured insiders and assisted and/or activated outsiders … a secondary world of work and welfare is developing for outsiders, made up of secondary ‘atypical’ jobs, activation policies and income-tested targeted benefits. (p. 383)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In short, it is argued that a new welfare world has emerged in which family benefits, healthcare and poverty alleviation are provided either as universal or targeted benefits mainly financed by taxation and controlled by the state, while at the same time, pensions and employment policies have largely been retained in the social insurance world.</p>
<p>In the following, I would like to take issue with the notion of dualization as the most powerful concept to emerge from the study of the transformation of European welfare states. I will focus on the fact that the Bismarckian welfare state has always reinforced and constituted market-based stratification and argue that rather than institutionalizing dualism, recent reforms and structural changes have led to a more fragmented and heterogeneous labour market with reduced welfare provisions. Ultimately, all employees are now worse off than they previously were, and in many cases the groups of insiders have been more affected than the outsiders, although in different ways.</p>
<p>In the Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Esping-Andersen classified continental European welfare states as conservative-corporatist, based on social insurance, which tended to reproduce status differentials. The core constituents of Bismarckian insurance – full-time workers with long occupational tenure – enjoyed comprehensive protection against the negative effects of old age, unemployment, disability and sickness. Over the course of the 20th century, differentials between occupational status groups diminished. In particular, the initially stark contrast between blue and white collar workers in regard to pension entitlements was abolished, step by step. However, the Bismarckian welfare state was never an inclusive welfare state. Those outside mainstream employment – day labourers, the unskilled and underemployed and women workers with patchy employment records – were covered by social insurance more in name than in real protection. Low contribution levels led to inadequate protection in the case of unemployment and old age.</p>
<p>For the needy, poor and those with ‘atypical’ employment records, many Bismarckian welfare states also provided social assistance. These were means-tested poverty relief measures and included family responsibilities to pay for impoverished adult children or parents. In addition, the poor and underemployed were excluded from measures of active labour market policies and a decent state pension. Public services were underdeveloped in Bismarckian welfare states, preventing some groups from having stable employment patterns, particularly women. Women were largely excluded from becoming labour market insiders, since the lack of child-care provision stopped them from having meaningful careers or stable employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425321">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>: 88). For most women, social protection was therefore dependent on their relationship with a male breadwinner. As is well known and established in the literature, women’s access to healthcare, income protection and pensions derived from their husbands’ entitlements and employment.</p>
<p>In other words, dualism between labour market insiders and outsiders has always been an inherent and even constitutive element of Bismarckian welfare states. The main component of dualism was the role of familialism. The division of labour between husbands and wives with regard to childcare, but also between the state and the family, has had major repercussions on the ability of women to fully participate in the labour market. Women’s precarious position on the labour market had negative consequences for social protection and reinforced stratification and social inequality. As Esping-Andersen points out in the prologue of this book, familialism bears a major responsibility for the inadequacy of the Bismarckian welfare state. Against this backdrop, it comes as a surprise when recent reform trajectories of continental welfare states are characterized as processes of dualization. In what way has existing dualism increased or become more distinct?</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, two major developments have taken place in continental Europe. First, employment patterns have become more varied and heterogeneous. The ‘standard’ employment relationship of a full-time, open ended and secure job has given way to many different kinds of employment relations: part-time work, fixed-term employment, temping agencies, freelance work and so on. Activation policies from the mid 1990s onwards using such policy tools as in-work benefits and tighter checks on the unemployed have brought hitherto long-term unemployed and underemployed workers back into employment, although on a precarious basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711425321">Eichhorst et al., 2011</xref>). What all these ‘atypical’ types of work have in common is that they, on average, lead to lower pay and that outsiders are more likely to move in and out of unemployment.</p>
<p>In addition, however, those who are still in ‘standard’ employment have also seen their working lives transformed. Work pressure has intensified and flexibility on the job has increased. They have seen their managers’ pay explode while their own wages stagnate. In many firms, workers have had to make concessions to keep their jobs and have had many fringe benefits cut. These changes have been unevenly implemented, however. Some industries (mining) and occupational groups (civil servants) have continued to be highly protected, while rapid restructuring has taken place in others (that is, privatized public enterprises). Some still enjoy very stable jobs; some have faced several waves of redundancies. The brunt of the burden has often been borne by younger workers whose pay and conditions differed considerably from those of older colleagues in the same job. Many formal labour market insiders would not consider themselves as being protected, given the changes they have experienced at work. These transformations can be described as a trend towards precariousness and fragmentation of the labour market as a whole.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to social protection and welfare provisions, continental European welfare states have seen a wave of welfare restructuring and retrenchment affecting both labour market insiders and outsiders. Moreover, the deepest cuts in welfare entitlements have affected labour market insiders more than labour market outsiders, simply because they had more to lose. Since benefits for the needy poor, particularly for children, were often at levels that were difficult to cut further, the majority of cuts have affected those who were on insurance-based schemes. For instance, changing pension systems from defined benefits to defined contributions, increasing the retirement age and recalculating public (and private) pension entitlements have made pension entitlements more homogenous at a lower level. Occupational pensions, which would have made a clear distinction between insiders and outsiders, have been cut rather than be used to fill the void of public provisions.</p>
<p>Similarly with regard to unemployment insurance, activation has often meant entitlement cuts for previous labour market insiders in order to put pressure on the unemployed to find new jobs. In many respects, the distinction between the insured insider and the assisted outsider has become less meaningful. The average insured insider, rather than having full insurance coverage (health, unemployment, pension), has precious few privileges compared with the assisted outsider, despite the fact that he or she has paid large amounts of contributions into social security funds. At the same time, during the course of labour market activation, the assisted outsider has gained access to measures that previously had been the privilege of insiders. For instance, the Hartz reforms in Germany have opened up access to training programmes and wage subsidies that previously were only accessible for those covered by unemployment insurance. Similarly, because assistance benefits are needs-based and insurance benefits tended to be cut, benefit level differentials narrowed instead of widening. In other words, the world of work has become less secure for all labour market participants, and the degree of protection has diminished for all.</p>
<p>A closer look at the Hartz reforms bears this out. According to an evaluation study of the distributional effects, the poorest 20 percent of the population have benefited from the reform, while middle-income groups have lost out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711425321">Koch et al., 2009</xref>: 47). Within the population as a whole, poverty rates have declined since previously hidden forms of poverty have been reduced. Those households that had incomes just below the social assistance levels and did not receive transfer payments are now eligible for additional benefits, particularly for housing.</p>
<p>A wave of restructuring of labour markets and welfare programmes has swept through continental Europe. The vast majority of working families have seen their social entitlements cut, their economic security weakened and the pressure to find and hold work heightened. The outcome has been a general move of an already stratified system towards a greater degree of universalism with basic provisions, in which occupational and status related distinctions for the majority of employees have diminished rather than increased. At the same time, segmentation on the labour market has persisted. Although ‘A Long Goodbye to Bismarck’ provides an excellent analysis of these developments, there are limits in using the concept of dualization as a way of summarizing them.</p>

<p>In the mid 2000s, when we started our collective research, reforms to the welfare systems of continental Europe had received far less attention than those adopted in liberal or social democratic contexts. To the extent that they had figured in the comparative literature at this time, they were – notwithstanding Kees Van Kersbergen’s almost Maoist perspective on permanent reform – almost always portrayed as cases where ‘freezing’, ‘stability’ or ‘sclerosis’ prevailed. Yet these welfare systems were also changing, as a number of us had already highlighted earlier (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711425321">Bonoli and Palier, 1998</xref>, for example).</p>
<p>The aim of our research project was to provide a systematic and comprehensive empirical account of the reforms that had been taking place in Bismarckian welfare systems since the early 1980s. By comprehensive, we meant not only to be as exhaustive as possible, by studying almost all cases that could be said to be Bismarckian. We also wanted to be comprehensive in the more Weberian sense, by trying to understand the reforms of these welfare systems from within. This meant distinguishing ourselves from the Anglo-Nordic axis that dominated the comparative welfare state literature at the time and that offered a rather disdainful external perspective – excellently parodied by Kees Van Kersbergen – on the ‘ugly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711425321">Manow, 2004</xref>) conservative corporatist world of welfare, hopelessly unable to change. Researchers in the comparative mainstream did not see that Bismarckian welfare systems were changing because the reforms implemented were not those that they were looking for, whether ‘bad’ retrenchment or ‘good’ adjustment to a changing socio-economic context. In fact, what we show in the book is that in continental Europe reforms were being implemented ‘à la Bismarckian’. Our aim was certainly not to eulogize about this Bismarckian route to reform, but simply to address the question ‘Why are they doing what they do?’ rather than always asking ‘Why are they not doing what they should?’</p>
<p>The lead hypothesis of the project was that the shared institutional features of Bismarckian welfare states generate similar policy problems as well as similar trajectories of policy change, which may be more important in structuring change than the many other variables that are usually assumed to be important in welfare reform. Beyond national differences, the book indeed reveals a common reform trajectory that can be deconstructed into four main sequences, as summarized by Anke Hassel. I would, however, like to reiterate here why I believe that the notion of ‘dualization’ accurately portrays what happened to these welfare systems (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425321">Emmenegger et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In many continental European countries, the overriding aim from the late 1970s was saving the economic and social model based on highly skilled, highly paid and highly productive sectors and workers. This was achieved by preserving the jobs and social protection of the most productive industrial male breadwinners, and by simultaneously removing the least productive – female, older, young, low skilled and migrant – workers from the core labour market. Social insurances were highly instrumental in the implementation of this strategy, as they financed early retirement, relatively generous unemployment allowances or maternal wages.</p>
<p>When this first strategy appeared too costly and the high levels of social contribution necessary to finance it came to be seen as economically unviable, reforms aimed at retrenchment were not built against the traditional welfare systems, but within it. The Bismarckian logic was indeed at the heart of these reforms, since they generally reinforced the ‘equivalence principle’ (the contributivity of benefits) and also involved removing from social insurance the ‘burden’ of having to finance non-contributory benefits. Whether in old age pensions, unemployment benefits or invalidity allowances, in all our cases the main technique for reducing social insurance benefits was a strengthening of the link between entitlements and the amount and duration of contributions paid. This relied on the already existing logic of the schemes (their contributivity, that is, the right to social benefits derives from paying social contributions). Typically, unemployed or disabled people henceforth needed to have contributed for a longer period to be entitled to the full allowance. The number of years of contribution opening entitlement to a full pension was also increased, and/or deductions for pensions claimed, before the standard age of retirement was introduced. Benefits were thus reduced mainly for those who had not enjoyed a relatively unbroken and full-time career, but were preserved for more ‘typical’ workers. The very logic of these reforms thereby reinforced dualisms. The economic strategy relying on and protecting the most productive workers implied a further segmentation of the labour market, while the increased contributivity of social insurances meant that fewer people could access them, and more people were forced to rely on social assistance.</p>
<p>The representatives of those who contribute to and benefit from the system (that is, the wage earners) were among the key players in the political game around social policy reform. They had a say in the process, and the power to block proposals with which they did not agree. Acceptance by the social partners of benefit cuts was usually exchanged for the state agreeing to finance non-contributory benefits, the burden of which for social insurance the social partners had long complained about. A key finding of this book is that this dualizing political exchange is a general feature of welfare reforms in continental Europe. These reforms were perceived as preserving the very nature of social insurance, and sometimes even as reinforcing it. But as a result of the way that they were negotiated, these reforms sowed the seeds of dualization. In order to ‘relieve’ social insurance from covering the long-term unemployed and non-standard workers, the reforms institutionalized a new world of welfare for ‘atypical’ workers, organized around tax-financed, non-contributory and income-tested benefits. Furthermore, in the negotiation of retrenchment measures, the trade unions managed to guarantee the position of current ‘insiders’, through a long phasing-in period for reforms in pension rights and a dual recalibration of unemployment insurance benefits, with greater benefits for those who previously worked full-time and less for those with more broken careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425321">Clegg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>No one claims, however, that dualism is completely novel in continental Europe. Since their origins, Bismarckian social policies distinguished policies for workers (Arbeiterpolitik) from policies for the poor (Armenpolitik). What is new, though, is the general direction of the ‘permanent’ welfare reforms. During the Trente Glorieuses, extension, generalization and inclusiveness were – to a greater or lesser extent, as John Stephens reminds us – the trademark of social policy development in continental Europe, with Bismarckian institutions supposed to reach Beveridgean goals by directly or indirectly covering the whole population. Since the early 1980s, by contrast, social insurances have progressively lost their capacity to be ‘quasi-universal’. As a result of reduced replacement rates in unemployment benefits or pensions, they no longer provide ‘full income guarantees’. Due to the exclusion of more and more people (with atypical profiles) from social insurance, they no longer cover the whole population. Since one consequence of these reforms is that the coverage of social insurance shrinks, more and more space is created for the development of new benefits, whether on top of compulsory social insurance through voluntary private pensions, or below it through social assistance benefits, for those who have lost (or who never gained) rights to social insurance.</p>
<p>Our empirical account of these developments and our analysis of the losers and winners do not square with the claim that ‘insiders’ suffered as much as or more than ‘outsiders’ in these processes. If pension replacement rates are indeed generally decreasing (and will do so even more in the future, thus preserving the current pensioners), only those working in highly unionized large firms will benefit from private-funded pension schemes aimed at compensating for the foreseeable losses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425321">Seeleib-Kasier et al., 2011</xref>). If health insurance indeed covers less of individuals’ costs, only those working in the same large firms will be able to recoup much of their losses through complementary health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425321">Seeleib-Kasier et al., 2011</xref>). If unemployment benefits have indeed decreased for all workers, in some countries much of the core workforce are now almost entirely protected – in exchange for being more and more productive – from being made redundant, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425321">Anke Hassel (2011)</xref> has herself recently demonstrated for Germany.</p>
<p>We can here cite just one telling example, derived from the specific German reaction to the recent economic crisis. As is well known, in 2009 Germany experienced an abrupt decrease in its gross domestic product (GDP), yet maintained a relatively stable unemployment rate. Kurzarbeit was the magic tool. The 2010 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Employment Outlook underlines that this public short time work scheme had by 2009 helped to preserve as many as 200,000 jobs in Germany. This is a typical pro-insider policy, since it maintains in employment those in the threatened industrial sector who are most qualified and productive. Meanwhile, those who have an atypical employment contract are fired or those on short-term contracts do not get their contracts extended. While the Hartz IV reforms made things worse for many unemployed people in Germany, it simultaneously generated a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, which has been used in the crisis to finance Kurzarbeit. Money saved on the back of ‘outsiders’ has thus been used to protect ‘insiders’ from the crisis! As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425321">Wolfgang Streeck (2010</xref>: 508) puts it, ‘in 2009 the Federal Labor Agency could draw on a cash hoard of savings from unemployment benefit made possible by Hartz IV to fund an unprecedented expansion of short-time work’. And as underlined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425321">OECD (2010</xref>: 19), ‘the positive impact of Short Term Work was limited to workers with permanent contracts, further increasing labor market segmentation between workers in regular jobs and workers in part-time jobs’.</p>
<p>John Stephens is of course correct to point to differences between Bismarckian welfare systems and their reform trajectories. Indeed, the country chapters in our book clearly illustrate that the exact same reform trajectory has not been followed everywhere. The Netherlands commenced structural reforms much sooner than other countries; Belgium has not really witnessed the turn towards activation seen elsewhere; and Italy and Austria have to date done little to modernize their social policies. The politics of reform has also been different. Reforms were highly conflictual in some countries but negotiated through social pacts in others, Europe mattered rather more in some cases – such as Italy, Spain, Belgium and France – than it did in others, and so on.</p>
<p>A number of the chapters discuss the reasons for these variations in some detail (see especially the chapter on Belgium/the Netherlands by Anton Hemerijck and Ive Marx, on Spain by Ana Guillen and on Switzerland by Silja Häusermann). However, I would emphasize that our basic hypothesis helps us to understand many of these differences, as well as the cross-case commonalities. In effect, what seems to be the main explanandum for whether countries have followed the same trajectory or not is related to the initial institutional configuration of their welfare systems. The main divergences are, in other words, explained by differences in the institutional point of departure. This is obvious for healthcare in the case of Italy and Spain. As the Spanish chapter makes clear, it is because the health insurance system was not based on a diversity of autonomous funds that it could be universalized. In a similar vein, the initial structure of pensions and healthcare in the Netherlands or in Switzerland account for much of their specific reform trajectories. The same could be said to explain the Belgium exceptionalism as far as unemployment is concerned, or some peculiar tendencies in the Visegraad countries. To put it in a nutshell, the more the point of departure diverged from the Bismarckian norm, the more ‘deviant’ the reform trajectory has been too.</p>
<p>To the despair of Kees Van Kersbergen, this research project may not have been able to answer his big questions (but who ever had or will?). We have, however, at least underlined and explained the specificity of the trajectory followed by Bismarckian welfare systems over the last three decades. Let us hope that this is already something. At a minimum it may help us understand the current European situation, where Germany seems to have been able to regenerate and redynamize its economic model, while being among the European countries where in-work poverty and inequalities have increased most over the last decade.</p>
