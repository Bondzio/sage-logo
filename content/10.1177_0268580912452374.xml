<p>Facebook has no doubt made a significant impact on entire social networks, with over 900 million users to date. Daniel Miller argues that this impact can be seen particularly in Trinidad, in ways that are both unique to the island and that reflect the impact of Facebook worldwide. Trinidad is chosen as the location for study because of the relatively high usage of the website there and the seamless way in which the Facebook network has been integrated into existing complex offline networks locally. In an extensive anthropological investigation of the use of Facebook on this one island, Miller seeks to answer a number of questions about these users of the social networking site: how their lives have been changed by the site; what impact it has on their relationships; if it approximates some kind of community; how it changes how we see ourselves; and why people are seemingly so unconcerned with loss of privacy. To explore these questions, the book is divided into two parts. First, the author presents 12 unique stories, each a portrait of one particular user and the consequences of their Facebook use. Following these stories is a critical analysis of Facebook as both a Trinidad creation and broader theses about what the site might be universally.</p>
<p>The 12 portraits contrast the positive impacts of Facebook enhancing one’s social life through an online community for the housebound and for the shy, with negative impacts stemming from what may be judged as improper use of the site. The bright and social Dr Karamath was able to maintain his vibrant networks online once his mobility declined, and even forged a unique friendship with a group of other older adults online. Arvind utilized social games such as <italic>Farmville</italic> to escape from offline life and find more comfortable ways to interact with others online. Unfortunately for Marvin, his heavy use of the site drove away his wife out of jealousy of his online interactions. In an even less fortunate tale, Josanne, a locally famous musician, was humiliated at the hands of other users when an unwanted audience grew around the release of her private sex tape. One of these portraits speaks more generally, and less dramatically, to the site being a ‘time suck’, with Aaron using the site for six hours a day communicating, playing games, and cultivating his profile. Many of these stories feel universal; the individuals could exist in nearly any other country. More compelling are the portraits that go deeper, positing Facebook as a public performance space, a book of truths, and as a growing history of the self. In one portrait, a young woman named Vishala uses her Facebook site to ‘Go Brave’ – a strong sentiment in Trinidad to confidently go forth in one’s pursuits – and discovers the social networking site revealing a truer self than can be achieved offline. Similarly, Ajani uses her Facebook page as a stage for her artistic expressions, carefully crafting her messages to elicit a desired audience response. For Nicole, an early adopter of the social networking utility, the site has grown with her over the last six years, providing an ongoing history of her life and documenting her growth from college student to mother. Finally, there are tales that illustrate how Facebook’s network mirrors and complements existing communities and network structures in Trinidad society. For Alana, Facebook provides an integrated space to both study and gossip with classmates, just as one would at school. Elijah Ministries uses ‘God’s technology’ to more effectively get the Word out, and not only build a stronger community within the church, but also provide an online space free of geographic constraints for its members. Meanwhile, Joseph was able to revamp the site, once full of depressing memories of a past relationship, into a key marketing tool in his business; transforming a once personal network into a professional one. Finally, for Burton and others, the site functions as a meta-network of all the existing offline networks that Trinidadians utilize for work and social needs.</p>
<p>In his analysis of Trinidad’s localization of Facebook, Miller states that ‘there is no such thing as one Facebook from the perspective of cultural relativity. Facebook is only the aggregate of its regional and particular usage’ (p. 163). Although Trinidad has a smaller population of users, it is higher relative to how many residents have Internet connections. The strong integration of Facebook into the lives of Trinidad residents is also obvious in how much more often Facebook comes up in offline conversations on the island than it does in the United States or the United Kingdom, the author’s other locations of study. For Trinidadians the site is better known as <italic>Fasbook</italic> or <italic>Macobook</italic> from ‘fas’ meaning to get to know another person too quickly, and ‘maco’ meaning to be nosy, or get in another’s business. They even compare time on the site to ‘liming’, a traditional Trinidadian way of spontaneously hanging out. Thus, while the site was created in the United States, the portraits are presented to illustrate that the site has become an expression of Trinidadian values, functioning as an online version of their offline bacchanal, or the scandal and gossip with which they define their culture.</p>
<p>While Miller argues mainly that the people of Trinidad have developed their own unique use of Facebook, he also realizes these stories provide evidence for a broader impact of the site. He develops 15 theses on what Facebook may be globally, drawing from the individual users’ stories. These theses address how Facebook changes the individual, the community, and even how it shapes our understanding of the world in more profound ways. As individuals, Facebook helps us grow relationships by utilizing the relationships we already have and by making friendships more efficient. Facebook can also help those who for various reasons struggle with offline relationships. Most interestingly, Facebook acts as a meta-friend, providing an ever-present and reliable source of information about friends, relieving boredom and loneliness without intrusion on others. Through these uses, Facebook has transformed our relationship to privacy, pushing the balance between being social and sharing too much of oneself on a public forum. It has also transformed the self as we consider how best to present our persona online. These uses drive the development of a ‘netiquette’ of use, largely reflecting existing norms of social behavior. Yet, Facebook allows us to customize ever-changing notions of community, diminishing the growing geographic differences, but also allowing for the disengagement from such community when more isolation is preferred. Arguably, the site has also become a key venue for political organization thanks to its nearly global reach. Facebook has even transformed our notions of time, space, and leisure. People communicating via Facebook do not need to be in the same place, they do not need to be online at the same time, and they can access the site during any part of their day, making context irrelevant. In closing, Miller provides some additional ideas on what Facebook is and is not. He states it is not a corporate site; our lives are no less authentic on the site than offline. It exists within ‘polymedia’, or the multitude of ways in which people can now communicate through a diverse collection of technology, and it may eventually drive all of our communications. Ultimately, for some, Facebook is the Internet itself, providing a seamless integration of all online activities and information.</p>
<p>The stories presented in this book are engaging and, as the author hopes, read as enjoyable travelogue. These portraits also provide intriguing evidence for the pervasive role of Facebook in all aspects of life for the residents of Trinidad. For example, the philosophical truths that Vishala discovers about herself and others through the site, how Ajani uses the space to craft an ongoing performance, and the history of herself that Nicole has built are captivating and surprising in their profundity. However, not all of the stories are necessarily as rich with meaning as the author implies. For instance, when Arvind plays <italic>Farmville</italic>, as many Facebook users do, he may simply be engaging in a light-hearted form of entertainment and nothing more. Similarly, Aaron may spend six hours a day on Facebook in the same way others may spend six hours a day watching television. Facebook clearly plays a large role in each of these individuals’ lives, but not an equally transformative role for each. These stories may also be more universal than their presentation implies. While many portraits certainly revealed elements of Trinidad culture, it is easy to imagine these same stories taking place in other countries, each with their own cultural twist. This is not to say that Trinidadians have not made Facebook their own, as indeed they have, but the way in which they use it is more generalizable, as illustrated in the 15 theses. Ultimately, Miller answers the questions he explores at the start of the book, and presents a strong case for the seamless integration of this one website into the lives of an entire culture.</p>
