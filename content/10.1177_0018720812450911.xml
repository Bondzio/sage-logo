<p>In many complex industrial environments, including aviation and power system control, humans now share the responsibility for the safety and security of the system with advanced technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812450911">Flaspöler et al., 2009</xref>). This interdependence between human operators and technology has generally resulted in improvements in both the efficiency and the accuracy of system performance. However, it has also shifted the role of the operator from “active controller” to “system monitor,” with a resulting emphasis on diagnostic reasoning.</p>
<p>Diagnostic reasoning is a cognitive skill whereby patterns of information arising from the environment are matched to preexisting patterns of information resident in long-term memory, which are then used to form an explanation of a previous event and/or to anticipate or predict a future event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812450911">Schimdt &amp; Boshuizen, 1993</xref>). Although successful diagnosis is possible with limited knowledge and instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812450911">O’Hare, Mullen, Wiggins, &amp; Molesworth, 2008</xref>), skilled diagnostic performance is typically acquired through extensive experience and practice and is generally regarded as the province of domain experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812450911">Gale &amp; Walker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812450911">Jarodzka, Scheiter, Gerjets, &amp; van Gog, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720812450911">Wallis &amp; Horswill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; Bollwerk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 1995</xref>). Therefore, understanding the cognitive processes that enable the acquisition of expert diagnostic skills has important implications for workplace assessment, evaluation, and training.</p>
<p>The acquisition of cognitive skills such as diagnostic reasoning has typically been investigated using comparative analyses of experts and novices. Referred to as the expert–novice paradigm, it has been a useful strategy to identify the features of cognitive processing that differentiate expert from novice performance. Moreover, the fact that these comparisons have been undertaken across many different domains enables the identification of similarities that reflect broader underlying constructs.</p>
<p>One of the most robust outcomes of the expert–novice paradigm is that experts can maintain and recall large amounts of information in short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812450911">de Groot, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812450911">Schimdt &amp; Boshuizen, 1993</xref>) despite the well-established processing restriction of seven simultaneous chunks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812450911">Miller, 1956</xref>). This suggests that experts have developed particular cognitive strategies that enable them to acquire and integrate domain-related information quickly and accurately.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Kintsch (1995)</xref> suggested that the accuracy and the capacity of memory-based recall among experts reflect the utilization of cues to selectively attend to, and integrate, task-related information. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812450911">Klein (1989)</xref> described the utilization of cues as one of the distinguishing characteristics of domain experts. These cues are acquired through their association with specific events, eventually becoming automated with repeated exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812450911">Lipshitz, Klein, Orasanu, &amp; Salas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the application of cues effectively provides a mechanism to reduce the cognitive demands of a task, without the loss of relevant diagnostic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812450911">Rasmussen, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical support for the application of cues in expert diagnosis is reasonably well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812450911">Cellier, Eyrolle, &amp; Marine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812450911">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812450911">Schriver, Morrow, Wickens, &amp; Talleur, 2008</xref>). For example, in cricket, expert batsmen use movement cues to predict an opposing bowler’s intentions and to prepare their shots before the ball has been delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812450911">Müller, Abernethy, &amp; Farrow, 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the aviation context, there is evidence to suggest that expert pilots focus on those cues that are most predictive of engine failure and, similarly, those cues that are most likely to indicate the source of a fault once an engine failure has occurred. Accordingly, expert pilots respond faster and more accurately to faults than do novice pilots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812450911">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the proposition that experts use cues is not in dispute, a major limitation of previous research based on the expert–novice paradigm is that experts have normally been identified simply on the basis of their cumulative experience operating within a particular domain. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812450911">Schraagen (1993)</xref> defined psychology research design experts as those individuals with at least 10 years of experience designing experiments in psychology. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812450911">Coderre, Mandin, Harasym, and Fick (2003)</xref> defined gastroenterology experts as qualified specialists with more than 5 years of experience. However, several studies have demonstrated that individuals with extensive experience do not necessarily exhibit superior performance to novices on domain-representative tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Lehmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812450911">Shanteau &amp; Stewart, 1992</xref>). It is possible that this may reflect the fact that “years of experience” in a role does not necessarily equate directly to the progression toward expertise. Therefore, experience may be a necessary but not sufficient precursor to expertise. Dedicated practice is also required, and this is likely to be best reflected in erformance-based measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812450911">Charness, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Charness, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A second, but related, limitation of expert–novice comparisons is that this approach may not capture the full spectrum of cognitive skills development. Expert–novice comparisons, by definition, can capture only the two extremes of performance. However, among skill acquisition theorists, there is broad consensus that at least three stages compose the progression from novice through competence to expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Lehman, 1996</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Lehmann (1996)</xref> refer to three stages of cognitive skill acquisition, each of which is associated with a distinct level of performance. These include a novice phase, when the component skills and knowledge are developed, a competent phase, in which learned skills have become partially or entirely automated through associations in memory, through to the expert phase, characterized by the ability to maintain control over the strategic aspects of performance, facilitating the selective encoding and refinement of those associations. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson (1983)</xref> proposed a three-stage model of skill acquisition, which broadly maps to novice, competent, and expert phases described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Lehmann (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>The difficulty associated with stage models of skill acquisition is that there is an assumption that the acquisition of particular skills within one stage necessarily facilitates the progression to subsequent stages of skill acquisition. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that many operators can fail to progress beyond competence, despite the accumulation of significant amounts of operational experience and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812450911">Doane, Pellegrino, &amp; Klatzky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812450911">Reif &amp; Allen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720812450911">Watson, Stimpson, Topping, &amp; Porock, 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to compare such individuals to novice and expert practitioners to improve our understanding of the progression toward expertise. However, to ensure the reliability and validity of such comparisons, a priori techniques for distinguishing genuinely competent individuals from novices and experts must be devised.</p>
<sec id="section7-0018720812450911">
<title>The Proposed Solution</title>
<p>Although many researchers have used indirect measures of expertise, such as operational experience, as the basis for classifications, the identification of genuine experts using domain-related performance is well established. For example, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812450911">de Groot (1965)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812450911">Elo (1986)</xref> identified chess experts on the basis of tournament rankings, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812450911">Ericsson (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812450911">Ericsson, Charness, Feltovich, &amp; Hoffman, 2006</xref>) identified sports, medical, research design, and music experts using domain-representative tasks. Similarly, several researchers have stratified task performance using a within-task criterion. For example, movement responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720812450911">Vaeyens, Lenoir, Williams, &amp; Philippaerts, 2007</xref>) and visual search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812450911">Savelsbergh, Van der Kamp, Williams, Ward, &amp; Brogan, 2005</xref>) techniques in laboratory environments have been used to predict soccer performance on the field.</p>
<p>The present study extended this work by proposing that it may be possible to stratify diagnostic reasoning performance, utilizing tasks that capture distinct aspects of broader domain-related performance. To capture the three stages of cognitive skill development, whereby novices’ progress to expertise based on the acquisition and refinement of cue associations in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812450911">Klein, 1989</xref>), tasks were selected on the basis that the judicious utilization of cues would facilitate performance. Four tasks were developed for the present study, comprising feature iden- tification, feature discrimination, background knowledge, and information acquisition. Each task was modified to utilize stimuli from the power system control domain. Power system control was selected as the domain of interest on the basis that the activity is largely cognitive in nature and, as a computer-based activity, it was possible to ensure a degree of experimental control while maintaining a high degree of ecological validity. Furthermore, the domain is one in which operators develop highly specialized skills and thus have the opportunity to develop expertise.</p>
<p><italic>Feature identification</italic> is based on the observation that experts utilize a limited set of features that either (a) provide a degree of ecological validity and/or (b) are particularly consequential to the safety and security of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812450911">Müller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812450911">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>). The identification of these key features restricts the search for information and thereby primes a response so that response latency is decreased yet remains accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812450911">Schyns, 1998</xref>). The skill of feature identification can be examined through a target-matching task in which the operator is asked to identify a domain-relevant target from an array. Because power controllers must frequently extract network fault alerts from complex displays, a process critical to the initial recognition of network problems, the present study used a network fault alert within a power network display as the target (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812450911">Figure 1</xref>). This task can also be extended, by asking the operator to identify, with only limited exposure, the location of a particular target. In both cases, this requires the capacity to identify key features from a complex scene, a skill that is presumably most developed among experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812450911">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812450911">Santos &amp; Badre, 1994</xref>) and is a known mediator of diagnostic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812450911">Strauss &amp; Kirlik, 2006</xref>). Thus, domain experts can be expected to demonstrate reduced latency and greater accuracy in response to the various cue-based tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812450911">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812450911">Schyns, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Feature discrimination</italic> is broadly based on the lens model’s conceptualization of expertise, whereby performance can be facilitated by the consistent recognition and utilization of optimally diagnostic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812450911">Brunswik, 1956</xref>). Consistent with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss and Shanteau (2003)</xref> demonstrated that experts’ perception of the relative utility of features remains consistent over a series of trials. Summarized by the Cochran–Weiss–Shanteau (CWS) index of expertise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss and Shanteau (2003)</xref> proposed that the ratio of discrimination over inconsistency could be used as a metric of expertise. <italic>Discrimination</italic> refers to the differential evaluations of the perceived utility of individual features within a set, whereas <italic>consistency</italic> refers to the participant’s evaluation of the same feature over time. Thus, the ratio will be larger when participants both discriminate effectively and are consistent in their ratings of utility for the same features.</p>
<p>Although the CWS index is undoubtedly a useful tool for the assessment of expertise, its validity relies on the use of a series of simple scenarios that are totally consistent in terms of the available cues. However, the nature of many complex industrial environments is such that the development of such scenarios requires that they be simplified to the point where key features associated with the actual task may inadvertently be removed or, alternatively, become so obvious as to artificially reduce the variation in responses between participants. Consequently, the researcher may impose structure and rules on judgments that may not actually exist in the naturalistic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812450911">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study took an alternative approach, by analyzing responses to a single, complex scenario for which the relevance of a range of features was considered. In the field, it is critical that power controllers be able to selectively ignore irrelevant alerts and information and focus on those indicative of the causal fault. Therefore, consistent with the principles underlying the CWS index, it was argued that, in comparison to nonexperts, experts would be better able to discriminate between features with relatively greater or lesser relevance given a specific scenario. Based on the discrimination component of the CWS formula, discrimination was calculated using within-subject response variance in ratings of utility across each of the features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003</xref>). Thus, experts were expected to demonstrate relatively greater variance in their ratings across all features, regardless of utility, in comparison to nonexperts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812450911">Kolodner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although paired associations are not closely matched to a real-world process, this measure is based on the long-standing practice of measuring the strength of associations in memory by presenting word pairs and measuring response latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812450911">Ackerman &amp; Rathburn, 1984</xref>) or ratings of perceived relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812450911">Schvaneveldt, Beringer, &amp; Lamonica, 2001</xref>). Therefore, this task should provide a measure of the real-world ability to recognize the relationship between key features and events, critical to the recognition of latent faults. In its present form, the task presents two random but domain-relevant words or phrases either sequentially or simultaneously and measures response latency and variance in ratings of relatedness. The sequential pairings were included to assess the impact of priming on response latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812450911">Klein, 1989</xref>), whereas the simultaneous pairings were included to assess the participant’s ability to divide attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812450911">Sweller, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Among experts, cue associations are refined and efficient, so that the presentation of the feature within a valid cue should prime the outcome and vice versa, resulting in lower response latencies. This is consistent with the paired-relatedness analyses utilized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812450911">Schvaneveldt et al. (2001)</xref>, whereby expert aviators demonstrated reduced response times and greater discrimination for ratings of association between paired items. As with the Feature Discrimination Task, discrimination in the Paired Association Task was measured using the within-subject variance across item ratings, and thus domain experts were expected to demonstrate both reduced response latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812450911">Ackerman &amp; Rathburn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812450911">Schvaneveldt et al., 2001</xref>) and greater response variance in the Paired Association Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The Transition Task is based on the observation that experts and nonexperts differ in the sequence in which they acquire task-related information. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins and O’Hare (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812450911">Wiggins and Bollwerk (2006)</xref> were able to differentiate expert from nonexpert pilots based on the sequence in which information was accessed when responding to a failure scenario. Although nonexperts tended to acquire information in a sequence consistent with its physical presentation, domain experts tended to acquire information less sequentially, in an order reflecting the relevance and context of the information.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins and O’Hare (1995)</xref> and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720812450911">Wiggins, Stevens, Howard, Henley, and O’Hare (2002)</xref> developed a procedure to quantify the transition involved in the acquisition of information using the sequence of information screens as they are presented to participants as a reference score. For each participant, sequentially accessed pairs of information screens were examined to establish whether they were drawn from the same or different submenus. On the basis of these data, it was possible to establish the proportion of pairs of information screens accessed from the same submenu and thus the extent to which information was accessed according to the structure in which it was presented.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins and O’Hare (1995)</xref> employed a menu structure, the present study established the transition sequence using a single list of domain-relevant categories. Each category on the list could be clicked to reveal additional information regarding a network incident. The information and structure were consistent with reports provided by the system. By examining the sequential pairs of information screens as they were accessed and establishing whether they represented the sequential pairs of information screens as they were listed, it was possible to calculate the proportion of pairs of information screens accessed in the sequence in which they were listed. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins and O’Hare (1995)</xref>, experts were expected to utilize a less sequential strategy for acquiring information and thus access a lower proportion of screens sequentially.</p>

<title>Aims and Hypothesis</title>
<p>The specific aim of the present study was to determine whether, collectively, four approaches to the measurement of cue utilization—Feature Identification, Feature Discrimination, Paired Association, and the Transition Tasks—were able to decompose performance into three levels consistent with the novice, competent, and expert stages of skill acquisition described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Lehmann (1996)</xref>. Because experts rely heavily on cue associations in memory to direct their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812450911">Klein, 1989</xref>), they were expected to demonstrate consistently superior performance on those reasoning tasks that required the judicious extraction and utilization of cues. By comparison, competent nonexperts, who, although experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812450911">Gray, 2004</xref>), draw on less refined cases or cue associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson, 1983</xref>), should demonstrate somewhat weaker performance. Novices, with limited operational experience, are expected to perform relatively poorly on any specialist task. Therefore, the following was hypothesized:</p>
<list id="list1-0018720812450911" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Performance across the tasks will cluster into three levels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These clusters, reflecting novice, competent, and expert practitioners, will differ in terms of performance in each of the tasks. The expert cluster, compared to the other clusters, will be associated with <list id="list2-0018720812450911" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>A reduced response latency and increased accuracy during the Feature Identification Task</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A reduced response latency and an increase in the variance of ratings of association between pairs in the Paired Association Task</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An increase in the variance of ratings of utility of individual features during the Feature Discrimination Task</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A decrease in the proportion of information screens accessed sequentially during the Transition Task</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Novice and competent clusters will be differentiated on the basis of years of experience, but no difference will be evident between competent and expert clusters.</p>
<p>The final hypothesis was designed to test the proposition that the expert cue utilization cluster was associated with diagnostic expertise. Because skilled diagnostic performance is generally regarded as characteristic of domain expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812450911">Gale &amp; Walker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812450911">Jarodzka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720812450911">Wallis &amp; Horswill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 2006</xref>), the following was also hypothesized:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In comparison to the other clusters, the expert cue utilization cluster will select the optimal diagnostic outcome with greater frequency.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants represented a convenience sample recruited during a training session held by TransGrid, the owner and operator of the New South Wales electrical power transmission network. They comprised 65 power transmission operators, of whom 61 were male and 4 were female. All of the participants approached elected to participate in the study. They ranged in age from 23 to 61 years, with a mean of 38.14 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.63). The participants had accumulated between 0 and 40 years of experience in power transmission, with a mean of 14 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.30). Of the participants, 27 were part of a graduate program and thus were considered inexperienced in power transmission, with a mean of 2.85 years of experience (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.76). The remaining 38 participants were not recent graduates and had accumulated a mean of 22.36 years of experience (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.98) within the domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018720812450911">
<title>Stimuli Development</title>
<p>Prior to the study, cognitive interviews were conducted with a subject matter expert from the power transmission domain to develop the stimuli. The subject matter expert was selected on the basis of peer reference and position. Consistent with the critical incident technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812450911">Flanagan, 1954</xref>), he was asked to describe operational incidents in which he had made a critical decision and which had occurred within the preceding six months. It was emphasized that the incidents reported should be complex because of the potential for uncertainty and where he felt that his expertise and experience made a critical difference to the outcome.</p>
<p>The subject matter expert described several incidents in detail, including a comprehensive description of all of the information that might have been available, even if the subject matter expert believed that that information was irrelevant. This approach was taken to circumvent the possibility that such a skilled practitioner may have been unaware of the cues that guided his or her decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812450911">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>). The descriptions were corroborated against incident reports and network event history logs recorded by the network control system.</p>
<p>Two incidents were subsequently organized into timelines, reflecting, as accurately as possible, the actual sequence and timing of events, and formed the basis of the Feature Discrimination Task (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720812450911">Appendix A</xref>) and Transition Task (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0018720812450911">Appendix B</xref>) scenarios, respectively. The remaining incidents were used to develop a catalogue of features that an individual may or may not consider during a complex diagnostic task within power control. These features were then paired to form the items in the Paired Association Task (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018720812450911">Appendix C</xref>). The images used in the Feature Identification Task were screen captures of actual line failure alerts, recorded by operators as they occurred (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812450911">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812450911">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>This study involved the use of EXPERTise. EXPERTise is a “shell” software package designed in house to record performance across four cue-based expert reasoning tasks: the Feature Identification Task, the Paired Association Task, the Feature Discrimination Task, and the Transition Task. EXPERTise was specifically designed so that these tasks could be customized to match the stimuli used in a particular domain.</p>
<p>The Feature Identification Task incorporated two stages. In the first stage, participants were presented with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) interface screen captures of the transmission network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812450911">Figure 1</xref>). Each SCADA screen displayed the failure of a circuit breaker. The distance from the target and the speed with which participants clicked on the failed circuit breaker was recorded. In the second stage, the participants were shown a SCADA screen capture for 1.5 seconds, during which a failed circuit breaker was displayed. On a subsequent screen, they were asked to select the location of the fault from four possible options (designated by codes associated with different power lines), and this response, together with the response latency, was recorded.</p>
<p>The Paired Association Task also incorporated two substages. In the first substage, participants were presented with pairs of features and events sequentially. For example, the participants might be shown the terms <italic>Energies</italic> and <italic>Current</italic>. The stimuli were presented as text and displayed for 1.5 seconds. The participants rated the perceived strength of the relationship between the features and events on a 6-point scale. The second stage also involved the presentation of features and events for 1.5 seconds, but the stimuli were presented simultaneously on the screen. The participants’ ratings and their response latencies were recorded.</p>
<p>The Feature Discrimination Task involved the presentation of a SCADA screen capture that incorporated a system failure. Participants were asked to assess the situation and then, on the same screen, select one of four possible responses to the failure, including a “do nothing” option. On the following screen, they rated, on a 6-point scale, the utility of each of nine individual features of the scenario in formulating their response. The participants’ response to the scenario and their ratings of each feature were recorded.</p>
<p>The Transition Task involved the presentation of a descriptive scenario that required participants to acquire additional information prior to selecting a response. The scenario involved an unverified report of a child climbing a high-tension power line. The information presented was intentionally incomplete so that participants would be required to acquire additional information to form an accurate diagnosis and response. The additional information was provided in the form of a list of information screens. Each information screen was accessed through a mouse click on the relevant button, and this enabled the process of information acquisition to be traced. Each button was labeled with a relevant term (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0018720812450911">Appendix B</xref>) to ensure that its contents were clear to participants, and this was verified during usability testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812450911">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The participants were invited to participate in the study during a work-related training session. In groups of approximately 10 participants, they were briefed on the purpose of the study and then asked to sign a consent form if they wished to continue. They completed a brief demographics questionnaire, which captured the general (years in the domain) and specific (years in their current position) experience of the operators, and they then began the EXPERTise test battery via laptop computer. On completion of EXPERTise, they answered a second questionnaire, this time regarding their perception of the EXPERTise tasks. The EXPERTise session and questionnaires took approximately 40 minutes to complete.</p>

<sec id="section15-0018720812450911">
<title>Descriptive Data</title>
<p>Each continuous variable was screened for normality of distribution. For all of the variables, the skewness and kurtosis figures suggested a non-normal distribution. This was confirmed by visual inspection of the corresponding histograms. The variables were then subjected to a square root transformation. Subsequent analysis revealed that the skewness and kurtosis figures were within acceptable limits for most of the variables, skewness less than 1, kurtosis less than 1. The exception, the reaction time scores for the Feature Identification Task, was subjected to a log transformation, but this too failed to meet acceptable limits: skewness greater than 1, kurtosis greater than 1. Based on concerns that this skewness indicated that the measure lacked precision or was subject to confounding variables, the data were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Cluster Models</title>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of classifying participants into three groups on the basis of observed levels of performance across the EXPERTise tasks. Because of differences in scale, the variables were standardized prior to clustering, as is required by the K-means cluster procedure of the SPSS statistical package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812450911">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1996</xref>). Based on the theoretical rationale that performance can be decomposed into novice, competent, and expert levels, three clusters were entered as the most likely fit to the data.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812450911">Table 3</xref> presents the results of the cluster analysis, the mean score for each cluster on each of the outcome variables, and the cluster rankings for each task. As expected, three distinct groups could be formed based on performance on EXPERTise. Cluster 1 comprised those individuals who tended to perform poorly across the EXPERTise tasks and, as such, was designated the low-performance or “novice” cluster. Although, as a group, members of this cluster were faster on the Paired Association Tasks than were members of Cluster 2, the lack of variance in their responses suggested that this was probably the result of guessing.</p>

<title>Comparison of Cluster Experience</title>
<p>One of the key assertions of the present study was that although novices can be identified by their lack of experience in the domain, experienced practitioners decompose into two distinct levels of performance that are not necessarily tied to years of experience. Therefore, it was expected that the low-performance group would be relatively less experienced than the mid- and high-performance clusters. The mid- and high-performance groups were not necessarily expected to differ on this dimension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether performance across four approaches to the assessment of cue utilization performance would decompose into three levels of performance consistent with the novice, competent, and expert stages of cognitive skill acquisition described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Lehmann (1996)</xref>. The assessment tasks were selected on the assumption that diagnostic expertise involves the successful extraction and utilization of cues and that this cognitive skill explains, in part, expert performance. Consequently, expertise was expected to result in consistently superior performance across the diagnostic reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>In general, the results provide substantial support for the assertions underlying the present study. Most important, performance clustered into three levels of performance across the four tasks, consistent with the novice, competent, and expert phases described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson and Lehmann (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson (1983)</xref>. The expert cluster comprised those participants who consistently were faster, were more accurate, showed greater discrimination, and were less likely to access information in the sequence in which it was presented. By comparison, the competent cluster included those individuals whose performance was slightly lower but nevertheless consistent across the tasks. In turn, the competent cluster was clearly distinguished from the novice cluster, which comprised participants who demonstrated the lowest levels of performance. Overall, the groups differed in their diagnostic outcomes, with the expert cluster selecting the optimal response with greater frequency than the competent and novice clusters, suggesting that the groups do in fact genuinely reflect distinct levels of diagnostic performance.</p>
<p>Although a moderate relationship between years of domain experience and task performance was evident, comparisons between the clusters revealed that this relationship was not linear. Although the transition from novice to intermediate performance appears to require a significant increase in years of domain experience, the difference between intermediate and expert performance was only trivial. This is broadly consistent with previous research demonstrating that the number of years of experience within a domain is only weakly associated with the progression to expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812450911">Gray, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The present results also suggest that expertise can be distinguished from competent and novice performance based on a series of tasks that are dependent on access to and the utilization of feature–event relationships or cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720812450911">Wiggins, 2006</xref>). This is consistent with contemporary perspectives concerning the role of cues in expert diagnostic reasoning and intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812450911">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>). For example, using eye-tracking data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812450911">North, Williams, Hodges, Ward, and Ericsson (2009)</xref> demonstrated that, in comparison to unskilled soccer players, skilled players tended to extract key features and draw associations between those features to anticipate the destination of the ball following an attacking pass or shot at the goal. This feature identification process is widely regarded as an efficient process that reduces cognitive demands and releases cognitive resources for other tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812450911">Cellier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812450911">Lansdale, Underwood, &amp; Davies, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section22-0018720812450911">
<title>Assessments of Expertise</title>
<p>Many previous assessments of expertise have adopted the expert–novice paradigm in which the performance of experts, classified a priori, is compared to that of their less experienced (typically novice) counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812450911">Coderre et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812450911">Schraagen, 1993</xref>). Although these comparisons are useful, they are predicated on an assumption of expertise, whereby expertise is equated to experience accumulated within the domain. Furthermore, the assessment of performance tends to be based on a relatively limited series of dimensions.</p>
<p>The present study utilized an alternative approach in which (a) the cohort was carefully selected based on the demand for a particular type of cognitive skill, (b) four assessment tasks were developed on the basis that they assessed different aspects of a fundamental cognitive construct necessary for effective and efficient diagnostic reasoning, (c) a theoretical model of skill acquisition was adopted that justified the delineation of groups, and (d) the groups were delineated on the basis of their performance across the four tasks.</p>
<p>As with all assessments of expertise, the difficulty lies in establishing the validity of expertise in the absence of an unequivocal target or benchmark. One solution is to adopt the approach employed in psychometric testing in which the performance of each individual is assessed against a cohort. By using <italic>z</italic> scores, it is possible to make valid comparisons across the cohort and ensure equivalence across the different assessment tasks.</p>
<p>In the case of the present cohort, three distinct clusters emerged that represented three levels of performance, consistent with a three-stage model of skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson, 1983</xref>). These differences in performance were evident across all four of the assessment tasks, each of which was designed to assess an aspect of cue utilization during diagnostic reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812450911">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812450911">Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720812450911">Wiggins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, the groups differed in their responses to a more complex diagnostic reasoning task. In combination, this evidence lends weight to the proposition that the groups identified represent distinct populations that differ in their capacity for diagnostic reasoning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0018720812450911">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The results of the present study confirm that three distinct levels of performance can be identified based on performance across the Feature Identification, Paired Association, Feature Discrimination, and Transition Tasks. These three levels of performance are broadly consistent with a three-stage model of cognitive skill acquisition incorporating novice, competent, and expert practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812450911">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Lehmann, 1996</xref>). It is important that the results indicate that the performance of the competent or intermediate cohort can be differentiated from that of both the novice and expert cohorts across the range of cue-based tasks.</p>
<p>In addition to confirmation of three levels of performance, it is important to note that all of the assessment tasks in the present study were developed on the assumption that expertise in diagnostic reasoning involves the extraction and utilization of feature–event relationships or cues. Presumably, the utilization of cues enables cognitive processing efficiencies that allow experts to respond more rapidly, with greater discrimination, and with greater depth of rocessing than their nonexpert counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812450911">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>At an applied level, the assessment of expertise based on the extraction and utilization of cues has important implications for the evaluation of training outcomes. For example, it provides a mechanism against which to assess the progression toward expertise. By developing standardized norms for a given domain, it should be possible to establish whether an individual learner is developing diagnostic skills consistent with expectations and/or whether a particular level of performance has been achieved following exposure to training. Measuring independent facets of expert performance EXPERTise can also be used to identify those aspects of cue utilization and extraction that competent learners are struggling to complete to guide remedial training efforts. Cue-based approaches to training have already met with some success in the aviation context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720812450911">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 2003</xref>). The application of this strategy will improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of remedial training and, as a consequence, minimize the costs associated with training interventions.</p>
<p>Finally, at an empirical level, the results support the proposition that domain experts are best identified on the basis of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812450911">Ericsson &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>). The identification of experts on the basis of their within-task performance, rather than their experience per se, should assist with knowledge extraction and empirical comparisons between different levels of operational performance. The utilization of genuine experts ought to improve the validity of research outcomes involving the expert–novice paradigm and perhaps provide the basis for better understanding the process of cognitive skill acquisition.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether the application of four independent, cue-based assessments of performance collectively differentiated expert, competent, and novice performance in power system control. Overall, performance in the assessment tasks clustered into three groups, thereby providing support for a three-stage model of cognitive skill development based on the acquisition of cue associations in memory.</p>
<p>The present study was conducted in a context of remote diagnosis using standardized displays. Therefore, it can be presumed that the present results extend to similar domains such as air traffic control and rail control. However, EXPERTise may also have utility in other domains, as it can be modified to fit any cognitive skill in which practitioners must acquire visual or auditory information from the environment to make sense of the situation and form a response. Of course, other skills, such as the abilities to manage distractions or interruptions, to maintain motivation, and to manage uncertainty, may be of greater significance to expertise in these contexts, Consequently, further research is necessary to establish the relationship between cue-based reasoning performance and diagnostic accuracy in domains such as medicine, in which high performance requires a combination of cognitive, psychomotor, and psychosocial skills.</p>
<p>The replication of the results of the present study in a domain such as medicine, where studies of expert diagnosis have been hampered by the difficulties associated with reliably identifying expert medical diagnosticians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812450911">Norman, Coblentz, Brooks, &amp; Babcook, 1992</xref>), would further validate the utility of the EXPERTise tasks. This would also strengthen the three-stage cue acquisition model of expert performance and ultimately provide a new solution to an old problem, namely, how to define and identify domain experts.</p>
