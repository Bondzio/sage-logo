<abstract>
<p>There is inconsistent evidence as to whether angry faces evoke approach or avoidance tendencies. The present research sought to resolve this debate. We suggest that approach–avoidance movements can serve various goals (e.g., affiliation, aggression). Furthermore, we assume that these goals determine the effect of angry faces on approach–avoidance tendencies. In particular, angry faces communicate aggressive intentions and may therefore evoke aggressive tendencies in the perceiver. Thus, angry faces should trigger approach only when it serves aggression but not when it serves affiliation. Three studies showed that angry faces facilitated approach, when the behavior was represented as aggressive approach, but not when it was represented as peaceful approach. Furthermore, when approach was represented as peaceful approach and, hence, aggression was not an available option, angry faces facilitated avoidance. In sum, angry faces can evoke approach or avoidance, depending on the goals associated with these behaviors.</p>

<body>
<p>Approaching rewards and avoiding threats is a central function of living organisms. Accordingly, classic and current theories suggest that evaluations of environmental stimuli occur quickly and efficiently and that evaluations automatically result in the activation of a behavioral predisposition to approach or avoid (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612471060">Lang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612471060">Lewin, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550612471060">Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2004</xref>). Typically, these models suggest a simple contingency: Positive stimuli evoke approach tendencies, and negative stimuli evoke avoidance tendencies, and numerous studies support this assumption (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612471060">Chen &amp; Bargh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612471060">Krieglmeyer, Deutsch, De Houwer, &amp; De Raedt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612471060">Solarz, 1960</xref>). For social animals such as humans, social stimuli are particularly relevant to approach and avoidance behavior. Individuals are motivated to approach their friends and to avoid their foes. Meeting a stranger poses the challenge to determine whether he is friendly or dangerous. One source of information to determine the intentions of another person is his emotional expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612471060">Darwin, 1872</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612471060">Fridlund, 1994</xref>). For instance, happy expressions communicate an affiliation intention, whereas angry expressions convey an aggressive intention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612471060">Knutson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550612471060">Yik &amp; Russell, 1999</xref>). Consequently, one would assume that happy expressions evoke approach tendencies, and angry expressions evoke avoidance tendencies. However, empirical evidence on the impact of angry expressions on approach–avoidance behavior is inconsistent.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550612471060">
<title>Angry Expressions and Approach–Avoidance</title>
<p>On one hand, several studies suggest that angry expressions facilitate avoidance responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550612471060">Marsh, Ambady, &amp; Kleck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612471060">Roelofs, Minelli, Mars, van Peer, &amp; Toni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612471060">Rotteveel &amp; Phaf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612471060">Seidel, Habel, Kirschner, Gur, &amp; Derntl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612471060">Stins et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, Marsh, Ambady, et al. (2005) presented an angry or fearful facial expression on the computer screen. Participants responded to the pictures with pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach) or pushing a joystick away from themselves (avoidance). Results showed that angry expressions facilitated avoidance responses, whereas fearful expressions facilitated approach responses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some studies indicate that angry faces facilitate approach behavior. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612471060">Wilkowski and Meier (2010</xref>) presented an angry or a neutral face on the screen and asked participants to move the word <italic>ME</italic> toward or away from the face. Results showed that angry as compared to neutral faces facilitated approach responses. These findings were replicated in two studies, one of which compared angry and fearful faces. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating that perceivers associate angry facial expressions with approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612471060">Adams, Ambady, Macrae, &amp; Kleck, 2006</xref>). In particular, perceivers were faster to identify angry faces when the faces moved forward as compared to when they moved backward. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that painful events cause lower activity in the sensorimotor system when participants concurrently see angry as compared to fearful faces (Senkowski, Kautz, Hauck, Zimmermann, &amp; Engel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550612471060">2011</xref>). However, the latter two studies did not directly assess approach–avoidance responses in participants, therefore being less informative on the present research question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1948550612471060">
<title>Reconciling the Inconsistent Findings</title>
<p>How can the inconsistent findings be reconciled? We suggest that angry expressions do not uniformly facilitate approach, because approach–avoidance movements are sometimes ambiguous in their motivational meaning (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612471060">Lang, 1995</xref>). For instance, one can approach somebody to hug him or to beat him up. Whereas the former approach movement serves an affiliation goal, the latter approach movement serves an aggression goal. Likewise, approach–avoidance behavior in laboratory tasks is often ambiguous. For instance, whether positive (vs. negative) stimuli facilitate pulling a joystick depends on whether pulling is interpreted as pulling the stimulus toward the body or as pulling the hand away from the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612471060">Seibt, Neumann, Nussinson, &amp; Strack, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether angry faces evoke approach may thus depend on how the approach movement is interpreted. More specifically, angry faces may evoke approach if it is interpreted as serving an anger-compatible goal (e.g., if it is interpreted as aggression) but not if it is interpreted as serving an anger-incompatible goal (e.g., if it is interpreted as affiliation). In essence, we suggest that angry faces trigger aggressive approach but not affiliative approach. A closer inspection of the paradigms used to study the effects of angry expressions on approach–avoidance responses supports our reasoning. Particularly, these paradigms differ in procedural details that may imply different goals of approach–avoidance movements. In studies supporting an anger–avoidance link, avoidance was mainly operationalized as pushing a joystick away (Marsh, Ambady, et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612471060">Roelofs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612471060">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>), which is similar to a punching movement and can thus be easily interpreted as aggression. In contrast, studies supporting an anger–approach link used a task in which participants moved their symbolic self on the screen toward or away from a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612471060">Wilkowski &amp; Meier, 2010</xref>). Here, the approach movement can be more easily interpreted as aggression than the avoidance movement because one usually has to move toward the target in order to aggress. Taken together, whether angry expressions facilitated approach or avoidance in previous studies may have depended on whether the approach or the avoidance response could be more easily interpreted as aggression.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>The present research tests the hypothesis that angry faces evoke approach behavior only when it is interpreted as aggression but not when it is interpreted as affiliation. To this end, we manipulated the meaning of approach by asking participants to represent the approach movement as aggressive approach vs. peaceful approach. We expected angry faces as compared to neutral (Experiments 1 and 3) or fearful faces (Experiment 2) to facilitate approach only when approach was represented as aggressive approach, but not when approach was represented as peaceful approach. </p>

To manipulate the meaning of the approach movement, we instructed half of the participants to imagine moving aggressively toward the face, whereas the other half of participants were instructed to imagine moving peacefully toward the face.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Photographs of six men and six women were selected from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612471060">Tottenham et al., 2009</xref>). We used two photographs of each person, one with a neutral and one with an angry expression. All faces showed direct eye gaze. The size of the pictures was 200 × 200 pixels. Female participants saw only female faces and male participants saw only male faces. All stimuli were presented on a black background.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550612471060">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants completed one block to practice the response labeling (aggressive approach vs. peaceful approach, depending on conditions), two blocks to practice the response mappings (angry–approach/neutral–avoidance and angry–avoidance/neutral–approach), and four test blocks, two of which with each response mapping. The test blocks with the different response mappings were completed in alternating order, with the first type of response mapping counterbalanced across participants. The practice blocks for the particular response mappings were administered immediately before the first and second test block.</p>
<p>Target stimuli of the response-labeling practice block were the response labels “move away” and “move toward aggressively” or “move toward peacefully,” depending on conditions. Each response label was presented 10 times, resulting in a total of 20 trials. Target stimuli of the response-mapping practice blocks and the test blocks were faces as well as response labels. The response labels were included to remind participants of the meaning of the responses. Each response-mapping practice block consisted of six trials, four trials with faces and two trials with response labels. Each test block consisted of 60 trials, 48 trials with faces and 12 trials with response labels.</p>
<p>The sequence of all trials was as follows. First, the word <italic>ME</italic> appeared in the center of the screen and two black boxes outlined in white appeared at the top and bottom of the screen. After 750 ms, both boxes turned white and a target stimulus (response label or face) was shown in either the top or bottom box. Each target stimulus was presented equally often in the top and bottom box. Participants were asked to move the word <italic>ME</italic> as quickly as possible toward or away from the target by pressing the up or down arrow keys. When the target was a response label, participants moved according to the indicated direction. When the target was a face, they moved according to the particular response-mapping rules (angry–approach/neutral–avoidance vs. vice versa). Participants pressed the key 3 times. Each key-press moved the word <italic>ME</italic> one third along the way. The screen turned black 50 ms after the end position was reached. When participants gave an incorrect response, an error message appeared. The intertrial interval was 500 ms. The order of the trials of a particular block was randomized individually for each participant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Only responses to faces were analyzed. Reactions to response labels were excluded, because they severed the only purpose to remind participants of the response meaning. Incorrect responses (5.0%) and response latencies below 150 ms and above 2,500 ms (0.8%) were discarded. These cutoff criteria were shown to yield the greatest sensitivity of approach–avoidance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612471060">Krieglmeyer &amp; Deutsch, 2010</xref>).<sup>

</table-wrap>
<p>Note that absolute differences between approach and avoidance response latencies are difficult to interpret, because overall approach was initiated faster than avoidance. This main effect of response direction has been found with several approach–avoidance measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550612471060">Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550612471060">Rinck &amp; Becker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612471060">Wilkowski &amp; Meier, 2010</xref>). The cause of this effect is currently unknown. Thus, although our results might look as if angry and neutral stimuli facilitated approach relative to avoidance responses, the faster approach responses may have a cause that is independent of the nature of the presented stimuli and thus may tell little about the response tendencies triggered by angry versus neutral stimuli. Hence, at least parts of the main effect are likely to represent artifacts that are independent of stimulus-induced response tendencies. Therefore, when analyzing approach–avoidance response latencies, it is necessary to compare relative differences of approach and avoidance responses between conditions. To this end, we computed difference scores by subtracting the latencies of approach responses from the latencies of avoidance responses (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612471060">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>). Higher scores indicate relative facilitation of approach as compared to avoidance. We subjected the approach–avoidance scores to a 2 (emotional expression: angry vs. neutral) × 2 (response label: aggressive approach vs. peaceful approach) ANOVA, yielding a significant interaction between emotional expression and response label, <italic>F</italic>(1, 58) = 5.47, <italic>p</italic> = .023, η<italic>

<sup>2</sup> = .09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550612471060">Figure 1</xref>). Note that this two-way interaction is equivalent to the three-way interaction between emotional expression, response label, and response direction, revealed by the ANOVA on response latencies. Simple comparisons indicated that labeling approach as peaceful as compared to as aggressive reduced approach–avoidance scores for angry faces, <italic>F</italic>(1, 58) = 5.83, <italic>p</italic> = .019, whereas it marginally increased approach–avoidance scores for neutral faces, <italic>F</italic>(1, 58) = 2.83, <italic>p</italic> = .098. When approach was labeled aggressive approach, angry faces caused higher approach–avoidance scores than neutral faces, <italic>F</italic>(1, 58) = 4.43, <italic>p</italic> = .040. This effect was nonsignificantly reversed when approach was labeled peaceful approach, <italic>F</italic>(1, 58) = 1.42, <italic>p</italic> = .239. </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiment 1 demonstrates that labeling approach as aggressive or peaceful approach moderates the influence of emotional expressions on approach–avoidance tendencies. Angry as compared to neutral faces facilitated approach only when approach was represented as aggressive approach, but not when it was represented as peaceful approach. These results suggest that there is no decontextualized anger–approach link but a more specific anger–aggression link that includes the goals associated with the approach behavior. </p>
<p>However, the present findings are subject to an alternative explanation derived from the Evaluative Coding Account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550612471060">Eder &amp; Rothermund, 2008</xref>). According to this theory, representations of responses may have a positive or negative meaning. For instance, labeling a response as approach assigns a positive meaning to the response representation and labeling a response as avoidance assigns a negative meaning to the response representation. As a consequence, affective stimuli may facilitate responses that have a congruent valence, regardless of the motivational meaning of the responses (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612471060">Krieglmeyer et al., 2010</xref>). The findings of Experiment 1 can be explained in terms of an evaluative congruency between stimulus and response valence, if one assumes that angry faces and “aggressive approach” are negative, and neutral faces and “peaceful approach” are positive. The goal of Experiment 2 was to address this alternative explanation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550612471060">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 2 aimed at excluding evaluative coding as an alternative explanation of the present findings. To this end, we replicated Experiment 1 with the only difference that we used fearful instead of neutral faces. Fearful faces are similarly negative as angry faces. At the same time, we expected fearful faces to not facilitate a negatively labeled behavior (<italic>aggressive approach</italic>) but a positively labeled behavior (<italic>peaceful approach</italic>). This hypothesis was based on findings showing that fearful faces facilitate approach (Marsh, Ambady, et al., 2005). In line with other researchers, the authors argued that fearful expressions communicate subordination, appeasement, and affiliation, thereby evoking approach and caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550612471060">Hess, Blairy, &amp; Kleck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612471060">Marsh, Adams, &amp; Kleck, 2005</xref>). In short, if our hypothesis that angry faces facilitate aggressive approach and fearful faces facilitate peaceful approach is supported, then the findings cannot be explained by the evaluative congruency between stimulus and response valence. </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Angry relative to fearful faces facilitated approach when it was represented as aggressive approach, but not when it was represented as peaceful approach. Importantly, the results exclude evaluative coding as an alternative explanation. The evaluative coding account would have predicted that both angry and fearful faces facilitate aggressive approach, because both expressions match aggressive approach in valence. As this was not the case, evaluative coding cannot explain the findings.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 further showed that angry relative to fearful faces caused a lower approach–avoidance score when approach was labeled peaceful approach. This may indicate that angry faces facilitated avoidance in this condition. Thus, angry faces may not only facilitate approach but also avoidance, depending on the goals associated with the available behavior options. However, the findings are difficult to interpret, because avoidance was not significantly faster than approach in this condition. Yet, as discussed above absolute differences between approach and avoidance latencies cannot be interpreted, because approach–avoidance measures typically yield faster approach responses probably due to methodological causes. Therefore, a baseline condition is necessary to get an estimate of the baseline approach–avoidance score, which can then be used as a comparison condition. This was the goal of Experiment 3.</p>

<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1 with additional baseline trials. Baseline trials showed an arrow pointing upward or downward as target stimulus. Participants moved according to the direction of the arrow. Both the up and the down arrow could indicate an approach or avoidance response, depending on whether the arrow appeared in the top or bottom box. Thus, the direction of the arrow (up vs. down) was counterbalanced across approach and avoidance responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiment 3 showed that angry faces facilitated avoidance relative to baseline when approach was labeled as peaceful approach. This suggests that angry faces evoke avoidance tendencies when aggression is not an available option. Surprisingly, we did not replicate the finding that angry faces facilitated approach when approach was labeled aggressive approach. However, inspection of individual approach–avoidance scores revealed that one participant in the aggressive-labeling condition showed a pattern opposite to the remaining participants in this condition. In particular, this participant’s approach–avoidance scores for angry and neutral faces deviated more than 3.5 <italic>SD</italic> from the respective mean approach–avoidance scores of this condition. Exclusion of this participant revealed the expected pattern of results. Angry faces facilitated approach relative to baseline, <italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 4.60, <italic>p</italic> = .038, as well as relative to neutral faces, <italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 5.0, <italic>p</italic> = .031.</p>
<p>A reviewer raised the concern that the validity of the findings from all experiments reported in this article may be limited, because the block structure of the task may have caused transfer-of-facilitation effects on response latencies within one block. More specifically, if one stimulus–response combination in a particular block (e.g., neutral–approach) is compatible, then responses on trials with the other stimulus–response combination in the same block (e.g., anger–avoidance) might be facilitated as well, even though this combination may not be compatible. Thus, it remains unclear whether facilitation of a single stimulus–response combination occurred due to compatibility or due to transfer-of-facilitation within one block. The baseline trials included in Experiment 3 allow testing this alternative explanation. If transfer of facilitation occurred, then this should also be observable on baseline trials with arrows as stimuli. In particular, responses to arrows should be faster in the anger–approach/neutral–avoidance block than in the block with the reverse response mapping when approach was labeled aggressive approach. Conversely, when approach was labeled peaceful approach, then responses to arrows should be faster in the anger–avoidance/neutral–approach block than in the other block. To test this possibility, we subjected response latencies on arrow trials to a 2 (block: anger–approach/neural–avoidance vs. anger–avoidance/neutral–approach) × 2 (response label: aggressive approach vs. peaceful approach) ANOVA. The interaction between block and response label was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 80) = 2.15, <italic>p</italic> = .147, η<italic>

<sup>2</sup> = .03. Thus, there is no evidence for transfer-of-facilitation effects within one block.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Three experiments showed that angry facial expressions evoke approach behavior only when the behavior is interpreted as aggression but not when it is interpreted as affiliation. This suggests that goals associated with approach determine whether angry faces facilitate approach. More specifically, angry faces evoke approach if it is interpreted as serving an anger-compatible goal (i.e., aggression), but not if it is interpreted as serving an anger-incompatible goal (i.e., affiliation). Furthermore, Experiment 3 revealed that angry faces evoke avoidance behavior when aggression is not an available option. Thus, there are at least two behavioral tendencies associated with angry expressions, aggression and avoidance. Whether aggression or avoidance is preferred may depend on several factors, such as the availability of aggressive means, an escape route, appraisals of power and coping potential, as well as aggressive personality characteristics.</p>
<p>The observation that angry faces can evoke aggression or avoidance, depending on context conditions, may indicate that both aggression and avoidance serve the goal to ultimately increase the distance to the target. In line with this reasoning, researchers have proposed that negative stimuli elicit a motivation to increase the distance to the target, which can be achieved by flight or fight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612471060">Lang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550612471060">Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2004</xref>). In the case of fight, distance increase is achieved by attacking the opponent and putting him to flight. Thus, concrete approach behavior (e.g., aggressive approach) may serve avoidance goals at a superordinate level. Empirical support for the role of superordinate goals in approach–avoidance responses comes from a recent line of studies showing that affective stimuli facilitated responses that ultimately caused a compatible distance change (positive-approach, negative-avoidance), even when the concrete response immediately led to the opposite and thus incompatible distance change (Krieglmeyer, De Houwer, &amp; Deutsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550612471060">2011</xref>). Thus, the link between stimulus valence and response direction is determined at the level of superordinate goals, not at the level of concrete behaviors. This perspective opens up a parsimonious solution to the debate about whether anger is associated with approach or avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550612471060">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009</xref>). In particular, anger stimuli may activate avoidance goals at a superordinate level, which in turn may trigger various concrete behaviors that locally may imply approach or avoidance, depending on appraisals and situational constraints. Thus, the relation between the superordinate goal and the concrete behavior may be determined by the functionality of the concrete behavior, not by the congruency in movement direction.</p>
<p>A limitation of the present experiments is that the responses were symbolic rather than real behaviors. Thus, it remains to be shown whether the effects generalize to real behavior. However, we are optimistic that this will be the case, because approach–avoidance research investigating real behavior has so far successfully replicated effects found with symbolic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550612471060">Dotsch &amp; Wigboldus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612471060">Stins et al., 2011</xref>). We also do not know yet if the results generalize to situations, in which people do not categorize the emotional expressions. Again, we are optimistic that this will be the case, because previous research has shown that facilitation of approach–avoidance responses by stimulus valence occurs also without the goal to evaluate the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612471060">Krieglmeyer &amp; Deutsch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the present studies resolve the debate about whether angry faces evoke approach or avoidance. Angry faces trigger approach only when it serves aggression. Otherwise they trigger avoidance. Both behaviors may serve the goal to increase the distance to the angry opponent, either by fleeing or by putting the opponent to flight.</p>
