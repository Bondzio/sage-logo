<abstract>
<p>In this work, the authors designed, built, and tested a novel port camera system for single port access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery. This SPA Port Camera device integrates the monitor, laparoscopic camera, and light source into an inexpensive, portable cannula port. The device uses a 2-channel SPA port inserted through an umbilical incision, similar to traditional SPA. After insertion into a channel, the device deploys a small camera module and LED lamp in vivo. An integrated, on-patient LCD provides the view of the surgical site. The design intent of the port camera is to enhance SPA by (<italic>a</italic>) reducing the size of the SPA port through the elimination of the dedicated laparoscope channel; (<italic>b</italic>) reducing equipment cost by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and LED lamp at the port tip; (<italic>c</italic>) eliminating the need for an assistant who operates the laparoscope; and (<italic>d</italic>) mechanically coupling the camera, tool port, and on-patient LCD screen. The effectiveness of the device was evaluated by comparing the video performance with a leading industry laparoscope and by performing a user evaluation study and live porcine surgery with the device. Effectiveness of the device was mixed. Overall video system performance of the device is better than an industry standard high-definition laparoscope, implying that significant cost savings over a traditional system are possible. Participant study results suggest that simulated laparoscopic tasks are as efficient with the SPA Port Camera as they are with a typical SPA configuration. However, live surgery revealed several shortcomings of the SPA Port Camera.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Developments in laparoscopy are directed toward minimizing the invasiveness, trauma, pain, scarring, and recovery time of surgery by reducing the size and number of access ports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611418988">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418988"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611418988"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418988"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611418988">5</xref></sup> To this end, new surgical techniques have been developed in which procedures are performed through single incisions in the abdominal wall. Examples include transumbilical cholecystectomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418988">6</xref></sup> single incision bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611418988">7</xref></sup> and single trocar laparoscopic appendectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611418988">8</xref></sup> Several devices have recently been developed that compliment these new procedures. For example, the TriPort (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland), the AirSeal (SurgiQuest, Orange, CT), the SILS Port (Covidien, Norwalk, CT), and the Uni-X (Pnavel Systems, Morganville, NJ) are all recently developed devices that facilitate single port access (SPA) procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611418988">9</xref></sup> These devices will be referred to hereafter generally as “SPA ports.” Each of these devices provides simultaneous port access for 2 tools and a laparoscope through a single incision.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to further improve the state of the art in SPA by developing a low-cost laparoscopic device called the SPA Port Camera that integrates a tool port, camera, light source, and video display into a single cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611418988">Figure 1</xref>). The SPA Port Camera is designed to work with available SPA ports in place of the traditional laparoscope, and in this study a Covidien SILS Port was used. After the SILS Port is inserted transumbilically, the SPA Port Camera is inserted into 1 of the 3 SILS Port channels, and the camera module on the distal end of the device is deployed, which allows for the insertion of yet another tool through the same SILS Port channel. A small video display attached to the proximal end of the device allows for optimal gaze-down viewing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611418988">10</xref></sup> and presents an additional (or alternative) view to the surgeon. Using the SPA Port Camera in this configuration enables the simultaneous use of 3 tools through a single incision. If only 2 simultaneous tools are needed, the SPA Port Camera can be used with a custom 2-channel foam port, which is approximately half the size of the commercially available SILS Port mentioned above. The SPA Port Camera therefore enables the use of an additional tool (compared with the typical SILS Port configuration) or reduced incision size, depending on the needs of the surgery.</p>

<p>In a previous study, the authors built and tested the first Port Camera prototype, a novel, inexpensive, portable, laparoscopic tool that integrated the components of a vision system with a cannula port. The Port Camera device was designed to (<italic>a</italic>) minimize the invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery by combining a camera port and tool port; (<italic>b</italic>) reduce the cost of laparoscopic vision systems by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and LED light source in vivo, and at the port’s tip; and (<italic>c</italic>) enhance laparoscopic surgical procedures by mechanically coupling the camera, tool port, and LCD screen to provide an on-patient visual display. In the study, the Port Camera video system was shown to be equivalent to (and in some tests superior to) 2 commercially available laparoscopic video systems. Ex vivo and in vivo studies were conducted to measure the operative performance of the Port Camera. Ex vivo results suggested that the Port Camera is as efficient as a traditional laparoscopic system. In an in vivo porcine study, the Port Camera was successfully used by a laparoscopic surgeon for exploratory surgery and liver biopsy, demonstrating initial surgical feasibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418988">11</xref></sup> In this work, we build on the successes of the first prototype and explore the feasibility of using the Port Camera for SPA.</p>

<title>Methods</title>

<title>Device Description</title>
<p>The SPA Port Camera is a portable device that consists of a video system and display, cannula port with instrument seals, insufflation valve, mechanism for deploying and retracting the camera module, and integrated SPA foam. The cannula diameter accommodates 5- to 12-mm instruments. The device is designed using inexpensive electronics, vision, and lighting components such that the target sale price of $300 is a 140-fold decrease in cost compared with a traditional laparoscopic vision system’s capital cost (based on a price quote from Stryker on October 13, 2009: laparoscope, $3600.00; light source, $7500.00; light cord, $295.46; camera box, $11500.00; camera head, $12000.00; display, $6247.50; total, $41142.96). The purpose of the prototype device is to evaluate and test the SPA Port Camera concept, thus there are design differences between the commercial and prototype devices. For example, the prototype device is not battery powered but uses an external power supply, the video camera is low-resolution analog, and plastic housings are made from rapid prototyped parts. A high-resolution digital vision system has been tested ex vivo but has not been integrated into the prototype at this stage of development. The mechanical components of the SPA Port Camera device are the SPA foam with integrated insufflation valve and cannula, tool seals, LCD housing, camera module activation lever, and tilt mechanism. The housing and cannula were manufactured from AS-400 polymer using a Stratasys Prodigy Plus 3D-Printer. The camera module activation and tilt linkage is a 3.2-mm diameter stainless steel tube and pair of 1-mm Nitinol rods that traverse the cannula. The stainless steel tube is attached at the distal end of the device to the camera module and at the proximal end to a rotating knob for camera deployment. The Nitinol rods are attached at the distal end of the device to a tilt linkage and the proximal end to a sliding lever. The tube also provides a conduit for wires that power the camera and LED light source and connect the LCD screen to the camera module. Prior to insertion through the abdominal wall, the camera module is coaxial with the cannula. Turning the activation knob rotates the camera module into its deployed position. Once deployed, the cannula shaft is unobstructed so the surgical tools may be inserted and used as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611418988">Figure 2</xref>. The tilt mechanism controls the angle of the camera module from 0° to 30°.</p>

<p>The electrical components are the camera board with LED illumination source (RS-5018, Changsha Qifeng Mechanical Equipment Co, Ltd, Shenzen, China), the LCD screen, and video driver board (LCD35L, Accelevision, Cerritos, CA). The output format of the camera board CMOS sensor (OV6920, Omnivision, Santa Clara, CA) is composite video output with a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels. The diagonal dimension of the LCD screen is 89 mm, and the driver board supports composite video input, which directly interfaces with the camera output.</p>
<p>The SPA foam has 2 channels: The primary channel is sized for the Port Camera device and the secondary channel accommodates a common laparoscopic tool, such as a grasper, shear, and stapler. Once the SPA Port Camera is inserted and deployed, a second tool can be inserted through the Port Camera’s cannula and triangulated in the peritoneal cavity despite their common entry point. To triangulate, the tool used through the secondary channel must articulate and rotate similar to any of the SPA hand instruments produced by major surgical instrument manufactures. The prototype device is powered with an external power supply, whereas future versions will be battery powered. The device’s composite video output can also be used to externally record or display video on any standard operating room video monitor.</p>

<title>Video System Evaluation</title>
<p>The video system quality of the SPA Port Camera was evaluated by comparing it with a leading industry laparoscope, the Stryker (Kalamazoo, MI) high-definition (HD) camera and scope (model number 1188HD). Sharpness, colorfulness, brightness, lightness, hue, and chroma were compared. The analytical methods, rationale, and test setup for comparing these attributes are described in previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418988">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-1553350611418988">
<title>User Evaluation</title>
<p>The purpose of the user evaluation study is to compare the performance of the SPA Port Camera device with a typical SPA setup with standard laparoscope. Two simulations, the ball drop and cut task, were designed to assess usability of the SPA Port Camera for tissue identification and biopsy acquisition, which are basic procedures that laparoscopic surgeons perform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611418988">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611418988"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611418988"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611418988">15</xref></sup> Institutional review board approval was obtained, and 19 volunteers completed the study. The simulations were performed using a laparoscopic surgical trainer (MITS TRLCD03 by 3-Dmed, Franklin, OH).</p>
<p>Each volunteer participant performed the tasks under configurations A, B, and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611418988">Figure 3</xref>). Configuration A is similar to a typical SPA surgery, where the laparoscope and 2 tools all pass through 3 separate channels in the SPA foam, which is inserted into a single incision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611418988">16</xref></sup> In configuration B, an articulating tool is used through one of the channels and the SPA Port Camera is used through the second channel. The second tool passes through the Port Camera channel. Configuration C is similar to B, except that the LCD screen is decoupled from the tool port and the video is displayed above the patient on a monitor in the traditional manner. The surgical trainer comes equipped with a nondirectional, diffuse internal light source, which was used for all configurations. In addition, the laparoscope was instrumented with the analog OV6920 video camera so that each configuration used the same camera. The results of the evaluative study, therefore, consider neither the effects of the origin and intensity of the light source, nor the video quality.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the ball drop task, the participants were timed while they individually picked up a series of colored balls and subsequently deposited them in correspondingly colored bins. The balls were manipulated within the surgical trainer with laparoscopic grasping tools. The time was stopped when all balls were placed in the appropriate bins. Errors were assessed for each ball that was dropped or placed in an incorrect bin. In the cut task, a series of rubber strips were attached to an anchor on one end. The participants were timed while they stretched the unattached end with a grasper and then cut along a line marked on the strip with laparoscopic shears. The time was stopped when all strips were severed. Errors were assessed for each strip that was not severed within 1 mm of the marked line. The number of errors that occurred during each task was recorded as well as the time to complete the tasks. No time penalty was assessed for the errors. Both tasks were performed with configurations A, B, and C, for a total of six tasks per participant. The task order was randomized for each participant.</p>

<title>Live Surgery Evaluation</title>
<p>Previous studies have proven feasibility of a single incision cholecystectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611418988">17</xref></sup> The goal of the porcine study was to perform a cholecystectomy through a single incision using only the 2-channel SPA Port Camera. The procedure was performed on a live porcine model at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. Institutional review board approval was obtained (IACUC protocol number 87909-05-1D), and an experienced laparoscopic surgeon performed the procedure.</p>
<p>A single 20-mm incision was made under the costal arch exposing the fascia, and pneumoperitoneum was induced. A 5-mm trocar was introduced, and the abdominal cavity explored with a scope. Following exploration, the 5-mm trocar was removed and a SILS Port from Covidien was inserted through the 20-mm incision according to Covidien’s recommended insertion procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611418988">18</xref></sup> The SPA Port Camera was inserted through 1 of the 3 channels in the SILS Port. The camera module was deployed and the surgical grasper inserted through the SPA Port Camera’s cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350611418988">Figure 4</xref>). An articulating grasper was introduced through the SILS Port’s second channel and the 2 tools were triangulated to probe the surgical region and expose Calot’s triangle. The SILS Port’s third channel was not used.</p>

</fig>
<p>The deployed camera module at the distal end of the Port Camera interfered with the range of motion of the articulating tool to such an extent that it was difficult to perform routine SPA procedures such as suturing and suspending the gallbladder. To bypass this difficulty an additional 5-mm trocar and grasper was inserted to independently suspend the gallbladder. The cystic duct and artery were both clipped with a 5-mm clip applier that was inserted through the Port Camera channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611418988">Figure 5</xref>). The duct and artery were excised, and the surgery was terminated because of difficulty prior to full excision of the gallbladder. To remove the SPA Port Camera, the tools were removed from the channels and the camera module was rotated so that it was again coaxial with the channel. Total surgery time was 1.5 hours.</p>

<title>Results and Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section8-1553350611418988">
<title>Video System Evaluation</title>
<p>The analog video system (OV6920) used by the SPA Port Camera performed very poorly compared with the Stryker HD laparoscope. Even at relatively large feature sizes (1.8 mm), the contrast of the Stryker scope was about 3 times better than the analog system. The color quality of the analog system also performed more poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611418988">Figure 6</xref>). Because of this, a digital video system (OmniVision, OV7690) for the SPA Port Camera was investigated and tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611418988">Figure 6</xref>, the digital system performed better than the HD Stryker scope in average brightness and average contrast and nearly equal in average hue. The digital system also has better contrast than the HD Stryker scope down to feature sizes of 0.4 mm. The HD system performs better with smaller features because of its higher pixel density. Overall, the inexpensive digital system performs better than the HD Stryker scope. Future work will integrate the digital video system into the SPA Port Camera, thus replacing the lower quality analog video system. The maximum confidence interval of all the means in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611418988">Figure 6</xref> is 0.008.</p>

<title>User Evaluation</title>
<p>The participant’s actual task times and errors were normalized and then averaged to find the mean for each configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1553350611418988">Figure 7</xref>). Two-tailed, 2-sample, unequal variance <italic>T</italic> tests were performed against each configuration to test for significant interactions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418988">Table 1</xref> shows the <italic>P</italic> values for each interaction. Significant values with 90% confidence are indicated in gray. These results suggest that configuration C yields faster ball task times than both configurations A and B. This is likely because configuration C had fewer ball task errors. Interestingly, the opposite is true for the cut task: Configuration C yields slower times than A and B. No other interactions were significant. These results suggest that laparoscopic tasks such as tissue identification, stretch and dissect procedures, and biopsy acquisition can be performed equally well with the typical SPA configuration (A) or the SPA Port Camera configuration (B). Using the SPA Port Camera with a standard external monitor (configuration C) appears to enhance the performance of some tasks but impeded others.</p>

<title>Live Surgery Evaluation</title>
<p>Premature termination resulting in unsuccessful removal of the gallbladder was because of the following difficulties: (<italic>a</italic>) The attached 89-mm diagonal LCD screen was too small and the surgeon found it difficult to navigate and differentiate tissue with the small screen. Future versions will need to implement a larger screen while trying to minimize weight. (<italic>b</italic>) The screen was rigidly attached to the Port Camera cannula shaft at a 90° angle. The surgeon indicated that this orientation was not optimal for prolonged viewing. The screen angle should be adjustable so that each surgeon can adjust it to his or her preferred viewing position. (<italic>c</italic>) Lack of zoom made it difficult for the surgeon to obtain closer views for detailed work, such as suturing. At least 2 levels of zoom are needed—one for tool insertion so the surgeon could focus on the port tip to prevent possible tissue damage, and another for working when the tools are fully deployed. Lack of zoom appeared to be a significant disadvantage relative to a standard laparoscope, which can move freely in and out of the cannula. (<italic>d</italic>) Both the in vivo and ex vivo portions of the cannula must be redesigned and minimized to allow for greater tool range of motion. Ex vivo, the seal and deployment/tilt levers compete with the handles of the surgical tools. In vivo, the cannula shaft and camera module compete with the shafts of the surgical tools. It should be noted that typical SPA procedures also suffer from crowding immediately around the port. One advantage of the SPA Port Camera over a traditional laparoscope comes from the coupling of the screen to the camera. The coupling causes the displayed image relative to the surgeon to remain upright regardless of the screen and camera orientation. This is not the case with a traditional laparoscope, in which case the assistant must ensure that the video image is upright relative to the surgeon.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The digital video system (OmniVision, OV7690) for the SPA Port Camera performs better overall than an industry standard HD laparoscope (Stryker, 1188HD). This result implies that the SPA Port Camera could provide significant cost savings over a standard SPA system without sacrificing performance. The results from the participant study suggest that simulated laparoscopic tasks, such as tissue identification and biopsy acquisition are as efficient with the SPA Port Camera as they are with a typical SPA configuration. When used on a live porcine model, however, several shortcomings of the device were revealed. For example, the range of motion of the surgical tools was limited because of physical interference caused by the deployed camera module. Other issues such as too small screen size and fixed screen orientation made detailed tasks difficult. A revised design should consider the following: (<italic>a</italic>) The size of the cannula that houses the camera must be optimized. It must be large enough to admit a variety of surgical tools, yet small enough to not interfere or compete with tools inserted into the adjacent ports. Another option would be to decouple the camera from the cannula, so that it is integrated into the SPA port, and completely out of the way of the surgical tools. (<italic>b</italic>) The video screen size must be optimized, and the screen angle must be adjustable. (<italic>c</italic>) More control over the camera field of view is needed—video zooming capabilities may accomplish this. Despite these drawbacks, the potential benefits, such as reduced equipment cost, smaller incision size, and reduced personnel in the operating room are compelling enough to consider design changes and another revision of the device.</p>
