<abstract>
<p>Many patients experience adverse events after discharge; numerous are medication related and preventable. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacist medication counseling and disease education at discharge. Pharmacist Assisting at Routine Medical Discharge is a prospective study of English- or Spanish-speaking adults discharged from internal medicine. Control patients received usual hospital discharge care; intervention patients received usual care with discharge counseling and a follow-up phone call. Evaluated outcomes included the following: 30-day hospital reutilization (combined readmissions/emergency department visits), pharmacist interventions, predictors for hospital utilization, patient satisfaction, and primary medication adherence. In all, 279 patients were enrolled: 139 in the control and 140 in the intervention group. Pharmacists made 198 interventions. The rate of hospital reutilization was 20.7% and similar between the intervention and control groups. Patients receiving the pharmacist intervention demonstrated improved primary medication adherence and increased patient satisfaction. Pharmacist-provided discharge counseling resulted in medication interventions, improved patient satisfaction, and increased medication adherence.</p>

<p>As many as 20% of patients experience an adverse event after hospital discharge, with an estimated 60% deemed medication related and preventable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612461169">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612461169">3</xref></sup> This may result in costly health care utilization, including emergency department (ED) visits as well as hospital admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612461169">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612461169">7</xref></sup> Patient discharge education regarding medication therapy and disease states may help increase medication adherence following discharge and decrease rehospitalizations that result from medication-related issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612461169">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pharmacists are well suited to provide medication counseling to help ameliorate possible patient confusion about their medications and to increase medication adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612461169">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612461169">12</xref></sup> This is important because medication nonadherence is related to greater morbidity and mortality for those persons with chronic disease and has been estimated to increase health care costs by $170 billion annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612461169">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612461169">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, pharmacist discharge intervention may help improve patient satisfaction with the overall discharge process, which may in turn infer a cost benefit. The literature has revealed that a 1-point gain in satisfaction score has been linked to increased earnings of $4980 per bed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612461169">17</xref></sup> With Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores being tied to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement rates, gains and losses in satisfaction can have a significant financial impact on hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612461169">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612461169">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies that have evaluated the impact of pharmacist intervention at medical discharge have shown a variable effect on reducing rehospitalizations and ED visits and are not without limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612461169">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612461169">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1062860612461169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1062860612461169">26</xref></sup> In some instances, discharge counseling was not performed by a pharmacist but by a nurse educator, with a pharmacist performing follow-up phone interviews to assess medication-related issues. This makes it difficult to ascertain the effect of pharmacy services.

<p>The University of New Mexico Hospital (UNMH) offers a unique health care setting, serving a diverse patient population that encompasses a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic classes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacist discharge medication therapy counseling and disease state education for patients discharged from the internal medicine service at UNMH.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612461169" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Pharmacist Assisting at Routine Medical Discharge (Project PhARMD) is a single-center prospective interventional study conducted at UNMH, a 646-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. Study patients were recruited from participating internal medicine teams over a 3-month study period (November 28, 2010, to February 25, 2011). The UNMH internal medicine service consists of 6 teams; 3 teams were assigned to the intervention group and 3 teams to the control group.</p>
<p>English- or Spanish-speaking patients who were discharged from all internal medicine teams were considered for study inclusion. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age, unable or unwilling to receive discharge counseling, discharged to anywhere other than home, had a planned readmission, or were previously included in the study. Only patients who were discharged between 8 am and 5 pm Monday through Friday were included in the study, based on pharmacist availability to perform discharge counseling.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the institutional review board at UNM Health Sciences Center.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612461169">
<title>Study Procedures</title>
<p>Patients being discharged were identified during daily internal medicine discharge rounds. Discharging physicians and nurses were aware of the study regardless of which study group they were in. The UNMH procedure for patient discharge (ie, usual care) requires the nursing unit to provide patients or caregivers with prescriptions for medications as ordered by the physician and teach them about self-care management after discharge; however, the exact procedure is not standardized between nurses and nursing units. Patients who were discharged from an intervention team received discharge counseling by a pharmacist in addition to the usual discharge care provided by the nursing staff. Control patients received usual discharge care only. Intervention patients received discharge counseling from a pharmacist that included information about proper medication administration, side effects, and disease state education. Pharmacists also reviewed patients’ medications and prescriptions by completing medication reconciliation; identifying duplicative, unnecessary, or incomplete therapy; checking for drug interactions; verifying patients’ formulary drug coverage and availability of medications; and ensuring prescription completeness. To minimize interpharmacist variability during the discharge process, a standardized checklist was developed outlining the topics to be covered during a counseling session, and standardized patient education leaflets were used. Patients whose primary language was Spanish received counseling by a Spanish-speaking pharmacist.</p>
<p>Patients in both the control and intervention groups were given an anonymous survey to assess satisfaction with the discharge process prior to leaving the hospital on the day of discharge. Surveys were provided in either English or Spanish along with an envelope and were collected prior to patient discharge. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point Likert response scale. (The survey instrument is available from the authors on request.)</p>
<p>Intervention patients received a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist 36 to 72 hours post discharge to assess patient clinical status and identify and resolve further medication-related issues. Three attempts were made between the hours of 8 am and 6 pm, unless the patient expressed a preferred contact time. Health-related issues identified during the phone calls were resolved with the help of the discharging medical team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612461169">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Patient demographics, insurance information, medical history, discharge diagnoses, length of stay (LOS), number of discharges within the previous year, number of scheduled and as-needed medications at discharge, and primary care provider (PCP) information were recorded. The patient’s medical history was used to calculate a Charlson comorbidity score. Interventions made at discharge were recorded on a standardized data collection sheet and further classified using mutually exclusive categories adapted from Bayley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612461169">30</xref></sup> to ensure consistent coding among pharmacists. Total time spent by pharmacists on the discharge process also was recorded.</p>
<p>Patient charts were reviewed for readmissions and/or ED visits at UNMH 30 days from their initial discharge date. Only the first rehospitalization and ED visit were recorded. ED visits resulting in a hospital admission were counted as a readmission. Time since discharge, LOS, and the reason for recurrent health care utilization was documented by the pharmacist who provided the initial discharge counseling. These factors were reassessed by a single pharmacist for accuracy and consistency following study conclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612461169">
<title>Study Outcomes</title>
<p>Outcomes evaluated included 30-day postdischarge hospital reutilization (defined as the total number of readmissions and ED visits), number of pharmacist interventions, predictors for readmission and ED visits, patient satisfaction, and primary medication adherence. An a priori power analysis was calculated based on a historical 30-day readmission rate of 12.3% and a 13% ED visit rate at UNMH; it was estimated that 292 patients were needed in each group to detect a 33% reduction in hospital reutilization (power = 80%, α = .05; PASS 2008; NCSS, Kaysville, UT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1062860612461169">
<title>Subgroup Analysis</title>
<p>Primary medication adherence has been defined as the rate at which patients fill new prescriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1062860612461169">31</xref></sup> A subset analysis of patients with UNM Care, a patient assistance program available for certain qualifying residents of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, was conducted to assess primary medication adherence rates. Patients enrolled in this program received prescription benefits only at the UNMH outpatient pharmacy, making prescription fill data available for analysis. To determine primary medication adherence, a report with prescription fill data was generated for patients with UNM Care. Only prescriptions for regularly scheduled medications were evaluated for primary adherence. Patients were considered adherent if they picked up their prescription within 30 days of discharge. Patients also were considered adherent to a medication if they had an adequate supply of a medication at home based on prescription fill history prior to hospitalization. The rate of primary medication adherence for each patient was expressed as the number of regularly scheduled prescriptions filled divided by the total number of regularly scheduled prescriptions written.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612461169">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 19 (IBM Inc, Armonk, NY). Patient demographic characteristics, 30-day postdischarge hospital reutilization, and summative mean survey responses were compared between study groups via descriptive statistics (Student <italic>t</italic> test and χ<sup>2</sup> for continuous and categorical variables, respectively). The number and type of interventions provided were reported using descriptive statistics as well.</p>
<p>Multiple logistic regression was used to compare reutilization rates between the study groups after controlling for potential confounders to identify predictors of hospital reutilization and to determine predictors of requiring at least 1 patient care intervention at discharge. Only variables with a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.1 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>Nonparametric analysis (Mann-Whitney test) was used to compare survey responses and primary medication adherence rates. The individual question differences for the survey responses were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 698 patients were screened for inclusion; 279 met study criteria—139 in the control and 140 in the intervention group. The most common reasons for exclusion included discharge to an outside facility (ie, long-term care facility, skilled nursing facility, or prison) and discharge outside of study hours or before a pharmacist could counsel the patient. Study recruitment and patient flow are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612461169">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Baseline characteristics for the study patients are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612461169">Table 1</xref>. Overall, patients in the control and intervention groups were similar. However, a statistically significant difference was identified between groups with regard to insurance coverage. More patients in the intervention group were uninsured or enrolled in county-provided indigent patient assistance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Additionally, patients in the intervention group more frequently identified Spanish as their primary language; however, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .08).</p>

<title>Discharge Interventions</title>
<p>Pharmacists spent 111.6 hours performing the discharge counseling procedures. Pharmacists made 198 patient care interventions (mean = 1.41 interventions per patient), with 185 (93.4%) interventions accepted by the discharging team. Types of interventions and acceptance rates are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612461169">Table 2</xref>. The most common interventions were the addition of a drug, dose change, and medication discontinuation. The most common medication classes involved were anti-infective (17.8%), cardiovascular (16.0%), and gastrointestinal (12.9%) agents. Neither the number nor class of medications at discharge was found to be predictive of patients being more likely to require pharmacist intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies demonstrate that pharmacist participation in the care of hospitalized patients can improve patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1062860612461169">32</xref></sup> Pharmacists in this study were able to identify and intervene to prevent a number of potential problems with prescriptions written prior to discharge from the hospital. Overall, the pharmacists’ discharge counseling was able to improve both primary medication adherence and patient satisfaction with the discharge process.</p>
<p>The clinical interventions documented by pharmacists during the course of the study illustrate the importance of pharmacist involvement in discharge prescribing. More than half of the patients in the study had at least 1 recorded intervention, highlighting that medication regimens often are not ideal at the time of discharge or may have errors such as incorrect or inappropriate dosages. Given that the most common intervention was the addition of a medication for an untreated indication at discharge, it could be argued that ideally, this type of intervention should be implemented earlier during the admission. Physicians accepted 93.4% of pharmacist recommendations, indicating that the interventions were appropriate; however, the clinical implication of each intervention was not weighed or assessed. Bayley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612461169">30</xref></sup> describe a comprehensive transitional care pharmacist model involving admission medication reconciliation, medication recommendations during in-hospital stay, development of the discharge medication list, discharge education, and a follow-up phone call 3 to 5 days post hospitalization. They demonstrated that medication-related interventions were equally distributed among the admission, in-hospital, and discharge periods (31%, 38%, and 29%, respectively), supporting the notion that discharge planning should begin at admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612461169">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, although Bayley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612461169">30</xref></sup> were able to demonstrate the need for pharmacist involvement at admission as well as at discharge, their study did not assess if patient care interventions led to an improvement in patient outcomes after discharge. In the present study, pharmacy involvement occurred in both the inpatient setting, with inpatient pharmacists intervening as needed on inpatient issues, and at discharge, with discharge interventions and counseling provided per the study protocol. Pharmacy involvement in the discharge process yielded higher rates of primary medication adherence. This service attempted to improve patient understanding of their disease state and medication therapy, with the hope that more informed patients would be more likely to be adherent to their medications. Patients who are nonadherent to their medication regimens may be at risk of experiencing complications, resulting in increased health care utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612461169">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612461169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612461169">16</xref></sup> By improving medication adherence, patients’ disease states can be better managed, leading to a potential decrease in not only morbidity but also health care utilization and costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612461169">33</xref></sup> This may prove to be another key area in which pharmacist involvement may lead to improved patient care and cost savings.</p>
<p>Pharmacist involvement at discharge also significantly improved patient satisfaction with the discharge process. In this era of increasing hospital transparency, patient satisfaction has become a much more important area on which hospitals must focus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1062860612461169">34</xref></sup> Not only can pharmacists lead to direct cost savings and cost benefit for the institution, but they also may be able to improve hospital reimbursement and performance ratings through improved patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1062860612461169">35</xref></sup> Although patient satisfaction scores in this study were high for both groups, patients had statistically significantly higher satisfaction with discharge services when pharmacists provided counseling in addition to usual care. Although every survey item had statistically significant differences favoring the intervention group, the largest differences were seen in items directly related to medication use (items 1, 2, and 4). Item 1 referred to the explanation of what the medications were for, item 2 referred to the explanation of how to take the medications, and item 4 referred to the information regarding side effects. The differences seen between groups for these items are consistent with the skills pharmacists possess, particularly with regard to medication knowledge and counseling. These appear to be areas in which pharmacist involvement in the discharge process will yield the greatest benefit. Overall, pharmacist involvement improved patient satisfaction in all areas surveyed. This may prove to be a simple and practical way for hospitals to elevate their level of patient satisfaction and thus improve their reimbursement rates and profitability.</p>
<p>Although there was no difference in 30-day postdischarge hospital reutilization, the reasons for this are multifactorial. When examining the literature evaluating the impact of discharge services, the combined rate of readmissions and ED visits at UNMH is lower than what is reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612461169">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1062860612461169">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1062860612461169">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, UNMH has a low readmission rate relative to other University HealthSystem Consortium Hospitals, and the overall readmission rates were lower than that in the historical control period that was used to estimate sample size. This may be related, in part, to other concurrent initiatives to address readmission rates implemented at our institution. A majority of rehospitalizations may not be preventable or inappropriate. A recently published study found that only 13.3% of hospital readmissions were preventable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1062860612461169">36</xref></sup> Of these preventable readmissions, only a fraction could be attributed to medications. An intervention that focuses primarily on medications education may be insufficient to improve the already low rate of readmissions seen at our institution.</p>
<p>The patient population seen at UNMH also may be a factor. UNMH is not only an academic medical center but also is the county hospital for Bernalillo County and serves a large number of indigent as well as uninsured patients. Many of these patients use the ED in lieu of seeing a PCP. In fact, 2 patients returned to the ED for the sole purpose of a medication refill, whereas another patient returned because he or she forgot to take home the discharge prescriptions. Although these visits to the ED were counted as negatively influencing the rates of reutilization, these cases actually should be considered as positives in terms of patient care based on the fact that the patients realized the need for taking their medications post discharge.</p>
<p>Although medication and disease state counseling at discharge were able to improve patient satisfaction and increase primary medication adherence, it is difficult for these discharge services to affect social factors such as insurance status or access to health care. Furthermore, a recent systematic review found that no single intervention (eg, discharge counseling, patient activated hotlines, transition coaches) was associated with reducing 30-day hospital reutilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1062860612461169">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the short time frame in which discharges occur and limited hospital resources, identifying high-risk patients may help maximize resources by allowing health care providers to target these patients and effectively focus on them. Findings from this study indicate that the number of previous hospitalizations in the past year increases the likelihood of hospital reutilization. The majority of the literature has examined patient predictors for rehospitalizations alone and has found several predictors, including reason for hospitalization, depression, LOS, and number of previous hospitalizations in the past year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612461169">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1062860612461169">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1062860612461169">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1062860612461169">38</xref></sup> However, comparisons to previous studies may not be helpful to identify high-risk patients because they may not accurately reflect the population seen at UNMH. Previous studies have been limited to a mainly English-speaking, white population, whereas the current study included English- and Spanish-speaking patients, with the majority of patients being of Hispanic ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612461169">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1062860612461169">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1062860612461169">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1062860612461169">38</xref></sup> Additional studies also have examined the effect of the number of discharge medications on readmission rates. A study by Ruiz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1062860612461169">39</xref></sup> found that when a patient was readmitted because of an adverse drug event, the number of medications prior to the event was a predictor of rehospitalization. A second study found that patients with more than 5 medications were 2.53 times more likely to be readmitted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1062860612461169">40</xref></sup> Although the number of discharge medications was not a predictor for readmissions and ED visits in the current study, this may be related to the limited sample size.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge limitations of this study. First, the sample size was limited by the exclusion of patients discharged to anywhere other than home. Although this was done to limit confounding of the results, it significantly decreased the number of patients eligible for study enrollment. Second, the authors were unable to assess readmissions or ED visits at other institutions. Limitations also exist with the satisfaction survey, including the potential for selection bias; however, this is less likely because the participation rate for the survey was 62%. The instrument used to assess patient satisfaction was not previously validated. Patient health literacy was not assessed, which could potentially affect patients’ ability to respond to the survey. Finally, primary adherence rates were analyzed for only those patients with UNM Care because this program requires patients to fill their medications at UNMH outpatient pharmacy to receive benefits. Although this enabled the authors to target a specific population because of access to fill data for these patients, it limits generalizability to a larger population. Furthermore, UNM Care patients could elect to have their prescriptions filled at other pharmacies that offer incentives, such as $4 drug plans, potentially confounding these medication adherence results.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results from this study illustrate that pharmacists can play a key role in improving the discharge process by completing medication reconciliation, counseling, and disease state education. Pharmacists are ideally suited to improve continuity of care and patient outcomes. Although the authors were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in 30-day postdischarge hospital reutilization, many benefits were identified, including correcting potential problems with discharge prescriptions, increased patient satisfaction, and improved primary medication adherence. Additional studies in a diverse patient population are needed to further identify the optimal form and process for pharmacist involvement in the discharge process.</p>
