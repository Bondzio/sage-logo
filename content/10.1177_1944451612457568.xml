<abstract>
<p>It is estimated that the annual incidence of spinal cord injury in the United States is 12 000 new cases per year. Victims of spinal cord injury are prone to developing respiratory complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and ventilatory failure secondary to physiologic derangements resulting from spinal shock and paralysis. Respiratory complications are the leading cause of death in those who survive the initial injury. The goal in ventilator management of spinal cord injury patients in the intensive care unit setting is to prevent these complications and optimize patients for early transfer to a spinal cord rehabilitation facility. To minimize atelectasis, current guidelines recommend the use of very high tidal volumes (15 mL/kg) or setting high tidal volumes (10 mL/kg) in addition to using positive end-expiratory pressure. In this article, the authors discuss the pulmonary complications that affect the mortality of these patients and review the evidence behind the current high tidal volume ventilation strategy.</p>

<p>There are approximately 12 000 new spinal cord injury (SCI) cases per year. The majority (&gt;80%) of cases are the result of traumatic injury. The cervical spine is the most mobile portion of the spine and is the most common site of spine injury. Accumulated data since 2005 have revealed that the most frequent neurologic injury category at discharge is incomplete tetraplegia (39.5%), defined as cervical spine injury with some sensory or motor sparing below the level of injury, followed by complete paraplegia (22.1%), incomplete paraplegia (21.7%), and complete tetraplegia (16.3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612457568">1</xref></sup> The need for definitive airway control and mechanical ventilation is high in these patients particularly in those with high cervical SCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457568">2</xref></sup> A clinical practice guideline for the respiratory management of patients with SCI does exist; however, some of the major recommendations included in the guideline lack strong scientific evidence and conflict with the current evidence guiding mechanical ventilation in other patient populations. It is this disagreement that prompted this review of pulmonary complications and mechanical ventilation in patients with SCI.</p>

<title>Respiratory Complications</title>
<p>Respiratory complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCI with a reported occurrence of up to 83% in patients with a high (C1-C4) level of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612457568">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup> Jackson and Groomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612457568">5</xref></sup> in a 5-year prospective study of 261 patients observed that atelectasis (36.4%), pneumonia (31.4%), and ventilatory failure (22.6%) were the most common respiratory complications, confirming the findings of several previous studies. Interestingly, it was noted that ventilatory failure and aspiration occurred early after injury (average 4.5 days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612457568">5</xref></sup> Jackson and Groomes also showed that respiratory complications correlated with the level of injury and were greater and of longer duration when injury occurred in the high cervical (C1-C4) area. Additionally, respiratory complications are an important determinant of overall hospital cost and length of stay and are a better predictor of financial burden than level of injury alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612457568">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Frequently, traumatic SCI is followed immediately by spinal shock resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis below the level of injury. This acute shock phase, which may last from several days to a few months, leads to significant respiratory compromise, including ineffective cough, limited ability to clear pulmonary secretions, and a reduction in vital capacity and inspiratory capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612457568">7</xref></sup> Animal models have demonstrated that the reduction in lung compliance is likely because of decreased surfactant production in the atelectatic lung. Similar to other trauma patients, victims of traumatic SCI are also at risk for aspiration of stomach contents in the acute phase of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612457568">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients with cervical SCI may develop bronchial mucous hypersecretion thought to be secondary to loss of sympathetic control over bronchial mucous glands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup> Increased secretions coupled with ineffective cough and decreased ability to clear the secretions makes these patients prone to bronchial mucous plugging.</p>
<p>Because of impaired inspiratory capacity secondary to weak or paralyzed respiratory muscles, cephalization of abdominal contents, and reduced clearance of bronchial secretions, SCI patients are at significant risk for developing atelectasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612457568">9</xref></sup> Peterson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612457568">10</xref></sup> observed that 60% of ventilated patients with C3 or C4 injury at the time of transfer to a tertiary care facility had atelectasis. Compounded by the increased risk in any patient on mechanical ventilation, these patients are prone to developing pneumonia early in their hospital course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other respiratory complications include bronchospasm that occurs routinely in patients with cervical SCI because of loss of sympathetic innervation of the lungs leaving unopposed parasympathetic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup> In the early management of SCI, the risk of developing pulmonary edema exists as a result of several possible etiologies including fluid overload during the time of initial resuscitation, cardiogenic and/or neurogenic causes, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infection, and/or direct trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All of these factors place the patients at risk for respiratory failure, including acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. A retrospective review by Como et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457568">2</xref></sup> of 119 patients admitted with cervical SCI revealed that 100% of patients with complete injury above C5 required a definitive airway via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. Seventy-one percent of survivors with this high SCI required mechanical ventilation at the time of discharge to a rehabilitation facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457568">2</xref></sup> Of those patients with complete lesions at C6 and below, only 79% required a definitive airway with 50% receiving tracheostomy and 15% requiring mechanical ventilation at discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457568">2</xref></sup> Patients with lower level of neurologic injury are typically able to breathe on their own initially but may require intubation due to inability to manage secretions and development of atelectasis and pneumonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612457568">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certainly in the initial stabilization phase, patients with cervical SCI may require ventilator support until the extent and completeness of the injury can be determined. In the acute phase of injury, accurate neurologic assessment may be difficult. Patients with SCI are at risk for ascending spinal cord edema that may result in unexpected respiratory compromise even in the absence of pulmonary complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612457568">12</xref></sup> Extension of SCI, thought to be secondary to progression of edema and inflammation, has been observed as late as 1 week out from injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612457568">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Guidelines for Mechanical Ventilation</title>
<p>A low tidal volume strategy to minimize lung injury and inflammation in ventilated patients with ALI or ARDS is well established in the ICU setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612457568">13</xref></sup> There is evidence suggesting that mechanical ventilation may contribute to the development of lung injury. Although the pathogenesis of ventilator-induced lung injury is not completely understood, the prevailing hypothesis is that overdistention of the alveoli in some areas of the lung and atelectasis in other areas of the lung causes the expression of inflammatory mediators resulting in lung injury and systemic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612457568">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451612457568">15</xref></sup> Therefore, lung protective ventilation strategy hinges on the concept that ventilator-induced lung injury can be mitigated by the use of low tidal volumes and plateau pressures, and with the use of positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) to minimize atelectasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612457568">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451612457568">16</xref></sup> Indeed, controversy regarding the use of low tidal volumes in patients without underlying ALI remains. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting that mechanical ventilation may contribute to the development of lung injury even in patients without established ALI or ARDS and that strong consideration be given to limiting large tidal volumes and maintaining low plateau pressures not only in patients with established ALI but also in those at risk for ALI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451612457568">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451612457568">18</xref></sup> It should be noted that these studies did not include patients with SCI as subjects.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine published clinical practice guidelines specifically for the respiratory management after high SCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451612457568">19</xref></sup> These guidelines recommend the use of a protocol that includes increasing tidal volumes to prevent or resolve atelectasis in mechanically ventilated patients. The recommended initial tidal volume setting is 15 mL/kg (ideal body weight) with gradual increases based on the presence of atelectasis noted on daily chest radiographs. The basis of these recommendations includes the fact that patients with high SCI usually have normal lung parenchyma and are essentially void of innervation. The panel does recommend that the ARDS Network protocol of low tidal volume ventilation be adopted in tetraplegic patients who go on to develop ALI/ARDS.</p>
<p>The panel acknowledged that strong scientific evidence is lacking with only case series to date but cites the 1999 study by Peterson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612457568">10</xref></sup> to support their recommendations. In this retrospective review of the medical records of 42 ventilator-dependent patients with C3-C4 tetraplegia admitted to an SCI rehabilitation facility, it was noted that those patients who were ventilated with higher tidal volumes (&gt;20 mL/kg ideal body weight) had significantly less atelectasis at 2 weeks after admission than the lower tidal volume group (&lt;20 mL/kg). Moreover, those in the higher tidal volume group could be weaned from the ventilator an average of 21 days faster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612457568">10</xref></sup> There were several limitations to this study. The subjects were not randomized and it is unclear why one group received lower tidal volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup> Additionally, the lower tidal volume group was ventilated with a mean tidal volume of 15.5 mL/kg and none were ventilated with tidal volumes of less than 10 mL/kg. In keeping with the existing protocols at the study site, the use of PEEP was not included in either group. The consortium of panel members’ state that it is unclear why those patients ventilated with higher tidal volumes were able to be weaned faster but theorize that larger tidal volumes may stimulate surfactant production and improves pulmonary compliance by minimizing atelectasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451612457568">18</xref></sup> Perhaps the gradual titration of tidal volumes over 2 weeks permitted better pulmonary tolerance of the increased volumes by allowing for sufficient surfactant production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612457568">10</xref></sup> It should be pointed out that this study took place in an SCI rehabilitation facility, thus the results may not be applicable to initial ICU care.</p>
<p>Fundamental to the respiratory management of mechanically ventilated patients with SCI is to actively employ methods to prevent mucous plugging, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Aggressive management of secretions with effective pulmonary hygiene is essential. Use of a protocol to prevent atelectasis should be considered. Implementing a clinical pathway that specifically includes a respiratory management protocol in these patients appears to be associated with a lower incidence of respiratory complications, reduced mortality, as well as reducing ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451612457568">20</xref></sup> The above referenced guidelines advocate higher tidal volumes and prevention of overbreathing by the patient to prevent atelectasis. PEEP is commonly used in the ventilator management of a wide range of patients in the ICU setting. The use of PEEP has been shown to be beneficial in preventing alveolar collapse and contributes to minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451612457568">21</xref></sup> A protocol for SCI that incorporates PEEP could be considered and has been adopted at several institutions.</p>
<p>Locally, the San Francisco General Hospital’s protocol incorporates the use of PEEP to mitigate atelectasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451612457568">22</xref></sup> Volume control ventilation is used with a tidal volume set at 10 mL/kg ideal body weight with a rate of 6 to 12 breaths per minute to maintain an arterial pH of 7.35 to 7.45 and a Pa<sc>co</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 35 to 45 mm Hg. Since PEEP is incorporated to reduce atelectasis and not for the primary purpose of improving oxygenation it should be maintained between 8 and 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O rather than being weaned. Additionally, the protocol incorporates sighs as a recruitment maneuver to treat atelectasis and alleviate mucous plugging as well as insufflation/exsufflation therapy to promote secretion clearance. Daily monitoring includes measurement of vital capacity and minimum inspiratory force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451612457568">21</xref></sup> Periods of spontaneous breathing should be considered in ventilator management protocols to prevent diaphragmatic dysfunction that results from disuse. Lack of diaphragmatic contraction, even for short periods, has been shown to lead to muscle inflammation and loss of diaphragmatic mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451612457568">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A small retrospective study of 87 patients with SCI reviewed attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation and found that carefully executed weaning and attempts at extubation may be warranted in selected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451612457568">24</xref></sup> In this review, 74% of all patients suffering from SCI at any level were extubated at the time of hospital discharge. Yet the failure to wean rate was significantly higher in those with cervical spine injury as compared with either thoracic or lumbar injury. Nonetheless, only 32% of those patients with cervical spine injury required mechanical ventilation at the time of hospital discharge. This study has clear limitations, such as its retrospective nature, no weaning standardization, and small sample size, but it illustrates that very early weaning attempts might be considered in a subset of patients with SCI. It also highlights the need for further study to identify those patients who warrant early attempts at weaning and extubation versus those who would benefit from early tracheostomy.</p>
<p>It is recommended that early definitive management of the airway be considered in those patients with complete cervical SCI, especially with an injury at C5 or higher. In fact, early tracheostomy, described as within 7 days of intubation, should be considered in cervical spine injury. Tracheostomy affords several advantages including improved pulmonary toilet, decreased dead space and potentially earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation. It may provide a psychological advantage to these patients as well by allowing oral feeding and phonation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451612457568">25</xref></sup> In addition, it has been correlated with facilitation of earlier transfer out of an intensive care unit setting to an intermediate care and, ultimately, to a rehabilitation facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612457568">26</xref></sup> In a retrospective review by Harrop et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451612457568">25</xref></sup> several risk factors for tracheostomy placement were identified. In this series of 156 patients with complete cervical spine injury, patient’s age (&gt;45 years), preexisting medical conditions, including lung disease, preexisting pneumonia, and high cervical (C2 or C3) spine injury required a tracheostomy.</p>
<p>Ventilator dependence is an independent predictor of survival in patients with SCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451612457568">27</xref></sup> There is a clear mortality benefit when patients are liberated from mechanical ventilation through rehabilitation. Evidence from an SCI rehabilitation center suggests that a protocol developed to improve ventilator muscle strength and endurance is effective in allowing high tetraplegics to spontaneously ventilate for short periods and low tetraplegics to discontinue mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451612457568">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the poor data pertaining to the best strategy for mechanical ventilation in patients with SCI, most clinicians would agree the objective of early ventilator management in the ICU setting is to minimize respiratory complications and facilitate transfer to a rehabilitation center as quickly as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451612457568">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451612457568">21</xref></sup> Once the patient is stabilized, early transfer to specialized SCI rehabilitation centers is associated with a significant decrease in the number and severity of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457568">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1944451612457568">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>After nearly a decade of emphasis on using a lung-protective strategy of low tidal volume mechanical ventilation, it may seem odd to return to the more traditional higher tidal volume strategy in patients with SCI. Although clear-cut evidence supporting higher tidal volume ventilation is lacking and further study comparing high versus low tidal volumes in spinal cord injury is needed, a number of centers that regularly manage spinal cord injury have adopted protocols incorporating this approach. The most significant improvement in survival over the past decade in this patient population seems largely to have occurred in the first year after injury likely reflecting improvements in critical care management and early rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451612457568">25</xref></sup> Ultimately, our goal as critical care specialists is to prevent respiratory complications and optimize patients for early transfer to a spinal cord rehabilitation center.</p>
