<p><italic>Objective</italic>. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a structured follow-up program on the incidence of diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) in high-risk diabetic patients. <italic>Research Design and Methods</italic>. A total of 1874 diabetic patients referred to the Diabetic Foot Unit of the University of Pisa were ranked based on the ulcerative risk score proposed by the International Consensus on Diabetic Foot. Out of 334 patients (17.8%) with a score ≥2, 298 accepted to participate in this prospective trial and were randomized into 2 groups: group A, which received standard treatment, and group B, in which the patients received, as a part of a structured prevention program, custom-made orthesis and shoes. Incidence of new DFUs was observed for no less than 1 year and in a subset of patients after 3 and 5 years, respectively. Incidence of new DFUs and recurrences were considered as primary endpoints to establish the effectiveness of the program; costs were also compared. <italic>Results</italic>. Among the patients enrolled in this follow-up analysis, 46% had neuropathy and deformities, 20% had previous ulceration, 25% had previous minor amputation, and 9% had neuro-osteoarthropathy. During the first 12-month follow-up, 11.5% of patients in group B developed a DFU compared with 38.6% in group A (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In the extended follow-up, the cumulative incidence of ulcer in group B compared with group A was 17.6% versus 61% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) after 3 years and 23.5% versus 72% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) after 5 years, respectively. The net balance at the end of the follow-up was highly in favor of the prevention program, with a saving of more than €100 000 per year. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The implementation of a structured follow-up with the use of orthesis and shoes can reduce the incidence of DFU in diabetic patients who are at high ulcerative risk and its related costs.</p>

<body>
<p>Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is still a very prevalent chronic complication among diabetic patients with 15% to 20% of them developing such a complication at least once in their lifetime. Moreover, DFU is the strongest predictor of lower extremity amputations (LEA), thus contributing to the high costs of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438729">1</xref></sup> Because of these considerations, DFU prevention should be pursued in the most efficient manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438729">2</xref></sup> To this purpose, guidelines have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438729">3</xref></sup> When properly implemented, they have been shown to increase the rate of healing in almost 90% of the cases. Despite this, the incidence of LEA remains inappropriately high and much higher than that occurring in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438729">4</xref></sup> The explanation for this dissociation is likely to reside on very high DFU relapse rate in diabetic patients, with a figure as high as 70%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438729">3</xref></sup> This observation calls for the need of controlling as many risk factors as possible and the implementation of an effective strategy for durable prevention.</p>
<p>In our own experience, involving 6484 patients over 5 years, DFU healing occurred in 88.9% of patients, but the cumulative recurrence rate was 39.7% after the first year, 60.6% after 3 years, and 70.1% at 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438729">5</xref></sup> The most frequent reasons for DFUs and their recurrence were direct or indirect trauma often related to inadequacy of the shoes worn by the patients. Of interest, DFU commonly relapses in spite of the fact that the patient is instructed to pay attention to foot care and hygiene and to wear “comfortable shoes,” as part of a secondary preventative strategy. The latter suggestion, however, may be too broad and unselective, although a more detailed advice for individual orthesis and shoes may help in this preventative effort. Recent systematic review of the literature seems to support this view, although there is still lack of a universal consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438729">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438729">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2001, Dahmen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438729">9</xref></sup> set the technical standards and the actual definitions for therapeutic footwear for the neuropathic foot and proposed an algorithm for appropriate prescription of insoles and shoes in patients with this complication. The features of a footwear for patients with high DFU risk can vary according to the type and severity of involvement of the foot, which include customized insole, bottine (ie, at the height of malleoli), or high shoes with stiff outsole and early pivot point location.</p>
<p>In an attempt to improve our clinical standards, we have implemented the Dahmen’s algorithm in a structured prevention program for patients at high risk for developing DFUs or their recurrence. We now report up to 5 years follow-up on adoption of such a structured approach.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612438729">
<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<p>Between January and December 2005, all patients attending the Diabetic Foot Unit at the University of Pisa were screened for their ulcerative risk according to the guidelines of the International Consensus on Diabetic Foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438729">3</xref></sup> The presence of diabetic neuropathy was ascertained with the evaluation of Achilles tendon reflex, determination of vibration perception threshold (VPT), and evaluation of protective sensation by the 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438729">10</xref></sup> Peripheral vascular disease was assessed by the evaluation of posterior and dorsal pedal pulses and determination of the ankle-brachial pressure index ratio by Doppler continuous wave technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438729">11</xref></sup> Foot deformities and presence of active ulcerations were evaluated by an experienced podologist, whereas previous ulceration or amputation were recorded from the patient’s medical history.</p>
<p>Ulcerative risk was calculated according to the International Consensus on Diabetic Foot’s guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438729">4</xref></sup> as follows: 0 if neuropathy was absent, 1 if only sensory neuropathy was present, 2 if peripheral vascular disease or deformities associated with sensory neuropathy, and 3 if previous DFUs or amputations were detected. Patients with null risk score were scheduled for another screening after 1 year; patients with risk score = 1 received a thorough educative session on DFU prevention and scheduled for a control visit after 6 months; finally, patients with a score ≥2, with known duration of diabetes of at least 5 years, and 18 years or older were invited to participate in the study. Patients with active or recent (&lt;3 months) ulcers or active Charcot’s foot, local ischemia (lack of pulses and/or ankle-brachial pressure index &lt;0.7), inability of standing or walking without help, and life expectancy less than 1 year were excluded from the survey.</p>
<p>After obtaining informed consent, all patients were referred to our rehabilitative clinic for evaluation of the foot and current DFU risk by a team including a diabetologist, a podologist, and an orthopedic technician. In all patients, a focused anamnesis and clinical examination of the feet was carried out, paying special attention to the presence of deformities, previous DFUs and amputations, localized hyperkeratosis, and other signs of local high pressure. Preulcerative conditions such as localized hyperkeratosis, nail deformities, or ingrown nails received adequate podologic treatment. Then patients were randomized into 2 different groups by means of a computer-generated randomization list. Patients in group A, according to our standard care, received an in-depth education on how to prevent ulceration and were advised to use comfortable shoes with nontraumatizing characteristics. A list of suitable shoes was delivered to the patients and their features were discussed to be sure that the patients would understand properly. Patients in group B received the same education on preventive strategies, but in addition received orthesis and shoes manufactured according to the indications of the algorithm published by Dahmen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438729">9</xref></sup> A static footprint mat and a foam impression of the plantar surface of the feet were obtained for each patient. Footprints were obtained with the patients standing barefoot in a neutral position positioning their feet on a mat for 30 seconds while an operator traced with a pen the contour of the foot, to avoid missing areas eventually not reported on the mat, like often happens for the claw toes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438729">12</xref></sup> Then, the patients’ feet were placed on a foam box, while the patients were seated and the feet maintained in a neutral position by an operator who kept the knees at 90° and applied a pressure downward stabilizing the ankle, until a correct impression of the whole foot was obtained. Footprints and impressions were analyzed to identify problems requiring attention, and an individualized strategy was decided by the 3 professionals. In general, areas of high pressure of the forefoot were relieved by anticipating the contact of the foot with the ground by placing a premetatarsal bar; medial arch support was enhanced in case of claw foot, and soft fillers were positioned in case of minor amputations. Finally, the orthopedic technician realized the orthesis according to the agreed indications, total contact with medial arch support, and multilayer insoles.</p>
<p>Three different kinds of materials with different share hardness were used to construct the insoles: PPT-derived material (Professional Protective Technology, Deer Park, NY) was used to relieve local pressure, and Duroterm (Mibor, Alcoy, Spain) and Alcaform, a material derived from Plastazote (Zotefoams Plc, Croydon, UK), were used to absorb high-pressure points.</p>
<p>The shoes were high shoes or bottine, with a soft thermoformable leather to adapt to deformities, with extra depth to fit customized insoles, with stiff outsole, and with a rocker bottom profile in patients with previous ulceration or forefoot amputation, marked deformities, hallux amputation, and hollow foot with claw toes. Although the insoles were strictly customized and all craft-made by the same orthopedic technician (EF), the shoes were mostly semi-orthopedic footwear, available on the market with the characteristics described in the algorithm. In case the semi-orthopedic shoes did not fit the characteristics of the patient, a craft-made orthopedic pair of shoes was realized. All costs for insoles and footwear were covered by Tuscany Public Health Service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612438729">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once both the insoles and the shoes were available, the patients were scheduled for a test and, if positive, they walked out with the insoles/shoes system on. Appropriateness of the shoes was then verified after the first week of use. At the same time, an education session was delivered to each patient highlighting the need to wear the shoes all the time and to inspect daily the feet to check and report for any eventual problem. In case of a new DFU, patients of both groups were requested to refer to our clinic for an urgent consultation within 24 hours. In these cases, patients were visited and the cause, site, and type of the ulcer were recorded, and the general condition of both feet and shoes was evaluated and standard treatment was provided. Otherwise, patients were followed-up quarterly for 12 months for assessment of feet and footwear condition.</p>
<p>At the completion of the first year of follow-up, patients were invited to continue the program with the same strategy and, if they accepted, they entered a longer term follow-up. At the end of the first year and at 3 and 5 years for those remaining in the follow-up, a questionnaire was administered to gather information on the daily use of the footwear and the degree of comfort based on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (= <italic>lowest acceptance</italic>) to 10 (= <italic>highest acceptance</italic>).</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was the incidence of DFU and recurrences at 1, 3, and 5 years compared with the one we have previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438729">5</xref></sup> Patient’s acceptability and satisfaction were evaluated as secondary endpoints.</p>
<p>Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons were made by using the χ<sup>2</sup> test for dichotomous variables and Student <italic>t</italic> test for the analog values by using a commercial statistical software (Statview SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1874 (171/1703 type 1/2 diabetes, age 65.1 ± 11.6 years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.1 ± 1.6%), patients were screened over a consecutive 12-month period: 334 (17.8%; 41/293 type 1/2 diabetes, age 66.4 ± 10.8 years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.4 ± 1.7%) reached a risk score ≥2. Patients at high risk had longer duration of disease (27.6 ± 12.1 vs 16.9 ± 8.7 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and a higher VPT (27.8 ± 7.4 vs 20.1 ± 6.0 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) compared with the general cohort. On exclusion of 8 patients because of an active or recent DFU, 24 because of peripheral ischemia, 2 not able to stand or walk without help, and 2 refusing participation, informed consent was provided by 298 high-risk patients (89.2%); 150 of them were randomized in group A and 148 in group B. Among these participants, 46% had neuropathy and deformities, 20% had previous ulceration, 25% had previous minor amputation, and 9% had chronic neuro-osteoarthropathy. Deformities were largely accounted for by hollow claw foot (58%) and hallux valgus (23%), whereas flat foot (16%) and stabilized Charcot’s foot (9%) completed the deformity patterns.

<p>Patients in group B received 204 pairs of shoes (1.38 pairs/patient/year) and 218 pairs of insoles (1.47 pairs/patient/year) in all. The extra pairs of shoes and insoles were mostly because of replacement due to overuse, whereas in 9 cases only the insoles were replaced because of ruptures or poor fitting with the shoe at follow-up. The insoles were all custom-made, whereas the shoes were mainly semi-orthopedic footwear (ie, factory-produced); custom-made shoes were needed for 10 patients because of gross foot deformation.</p>
<p>During the initial 12-month follow-up, 17 patients in group B (12.8%) developed a total of 20 DFUs in spite of orthesis and shoes, compared with 58 patients (38.6%) and 75 DFUs in group A (χ<sup>2</sup> = 19.187, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). When patients developing DFU were compared with those not developing it, a more severe impairment of VPT at baseline was apparent in group B (38.2 ± 10.7 vs 26.1 ± 8.4 V, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) but not in group A (29.1 ± 9.0 vs 27.0 ± 7.9 V, NS); in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734612438729">Table 2</xref>, the results at 12 months are reported.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study lends support to the efficacy of orthesis prescription as part of a structured preventative program for DFU in high-risk diabetic patients.</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of DFU is well understood. The development of foot lesion is mainly due to diabetic impairment of motor and sensitive component of peripheral nerves, causing a progressive deformation of the foot resulting in areas of localized hyperpressure and reduction of protective sensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438729">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438729">3</xref></sup> Relief of pressure in these areas is considered the most effective healing procedure and the best preventative measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438729">8</xref></sup> Although the strategies to achieve an effective off-loading of the foot may vary according to the actual condition of the foot and by the severity of the process, adequate footwear is of paramount importance for DFU prevention and recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612438729">14</xref></sup> Ill-fitting footwear is a common trigger for foot ulceration, because wearing inappropriate footwear exposes the patient to the direct effects of friction and/or irritation as well as indirect damage because of inappropriate foot protection. Inappropriate footwear causing increased mechanical stress at the plantar and dorsal surfaces of the foot has been reported as the most common cause of foot ulceration in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438729">15</xref></sup> A recent prospective multicenter study on more than 1300 patients with newly diagnosed DFU found that 42% of them were localized on the dorsal or marginal sides of the foot and were therefore directly determined by ill-fitting shoes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612438729">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of these well-recognized factors, the use of more adequate footwear has not yet fully proven efficacious. Several but not all studies on therapeutic footwear have shown a reduction in DFU recurrence, and 2 systematic reviews concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic footwear in preventing reulceration is not yet that strong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612438729">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612438729">18</xref></sup> The reduction in the incidence of ulceration greatly varies from one study to the other, as does the incidence of ulcerations in the control groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612438729">18</xref></sup> This variability may be explained not only by different study design and relative objectives but also by differences in the footwear. This is not surprising because there is a lack of consensus in the definition of “therapeutic footwear.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612438729">19</xref></sup> On the other hand, a better definition of the features of a therapeutic footwear and the use of a guiding algorithm for identifying such features at an individual level should offer better off-loading solutions, hence, maximizing the effects of each component of the footwear. For instance, custom-made insoles have been shown to be effective in reducing peak pressure at the site of previous ulceration. These insoles are characterized by a medial arch support and a metatarsal pad that transfer part of the load from the metatarsal head to midfoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612438729">20</xref></sup> Guldemond et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612438729">21</xref></sup> showed that the combination of a metatarsal pad and medial arch support resulted in the largest relief of peak pressure at the metatarsal heads when compared with a flat insole. As far as relief of foot pressure is concerned, the rigid rocker outsole is currently considered the most effective design feature in therapeutic shoes. Several studies have reported a reduction in forefoot peak pressure up to 50% compared with standard shoes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612438729">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612438729">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with these considerations, we now report the results obtained by implementing a guiding algorithm together with a team approach to individualize orthesic solutions to prevent DFU in high-risk diabetic patients. When this approach was used in combination with usual educational processes, the rate of DFU was particularly low compared with that obtained in a group of patients with similar features, managed according to our standard protocol. The difference is striking as the occurrence of DFU was 3-fold lower in patients in whom appropriate footwear was adopted. The protective effect could be expected to increase over the time, because the effect of the risk is cumulative. In the extension group, however, the difference in the DFU rate remained constant. However, caution should be taken in drawing final conclusion from this observation given the smaller size of the extension group. For the orthesis footwear to be effective, it is important that shoe performance is carefully and regularly evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612438729">24</xref></sup> In our survey, almost one half of our patients had their footwear renewed before the end of the observation period because of overuse. The procedure can be costly for the patients, but according to the Tuscany regulation, reimbursement is available as long as the process is activated and remains under the control of the diabetic foot specialist. Moreover, the costs for the whole program can be deemed reasonable if one would consider the cost of managing recurring DFUs. A recent prospective multicenter evaluation, the EURODIALE study, has analyzed the costs related to the management of DFUs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612438729">25</xref></sup> calculating that the overall cost for the management of neuropathic ulcers, not complicated by ischemia or infection, amounts to €3771 per patient. Considering the different rates of incidence of DFUs between the 2 groups of patients, with our approach 55 DFU per year were prevented, which means €207 405 of gross saving compared with the standard care. Once the costs of the orthesis and shoes are considered, the final balance results in a net saving of €107 505 per year in the group treated with orthesis and shoes. These figures are based on direct costs. If indirect costs such as those related to working days loss are factored, the overall saving can exceed €500 000 per year. Finally, there is no significant cost in terms of quality of life for the patients, because of the acceptability and satisfaction for the program expressed by the participants.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the application of a standardized algorithm for therapeutic footwear in patients with a high risk for neuropathic DFU may represent an effective approach in preventing the occurrence of new ulcerations and should be inserted in any therapeutic strategy for DFU.</p>
