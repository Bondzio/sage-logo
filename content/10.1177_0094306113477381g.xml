<p>Dimitri Bogazianos explores the connection between the crack cocaine economy and the rap music industry more thoroughly than any of his predecessors. The thesis in <italic>5 Grams</italic> is clear and original. During the 1990s, the crack cocaine economy and criminal justice complex congealed into a rich symbolic world that rap artists drew on to sketch narratives about exploitation, justice, and violence, and to navigate their music careers. Bogazianos’ treatment of the policy history of crack and punishment is brisk, yet comprehensive, and his insights into the world of 1990s rap music are sharp. As a research project, however, <italic>5 Grams</italic> is somewhat unconventional, and at times unsettled, thanks to methodological choices and the inherent difficulties in studying artistic production.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge of accommodating changes to crack cocaine policy enacted shortly before the book was published, Bogazianos’ most central arguments hold up quite nicely. He describes the history and consequences of America’s ill-fated late-twentieth century turn towards punishment and mass incarceration, skillfully drawing on David Garland and others to frame these developments as coping mechanisms for a citizenry profoundly shaken by deindustrialization and cultural upheaval. The country’s desperation to affirm some sort of workable morality through punishment results in policies that are hastily implemented, terribly mismatched with the actual mechanics of the crack cocaine economy, and on the whole, ineffective.</p>
<p>After the policy discussion, <italic>5 Grams</italic> shifts to cultural analysis, describing the material impact of the crack economy on ghetto residents during the 1980s and 1990s, and the mapping of crack industry culture onto rap industry culture. The crucial cultural turn for the crack generation, Bogazianos argues, is the transformation of urban violence. Where violence among ghetto residents used to be a cultural norm directed at least partially toward social control, it now appears purely as a means to economic ends, without any regard for community. Rappers who grew up in neighborhoods impacted by the crack economy reiterate these themes in their music, both in descriptions of ghetto life and in narratives about the circumstances of their labor in the music industry.</p>
<p>Bogazianos’ treatment of the music industry is highly detailed and useful. Too frequently, journalists and academics refer to “the industry” as a shapeless, soulless behemoth, bent on cheapening art and suffocating creativity. This is an especially sore spot in hip-hop music, thanks to its evolution from a marginal ghetto subculture despised and disparaged by the mainstream, to a multi-billion dollar business with a global audience. In <italic>5 Grams</italic>, “the industry” has form and substance, and Bogazianos explains exactly how record companies exploit their artists and why it is so difficult for musicians to maintain their autonomy and reap significant rewards for their production.</p>
<p>Evidence for Bogazianos’ argument about the meaning of rap performances is comprised of close readings of a few carefully selected songs from the era, documentary films, journalistic articles, and biographies and autobiographies about the rappers in question. It would be a stretch to assume that all rappers have as firm a grip on industry labor controls as the author, but many performers are aware that they are getting screwed. In response, rappers critique legalistic labor controls in their music by using threats (mostly fantasies) of violence in their lyrics derived from their experiences in the urban crack economy, another industry where, to quote rap legend Rakim, “the number one cause of death is money.” Despite these violent themes, Bogazianos explicitly rejects the moral panic swirling around hip-hop music. Like most scholars who take hip-hop seriously, he refuses to side with either those who characterize rap as hedonism and moral debasement or those who herald it as the poetry of a righteous political revolution.</p>
<p>Bogazianos’ argument about rappers’ “reflexive lyrical stance… toward their own commercialization” (p. 2) is compelling, but he does not address counterarguments about the meanings of and inspiration for rap lyrics. Competing (or complementary) explanations for the prevalence of the themes in the book include: masculine posturing, violence as a marketable theme in popular culture, and “ghetto tourism” and the white adolescent audience demand for commoditized performances of dangerous black masculinity. Is it possible that a handful of rappers with lived experience in neighborhoods with crack economies started the trend, which was recognized as profitable and subsequently copied by scores of imitators? Did record companies encourage the prevalence of violence and anger in rap music, even at the cost of bearing an occasional critique directed at the industry?</p>
<p>An additional complication is the development of drug market discourse and lyrical violence in twenty-first century rap music. The crack economy is weaker than it was, and with the proliferation of subsidiary record labels chaired by rappers themselves, many contemporary rappers now take pride in their industry affiliations. While violent tales about the drug economy and ghetto life remain common themes in commercially successful rap, “new school violence” narratives seem to be infrequently applied as a moral framework for understanding rappers’ positions as commercial artists. It would be interesting to hear the author comment on this shift, which has implications for the instantiation, survival, and meaning of violence in rap.</p>
<p>Two methodological issues also deserve mention: sample construction and textuality. Bogazianos focuses on New York City, which is widely considered the center of the hip-hop universe during the late twentieth century. He is unapologetic about the fact that the authority for this claim comes from his personal experience as an underground rap artist who lived and performed in the city through the 1990s. The author’s justification for focusing on specific artists is similarly driven by his own certainty about which rappers mattered the most; in defending his choices, Bogazianos says, “I know this, because I was there” (p. 151). Though I happen to agree with many of the author’s declarations about which rappers defined the era, these assertions do not have to stand on their own. Bogazianos does well to convey Notorious B.I.G.’s impact on and significance to rap history, and the text would benefit from similar accounts focused on the other artists that drive the book, sections that might include notes about the artists’ critical acclaim, impact on the genre, and record sales.</p>
<p>Regarding textuality, Bogazianos rightly notes that rap is not poetry or literature, and must be treated as “a complex, commercially bound social practice, which can neither be divorced from its professional aspirations nor reduced to them” (p. 154). But in practice, the readings of rap songs are presented with a heavy emphasis on the text. To be sure, the words on the page matter. But so does the beat, and so do the relationships between the performers and the various audiences who witness, interpret, and re-perform the songs. All scholars, including Bogazianos, are free to choose their methods of musical analyses—not everyone cares for random sampling, quantitative content analysis, performance theory, or ethnomusicology. Bogazianos neatly discusses his careful qualitative coding process. All told, <italic>5 Grams</italic> is a well-crafted and important contribution to criminology and hip-hop studies, although the author might have engaged the musical and performative elements of rap more fully as part of the complexity he affirms.</p>
