<p>Kojin Karatani is Japan's foremost radical intellectual and one of the world's leading non-Western Marxists. But he is certainly not a conventional reader of Marx – partly on account of being an independent Marxist who claims to have had no influence from either Soviet or Western Marxism. A telling index of Karatani’s originality may be found in a recent essay in <italic>Rethinking Marxism</italic> entitled ‘Beyond Capital-Nation-State’, which he begins by questioning the very basis of historical materialism as it is summarily sketched in Marx’s famous passage from the 1859 Preface to <italic>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life processes in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary their social being that determines their consciousness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436935">Marx, 1969</xref> [1859]: 503)</p>
</disp-quote>
Engels is widely credited for proceeding from this formulation by Marx to popularize the base-superstructure model of the materialist conception of history, with suitable methodological qualifications and contextual considerations underlining its dialectical rather than mechanical account of causality, which has been examined since with sympathy by such critics as Raymond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612436935">Williams (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612436935">1980</xref>) and rejected most influentially in the Marxist tradition by Louis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612436935">Althusser (1969 [1965]</xref>; Althusser and Balibar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612436935">1970 [1968]</xref>). For his part, Karatani dismisses the Preface as neither original nor essential to Marx. Unlike structuralist or poststructuralist critics of post-Marxist stamp, however, he does not object to either the alleged determinism or teleology of the Preface. Moreover, his purpose in questioning the centrality of this particular passage to its author’s thought is not to discard the latter by disavowing the former, but to return to a more authentic reading of Marx for the sake of a more open and powerful Marxism beyond Marxism.</p>
<p>What Karatani coolly deletes from Marxism is the most basic concept of historical materialism: the <italic>mode of</italic> <italic>production</italic>. By so doing he intends not so much to displace as to encompass the notion of <italic>production</italic> found at the heart of virtually every reading of Marx within the broader notion of <italic>exchange</italic>, so as to advance in the name and spirit of Marx a superior concept: the <italic>mode of exchange</italic>. The mode of exchange thus becomes for Karatani the key Marxist concept for understanding not only the past and the present, but also an <italic>actually</italic> possible future called X. He effectively claims that the whole world appears quite differently, and more usefully so, when viewed through the lens of the mode of exchange, which brings into its purview not only capital, but also state and nation. In contrast to Marx’s periodization of the ‘pre-history’ of humanity in the Preface in terms of more or less successive modes of production – Tribal, Asiatic, Greco-Roman, Feudal, and Capitalist – Karatani discerns in human history four fundamental social formations defined in terms of their dominant mode of exchange (A, B, C, D). As explained in his interview with Joel Wainwright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612436935">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>), these begin with the social formation consisting essentially of relations of reciprocity (A), which is followed by societies of plunder-redistribution (B) and commodity exchange (C); this last, the currently dominant form of the ‘capital-nation-state’ combination, anticipates the final possibility X (D), which he characterizes in Hegelian fashion as a sublation of the original form of reciprocity dominant in A on a higher plane. Karatani fleshes out his four-fold mode of exchange matrix with arresting historical-geographical-sociological nuance, wherein social formations are conceived conjuncturally as overdetermined articulations of more than one mode of exchange involving various mixes of capital, nation, and state at various stages of their development. Gesturing toward the deliberately elusive X, he finds terms such as communism, socialism, and anarchism generally agreeable as names for it but strategically inconvenient on account of their political-ideological baggage. The closest Karatani comes to naming X is with the word ‘association’, following anarchist as much as Marxist tradition, recalling Proudhon’s conception of socialism and Marx’s definition of communism as the generalized actualization of ‘free association’.</p>
<p>What are we to make of such a radical reformatting of Marxism? Karatani’s spirited project of anarchist Marxism, profoundly influenced by Kant’s call for a World Republic of Perpetual Peace (another candidate for X), is unlikely to please everyone. Anarchists are the ones most likely to find Karatani’s theoretical innovations intriguing; and, on close reading, they may very well regard this thinker a more reliable guide to an exit from the present state of the world than Michael Hardt and Tony Negri. Card-carrying Post-Marxists for their part might wonder why a man so genial as Karatani still wishes to remain a Marxist. The reaction of committed Marxists to Karatani’s provocation is harder to predict, though a hostile one is not difficult to imagine. This would stem above all from a desire to retain the primacy of the concept of production, with appeals to Marx’s mature works such as <italic>Grundrisse</italic> and <italic>Capital</italic>. Did not the achievement of Marx’s <italic>critique</italic> of political economy, after all, lie precisely in taking us beyond the realm of exchange, where so much of classical political economy was detained, into the realm of production, wherein he laid before us the secret of accumulation – the making of surplus value? How could we now decline Marx’s memorable invitation:<disp-quote>
<p>in company with the owner of money and the owner of labour-power, [to] leave this noisy sphere [of circulation], where everything takes place on the surface and in full view of everyone, and follow them into the hidden abode of production, on whose threshold there hangs the notice ‘No admittance except on business’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612436935">Marx, 1976 [1867]</xref>: 279)</p>
</disp-quote>
Was it not there that we saw ‘the secret of profit making’, that is, ‘not only how capital produces, but how capital is itself produced’? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612436935">Marx, 1976 [1867]</xref>: 280).</p>
<p>If such objections may legitimately be raised at the first sight of Karatani’s post-1989 work, they are only likely to become more strident upon encountering his contemporaneous practical-political activities, which Wainwright rightly questions him about. Karatani’s New Associationist Movement (NAM) was founded in 2000 in Japan, and modeled on the Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) founded in 1983 by Michael Linton in British Columbia. Although J.K. Gibson-Graham may have endorsed this proposal to escape the commodity form, it sounds in essence very much like a postmodern version of Proudhon’s celebrated effort to get rid of capitalism by getting rid of money – which did not succeed even in the much more propitious circumstances of Europe circa 1848 and was subjected by Marx to an especially ruthless critique in <italic>Poverty of Philosophy</italic>. Marx, who was sympathetic to Proudhon’s anarchism in many respects and shared with him the key notion of free association as the basis of communism, simply could not go along with the man Karatani calls ‘perhaps the first socialist’ on this matter of the relationship between money and capital. The latter, for the author of <italic>Capital</italic>, is a social relation. Overcoming capital therefore requires overcoming those social relations specific to it, which cannot be accomplished merely by meddling with even their most universal means of mediation: money. Actually existing forms of LETS, needless to add, have only corroborated Marx’s point whenever their <italic>local</italic> money has come up against the force of <italic>real-world</italic> money. So Karatani’s emphatic political investment in LETS comes as a let down to even those favorably disposed toward his mode of exchange matrix beckoning us towards X; for classical Marxists, it may seem fundamentally misguided. It may be understandable given Karatani’s privileging of exchange over production, but it is no less politically ill-advised for being logical within Karatani’s order of things.</p>
<p>Betting on LETS and valorizing exchange above production – how damaging is the Marxist critique of these moves and how does Karatani defend them? To address these, it is necessary to consider at least Karatani’s major work available in English, <italic>Transcritique: On Kant and Marx </italic>(2003), which Fredric Jameson describes as an ‘immensely ambitious theoretical edifice in which new relations between Kant and Marx are established, as well as a new kind of synthesis between Marxism and anarchism’ (quoted on the back cover of <italic>Transcritique</italic>). This powerful work should lay to rest the suspicion of any theoretical naiveté or ‘misunderstanding’ of Marx on Karatani’s part en route to LETS via the mode of exchange: Slavoj Žižek, for example, is a little too harsh in accusing him of ignoring surplus value in his activism in LETS and NAM, in an otherwise useful review of <italic>Transcritique</italic> in <italic>New Left Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612436935">Žižek, 2004</xref>). Karatani understands surplus value as well as the difference between price and value and the nature of money, on the basis of which he sharply underlines the error of Proudhon in <italic>Transcritique</italic>, while insisting nonetheless on the value of this pioneering anarchist’s conception of free association to a vision of society liberated from capital and state. And he readily acknowledges the concrete limitations of LETS and NAM and the modesty of his own political contributions by means of them, while noting more soberly than do some poststructuralisms a la Gibson-Graham the difficulties of negotiating the formidable forces of capital-nation-state on the way to X. What Karatani remains committed to in LETS and NAM nonetheless is the anarchist-Marxist principle of free association and the vision of the withering away of both capital and state – which was not actualized in actually existing socialism but is essential for X. LETS and NAM, much like the Marx informed by Proudhon on the eve of the failed European revolutions of 1848, thus point to the direction away from the actuality of capital-nation-state, towards X.</p>
<p>If Marxists can be persuaded to soften their critiques of LETS and NAM, then what of their assessment of Karatani’s displacement of mode of production by mode of exchange? Here too, on patient inspection this iconoclastic Japanese thinker would seem to plead a case less incredulous than first suspected – and on the authority of Marx. As Karatani points out in <italic>Transcritique</italic> and elsewhere, the conception of production operative in the first volume of <italic>Capital</italic> is not narrowly economistic; it refers rather to the ensemble of social relations that defines capital as such, and extends well into the political and ideological realms concerned with the reproduction of the relations of production. The more technical second volume of <italic>Capital</italic> likewise begins with a thoroughgoing deconstruction of the categories of production, consumption and circulation, before its analytical emphasis falls heavily on the last of these. In <italic>Grundrisse</italic> too, even when Marx limits himself to a critique of classical political-economic concepts, he refrains from offering too narrow a categorical definition of production; here he links production inextricably to consumption, in order to examine the entire process of capitalist accumulation that both encompasses and exceeds what classical political economists called production and consumption. ‘Production is … immediately consumption’, Marx wrote there at the outset, because ‘the act of production is … in all its moments also an act of consumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436935">Marx, 1973</xref> [1857–1858]: 90–91).</p>
<p>This characteristically dialectical formulation rests on the richness of Marx’s conception of social relations, which includes production relations as well as relations of reproduction in their manifold mediations. For Karatani, it is the <italic>totality</italic> of these relations that consists of the proper object of Marx and Marxism, which cannot be reduced to production relations or any other subset of it. He finds the key term for this social totality in the pivotal manuscript written by Marx and Engels in 1845/6 and then abandoned without publication to the ‘gnawing criticism of mice’: <italic>Verkehr</italic>. This word, which occurs in some memorable passages of <italic>The German Ideology</italic>, harbors several meanings in the context of Marx and Engels’s usage: traffic (the predominant contemporary translation from everyday German), commerce, communication, interaction, communion and association. In most English translations of Marx, it is rendered as intercourse. This is what Karatani means by exchange in his <italic>mode of exchange</italic>. Yet his word choice in translation is poor: ‘exchange’ lends itself all too easily to strictly economic connotation and interpretation. He should have stuck to the more polysemous yet precise <italic>Verkehr</italic>, so as to alert the reader to the irreducible <italic>sociality</italic> of this concept mobilized by Marx and Engels. If an English translation of it were needed, it should have been <italic>intercourse</italic>. <italic>Mode of intercourse</italic> (<italic>Verkehrsweise</italic>) would likely have avoided many of the predictable objections summoned by Karatani’s apparently hazardous proposal to replace mode of production with mode of exchange.</p>
<p>However poor his terminological choice, Karatani’s case for the importance of <italic>Verkehr</italic> is persuasive:<disp-quote>
<p>Marx widely and diversely used the term <italic>Verkehr</italic> up until the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic> of 1848. His abandonment of the concept thereafter seems to have been caused by the fact that he submerged himself in the study of economics, which eventually led him to write <italic>Capital</italic>. He finally limited himself to the study of the whole system of capitalist economy by way of commodity exchange, thus making observations on the state, community and nation secondary. Therefore, to deal with those matters comprehensively, we should return to the notion of <italic>Verkehr</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612436935">Karatani, 2008</xref>: 572)</p>
</disp-quote>
If we quibble with Karatani’s semantics, we do so with the intention of registering with greater clarity the genuine merit of his call for a return to the authentic Marxist concept of <italic>Verkehr</italic> – especially those aspects of the totality of human-human and human-nature relations that are related to but also relatively autonomous from the economic relations studied by Marx. In addition to the economic, Karatani argues, there exist two other fundamental dimensions of <italic>Verkehrsweise</italic> to be engaged head-on in the long march towards X: the political and the ideological. To these correspond, as the title of Karatani’s essay ‘Capital-Nation-State’ suggests, two persistent thorns in the side of socialism that must be sublated in order to achieve X – <italic>state</italic> and <italic>nation</italic>.</p>
<p>The value of Karatani’s contention lies in the challenges posed by state and nation to communist politics. The lesson he draws from them is straightforward: instead of expecting state and nation to step respectfully aside to make way for communism <italic>after</italic> the revolution, we must struggle <italic>simultaneously</italic> on three fronts against capital, state and nation in order to defeat the totality of our own <italic>Verkehrsweise</italic> of ‘capital-nation-state’ if we are to attain X. Such a political standpoint requires that we re-evaluate state and nation as entities with <italic>their own histories</italic> – which interact with the history of commodity relations that originated in the ‘margins’ of pre-capitalist economic formations and became the essence of capitalism with the commodification of labor. Karatani’s consideration of the state on the basis of his return to <italic>Verkehr</italic> stands out in the Marxist tradition for at least two related reasons. The first is his insistence on understanding the state as not only a condensation of contradictory social relations at the decisive political level of society, but also as a product of the fundamentally antagonistic relations between different states constituting a Hobbesian world-system of interstate relations. Karatani characterizes the latter in ‘friend-enemy’ terms, with express gratitude to Carl Schmitt for theorizing this autonomous <italic>interstate</italic> dimension of the political and an appeal to Kant’s notion of the ‘World Republic’ as the only horizon that could transcend it – with the help of Marxist critique and anarchist politics. The second is his resourceful use of the much-maligned concept of the ‘Asiatic mode of production’. Stalin had notoriously banned it from Soviet Marxism in order to forestall Marxist questions concerning the bureaucratization of the USSR. For quite different reasons, Perry Anderson recommended for this concept ‘the decent burial that it deserves’ on the penultimate page of <italic>Lineages of the Absolutist State</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612436935">1974</xref>), as a precondition for undertaking in the non-European world ‘a concrete and accurate typology of social formations and State systems in their own right’ (pp. 548–549). Yet in Karatani’s own typology, no doubt influenced by a generation of Japanese Marxists researching the Asiatic mode of production, the same concept lends itself to a critique of Eurocentric tendencies found in mainstream as much as Marxist historical scholarship. Karatani writes in ‘Beyond Capital-Nation-State’:<disp-quote>
<p>Marx stressed that commodity exchange arose only between distinct communities. Likewise, it should be noted that the state, as well, can only emerge between distinct communities. The formation of the state cannot be seen as the outcome of the internal development of a community. Rather, it appears when a community rules other communities. This does not mean that all states were formed by conquest. If one state exists, other adjacent communities must become states in order to protect themselves from being subjected. It is in this sense that states exist essentially against other states … The state is a community that imposes tribute and service on other communities that it dominates … This is typical of the Asiatic social formation, which is usually considered an early and primitive stage in history … These states facilitated the creation of technology necessary to control the environment, as in the case of large-scale irrigation, which greatly developed agricultural production. What is no less significant is that they also created technologies for controlling people, such as bureaucracy, letters, media, religion and so on. The Asiatic states are not elementary. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612436935">Karatani, 2008</xref>: 579–580)</p>
</disp-quote>
In these reflections Karatani lays the basis for a suggestive comparative historical-sociological alternative to the mainstreams of Eurocentric teleology culminating – after the defeat of ‘actually existing socialism’ – in the ‘end of history’. The central terms of his view of history are borrowed from a figure no less reviled than Schmitt by Marxists: Karl Wittfogel, the author of <italic>Oriental Despotism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612436935">1957</xref>), who proposed a theory of core, marginal, and submarginal space in the pre-capitalist world. Comparable conceptions have been advanced subsequently by scholars possessing more admirable Leftist political credentials: centre, semi-periphery, and periphery in Immanuel Wallerstein’s ‘world-system’; metropolis and satellite in Andre Gunder Frank’s ‘development of underdevelopment’; or centre and periphery in Samir Amin’s ‘accumulation on a world scale’. Such perspectives on the world impress upon Karatani the need to study social formations in relation to other social formations in a hierarchically interconnected world. In general, he sees the margin as being unable to resist incorporation into the core; whereas the submargin is seen to exercise relative autonomy in appropriating selective features of the core and rejecting others while developing its own characteristics. Germanic societies as well as Japan find their place in this scheme ‘on the [sub]margins of Asiatic empires and in direct relation to them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612436935">Karatani, 2008</xref>: 581). It was thus possible for feudalism to evolve in these regions of the world rather than in countries that lay at the margin of Chinese and Indian Asiatic formations such as Korea, Vietnam, or Sri Lanka – thanks to their inheritance of relatively strong relations of reciprocity that proved catalytic in the development of private property. The decentralized structure of those feudal societies was more favorably disposed towards the subsequent consolidation of capitalism than Asiatic societies, wherein plunder-redistribution relations dominated under bureaucratic centralization. In advancing such hypotheses for historical-geographical research, Karatani undermines the commonplace mapping of the stylized political distinction between Asian despotism and European democracy on to the ideological-spatial division between Occident and Orient. He finds, in contrast, equivalents of Athenian ‘democracy’ in contemporaneous China, pointing in <italic>both</italic> cases to the emergence and imposition of the <italic>state</italic> as the decisive force against the politics of the polis. The case of China is familiar enough to Europeans from Wittfogel and other Sinologists. Yet few Occidental minds would follow Karatani in regarding Alexander the Great of Macedonia, whose imperial conquest of the Asian empires sounded the death knell of the ethos of Athens, as an Oriental Despot.</p>
<p>There is clearly more to Karatani than this. As a philosopher, his signal contribution has been a novel juxtaposition of Kant and Marx in <italic>Transcritique</italic>, offering a Kantian reading of Marx and a Marxist reading of Kant without reducing one to the other, so as to inject an ethical dimension to the critique of political economy while advancing a political-economic critique of ethics. Methodologically, this work revolves around the theorization of an irreducible gap between antinomic perspectives – such as the one Marx encountered between David Ricardo’s and Samuel Bailey’s irreconcilable conceptions of value that led, according to Karatani in <italic>Transcritique</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612436935">2003</xref>: 193), to his most radical ‘epistemological break’ between <italic>Grundrisse</italic> and <italic>Capital</italic>, in the discovery of money and commodity <italic>form</italic>. It is evident that the philosophical grounding of this thinker who began his career as a literary critic before engaging political economy lies at the heart of his historical-geographical-sociological-anthropological sensibilities as much as anarchist-Marxist political orientation. Given the impossibility of accessing such a wide-ranging and original <italic>oeuvre</italic> from any academic-disciplinary perspective, it may be apt to attempt a balance sheet of Karatani’s contribution by comparing him to a few other Marxists who have proposed their own ‘triads’. Two suggest themselves for the purpose: Henri Lefebvre and Giovanni Arrighi. Both offered alternatives to the base-superstructure model by proposing different conceptions of social totality: the levels of global, urban, and everyday life in Lefebvre (most succinctly formulated in <italic>The Urban Revolution</italic>, 2003 [1970]); and, in Arrighi’s case, the grand theorization of the levels of material life, market exchange and global geo-political-economy borrowed from Fernand Braudel. Both registered as well the role of the state in an original way within the terms of their totalities. Key to Arrighi’s <italic>The Long Twentieth Century</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612436935">1994</xref>) has been the distinction made between capitalism and the market economy and the identification of capitalism with the state by Braudel in <italic>Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he modern state, which did not create capitalism but only inherited it, sometimes acts in its favor and at other times against it; it sometimes allows capitalism to expand and at other times destroys its mainspring. Capitalism only triumphs when it becomes identified with the state, when it is the state. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436935">Braudel, 1977</xref>: 64)</p>
</disp-quote>
In his ‘global level’ – the union of ‘neo-dirigisme’ and ‘neo-liberalism’ – Lefebvre likewise links the state to capital, and accords considerable autonomy to it in <italic>De l’État</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436935">1976–1978</xref>) by means of the concept of the ‘state mode of production’ (<italic>mode de production étatique</italic>). In so doing he makes a case for <italic>autogestion</italic> (self-management), reminding communists of Marx’s vision of the ‘withering away of the state’. Karatani, then, is by no means the only heterodox thinker ‘deeply in awe of Marx’ (<italic>Transcritique</italic>: x) to theorize the state in an original way; to suggest a rapprochement between anarchism and Marxism; or to urge us to broaden political engagement beyond the laws of motion of capital for the sake of communist politics. Yet by the same token he belongs with Lefebvre, Althusser, and a handful of others who have read Marx in a radical and original way. There need be no assurance that anyone will fully agree with Karatani’s reading of <italic>Capital</italic> or his idiosyncratic rejection of historical materialism <italic>tout court</italic>; but it is safe to say that radical readers of his <italic>Transcritique</italic> and related texts could only sharpen the quality of their own Marxisms and become better qualified to answer the question: ‘what is to be done?’</p>
