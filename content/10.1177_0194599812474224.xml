<p>The role of fungus in the etiology of rhinitis is established, but the molecular mechanism responsible remains unknown. In addition, the methods for the accurate diagnosis of fungal allergies in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients are lacking. This is due to lack of standardized fungal antigenic extracts, presence of a large number of antigenic epitopes, and limitations of the current methods for assessing nasal patency.</p>
<p>Modified radioallergosorbent test (mRAST) and epicutaneous skin testing are the standard methods of screening multiple allergens in patients with AR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812474224">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> These methods have various limitations such as skin testing cannot be done in patients with a history of dermatographism and mRAST is less sensitive than skin testing. Because of these limitations of skin testing and mRAST, nasal provocation testing (NPT) may be a superior alternative diagnostic tool for inhalant allergies since it tests the end-organ effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812474224">3</xref></sup> The response to NPT is typically assessed by acoustic rhinometry (AcR) or anterior rhinomanometry (ARM). Acoustic rhinometry transforms the analysis of a sound pulse within the nasal cavity to an area-distance plot. However, this technique involves the placement of a tube within the anterior aspect of the nasal cavity, and malposition of the nasal tube can lead to distortion. Anterior rhinomanometry measures the pressure difference between the nasopharynx and the naris and unilateral airflow to calculate the nasal resistance to airflow. Although well standardized, it is not valid in subjects who have septal perforations or unilateral complete obstruction.</p>
<p>Optical rhinometry (ORM) has recently been introduced as a means of assessing nasal airway patency. It measures the absorption of the isobestic point of hemoglobin in the tissue. Consequently, ORM measures the total blood volume, both deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, within the nasal tissue and serves as an indirect measure of nasal airway patency. Compared with anterior rhinomanometry, ORM has a better correlation with patient symptoms of nasal congestion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812474224">4</xref></sup> The primary advantages with the ORM are the ease and comfort of use and the ability to obtain continuous measurements during the nasal provocation study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812474224">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though studies have validated ORM for assessing nasal patency in patients with dust mite AR,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812474224">5</xref></sup> data supporting the role of ORM for the evaluation of nasal patency changes in fungal AR are lacking. Thus, we hypothesized that NPT is a valid method of diagnosis of AR due to fungal etiology, and ORM can be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between patients with and without AR due to fungal etiology. To this effect, we conducted a prospective trial to validate ORM as a test for changes in nasal patency from fungal AR using skin testing as a screening method and to compare ORM with the standard means of assessing NPT results, AcR.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812474224" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We prospectively enrolled 2 populations of patients, healthy controls and patients with inhalant allergies and IgE-mediated skin sensitivity to <italic>Alternaria</italic> and/or <italic>Aspergillus</italic> between 18 and 65 years of age. Protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston, Texas). Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects. The healthy controls and AR subjects were recruited through open advertisement in the university community and from the clinical practices of authors (M.J.C., S.F., and A.L.) with the diagnosis of inhalant allergy. Healthy controls had no history of inhalant allergies or asthma and had negative reaction on a skin prick test to <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> antigens. The AR subjects had a history of inhalant allergies and a positive reaction on the skin prick test to <italic>Alternaria</italic> and/or <italic>Aspergillus</italic> antigen. Symptoms of inhalant allergies included sneezing, rhinorrhea, congestion, watery eyes, and pruritus of the eyes, nose, and/or palate. A positive reaction on the skin prick test was defined as a wheal size equal to or larger than the wheal size created by the positive control, histamine. Patients on the following medications were asked to discontinue them prior to testing: antihistamines (3 days), topical nasal steroids (1 week), systemic steroids (1 week), tricyclic antidepressants (1 week), H2 blockers (1 day), and leukotriene receptor antagonists (1 day). Other exclusion criteria included pregnancy, asthma, history of immunotherapy, immunodeficiency, chronic rhinosinusitis, prior sinus surgery, sinonasal polyps, β-blocker use, dermatographism, latex sensitivity, and previous systemic reactions to skin testing. In addition, subjects were not tested if they had an episode of rhinitis within the previous month and/or were symptomatic with allergy symptoms at the time of enrollment.</p>
<p>Each subject underwent NPT. Prior to the first antigenic challenge, all subjects were acclimated to the testing conditions for 15 minutes. Thereafter, baseline measurements with the optical and acoustic rhinometer were obtained, and all subjects rated specific nasal and distant symptoms using a nasal allergen provocation (NAP) scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> and visual analog scale (VAS) for subjective assessment of global nasal symptoms. The NAP was adopted from Krouse et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> and involved asking subjects to rate the severity of 3 symptoms (severity of nasal secretions, nasal irritation, and distant symptoms) on scale of 0 to 2. Therefore, the total score ranged from 0 to 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> A NAP test ≥3 was considered positive. The VAS scale consisted of a 10-cm line drawn on paper with marks at 1-cm intervals. Subjects were asked to globally assess their symptoms of congestion, sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea and to place a single mark along the VAS to demonstrate their perceived symptomatology.</p>
<p>The NPT protocol was standardized for all the tested subjects. First, the left nasal cavity was challenged with the negative control (buffered saline in 50% glycerin), and readings were obtained with ORM, AcR, NAP scale, and VAS. Any subject with positive reading on ORM or AcR was excluded from the study as it defines a reaction to the glycerinated saline, which is a part of all antigens. Starting with the right nasal cavity (allowing any irritant effect from the glycerinated saline challenge to dissipate prior to challenging the left side), 3 increasing concentrations (40 protein nitrogen units [PNU]/mL [1:2500 dilution], 200 PNU/mL [1:500 dilution], and 1000 PNU/mL [1:100 dilution]) of <italic>Alternaria</italic> antigen were used for the nasal provocation challenge. Nasal provocation testing was stopped if a positive response was noted by optical rhinometry. A positive response by ORM is defined as a change in optical density (OD) of 0.2 or greater. This value was based on published values constituting a positive response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812474224">6</xref></sup> A similar nasal challenge protocol was repeated on the left side with <italic>Aspergillus</italic> antigen (80 PNU/mL [1:2500 dilution], 400 PNU/mL [1:500 dilution], and 2000 PNU/mL [1:100 dilution]). The antigens were standardized as per international standards set forth through the International Union of Immunological Societies’ Committee for Allergen Standardization. The antigen challenge was started at 1:2500 dilution of the fungal antigen. If no response was noted after 10 minutes of monitoring with optical rhinometry, then a more concentrated dilution of 1:500 followed by 1:100 was used until an increase in OD of at least 0.2 was noted or a plateau was reached. Once a plateau was reached, nasal patency was monitored for 20 minutes from the time of introduction of the fungal antigen. After each nasal challenge, all subjects reported a NAP scale and VAS score to assess subjective symptoms, and an AcR reading was taken after 5 minutes of introduction of the antigen.</p>
<p>For NPT, each subject was first fitted with the spectacle-like frame of the ORM, which has an optical emitter and detector probe that is placed across the nasal dorsum. A 2-minute baseline ORM reading is first taken. Then, 100 µL of the antigenic solution is administered to the nasal cavity via a mucosal atomizer device directed at the inferior turbinate. The ORM reading is taken for a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 20 minutes. Five minutes after the administration of antigen, 3 readings are taken with AcR, and the average value from these 3 readings is reported as the mean cross-sectional area (MCA).</p>
<p>Continuous variables are represented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables are represented as percentage. All the tests with continuous/ordinal variables were examined for their diagnostic ability based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and NAP score was compared using Fisher’s exact test. The test was considered significant for <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, and all <italic>P</italic> values quoted are 2-tailed unless otherwise indicated. All the analyses were done using SPSS version 19 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 22 subjects were enrolled, of whom 11 were healthy controls and 11 had AR. Age range was 19 to 55 years with an average age of 29 ± 9 years for both groups. There were 55% males in the control group and 36% in the AR group (<italic>P</italic> = .7). None of the subjects in our study had a positive reaction on nasal provocation with the negative control warranting exclusion from the study.</p>
<p>Skin test was positive for <italic>Alternaria</italic> antigen in 73% (n = 8) of the AR patients. Four of the 8 patients had a positive NAP score. In contrast, none of the control patients had a positive NAP score (0/11, <italic>P</italic> = .01). Thus, the NAP score had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100% in identifying <italic>Alternaria</italic>-sensitive patients.

<p>None of the patients in our study reported any significant side effects, including anaphylaxis, from the skin testing or NPT. Three patients in the AR group (2 <italic>Alternaria</italic>-sensitive patients and 1 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-sensitive patient) had a wheal-and-flare reaction at the skin prick site 48 hours later, reporting redness, swelling, and itching at the skin prick site.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to evaluate the role of ORM for nasal patency in IgE-mediated fungal-sensitive AR patients. A previous study by the senior author (A.L.) reported a strong correlation between ORM and subjective ratings of nasal congestion using histamine and oxymetazoline challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812474224">7</xref></sup> In addition, Cheung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812474224">5</xref></sup> established that ORM can detect changes in nasal patency and correlates with subjective ratings of nasal congestion as well as AcR reading in patients with AR to dust mite nasally challenged with <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> (dust mite antigen). On the contrary, our study showed that neither ORM nor AcR was able to establish changes in nasal patency when nasally challenged with fungal antigens in patients with clinical symptoms of AR and IgE-mediated skin sensitivity to fungal antigens. The fungal antigens used in our study did not elicit early phase changes in nasal patency or blood flow in fungal-sensitive AR patients.</p>
<p>The NAP scores in <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> skin test–positive AR patients were significantly different from healthy controls. But more detailed analysis revealed that the difference was based primarily on differences in nasal irritation caused by the antigen rather than congestion or rhinorrhea. Based on ROC curve analysis, VAS was not able to differentiate <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-sensitive AR patients from controls, suggesting that fungal antigens used in this study did not cause significant nasal symptoms. The study by Cheung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812474224">5</xref></sup> showed significant change in nasal congestion on NPT with dust mite antigen in subjects with AR to dust mite diagnosed on history and skin testing. The poor correlation of epicutaneous testing and nasal response to fungal antigens in our study is consistent with other reports, despite using ORM as a novel means of assessing NPT effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> Delayed reaction seen in 3 of our AR subjects suggests a potential role of delayed hypersensitivity to fungal antigens. Unlike other common allergens such as pollen that incite nasal symptoms as a result of a type I hypersensitivity response with histamine release, mold antigens may incite other types of hypersensitivity within the nasal cavity. Additional research is warranted to further characterize differential immune responses to skin testing when using mold antigens. The use of 48-hour delayed responses in mold-allergic patients may improve overall sensitivity and specificity of nasal provocation assessment.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the poor correlation of epicutaneous testing and NPT has been previously seen for <italic>Alternaria</italic> antigens. Studies have pointed that skin testing for pollens is more reliable and valid and can more accurately reflect end-organ responsiveness than skin testing for mold antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812474224">8</xref></sup> Modrzynski and Zawisza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812474224">9</xref></sup> reported that of the patients tested with a positive skin test for <italic>Alternaria</italic>, only 56% had positive change in MCA on AcR. A study by Krouse et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref></sup> has suggested that mold allergy may not be accurately assessed through either epicutaneous or intradermal testing. In their study, sensitivity and specificity of epicutaneous testing were 42% and 44%, respectively, for <italic>Alternaria</italic> antigen when NPT with AcR was considered as the standard. This study indicates that use of epicutaneous testing may have limitations in testing for <italic>Alternaria</italic> allergy. Other studies support the use of skin testing as an accurate methodology for the diagnosis of timothy grass sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812474224">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812474224">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, clinometric properties of skin testing appear poor in the evaluation of inhalant allergies caused by fungus. So, it is possible that the inclusion criteria for our study were not sufficient to identify patients with fungal inhalant allergies. Assessment methods other than epicutaneous testing for immediate response may be indicated for the comprehensive evaluation of patients with suspected fungal allergies.</p>
<p>Lynch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812474224">8</xref></sup> have shown that bronchial challenge and skin testing results with <italic>Alternaria</italic> do not correlate significantly, whereas correlation between skin test and end-organ challenge with timothy grass antigen was significant. This study further elucidates poor correlation of epicutaneous testing and end-organ response for fungal antigens. In addition, in vitro IgE levels by the radioallergosorbent test also failed to correlate with the end-organ bronchial challenge in the Lynch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812474224">8</xref></sup> study using <italic>Alternaria</italic> antigen.</p>
<p>Another factor that can affect the accurate diagnosis of fungal AR is the presence of concomitant allergies to other antigens. Although allergy to molds occurs less frequently than hypersensitivity to plant pollen and dust mites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812474224">10</xref></sup> it may be found in 5% of persons with AR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812474224">11</xref></sup> In the case of concomitant allergy to plant pollen or other antigens and mold allergens, doubts may arise as to the significance of the latter in the etiology of the disease in individual cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812474224">12</xref></sup> In our study, we enrolled patients based on their history of symptoms suggestive of AR and skin test positive for fungal antigens. We did not test for other antigens, which may play a concomitant role in causing allergy symptoms.</p>
<p>Finally, the variability in the methods of preparation of mold antigens among various antigen suppliers may explain the discrepancy with other studies suggesting that positive provocation test for mold antigens strongly indicates clinical significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474224">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812474224">9</xref></sup> Aas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812474224">13</xref></sup> used prick testing to compare extracts of 5 common molds obtained from different manufacturers and found considerable differences between the extracts with respect to the pattern of positive and negative tests noted in mold-sensitive individuals and nonallergic controls. Thus, standardization of mold antigenic extracts with improved preparation techniques is required for further accuracy of NPT to detect end-organ changes in fungal AR.</p>
<p>Overall, the above-mentioned attributes of fungus suggest that either fungus does not elicit the same type I hypersensitivity response or that the current fungal antigens do not encapsulate the true allergen component. As a consequence, a poor correlation exists between the positive skin test for fungal antigens in a person with a history of inhalant allergies and NPT.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At the concentrations used in this study, fungal antigens caused irritation but did not elicit early phase changes in nasal patency or blood flow as monitored by AR or ORM in fungus-sensitive AR patients. The poor correlation of epicutaneous testing and nasal response to fungal antigens argues against a pure IgE-mediated immune response in the nasal cavity. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the immune response of fungi in the nasal cavity and also to evaluate the use of alternate testing methodologies and their scientific accuracy and clinical utility.</p>
