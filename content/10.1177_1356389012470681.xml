<abstract>
<p>This article provides a practical example of how to apply a theory-driven approach to research intervention and protocol design. It illustrates how reflection on both intervention theory and programme theory can inform and refine the: implementation of the intervention; research design; specification of research questions and tools; and, identify the contribution each research stage makes in the accumulation of policy-relevant learning. The article presents the logic models, associated theory and learning from the development of a pilot randomized control trial/feasibility study of a walking intervention targeting older adults.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Theory-based evaluation approaches such as Theories of Change and Realistic Evaluation have been used to bring evaluative thinking into the planning and implementation phases of many social interventions and to aid the development of appropriate research and evaluation frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012470681">Connell and Kubisch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012470681">Connell et at., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012470681">Fulbright-Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). The aim of these approaches is to enhance planning, implementation, impact, and the learning that results from evaluation with a view to improving future social programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012470681">Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012470681">Fulbright-Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>This article provides a practical illustration of how careful reflection on the theory behind both the intervention and the intended research protocol can produce learning that can enhance both of these prior to implementation. The learning can also be used to clarify the contributions to arise from different stages of a research process. It can inform the design of subsequent research stages (in the case of our example, moving from a pilot/feasibility study to a full randomized controlled trial [RCT]).</p>
<p>This article reports the learning from our reflections on the theory behind our own research pilot/feasibility study (West End Walkers 65+ [WEW65+]) and its associated intervention. The WEW65+ study examined the delivery of a pedometer-based graduated walking programme in combination with physical activity consultations to Scottish adults aged ≥65 years, who were currently not meeting the physical activity recommendations, in a primary care setting (general practice).</p>
<p>Reflection on programme theory should be an inherent part of good quality intervention or research design (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012470681">[NICE], 2007</xref>). However, the publication of research guidelines and frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012470681">Craig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012470681">Davidoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012470681">Glasgow et al., 1999</xref>) encouraging: more explicit consideration of the theory behind interventions; emphasizing the need for research to be tailored to intervention stages; and, highlighting the importance of researchers providing detailed descriptions of both the contexts and the process of their research and associated interventions, indicates that there is room for improvement in this process.</p>
<p>Learning from reflecting on theory as part of the development of research protocols is often not made explicit by researchers and the products from this process often go unpublished. By making the learning and products from our reflection explicit, we aim to help other researchers to understand this important process and apply it to their future endeavours. Given this, our article presents only our learning on the utility of applying theory-based tools and thinking to intervention and research design and implementation. The research design and protocol for this pilot/feasibility study are presented elsewhere by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012470681">MacMillan et al. (2011)</xref> as are our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389012470681">Mutrie et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured in the following way. First, we briefly outline the key approaches that encourage theory-driven perspectives to evaluation. Second, we provide some minimal background to the pilot/feasibility study WEW65+ that we use as an example for this article. Third, we present the models and associated theory and assumptions to arise from our reflections and the issues these highlighted for our intervention and research protocol. Fourth, we illustrate where our reflections reinforced or refined our initial plans and discuss what factors may have impacted on the learning and our subsequent actions. We also consider whether or not detailed reflection on theory is typically undertaken as part of intervention design and research development and whether a more formal approach (e.g. using logic modelling) would bring benefits to other researchers in different contexts.</p>

<title>Theory-driven evaluation approaches</title>
<p>Theory-driven evaluation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012470681">Chen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012470681">Fulbright-Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012470681">Judge and Bauld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>) encourage evaluators to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intervention being evaluated and how it is expected to work. Such approaches aim to improve learning and attribution by more effectively linking data on the process, outcomes, and context of the intervention. This allows greater understanding of whether an intervention works but also how, why, and for whom it works. Often, interventions work for some participants and in some circumstances and not for other participants and circumstances. Theory-driven approaches attempt to explain why this is the case. The theory underpinning the intervention and how it works should influence the range of methods, the focus taken, the research questions addressed, and the design used within the evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012470681">Chen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012470681">Fulbright-Anderson et al.,1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). For a more detailed explanation of two of the most common approaches to theory-based evaluation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012470681">Blamey and Mackenzie (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>The key concept in theory-driven evaluation is that there is a need to know what components of any intervention achieve its impact. In order to uncover this, it is necessary for evaluators to be knowledgeable about the intervention itself and about the theory that underpins the associated mechanisms or mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012470681">Stame, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389012470681">Weiss, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012470681">Weiss (1998)</xref> described two types of theory – ‘implementation theory’ and ‘programme theory’. The former describes the ‘nuts and bolts’ of the intervention or:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hat is required to translate objectives into ongoing service delivery and programme operation . . . the assumption is that if the activities are conducted as planned, with sufficient quality, intensity and fidelity to plan, the desired results will be forthcoming. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012470681">Weiss, 1998</xref>: 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The latter (programme theory) relates to ‘the responses of the people to programme activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012470681">Weiss, 1998</xref>: 57) or how the programme was expected to effect change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012470681">Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007</xref>). This is more commonly thought of as ‘causal theory’ or as identifying the mechanisms of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). In behavioural psychology such mechanisms are more likely to be referred to as mediators of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012470681">Bauman et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Theory-driven evaluation approaches aim to combine process findings with outcome/impact data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012470681">Connell and Kubisch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012470681">Stame, 2004</xref>) to improve attribution. Inherent in such approaches is the recognition that knowledge is cumulative; that is, learning outcomes are developed across longer-term individual, or multiple, interventions. Hence, such an approach holds that causality is unlikely to be convincingly demonstrated within a single or short-term evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012470681">Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012470681">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012470681">Stame, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389012470681">Weiss, 1995</xref>). This partly explains the need for research to be conducted in a staged manner ensuring learning from each stage is acted on in subsequent refinements of the intervention and associated research studies.</p>
<p>Theory-based approaches often use tools such as logic models or results chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012470681">Connell and Kubisch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012470681">Kellogg Foundation, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012470681">Mayne, 2001</xref>). These methods help to uncover the intervention and/or programme theory and then stakeholders can critique these theories by asking key questions about the programme or applying key criteria to check the validity of the programme assumptions. Such questions focus on the plausibility of the planned interventions (e.g. the evidence-base or logic surrounding the intended activities and their likely reach and levels of participant exposure), the do-ability of the programme (e.g. are there sufficient resources and skilled staff and timescales available to deliver the programme appropriately), and the testability of the programme (the extent to which it is expressed or delivered in a fashion that aids evaluation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012470681">Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012470681">Connell and Kubisch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389012470681">Mackenzie and Blamey, 2005</xref>). We used these tools and criteria when reflecting on the theory underpinning our intervention and our pilot/ feasibility protocol.</p>

<title>West End Walkers 65+ intervention and pilot/feasibility study</title>
<sec id="section4-1356389012470681">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The WEW65+ research project had elements of both a feasibility study and a pilot study. It piloted both the intended activities to be used in the delivery of the intervention and the anticipated research process for a larger scale RCT that would test the efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012470681">1</xref></sup> and effectiveness of increasing walking among low active adults aged ≥65 years through a primary care setting (specifically via a general practice). The intention was to contribute to Scottish policy on the most appropriate settings to promote physical activity as part of the national physical activity strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389012470681">Scottish Executive, 2003</xref>). The pilot/feasibility study was informed by evidence reviews and from previous research using similar intervention tools by the same research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012470681">Fitzsimons et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356389012470681">
<title>Intervention aims and activities</title>
<p>The aim of the WEW65+ intervention<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012470681">2</xref></sup> was to increase walking and reduce sedentary behaviour in adults aged ≥65 years. Participants were intended to incrementally increase their weekly step counts over an eight-week period and sustain these over the subsequent four weeks.</p>
<p>The key elements of the intervention involved a one-to-one, 30-minute physical activity consultation with a practice nurse, the provision of an individualized graduated walking programme with agreed goals for increasing weekly step counts and the provision of a pedometer and step recording tables. It also included an information booklet detailing: the benefits of walking; how to use the pedometer; and, providing information on local walking routes. An optional walking group was provided twice weekly. A second consultation providing relapse prevention strategies was also provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356389012470681">
<title>Research design, methods and tools</title>
<p>The WEW65+ pilot/feasibility study was an RCT with a waiting list control group conducted in one general practice in the West End of Glasgow. Patients aged ≥65 were screened and those already active or with any contraindication to physical activity were excluded. Participants were randomly allocated to the immediate intervention group or the waiting list control after their baseline step assessment using pedometers. Questionnaires were given at baseline and repeated at 12 and 24 weeks.</p>
<p>The intervention group (and 12 weeks later, the waiting list control group) were given the intervention (see details above) and were supplied with a pedometer and activPAL<sup>TM</sup> monitor – a research instrument that measures both sedentary behaviour (lying or sitting) and activity.</p>
<p>Baseline questionnaires gathered data on mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389012470681">Watson et al., 1988</xref>), functional ability (Perceived Motor-Efficacy Scale for Older Adults; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389012470681">Potter et al., 2009</xref>), quality of life (Short-Form [36] Health Survey version 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012470681">Jenkinson et al., 1999</xref>) and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012470681">Russell, 1996</xref>) using previously validated scales and questionnaires.</p>
<p>Those in the control group were asked to continue with their normal physical activity but were then given the intervention 12 weeks after the intervention group.</p>
<p>Two focus groups were conducted post intervention. One included a sub-group of intervention participants and one included consenting participants from the waiting list control group. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research team members on a one-to-one basis. Details of the pilot/feasibility study research protocol are fully explained in a separate paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012470681">MacMillan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389012470681">
<title>Making the intervention and research theory explicit</title>
<p>It is customary for researchers to reflect on existing evidence and associated gaps in this evidence to formulate the rationale for their research endeavours. They then usually scrutinize the literature and known practice to select promising (or develop new) interventions and refine these, if appropriate, before formally testing them via their research. These processes help them to identify both general and specific research questions and inform their research design. Given recent emphasis on the importance of understanding the theory underpinning interventions as part of the research design process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012470681">Craig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012470681">Davidoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012470681">NICE, 2007</xref>) our team took a more formalized approach (than that described above) to reflect on the theory for both our intervention and research protocol. To do this we utilised logic modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012470681">Fulbright–Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012470681">Kellogg Foundation, 2002</xref>) and reflected on the plausibility of the underlying intervention and programme theory as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012470681">Weiss (1998)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section8-1356389012470681">
<title>The logic models produced</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> shows a logic model that illustrates our theory. This model illustrates at a high level both our intervention theory (the nuts and bolts of the intervention) and the programme theory (the postulated causal psychological mechanisms/behaviours) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012470681">Weiss (1998)</xref> for our intervention.</p>

<p>We summarize below our discussions about the plausibility (the evidence from published reviews, our own previous research and tacit experience) that underpinned our theories and assumptions as to why this intervention would achieve its goals of increasing walking and enhancing health in older adults. This explanation of the plausibility of our theory also illustrates why we focused our research specifically on some key questions where there are evidence gaps.</p>

<title>Physical activity improves health?</title>
<p>The long-term outcome shown in box (q) on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> shows our assumption that regular and sustained participation in physical activity can contribute to enhancing population physical and mental health. We assumed that any increase on baseline activity levels would have a positive impact on health for those who were inactive. We believed that this was plausible given the large body of published research that establishes both associated and causal links between regular participation in moderate intensity accumulated physical activity and enhanced health and wellbeing outcomes for individuals and populations. There is evidence to illustrate that regular participation in physical activity can enhance mental health and wellbeing, improve weight maintenance and reduce risks of obesity, and reduce the risk or ameliorate the effects of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012470681">Department of Health, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012470681">Haskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389012470681">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, 67 percent of women and 55 percent of men in Scotland (our ultimate target population) do not reach the minimum levels of activity needed to achieve these health and wellbeing benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012470681">Scottish Government, 2011</xref>). The challenge is therefore how to get greater proportions of the Scottish population participating in physical activity on a regular basis. Key questions that arise are therefore about identifying priority target groups within the wider population and tailoring appropriate modes of activity and methods to support their behaviour change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1356389012470681">
<title>Older people are an appropriate target group?</title>
<p>Physical activity is inversely associated with age and so older adults tend to be less active than their younger counterparts. In Scotland, 83 percent of men and 88 percent of women aged 65 years and over do not achieve 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity on at least five days of the week. The proportion achieving this level of activity decreased with age and was consistently higher in men than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012470681">Scottish Government, 2011</xref>). Given that older adults make up an increasing proportion of our population and many of them suffer from one or more chronic health condition/s that might be prevented or ameliorated via regular physical activity, then adults over 65 form an important target group for physical activity promotion. A more active older population will, it is anticipated, have improved health and wellbeing and be independent for longer. Additionally, this might reduce NHS and social care costs. The following sections consider some of the more specific assumptions that underpinned the intervention theory leading to the interim and the longer-term outcomes in the logic model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1356389012470681">
<title>Walking is appealing as a mode of activity and requires a sufficient energy expenditure/intensity to enhance health outcomes?</title>
<p>An additional assumption that underpinned the long-term outcome in box (q) and the linkages to it from boxes (n), (u) and (p) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> was that walking, if done at a moderate pace and accumulated to ensure 30 minutes (3000 steps) on most days, would lead to health benefits. Our belief in this came from the following sources of evidence that showed that for previously sedentary adults, walking can decrease body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat and resting diastolic blood pressure as well as elicit psychological benefits such as improving mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012470681">Murphy, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356389012470681">
<title>Walking is an appropriate activity mode for older people?</title>
<p>Another assumption that underpinned the interim outcomes in boxes (m), (n), (u) and (p) was that walking would appeal to and be an acceptable/appropriate activity for this target group (adults aged ≥65 years) and one that could be taken up over the short and long term. Again we believed this was plausible because evidence has identified walking as a mode of physical activity that was attractive to, and feasible for, those who are currently low-active or inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012470681">Morris and Hardman, 1997</xref>). It is also a suitable activity for older adults, in particular, as the physical skill, intensity and equipment demands are low, it has minimal risks of injury and it is inexpensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012470681">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). Walking interventions have also been shown to be feasible to develop and deliver in real life scenarios and in a variety of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389012470681">Ogilvie et al., 2007</xref>). However, although such interventions have shown success in terms of increasing walking behaviour in the short term, there is only limited evidence that such changes can be sustained in the longer term (up to and beyond 12 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012470681">Fitzsimons et al., 2008</xref>) and relatively little is known about the success of interventions in different target groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389012470681">Ogilvie et al., 2007</xref>). Given this, a key question to be tested in the pilot/feasibility study, which builds on our previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>), was whether older adults (rather than young to middle-aged adults) can be encouraged to increase their walking and if long-term as well as short-term adherence can be achieved via this activity mode and in this target group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1356389012470681">
<title>Primary care is a suitable setting to access older inactive adults?</title>
<p>Our theory for setting the intervention within general practice was partly about accessing inactive older people. However, this decision was reinforced by the fact that a motivator for physical activity behaviour change may be perceptions of health and health benefits (see section on causal theory, mechanisms and mediators below). These perceptions may seem more salient if behaviour change is sanctioned and encouraged by a health professional and tailored and targeted to our existing abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012470681">Kirk et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1356389012470681">
<title>Sedentary behaviour might be reduced via the intervention?</title>
<p>Evidence suggests that even those who meet recommended levels of physical activity are at risk from major diseases if they also spend substantial periods of time being sedentary (e.g. completely inactive – viewing TV or using computers, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012470681">Healy et al., 2008</xref>). Box (u) in the interim outcomes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that we were anticipating a possible change in sedentary behaviour as a result of the intervention. However, we were unsure of the likely direction of such change. There is limited evidence that physical activity interventions lead to reductions in sedentary behaviour in addition to increasing periods of activity, or whether increased periods of activity might lead to compensatory behaviour where individuals also increase the time that they are sedentary. There is increasing evidence that time spent being sedentary will likely have negative health consequences irrespective of activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012470681">Katzmarzyk et al., 2009</xref>). Given this, and the gaps in evidence about the relationship and direction of any association between physical activity and sedentary behaviour, we were keen to see whether successful or unsuccessful outcomes (in terms of adoption and adherence) to the WEW65+ intervention played any role in reducing or adding to time spent being sedentary.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section16-1356389012470681">
<title>Programme (causal) theory: What psychological mechanisms do we think will be triggered by the intervention or elements of it?</title>
<p>We believed the short-term outcomes shown in boxes (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (l) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> were key mechanisms (or psychological mediators) that if enhanced were likely to lead to increased uptake and/or short- or longer-term adherence to walking and so increased step counts.</p>
<p>The evidence that underpinned these links in our model came from previous research that found correlations between such mediators and physical activity participation. For example, the review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389012470681">Trost et al. (2002)</xref> showed there was a positive association with physical activity for intentions, perceived health, self-motivation, self-efficacy as well as other mediators. The strongest association was for self-efficacy. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012470681">Biddle and Mutrie (2008)</xref>, self-efficacy is situation-specific confidence to undertake a given behaviour, in this case physical activity. Self-efficacy may relate to an individual’s perceptions or thoughts about their competence or ability (e.g. skill or fitness) to be active as well as whether they can do this in terms of other prevailing constraints (time, money, competing demands). The review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389012470681">Trost et al. (2002)</xref> also showed associations between factors such as enjoyment, expected benefits, perceived health, stage of behaviour change and social support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012470681">Biddle et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that a goal orientation/motivation in which an individual is keen to learn from mistakes and from comparisons to their previous performances or competence may also be associated with physical activity participation. However, this work has been mainly conducted on adolescents. Related constructs such as intrinsic motivation and intentions have also been associated with physical activity. Planning how to change your behaviour (deliver on your intentions) and self-monitoring your behaviour in relation to goals and feedback are also associated with physical activity participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012470681">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above evidence, we postulated that these were the likely mechanisms of change that would lead to adoption of walking and adherence to increased step counts among our target participants.</p>
<p>In summary, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012470681">Figure 1</xref> therefore presents a visual picture, at a relatively high level, of how the various intervention activities (boxes [a]–[f]) should lead to the behaviours that trigger some key mediators that in turn should result in increased adoption and adherence to walking. Our discussion and references above present the evidence that makes these theories plausible.</p>
<sec id="section17-1356389012470681">
<title>Which tools will trigger these mechanisms and so should be part of the intervention?</title>
<p>We used the transtheoretical model of physical activity behaviour change to help identify those in an appropriate stage of readiness to consider increasing physical activity (Contemplation and Preparation) and to screen out those in action and maintenance stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389012470681">Loughlan and Mutrie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389012470681">Marcus and Simkin, 1994</xref>). We also used this model to frame the behaviour change components of the consultation. It was our theory that these processes would enhance the effectiveness of the intervention and also reduce drop out from the research study.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a physical activity consultation in the intervention was based on the likely influence of this on the patients’ knowledge of the benefits of activity and enhancing their self-efficacy and motivation through weighing up the pros and cons of increasing activity, setting goals and finding social support. The consultation and the incremental aims of the programmes attempted to enhance skills such as goal-setting and to increase intention to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012470681">Kirk et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, previous research demonstrated that pedometers enhanced uptake and adherence to walking programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389012470681">Troughton et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, pedometers were included in this intervention not only as measures of activity but as an element of the intervention. They provide daily data to participants directly and so offered opportunities for self-monitoring, self-management and feedback on progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389012470681">Troughton et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reflecting on our own previous research emphasized increased social interaction as a possible mediator of uptake and adherence. As a result, we offered participants the opportunity to join a walking group as part of this intervention. This issue was highlighted in our previous WWW research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Theories underpinning the design of the WEW65+ research protocol?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012470681">Figure 2</xref> illustrates how our pilot/feasibility study is part of a longer-term research programme that was intended to lead on to a larger scale trial (see box [m]). Our theory was that this subsequent trial should ideally provide learning to inform whether or not the intervention is efficacious and generalizable within general practice and wider primary care (box l). Subsequent evaluation of such an expansion of the programme would in turn inform policy decisions about further implementation in multiple contexts and settings (boxes [k] and [q]).

<p>Considering the theory behind the research protocol (via the development of the logic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012470681">Figure 2</xref>), as well as the intervention, made us think more carefully about what we meant by terms such as feasibility. These terms are used within the MRC guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012470681">Craig et al., 2008</xref>) and in guidance for researchers provided by funding institutions such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012470681">National Institute for Health Research</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.netscc.ac.uk/glossary/">http://www.netscc.ac.uk/glossary/</ext-link>). This in turn helped us prioritize learning concerned with feasibility as much as efficacy.</p>
<p>The interim outcomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012470681">Figure 3</xref> (boxes [g]–[j]) illustrate that although we were interested at this stage of our research in establishing whether the WEW65+ was effective when delivered to older adults in general practice, we were simultaneously interested in whether the intervention and the research protocol were feasible for both participants and implementers. We were specifically interested in the feasibility of the intervention, the technology and the protocol for the participants. This included: the appropriateness of being approached and offered advice in primary care; the utility of using the transtheoretical model as an identification and screening tool; the acceptability of screening, randomization and the measurement tools/processes; the ease of use of the pedometers; and the response rate from sub-groups and whether this intervention increased inequity (since it was delivered in a relatively affluent area). We were also concerned about feasibility regarding the implementation processes for the deliverers in general practice including the time and training needed to conduct the programme and the impact on their other activities and priorities. These interpretations of the term feasibility are further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012470681">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012470681">Figure 3</xref> is an expansion of the links between the interim and initial longer-term outcomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012470681">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The tables illustrate that much of the theory, evidence and assumptions discussed as a result of our logic modelling and critiquing resulted in confirmation (rather than radical change or refinement) of our outline plans and decisions. However, those areas highlighted in italics were felt to be areas where the more formalized focus on the underlying theory did either clarify, reinforce or refine our decisions. In particular, we felt that the process:</p>
<list id="list4-1356389012470681" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>created a common understanding across the research team about what we understood by feasibility;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>emphasized that our outcomes for this pilot/feasibility study should be about feasibility and short-term to interim efficacy in primary care rather than answering questions about effectiveness and generalizability beyond these parameters.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Our reflections also highlighted that some of our measurement tools were also an active part of the intervention and vice versa (e.g. pedometers and activPAL<sup>TM</sup> ) and emphasized the worth in using high quality but more expensive versions of these tools.</p>
<p>The focus on our understanding of reach and feasibility highlighted further the need to consider whether the pilot/feasibility study would exacerbate or reduce inequalities and the implication of our results for less affluent practices and participants.</p>
<p>The lack of more radical changes on the intervention and research protocols we believe resulted from three main factors. The first is the specialism and experience of the research team and the fact that this pilot/feasibility study was one of a series of related research studies. The second is the degree to which this intervention and its associated intervention tools were (we believe unusually) already deeply influenced by behavioural and psychological theory. The third is a pragmatic issue about the number of questions and outcome measures that it is feasible to include in a small-scale study and the need, due to funding conditions, to focus on efficacy and objective measurement (given the lack of these in many studies). We deal briefly with each of these in turn.</p>
<sec id="section20-1356389012470681">
<title>Research teams experience and expertise</title>
<p>While the intervention was delivered in primary care by a practice nurse, the team involved in designing the pilot/feasibility intervention and conducting the research were predominantly specialists in physical activity for health and sport and exercise psychology. They were experienced researchers and this project was a development from previous similar research studies. Additional multidisciplinary expertise was also available from the wider team within the unit. As such, the team were well informed about the evidence for many of the theories we identified given these underpin their specialist subject areas/professions and the research processes they had used previously.</p>
<p>We postulate then that the use of these tools and our reflection on theory may have led to more changes in the intervention or protocol design had our intervention been less developed, our team less experienced or our topic area less well evidenced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1356389012470681">
<title>The intervention and its tools were (unusually) directly informed by a set of recognized behavioural theories</title>
<p>Our intervention had been designed for a previous study using the most recent physical activity evidence and had been refined in light of the learning from this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012470681">Baker et al., 2008</xref>). The intervention and the associated tools were therefore already deeply influenced by behavioural and psychological theory. For example, the transtheoretical model was used to inform the screening and the nurse consultation and goal-setting, and motivational theory informed the graduated physical activity programme and use of pedometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012470681">Abraham and Michie, 2008</xref>). We suggest that this explicit use of previously tested theory to design both the intervention, select the intervention tools and inform the research protocol is not common. The lack of consistent application of theory in the development and evaluation of interventions is highlighted in the following recommendation produced by NICE for those developing behaviour change programmes. They report that:<disp-quote>
<p>it is important to specify three things with respect to any intervention that aims to change behaviour. First, be as specific as possible about its content. Second, spell out what is done, to whom, in what social and economic context, and in what way. Third, make it clear which underlying theories will help make explicit the key causal links between actions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012470681">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012470681">Pawson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389012470681">Weiss, 1995</xref>). The PDG [programme development group] noted that the evidence is often very weak in these respects. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012470681">NICE, 2007</xref>: 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The strong influence of existing theory on our intervention design may also, therefore, have limited the extent to which our reflections enhanced our initial plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1356389012470681">
<title>Limitations to the number of outcome measures and questions that can be asked</title>
<p>Our reflections emphasized the importance of understanding about issues of implementation and feasibility and highlighted the need to learn more about mechanisms/mediators of change. However, this was a small scale pilot/feasibility study and only a limited amount of outcome measures and questionnaires could in reality be used without overburdening the participants. The intervention had been shown to work for working age adults but undoubtedly part of the reason the study was funded was to test the efficacy in the older population and this required the use of objective measures of behaviour and wellbeing outcomes (such as step counts, sedentary behaviour and general health). The range of measures required for these outcomes included a number of validated scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012470681">Jenkinson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389012470681">Potter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012470681">Russell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389012470681">Watson et al., 1988</xref>) and this meant there was limited space and opportunity to ask many additional questions about the mediators and mechanisms via the pre- and post-questionnaire. While issues about feasibility were included in the staff interview schedule, they were not included to the same degree in the participants’ one. Most of our questions about the success of the mechanisms (e.g. motivation, self-efficacy or self-monitoring) that had been triggered by the consultation or pedometers could also only be addressed in any detail as part of the focus group. The risk of overburdening participants, our reliance on validated outcome tools to judge efficacy, and limited resources, therefore restricted the degree to which our protocol changed to include additional questions on mediators (detailed programme or causal theory). This highlights the fact that, although lessons can be gained through reflection on theory, this does not guarantee that all of these can be acted upon. There may be more opportunity to accommodate questions on these mechanisms of change in a larger trial.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The WEW65+ pilot/feasibility study demonstrated the efficacy of the intervention for older adults. It illustrated that it was feasible to recruit and train older adults in primary care and deliver a walking intervention in this setting. The results from the WEW65+ are presented fully elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389012470681">Mutrie et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of logic models and detailed reflection on the theory underpinning the planned intervention and research protocol clarified, reinforced and refined our initial outline plans.</p>
<p>We suggest that there would have been more significant changes and improvements made to our intervention, protocol and tools as a result of our more detailed reflections on theory had we applied this process to an intervention that had not already been significantly influenced by behaviour change theory and refined by previous research. We suspect that a less experienced research team, those less specialized in behavioural psychology, or researching in a topic area that had a poorer evidence base would gain substantially more from the process outlined in the article.</p>
<p>The article illustrates how researchers, especially those less experienced or who are not specialists in the topic that they are evaluating, can use tools such as logic models to fully explore the intervention, programme and more tacit theories that underpin their interventions and research protocols.</p>
<p>Many agencies and authors rightly call for better use of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012470681">Craig et al., 2008</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012470681">Davidoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012470681">Glasgow et al., 1999</xref>); however, if researches and practitioners are to respond to this they need practical examples of the tools to use and processes by which this can be done. This article is an attempt to address a little of that need.</p>

<p>The authors debated whether to use the term efficacy or effectiveness to describe our WWW 65+ trial. Efficacy refers to testing the impact of a programme in terms of achieving its intended outcome (and doing more good than harm) in optimum conditions whereas effectiveness implies that the intervention’s impact is being tested in ‘real world’ conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012470681">Fritz and Cleland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012470681">Glasgow et al., 2003</xref>). The pilot/feasibility study we undertook, we believe, lies somewhere in the continuum between these two scenarios/terms. It was not delivered in laboratory conditions but neither was it in a typical everyday environment since the trial was set in a purposively selected general practice, was delivered via one general practitioner and one practice nurse who are highly motivated and have been specifically trained to implement their respective elements of the programme, and it is overseen and supported via a specialist research team. Given this, we have used the term efficacy elsewhere in the article. We would anticipate testing effectiveness in a future trial using more typical and real life general practice, primary care or wider delivery settings.</p></fn>
