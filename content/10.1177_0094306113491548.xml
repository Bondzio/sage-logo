<p>The letters contained in these two half-volumes were written by Max Weber during the last several years of his life. The first letter was written on January 5, 1918 and the final one on May 30, 1920, two weeks before his untimely death on June 14, 1920. This collection reveals various aspects of Weber’s <italic>political</italic> concerns, his <italic>academic</italic> interests, and especially his <italic>personal life</italic>. Together they help to complete a picture of a highly complex, and a somewhat conflicted, man.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094306113491548">
<title>Political Concerns</title>
<p>One of Weber’s great loves was politics and he devoted much of his life to it. But one notices a significant change in his later attitude toward it. The contrast in his approach from the beginning of the war to its conclusion is instructive. The volume of the <italic>Max Weber Gesamtausgabe</italic> that contains the political works written from 1914 to 1918 is massive; in contrast, the volume that is devoted to the political writings which followed is considerably smaller. The letters collected here in the first half-volume confirm Weber’s increasing anxiety about the outcome of the war and reveal his decreasing interest in political issues.</p>
<p>In February 1918, Weber was clearly frustrated with the political leadership. He called Berlin a “political insane asylum” and in October of the same year he wrote “I am an opponent of <italic>any</italic> consideration of the stupidity of the political public” (pp. 85 and 279).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491548">1</xref></sup> The source of much of Weber’s agitation was the sheer stupidity and incredible arrogance of many of the political players. Weber held this opinion regarding many members of the old government, but his opinion of the people leading the November “revolution” was equally damning. He believed the so-called “revolution” was nothing more than a “masquerade” and he simply despised its leaders. He singled out the members of the “crazy Liebknecht band” as being “dilettantes” who led an “Ochlokratie” (“rule by the unwashed masses”) (pp. 310, 316–318). He also criticized Kurt Eisner, writing that “He is a demagogue without any <italic>political</italic> conscience” (p. 465). In contrast, Weber maintained that he had real respect for the working man, and he insisted that he was an “optimist” about the long term (pp. 307–308, 320). Yet, in December 1918 he wrote “This ‘revolution’ is a revolting, shabby carnival” and in February 1919 he again referred to the political capital as a “house of fools” (pp. 356, 394, 470). Furthermore, he maintained that anyone who was genuinely interested in politics was bound to be severely disappointed and he concluded simply that “The devil should just take this crazy world” (pp. 356, 470). In early July 1919 he complained that he had been continuously engaged in “politics” and “demagoguery” for the last five years and that he was simply tired of it (p. 672). A month later he wrote that “I do not want to write anything about politics. I have rejected <italic>all</italic> requests having to do with it” (p. 711). In early January 1920 he wrote: “I stand further away from politics and so long as I live I will have nothing to do with it: I am <italic>finished (‘basta’)</italic> with it” (p. 878). Three weeks later he insisted “If I were still participating in politics I would certainly use every power on earth, and even work with the devil, to restore Germany to its old position of glory—only <italic>not</italic> with the power of <italic>stupidity</italic>” (p. 912). Weber was a political realist and he recognized that politics was not for the faint-hearted, but he could not stand the immense stupidity and the outright insanity that seemed to plague German politics. In that same letter he wrote the “craziness from both the left and the right” made it impossible for him to engage in politics. There are, however, two further reasons why Weber retreated from politics: first, because he unsuccessfully sought candidacy, a situation about which he remained rather quiet, and second, as he wrote toward the end of his life, “The politician should and <italic>must</italic> make compromises.” He added, a “scholar <italic>may</italic> not make compromises and he <italic>cannot ‘gloss over’ ‘nonsense’</italic>.” “But, I am by profession (‘Beruf’) a <italic>scholar</italic>” (p. 986).</p>

<title>Academic Interests</title>
<p>By late 1918, Weber recognized not only that Germany was losing the war but that his financial situation would worsen rapidly. He also realized that there would be a struggle even for bread and that not much would be left over for a scholar. He wrote: “‘Inwardly’ it is more difficult because my inner ‘vocation’ (‘Beruf’) is: scholarly work and scholarly teaching. And the nation does not now need that” (p. 253). Nonetheless, he started entertaining the idea of returning to teaching and when the opportunity arose to teach in Vienna, he agreed. While he evidently was looking forward to his “Viennese experiment,” his letters of resignation to Heidelberg University have a note of finality and regret.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094306113491548">2</xref></sup> Weber had mixed opinions about his time in Vienna: he complained about the numerous meetings and the inefficient bureaucracy. He was exasperated by the late payments: “And <italic>still</italic> these guys (‘Kerle’) have not paid me my money—this shoddiness (‘Schlamperei’) truly stinks to heaven!” (p. 135). He complained of endless visits and having no time to write. He wrote that “I am still a scholar but unfortunately on health grounds <italic>no</italic> longer a teacher.” In a May letter to his wife Marianne he wrote that “I am born for the pen and for the speaker’s platform, but not for the lectern.” However, he happily admitted that “The students are rightly attentive and there is nothing there to complain about” (pp. 157–158, 166). His lecture in June on “socialism” was extremely well received, but he insisted that teaching was too demanding (pp. 195–202). Weber turned down an offer for a full-time position and counted the days until he could return to Heidelberg (pp. 161, 187, 227).</p>
<p>Despite his antipathy toward politics, Weber became even more interested in the notion of the state. There was considerable discussion of Weber teaching a course at Heidelberg on the doctrine of the state (“Staatslehre”) for the summer of 1919, but that fell through (pp. 219, 267). In the spring of 1919 a number of universities expressed interest in hiring Weber, but his choice really came down to two: Bonn and Munich. Bonn was attractive because he was offered the chair in “Staatslehre” but he accepted Munich for several reasons. One was the teaching and another was personal—Else Jaffé. However, Weber confessed to Hermann Onken that “I unhappily go to Munich, I would have rather gone to Bonn.” Most telling, he added “I would have liked the best to remain here [Heidelberg] but that was financially impossible” (p. 542).</p>
<p>In his June 1919 letter to the Baden Ministry of Culture and Education, Weber announced that he had accepted the Social Science (“Gesellschaftswissenschaft”) professorship in Munich and was resigning his position in the Baden academic body. He wrote to Mina Tobler that he would soon become a “full-fledged Bavarian” (pp. 633, 637). In late June he began his lecture course on “social science.” In a letter to Marianne he wrote how he spoke “abstractly and purely conceptual” but that the students were obviously pleased. His complaint was it was physically draining but he almost always seemed to have a high regard for his many, many students: “The students are nice and eager, only too <italic>many</italic>” (p. 679). Nonetheless, he was already looking forward to the winter semester when he would give the course on economic history (“Wirtschaftsgeschichte”) (p. 663). When he began that course in late October 1919, he had over 500 students (p. 824). He often complained of felling unwell, but there were times when he was really ill. In March and in April he complained of being “<italic>really</italic> sick”—sometimes it was the flu (p. 1015). He was, however, preparing for the summer semester course on “Staatslehre”—if for no other reason than he needed to make sure that the students recognized that the “subjectively <italic>meant</italic> sense of action” was the <italic>individual</italic>. This was in a late April letter to Heinrich Rickert, but Weber had made the same point in a lengthy letter to Robert Liefmann. Weber was against any use of “collective concepts” (“Kollektivbegriffen”) (pp. 1040, 946–947). In a letter to Marianne from June 1919 Weber talked about his projects and he seemed resigned to the need to teach: “I <italic>am</italic> still a man of the <italic>pen, not</italic> the lectern. But, what must be, must be” (p. 667).</p>
<p>Weber was not only occupied with teaching, he was also trying to finish a number of projects. One was revising the <italic>Protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus</italic> but he complained that the revision was arduous and was taking too long (pp. 685, 734, 768). Once finished with that, he promised to return to work on his massive project, the <italic>Grundriss der Sozialökonomik.</italic> The project was now almost ten years old and he continued to have problems in getting people to complete their contributions, but his biggest problem was writing and revising his own piece—<italic>Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.</italic> In late September 1919 he promised the publisher Siebeck that he would be sending its first part “very soon” (pp. 786, 789). Yet, the next month he complained that “The lecture course is really exhausting and hinders <italic>steady</italic> work; only with Christmas can I really get back to work.” And, he confessed that “The thick <italic>old</italic> manuscript must fundamentally be reworked” (p. 826). Weber completed the first part of <italic>Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft</italic> in March of 1920 and then spent April and May correcting page proofs (pp. 1079, 1086). Weber sent his second to last letter (May 23) to Karl Jaspers in which he thanked Jaspers for the second edition of his <italic>Allgemeine Psychopathologie</italic> and noted that he cited it in <italic>Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.</italic> He added “I can ‘read’ first in August.” Weber’s last letter was to Paul Siebeck and he asked his publisher to decide how he wanted to print his “<italic>Relgionssoziologie</italic>.” Weber ended that letter by saying “<italic>any</italic> solution is equally right to me” (pp. 1101–1102).</p>
<sec id="section3-0094306113491548">
<title>Personal Life</title>
<p>This collection of letters serves to confirm and clarify Weber’s political concerns and his academic interests, but they also serve to reveal an intensely personal side of Weber. Weber monitored the health of his mother quite closely. In 1919 she was 75 and was no longer able to maintain the family home. She sold that and moved to an apartment close by. Weber was worried about the difficulties she had climbing up the four flights of steps and he was concerned about her living alone. In March, she appeared to be better than before, but during the late spring and throughout the summer she seemed weak and frail. Finally, on October 14 she died; at first it seemed as if her death was relatively peaceful but that later turned out not to be the case. What was clear was that her death was a great personal blow to Max: he not only mourned her passing but he believed that “There is a little less love in the world” (p. 814). In some later letters to Marianne he wrote that he “saw and spoke” with his dead mother (p. 1031). Weber’s sister Lili committed suicide around Easter 1920; Weber recognized the financial and personal problems that she was trying to deal with and he spoke of her heroic fight. He appreciated Marianne’s willingness to take on the responsibility for Lili’s four children and spoke with pride on becoming a “father” at the age of 56 (pp. 981, 1073).</p>
<p>The biggest “surprise” from these letters is that they reveal Weber’s infatuation with Else Jaffé. This relationship appears to have begun in December of 1918 and seems to have continued until Weber’s death. They reveal Weber to be a rather undisciplined man who referred to “Golden Else” as his strong and dominating “Mistress.” She “possessed irresistible magic” and drove him with her force (p. 407, 579). He often sounded like a schoolboy: “I greet the young day in thoughts about you.” When he did not receive a letter from her he complained that “you punish me <italic>severely</italic>.” He pled with her: “See, I am well-behaved because you want that” (pp. 763, 774, 776). Occasionally, Weber seemed to realize how immature he must appear: “the dumb note from yesterday was really a school-boy product” (p. 585). Many of these letters are disconcerting, because they do not appear to match the picture many of us have of Weber: the Old-Testament-like prophet, the lonely ascetic, and the self-disciplined medieval knight. This is the picture that Marianne painted for us in her biography, <italic>Max Weber. Ein Lebensbild</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491548">1926</xref>). What is curious about these letters is that Marianne seems to have faded into the background. His letters to her lack the warmth and tenderness compared with those to Else and even those to Mina Tobler; but occasionally Weber writes about how his life in Heidelberg with Marianne was so special. We know from Marianne’s book how much she loved and admired her husband, but there is no way to know how Else felt about him because her letters to him have disappeared. What we do know is, like Marianne, Else was “deeply shaken” by Weber’s death (pp. 33–34).</p>
<p>The editors also provide a short account of Weber’s last days and death: he fell ill on June 4 and had a high fever. On June 5 the doctor pronounced that Weber suffered from a bronchial infection and predicted a speedy recovery. Sunday, June 7 was an election day; Marianne participated while Max stayed home. His lectures were cancelled for Monday, June 8, and for a few days he seemed to be improving. Then during the night of June 11 he suffered his first “collapse,” which was followed by the second and final one on June 14. “Eleven days after becoming ill Max Weber was dead” (p. 38). We are left to figure out who this great man really was.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491548">1975</xref> Friedrich Tenbruck published an essay in which he asked “How well do we know Max Weber?” and he answered, “not very well” (1999: 99–122). Tenbruck wrote his essay before the first volume of the <italic>Max Weber Gesamtausgabe</italic> appeared. Now, after the publication of more than thirty volumes we know Max Weber better. It is because of these letters from Weber’s last years that we have a more complete picture of the man in all of his complexities. While these letters raise some questions about his personal life, there is no question that they help us to better understand Max Weber.</p>
