<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the issue of how children and young people are constructed and governed in Finland’s crime prevention and securitizing programmes and projects. The analysed data consists of abstracts and appraisals of 88 local securitizing programs. The results of the analysis suggest that, in many ways, the programmes reflect a post-recession situation in Finnish society. Children and young people are dominantly positioned as ‘risks’ or as ‘exposed to risks’ and the goals and means of the programmes are connected with intensifying their control. The results suggest that the status of security speech and crime prevention technologies within the entity of governing childhood and youth require critical consideration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>International discussion on governing child and youth populations suggests a wide scale shift in many nation states during the past decades. In general, changes in the public debate and the political climate, neoliberal economic governance, the mobilization of new public management and risk-oriented tactics and technologies in the public sector are illustrative of many characteristics of a late modern era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212474734">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212474734">Parton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212474734">Young 2007</xref>). Such shifts have made significant impact on modes of governing children and young people (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212474734">James and James, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212474734">Muncie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1365480212474734">Scraton, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This article addresses the question of how children and the young are governed, and more specifically, how childhood and youth are constructed in Finland’s crime prevention and securitizing programmes and projects. Utilizing the concept of governance, I refer to the ‘conduct of conducting’, actions and measures aimed at forming, controlling and directing citizen’s behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212474734">Dean, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the regime of governance, which refers to a strategic formation of political governing – dispositive – is to be understood as a historically specific way of governing directed at certain population groups that then marks their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212474734">Foucault, 1980</xref>). The ethos of governance is connected with the ways of justifying and arguing for the status and measures within a certain regime. Studies of governance have a particular interest in the processes of producing and formulating reality that create space for implementing a certain type of political programme or rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212474734">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To answer the question of how we govern and are governed within different regimes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212474734">Mitchell Dean (1999)</xref> suggests four significant dimensions for exploration. First, the characteristic <italic>forms of visibility, ways of seeing and perceiving</italic> require analysis. Second, the <italic>distinctive ways of thinking and questioning, relying on definite vocabularies and procedures for the production of truth</italic> (those derived from the social, human and behavioural sciences) should be considered. Third, the <italic>specific ways of acting, intervening and directing, made up of particular types of practical rationality</italic> (expertise and know-how) that rely <italic>upon definite mechanisms, techniques and technologies</italic> should be analysed. Fourth, it is necessary to identify how <italic>subjects, selves, persons, actors or agents</italic> are formed. Dean stresses that the axes of visibilities, knowledge, techniques and practices, and identities are co-existent within each regime of practices, each constituting a line of continual transformation and variation. The regimes of practices can be identified whenever the relatively stable correlations of visibilities, mentalities, technologies and agencies exist. They constitute the taken-for granted points of reference for all forms of problematization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212474734">Dean, 1999</xref>: 23–27).</p>
<p>Based on Dean’s exploratory dimensions, this article addresses three explicit research questions. Firstly, to what extent are children and young people taken into consideration in crime prevention and securitization programmes? This task explores the status of minors among other citizen groups in the programmes and projects. Secondly, how are children and young people viewed in the programmes, in other words, what types of generational orders and positions do these programmes construct? Finally, what types of tactics and technologies of governing emerge from the programmes?</p>
<p>This article is structured as follows. Firstly, the societal context and the background of the empirical analysis will be presented. Secondly, the emergence of the Finnish national securitizing programme will be described. The descriptions illustrate the types of subjects, tactics, and technologies that are constructed in the programmes. Thirdly, the focus shifts to the local level and analyses how the child population is addressed in programmes and the key themes, representations, positions, and technologies presented in the local programmes is explored. Finally, the results of the empirical analysis are theorized and connected to the societal context. The results are discussed in relation to international, regional and national developments.</p>

<title>Contextualization, International Convergence, Nordic Policies and the Finnish Transformation</title>
<p>Several international analyses of criminal justice and social policy have revealed an increased focus on children and young people during the past decades. One of the key characteristics of the recent interest has been a new <italic>concerned tone</italic>, even with signs of moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212474734">Finn and Nybell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212474734">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1365480212474734">Scraton, 2008</xref>). This type of public interest originates from the turn of social policy in the US and UK in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to a punitive turn in youth crime policy, to the rise of the risk agenda and, in general, to the intensification of formal social control towards children, young people and families with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212474734">Butler and Dreyfus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212474734">Butts and Mears, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212474734">Hood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212474734">James and James, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1365480212474734">Kempf-Leonard and Peterson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212474734">Lister, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212474734">Muncie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1365480212474734">Trépanier, 1999</xref>). Moreover, the described transformation has expanded into a wide-scale international phenomenon, albeit one that varies from one state to another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212474734">Gendrot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212474734">Junger-Tas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212474734">Muncie and Goldson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212474734">O’Donnell and O’Sullivan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1365480212474734">Smandych, 2006</xref>). Various writers have suggested that increasing public anxiety and the intensifying of control could indicate larger-scale cultural transformations or even reflect an irreversible movement in the deep structure of Western societies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212474734">Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212474734">Giddens, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212474734">Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212474734">Parton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212474734">Young 2007</xref>). However, these propositions tend to be moderate. In many ways, scholars prefer speaking about the convergence of international influence and the homogenization of discourse instead of large-scale cultural change.</p>
<p>The above developments have also touched the Nordic welfare states. However, within social policy studies the Nordic states still enjoy a common reputation as social democratic welfare regimes, in which each state accepts primary responsibility for ensuring the welfare and social security of its citizens, including children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212474734">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212474734">Therborn, 1993</xref>). Since its inception, the underlying idea of Nordic child welfare policy has been the structural prevention of social problems and shared social responsibility for children’s well-being and equality. This policy was designed to deliver a comprehensive system of state subsidies and universal social services for preventing complex social problems in families with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212474734">Eydal and Satka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212474734">Satka et al., 2007</xref>).Nordic states are also generally perceived as applying humane and rational criminal justice policies; as states where criminal justice and social welfare systems are strictly separated; where social welfare measures are preferred; and where the principles of minimum intervention and avoiding stigma are given priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008b</xref>). One distinctive feature of the Nordic ‘welfarist’ youth crime model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212474734">Pratt, 2002</xref>) is the local child welfare board. In the Nordic model, issues, which are processed by juvenile courts in several other countries, are dealt with by these boards through a child welfare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, current Finnish studies suggest that these Nordic principles and practices of governance have significantly changed over the past twenty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1365480212474734">Satka et al., 2011</xref>). The early-1990s was an exceptional period in the Nordic states and brought about a significant turning-point in their welfare regimes, including child policy. All the states, Finland included, went through an unprecedented, deep economic recession. Finland endured a banking crisis followed by marked changes in the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212474734">Satka et al., 2007</xref>). The strengthening of neoliberal ideologies, especially in economic discourse and the import of neoliberal governance and managerialism began to undermine the Nordic welfare state model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212474734">Satka et al., 2007</xref>). Due to significant shifts in the socio-economic and political spheres, Nordic welfare policy was challenged and child and family policy, in particular, was taken in a new direction.</p>
<p>The post-recession years of child and family policy could be characterized as the era of political conservative backlash, public concern and moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212474734">Jallinoja, 2006</xref>). A sense of insecurity has permeated the whole of Finnish society, conditioning the public debate to pay increasing attention to the malaise of children, young people and families with children. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008a</xref>: 34–63). The principles of traditional welfare policy, such as the structural prevention of social problems by raising income for families with children and widening the scope of universal social services, were challenged through the emphasis and presumption of scarce public economic resources, leading to more ‘hot-spot’- and ‘risk’-oriented policies. New impulses, discourses and technologies, many of them of Anglo-American origin, were adopted and introduced into child policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212474734">Satka and Harrikari, 2008</xref>). One of the key mechanisms for diffusing such processes was the National Crime Prevention Programme ‘Working Together for a Safe Society’, which led to the formulation of a number of local crime prevention and securitization programmes and projects throughout Finland.</p>

<title>‘Working Together for a Safe Society’: The National Crime Prevention Programme</title>
<p>The Council of State of Finland took a decision in principle to formulate a national crime prevention programme on 4 March 1999. The programme was designed to create ‘a common policy for action on the prevention of crime and in the promotion of security, so that the impact of the measures on crime would be taken into consideration in all public decision-making’. The stated goal was that ‘not only the State but also municipalities, the business community, the Church, civic organizations and private individuals would participate in crime prevention in a more purposeful and active manner’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: I). The measures that the six governmental ministries, municipalities, business communities and the other parties were obliged to take, were listed in the programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212474734">Tt, 2003</xref>: 6–7).</p>
<p>The national programme became a model for local crime prevention programmes and was used to draft a crime prevention programme for each and every municipality. A great number of programmes have been compiled.In 2002, 316 municipalities had published their programme and by the end of 2003, nearly all the municipalities in Finland had formulated a programme. Many textual forms of the national programme were directly plagiarized in the local programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212474734">Virta, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The police had a specific responsibility of ensuring that local networks for securitization would be formed. The recommended minimum practice was that ‘municipalities undertake cooperation between the school, youth work, social welfare and the police in the prevention of youth crime and anti-social behaviour by children and the young’. One of the five specific developmental fields consisted of the prevention of the marginalization of children and young people, and intervening in the crime cycle of young people according to the principles of early intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212474734">Tt, 2003</xref>: 3–4).</p>
<p>The National Crime Prevention Council, connected with the Ministry of Justice, has allocated financial support for the local projects directed at decreasing crime and increasing safety. Eighty-eight projects were subsidized by the end of 2004. The data underpinning this article consists of the abstracts from, and the appraisal of these programmes and projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1365480212474734">
<title>Children and Young People in the National Crime Prevention Programme</title>
<p>‘Working Together for a Safe Society’ introduced a wide variety of measures directed at reducing criminality and promoting safety, through both governmental and private initiatives. Three key tactics were suggested. Firstly, the policy for action consisted of ‘measures designed to decrease suitable opportunities for crime’. Secondly, it consisted of ‘measures designed to prevent the development of some individuals into offenders, for example by targeting criminogenic risk factors connected with childhood or by supporting young people in danger of marginalization’. Thirdly, the policy consisted of measures designed to ‘interrupt a developing criminal career at as early a stage as possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>With respect to children and young people, the ‘criminal classes’ were seen to form a future threat:‘there is the danger in Finland that a large sector of the population will remain permanently outside of working life and other systems that provide the individual with a stake in lawful society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 3). Measures directed at children and young people were represented according to administrative fields, but the common approach adopted was one of early intervention directed at criminogenic risk factors to prevent crime. The programme suggested that factors such as ‘a poor home environment’, ‘having parents who are alcoholics’ or ‘who have poor parental skills’, ‘being abused as a child’ and ‘difficulties in concentrating while at school’ could be identified already at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 4–5).</p>
<p>Along with a shared early interventionist orientation, a particular selection of measures suited for a crime prevention and securitizing context was named for each administrative sector. Another general principle consisted of coordinating and intensifying cooperation between the police and all other authorities. This kind of politics of reacting can be detected best within the field of social and health policy. The programme suggests that:<disp-quote>
<p>A well-functioning system of child welfare services is in itself an important way of preventing crime. Deficiencies in the growing up environment can generally be identified at an early stage, and they usually come to the attention of a variety of practitioners. Even though the Child Welfare Act clearly stipulates that all authorities are obliged to report any need of child welfare to the child welfare authorities, and also others have the right to do so, there are difficulties in the flow of information. Supportive action is needed, action where the threshold for intervention is low, and which does not label the persons in question. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, it was suggested that criminogenic risk factors leading to a criminal career should be reacted to by ‘early intervention activities’. With respect to the risk agenda, the presentation of the programme could be characterized as moderate while proposing that ‘supportive action’ should not lead to ‘labelling’. This statement could rather be connected to the traditional Nordic welfare ethos than to the new type of risk discourse and politics. Moreover, the way of thinking and the status of child protection could be enclosed in the welfare belief system where ‘promoting social politics’ is believed to be ‘the best criminal policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212474734">Lahti, 2000</xref>). However, a key question remains: to what extent does a programme of crime prevention – drafted in the field of the Ministry of Justice – merge child protection as ‘the working means of crime prevention’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474734">Case, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212474734">Garrett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212474734">Goldson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the field of educational policy, the programme highlighted school as ‘a place for growth, and not just for the transmission of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 21–22). In addition to this general guideline, three specific issues were highlighted. Firstly, the programme suggested that the ‘techniques for the management and control of the class environment’ and the ability to ‘identify and support children and young people going through the difficult phases of life’ should be a key part of the training of teachers. Secondly, the programme proposed efforts for developing school into an activity centre that is supported by clubs and that is open throughout the entire day to decrease the time the children are alone, especially in the afternoon, as children were not believed to achieve ‘a safe and stimulating growing environment’ without parental support and control (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212474734">Forsberg and Strandell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212474734">Jallinoja, 2006</xref>: 131–154). Thirdly, and related to ‘school discipline’, the programme suggested that schools should have well-thought-out rules, adherence to rules should be promoted by agreeing on them together as far as possible and there should be a consistent response to any violation of the rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 21–22).</p>
<p>In general, within the field of youth policy, the programme was connected with the conditions of the risk regime and the Finnish post-recession societal situation. Whereas improving the conditions of civic activity of the whole youth population – including, for example, the voluntary nature of youth activity, increasing municipal youth work activities and building youth clubs – were highlighted, risk politics focused on young people deemed to be on the margins. In this ‘hot-spot’ politics <italic>children and the young in danger of marginalization</italic> were positioned as the target of youth policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 23–24). In other words, those youth defined as ‘winners’ are no longer the focus of youth policy. The target group is clearly narrowed, supported by arguments related to societal transformative factors. For example, general proposals for action regarding youth un/employment were not suggested, instead advocating ‘job trainee programmes’ for ‘the youth in danger of marginalization’ and ‘special youth work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 23–24).</p>
<p>The programme also paid attention to ‘the parent’s responsibility in raising children’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212474734">Goldson and Jamieson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1365480212474734">Walters and Woodward, 2007</xref>). ‘Neglecting one’s responsibilities in raising a child’ and a ‘conflicting approach to child-rearing’ would have an influence on whether or not a child begins to commit crimes. ‘Parents should bear their responsibility in raising their children, and not relinquish it to their children’, the programme highlighted. In addition, the programme focused on ‘municipal child guidance and family guidance services as well as services provided by the parishes and certain associations available as support to parents’, ‘increasing the time that parents and children share together’ and organizing ‘adult male role models’ for ‘the single-parent household boys’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 41–42).</p>
<p>Thus, the discourses of the national programme refer both to elements of traditional welfare policy and to a new risk politics. Neither of them have materialized undiluted in the programme corpus. However, the characteristics of the new conservative risk- and control-oriented agendas are evident. Despite stressing civic activities as an extension of welfare policy, particular children and young people are viewed as ‘at-risk’ or ‘in danger of marginalization’. A risk lens appraises them as a societal threat; a potential ‘criminal class’. In general, the key goal of the programme seems to be intensifying the control and supervision of children and young people not only at the institutional level and in formal practices, but also in informal and everyday face-to-face interaction and arrangements.</p>

<title>Children and Young People in the Local Crime Prevention Programmes</title>
<p>Children and young people have been the most popular target of local securitization programmes. By the end of 2003, 46 per cent of the local programmes funded by the National Crime Prevention Council were exclusively directed towards the young. Similarly, by the end of 2004, of the 88 projects informing this article, half were exclusively focused on the young, and two-thirds were directed – in one way or another – towards increasing local security by decreasing the criminal or anti-social behaviour of minors. The problems of the young (unemployment, drugs, marginalization, recruiting to criminal career) and problems connected with the young (selling cigarettes and beer to them, shoplifting and school discipline) were included in nearly all of the local programmes. The targets of crime prevention included antisocial behaviour (78%), drug crimes and intoxicant use and reducing school bullying, school violence and vandalism (66 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212474734">Tt, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the key aims in the national programme was the activation and intensification of local securitization work. Cooperation between the police and other authorities was particularly highlighted alongside encouraging citizens to become more actively involved with securitization initiatives. The most common forms of activities included establishing common rules between parents, parental patrol of streets at night and the establishment of night-time cafes. Furthermore, some municipalities connected their local programme with a communitarian civic movement of educational projects called ‘it takes the whole village to raise a child’, in which conservative generational orders were confirmed, children were placed under adult control and early and direct intervention towards bad manners and anti-social behaviour were legitimated.</p>

<title>Positioning, Tactics and Technologies in Local Securitization Programmes</title>
<p>The examples below illustrate the ways in which children and the young are positioned in local programmes:<disp-quote>
<p>The aim of the project is to develop a procedural model, in which children at-risk, suffering from learning disabilities, could be caught up at an early stage and moved on to the circle of rehabilitation (Rikoskierre poikki, Hämeenkyrö-Ikaalinen).</p>
<p>The target group of the project included 10–17year-old young people, young people who had committed an offence for the first time, and especially those who had dropped out of school and those in danger of marginalization (Missä mennään– rikoksentorjuntahanke, Jämsä).</p>
<p>The aims of the project were rearing children to become responsible, honest and venturous adults, highlighting the importance of and complying with the principles of legal and health education among the young and their parents, and intervening strictly in shoplifting, vandalism, bullying and all forms of violence (Koko kyläkasvattaa, Vantaa).</p>
<p>The aim of the model (Together towards life) is to support proper parenthood and interfere in shoplifting, intoxicant use and school bullying…. A working group consisting of parents and authorities will write the guidelines (Nuorisoturvallisuus, Kangasniemi).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first example addresses learning disabilities that could be considered one of the traditional welfare themes. However, disability is now ‘securitized’. Children with learning disabilities are now defined as a ‘risk group’ and clearly the aim is to promote early intervention. The second example positions children ‘in danger of marginalization’. The third example implies that the aim is to properly ‘rear’ future generations. Children and the young are positioned as ‘becoming’ future citizens. The fourth example illustrates how adults are the key actors in the programmes. Children and the young are the targets of their activity. Adults are divided into parents and authorities. Furthermore, parents are divided into those who need support in their parenthood (at risk) and those who are active and work within parental groups (good parents). It seems that the latter group of parents consists of middle-class parents (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212474734">Jallinoja, 2006</xref>: 160–180) who also work with local authorities to control ‘families at-risk’. Children and young people are positioned as ‘intoxicant-users’, ‘shoplifters’ and ‘school bullies’. In essence, three key tactics are advocated and mobilized.</p>
<sec id="section7-1365480212474734">
<title>The first tactic: Investing in parenthood</title>
<p>The first securitization tactic is supporting and strengthening parenthood to increase parental responsibility by employing two techniques. On the one hand, authorities activate and wake up parents to ‘bear their responsibility’ or to ‘come out and see what their children are up to on a Friday night’:<disp-quote>
<p>Increasing parental responsibility. We started up a cooperative work with parents, and as a result, the shared guidelines regarding curfews, providing intoxicants, informing of thefts and the lowest age to get in to a disco were formulated. The rules were reported by the local media and discussions were held in parental meetings….While visiting parental meetings parents were exhorted to bear their responsibility on preventing intoxicant use. ‘Is your child drunk on Friday nights?’brochure was delivered to the parents. The local newspaper published notices for parents, in which they were reminded of their responsibilities (Yhdessä elämään, Jämsä).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other technique places less responsibility on local authorities and more on strengthening parental involvement and reciprocal control. Technologies based on this principle included establishing autonomous parental groups and parental street patrolling:<disp-quote>
<p>Establishing a voluntary adult group to support young people and cooperate with hosts, vigilantes and the police at bright lights and the immediate surroundings during the weekends (Peräänkatsojaryhmä, Alavus).</p>
<p>We realized that we have to contact parents to cooperate with the authorities… 60 parents enrolled in parental activities and they formed groups around different themes; 20–30 of them were active until the groups ended working. Parents visited a youth club. Street patrolling during the weekend when school is over (Kimppakyyti-hanke, Sysmä).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Supporting parenthood’ and ‘increasing parental responsibility’seem to tactics for the intensification of control. The aims include 1) intensifying control over the parents, 2) intensifying reciprocal control between the parents and 3) strengthening the parents’ self-control; key features of conservative politics. The legitimating discourse for activating parents is one of a moral imperative, where responsibility is returned to the parents (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212474734">Goldson and Jamieson, 2002</xref>). The underlying rationale also consists of reducing public expense and promoting communitarian ideas about a generalized lack and thereby the need to exercise greater control over children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1365480212474734">
<title>The second tactic: Early and direct intervention</title>
<p>The tactic of direct and early intervention, based on a shared ‘ethos of interference’ aims at intensifying control over children and young people. The principle of early intervention in the local programmes is connected with ‘preventing criminal careers’ and in the national programme with identifying and addressing ‘individual risk factors’. Along with early ‘intervention’, an expression of early ‘detection’ emerges:<disp-quote>
<p>The aim of the project is to evoke crime prevention programme in Nurmijärvi. – – The project will continue further as the project of early detection and intervention, and all the administrative fields addressing the issues of children and young people will be concerned – – (Rikoksentorjuntaohjelma, Nurmijärvi).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, early intervention manifests itself as an inseparable part of governing ‘risk groups’ and those in ‘danger of marginalization’. The implicit basis of the local programmes suggests that early intervention is directed exclusively at children and young people. The concept of ‘direct’also emerges alongside ‘early’:<disp-quote>
<p>Procedural models, in which children’s and young people’s crimes are directly intervened in will be established and introduced. The goal is to prevent and reduce youth crimes and consequential harms (Varhaisen ja kokonaisvaltaisen puuttumisen malli, Lahti).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tactic of early and direct intervention is implemented by technologies connected with temporal and spatial contexts. One of the technologies is designed to increase authority control over young people by street patrolling during night-time hours. Different ‘tones’ are evident in this activity. A repressive-tone places the police as the key actor:<disp-quote>
<p>The police started up clamping down young people’s intoxicant use on Friday evenings and intervened in the minors’ alcohol offences more effectively. Young people who committed these offences were fined and their parents were obliged to fetch them from the police station (Yhdessäelämään, Jämsä).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whereas a more benign tone is mobilized with regard to night-time cafés that are, all the same, connected with street patrolling. Here the key actors are youth workers and volunteers from local NGOs:<disp-quote>
<p>Adult volunteers, youth workers both from the municipality and the church are working in the café and there will always be four adults at the same time. There are also 17 volunteers in the street patrol ‘Rukkanen’ (Yhteistyön luominen ja vahvistaminen paikallisessa rikoksentorjunnassa, Mäntsälä).</p>
<p>The guidance of volunteer adults for the young was delivered in the context of weekly night-time café evenings. Adults started up a small-scale street patrolling activity connected with Friday evenings in the past autumn. The goal was to find those young people who did not participate in night-time café, or any other controlled activity but spent their time by drifting (Illastus-projekti, Taipalsaari).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to street patrolling and night-time café activities, several local projects were designed to increase coordination and mutual understanding between local actors to respond to shoplifting:<disp-quote>
<p>The goal is formulating an operational model in cooperation with the entrepreneurs and authorities in Heinola to intervene in shoplifting as soon as possible (Näppis-projekti, Heinola).</p>
<p>In our meeting with entrepreneurs, we decided to intervene in all the shopliftings (Kimppakyyti-hanke, Sysmä).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parallel to street patrolling, control activities over shoplifting are exclusively directed at children and young people. Such selective targeting appears driven by two assumptions. The first lies in the ‘broken windows’-thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1365480212474734">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>), in which direct reaction to minor offences is believed to prevent serious offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474734">WTSS, 1999</xref>: 14–15). The second connects shoplifting as an offence typical of children over ten years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212474734">Salmi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Procedural models for shoplifting cases are part of a wider repertoire of programmes aimed at intensifying intervention. They are a part of ‘multi-professional authority cooperation’ which ensures that securitization permeates all administrative fields:<disp-quote>
<p>The project starts up multi-professional cooperation that aims at establishing and implementing operational models for early intervention scattering the whole economic region. The means of early intervention aim at preventing young people’s antisocial behaviour, youth crimes and their ramifications(Turvallisuus tavaksi – varhainen puuttuminen, Riihimäki).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Along with actual practices, one salient goal of multi-professional cooperation is to produce a shared reality and moral ethos based on crime prevention and securitization discourses. This intention – reflecting the economic and ontological starting points of the new agendas – has increased trust between professions and intensified collaboration. However, the forums of multi-professional cooperation also open spaces of conflict and rivalry where the dominant professions and discourses can be seen to undermine the weaker ones. Thus, the formulating processes underpinning the programmes serve to strengthen the power of the police and invoke a crime problem perspective – in everyday child and youth practices. In this way the police have been able to bind up other professions, such as social work, to promote their own professional goals in Finnish practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212474734">Harrikari and Pekkarinen 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212474734">Heino et al, 2005</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212474734">Garrett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1365480212474734">Souhami, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1365480212474734">
<title>The third tactic: Increasing self-control</title>
<p>The third tactic of the securitization programmes consists of promoting young people’s own self-control. Related to this is the establishment of ‘common rules’, aimed at compelling minors to comply with particular forms of action:<disp-quote>
<p>The young formulated agreements on non-shoplifting and a plan of action with entrepreneurs in case shopliftings emerge despite the agreement(Nuorten rikostorjuntaa Laukaan taajamissa, Laukaa).</p>
<p>The goal of the project is teaching manners, regarding teaching as a shared responsibility over public property, accustoming the young to behaving according to the rules and creating possibilities for acting properly in public places (Fiilistälakeuspuistosta, Seinäjoki).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘The common rules’ practice aims at decreasing uncertainty between the actors by agreeing in advance the forms of action that parties are required to comply with. The goal seems to be that young people –who internalize a schema registered into the agreement – are able to regulate their conduct and thus avoid behaviour defined as ‘bad-mannered’, ‘school bullying’ or ‘mischievous’. Parents are also registered in the programmes:<disp-quote>
<p>The programme includes a parental meeting where the common rules that the parents are expected to comply with are confirmed (e.g. curfews) (Nuorten matka turvalliseen tulevaisuuteen, Raumanseutukunta).</p>
<p>A survey of the parents of all the pupils at the Peltolaschool was carried out in the autumn of 1999. The goal of the survey was to find common rules, e.g. for the issues concerning the growing up environment, criminality and health education….The survey focused on a safe and supporting growing up environment, the principles of legality and health education and parent’s interference in shoplifting, bullying, violence and good manners (Koko kylä kasvattaa, Vantaa).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘common rules’ aim at standardizing thinking and behavioural schemas in such a way that normative interpretations are homogenized. This, for its part, intensifies cooperation, makes it more disciplined and promotes behaviour approved in the crime prevention projects. Some observations suggest that there is disparity in the power equilibrium of the agreements: the school system, for example, aims to encourage children and parents to fulfil their ‘own’ responsibilities and to standardize their behaviour without alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212474734">Määttä and Kalliomaa-Puha 2006</xref>). However, glimpses of dissolving hierarchical relations can also be seen:<disp-quote>
<p>The goal of the peer group conciliation method is to create a spontaneous, solution-oriented, affirmative and non-violent method for troubleshooting conflicts. The salient aim is to reduce malfunctions at schools by promoting the pupil’s life management skills (Sovittelukouluissajanuorisotaloissa, Helsinki).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, we also find various practices among ‘the common rules’ for increasing self-control where the young participate in the crime prevention project:<disp-quote>
<p>The secondary school pupils wrote their impressions on right and wrong, preventing crimes and legality in class. Psychologist MP gathered the writings into a volume called ‘We are the crime prevention bods – freewheeling working and fair control’. A musical called ‘41400 Lievestuore’, based on the writings, was performed in May and a core group consisting of 40 young people and their teachers carried out and planned costumes, staging, music, dances, PR etc(Nuorten rikostorjuntaa Laukaan taajamissa -hanke, Laukaa).</p>
<p>A crime prevention cartoon published four times in VantaanSanomat aims at reaching young people in a preventive sense. The cartoon included four themes (shoplifting, vandalism, assault, car theft) and each of them contained an offence, being caught and sanctioned. The cartoon has both an educational and an informative goal. And further, the local crime prevention activity is promoted at the same time (Rikoksentorjunta-sarjakuva, Vantaa).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this policy analysis suggest that children and young people are the key targets of Finland’s national and local crime prevention initiatives. Generational orders formed in the programmes could be described as conservative; children and young people are mainly positioned as ‘becoming citizens’ who belong under adult control. ‘Becoming’ is connected with the concepts of risk and incompleteness represented as a potential future threat and, as such, legitimating early intervention and pre-emptive interference. The key positionings – or subjects, following Dean’s typology – are children at-risk and the young in danger of marginalization.</p>
<p>In general, the goals and means of the Finnish programmes are connected with intensifying control over children and young people. The most usual forms for action are 1) promoting control of parents over young people (street patrolling), 2) early and direct forms of action by the authorities including different ‘tones’ directed at children and young people (early detection and direct intervention), 3) intensifying activities targeted at cooperation between authorities (multi-professionality) and 4) promoting self-control (agreements) and reciprocal control (peer conciliation) among young people.</p>
<p>Reflecting Dean’s typology on the axis of governance, the empirical findings manifest three central concepts of the Finnish regime of risk politics: concern, risk and early intervention. First, the fundamental ontological concepts of the emergent control culture are concern and fear (the forms of visibilities). Within the ‘concern’ discourse, reality surrounding children and young people is typically characterized as unforeseeable and unexpected, even threatening. Second, ‘risk’ is the epistemological eyeglass of the ontology of concern through which the worst and the most probable threats are identified and anticipated (the production of truth, knowledge). Third, through the concepts of ‘concern’ and ‘risk’, the strategies of ‘early intervention’ and their related techniques are mobilized as typical reactions within the new governance.</p>
<p>Perhaps such analyses and their substantial findings do not offer anything surprising or new to a UK-based or North American reader (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212474734">Armstrong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474734">Case, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212474734">Gray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212474734">Haines and Case, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212474734">Smith, 2006</xref>). After all, the rise of the risk paradigm and its relationship with globalization, neo-liberal governance, management and the homogenization of crime discourses have been the subjects of extensive (youth) criminological debate in the UK and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212474734">Goldson and Muncie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212474734">Muncie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212474734">Muncie and Hughes, 2002</xref>). The unique significance of the reforms addressed in this article, however, lies in their specific temporal and local context. In many ways, the analysed programmes reflect a post-recession situation in Finland and an openness to receive and apply international influence. In terms of a temporal change, the emergence of the risk paradigm – as a part of a wider socio-political transition – was remarkably swift and intense in Finland. A similar change of social policy that began in the 1970s, and has now been followed through for over four decades in the USA and the UK, was enforced in no more than ten years in Finland. The watershed of the change was the economic recession of the 1990s, an era of profound confusion in Finnish child, youth and family policy. In the post-recession era, characterized by an atmosphere of concern and moral panic, the new international doctrines and risk discourses were adopted with amazing speed and rigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1365480212474734">Satka et al., 2011</xref>). There is something familiar in the Finnish context: a small country that has always previously applied doctrines from abroad. In addition, the Finnish mentality in implementing regulations and programmes tends to be quite strict. With respect to the Finnish securitization programmes, many textual forms of the national programmes were directly plagiarized in the local programmes and only a few very small municipalities resisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212474734">Virta, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finland is often presented as one of the most humane and rational Nordic countries in respect of criminal/youth justice policy; a country that has avoided an internationally observed punitive turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212474734">Lappi-Seppälä, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212474734">Pitts and Kuula, 2005</xref>).In light of this empirical analysis and its contextualization, these claims seem to be over-simplified, and might be called into question. While some readily identifiable criminal/youth justice sanctions have declined, in many ways the societal atmosphere, public debate and political claims have fed more intrusive forms of repressive control and shifted the parameters of criminal/youth justice debate. For example, twelve initiatives for lowering or totally abolishing the age of criminal responsibility were presented in the Finnish Parliament during 1997–2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although criminal/youth justice sanctions have not hardened, therefore, other changes reflecting a tougher climate of regulation and control directed towards children, the young and families with children, has emerged. Contrary to the decreasing trends of the criminal/youth sanctions directed towards children and young people, since the 1990s the numbers of children below the age of 18 – and especially teenagers – subject to child welfare measures has grown strongly. This raises questions relating to institutional transitions of control and changes in modes of governance more broadly. No doubt, in this sense there are signs of a ‘net-widening effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212474734">Cohen, 1985</xref>) and it might be appropriate to ask whether the Finnish child welfare system comprises a‘hidden control system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212474734">Pitts and Kuula, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212474734">Pösö et al., 2010</xref>, 248–249).</p>
<p>The empirical analysis presented in this article has demonstrated how the main reforms in child and youth policy have occurred in the ‘pre-’ or ‘sub-crime’ initiatives where the vocabulary of ‘risk’ discourse has become dominant. A new kind of governmental area has been constructed between traditionally separate institutions; a grey zone of control now combines and connects the institutions of criminal/youth justice and child welfare. Securitization activity is more ‘political’ than ‘judicial’ by nature. Whilst the Nordic welfare ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474734">Harrikari, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212474734">Pösö et al. 2010</xref>: 247–248) still forms the basic structure of the system both in juvenile justice and child welfare, it is clear that securitization and risk policies have confused what is ‘hard’ and what is ‘soft’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212474734">Innes, 2005</xref>). It is not obvious whether we should, for example, speak about ‘the criminalization of social policy’, the ‘socialization of criminal justice policy’ or ‘securitization’ as a separate analytical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Finally, it is appropriate to remind ourselves that due to their prevalence and strong hegemonic status, it remains important to further explore how crime prevention and securitization discourses impact on ways of understanding strategic formations of childhood and youth. Since children are increasingly positioned as ‘becoming’, ‘risks’ and ‘threats’, there is a compelling reason to question how far their participation and provision are taken into consideration in local activities. In sum, the status of security speech and crime prevention technologies within the context of governing childhood and youth requires further critical consideration.</p>
