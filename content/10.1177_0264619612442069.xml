<abstract>
<p>This article describes and evaluates a programme of assistive technology demonstration projects that aimed to identify the information and support needs, as well as preferences and priorities, of older people with sight loss. The programme involved a series of projects across five sites managed by a major provider of housing and care services to people with sight loss. Projects typically involved specially trained lead members of staff displaying, discussing and demonstrating daily living devices and encouraging service users to try out items of interest. Programme evaluation reveals that although participants with sight loss have limited knowledge of generic and low-vision devices, they are keen to find technological solutions to routine difficulties, and value devices of practical design and ease of use that promote safety and independence. Evaluation also indicates that participating support staff would benefit from increased levels of awareness, confidence and training to maximize and operationalize service users’ access to, and appropriate use of, assistive technology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0264619612442069">
<title>Policy context</title>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010 the UK Government provided a total of £160 million to local authorities and partner agencies for the development and provision of assistive technology in the homes of older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619612442069">Beech and Roberts, 2008</xref>), an important initiative aimed at promoting and assisting independence in later life. Assistive technology can be defined as products or services designed to help older people and people with disabilities maximize their independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264619612442069">King’s Fund, 2001</xref>) and carry out tasks that would otherwise be problematic or impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264619612442069">Royal Commission on Long Term Care, 1999</xref>) and includes, amongst other items, wheelchairs, walking sticks, curtain openers, hoists, alarms, environmental control systems and daily living devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264619612442069">Help the Aged, 2007</xref>). Daily living devices, the category of assistive technology central to this article, commonly encompass low tech, easily sourced, items that assist the individual in carrying out regular activities and routines in and around the home, such as food preparation, housework and personal grooming.</p>
<p>Assistive technology is increasingly recognized as a cost effective resource that needs greater promotion so as to publicize its merits to those who would benefit, most of who are largely unaware of such provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619612442069">Beech and Roberts, 2008</xref>). The use of assistive technology potentially provides service users with flexibility in support options and as such contributes to the person-centred approach to social care enshrined in the personalization agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2006</xref>). The actual range of daily living devices is vast and relevant professionals are advised to foster a knowledge-building partnership with service users, listen carefully to service users’ wishes and ensure that particular devices are relevant and personally meaningful to the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264619612442069">Alaszewski and Capello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264619612442069">Assist UK, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264619612442069">Roberts, 2009</xref>). It is also important to recognize that if assistive technology is introduced and discussed in ways that emphasize people’s physical decline or their homogeneity as older people, interest and engagement may be withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264619612442069">Roberts, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0264619612442069">
<title>Policy drivers</title>
<p>One very important policy driver has been the government’s focus over the past twenty years on supporting people to live independently in their own homes. This objective was reinforced in a Government White Paper that also emphasizes the potential for technology to provide people with a greater level of self-determination in the way they manage everyday tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2006</xref>), an aspiration now accepted as a hallmark of Personalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2008b)</xref>. In addition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264619612442069">Audit Commission (2004)</xref> has argued that as the average age of the population increases there will be more pressure on informal and formal carers and, as a result, assistive technology will become more prominent and relevant in situations where it facilitates self care. Increased use of assistive technology is also seen as a potentially cost-effective way of maintaining the independence and well-being in our ageing population, including those older people with long-term conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264619612442069">Audit Commission, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264619612442069">2008c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264619612442069">National Service Framework (NSF), 2010</xref>). Assistive technology should not, however, replace hands-on support and has to be integrated with other important components of an older person’s care package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264619612442069">Alaszewski and Capello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619612442069">Brownsell et al., 2006</xref>) and in so doing can act as a catalyst for integrating services in a person-centred way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264619612442069">Department of Health, 2009</xref>). To be most effective, assistive technology has to be properly assessed and targeted to take account of required tasks and activities and environmental features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619612442069">FAST, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this policy context, the Assistive Technology Alliance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619612442069">(AT Alliance) (2010)</xref> contends that there continues to be a lack of collaboration and information sharing between researchers and developers and only limited consultation between users of assistive technology, manufacturers and service providers. These points are addressed in more detail later in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0264619612442069">
<title>Assistive technology and sight loss</title>
<p>There is evidence that assistive technology brings a number of benefits to older people and people with disabilities, including increased independence, improved quality of life, reduction of accidents in the home, ability to remain at home longer and enhanced support for those with long-term health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264619612442069">Bowes and McColgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264619612442069">Doughty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264619612442069">Tinker, 2004</xref>). Case studies also indicate that older people adjusting to living alone benefit from a menu of assistive technology, including daily living devices, monitoring systems and security safeguards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619612442069">Beech and Roberts, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264619612442069">Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) (2009)</xref> suggests that a variety of devices, equipment and home modifications are required to carry out daily activities, including alternative format materials, mobility aids, glasses and low vision devices, computer and allied technology, daily living devices, talking appliances and enhanced lighting. People with sight loss involved in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264619612442069">Buildings Research Establishment, 2004</xref>) indicated six main categories in which extant technology could be placed: ‘reading and communication’, ‘security systems’, ‘setting up and using electronic equipment’, ‘personal care’, ‘accident avoidance’, and ‘housework and routine activities’. The latter study emphasized the importance of technology that helps people manage kitchen and housework activities and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264619612442069">McCreadie and Tinker (2005)</xref> also report on the perceived benefits of devices that assist with domestic routines, especially items that are affordable and easy to use. Findings such as these prompted the programme under consideration in this article.</p>
<p>In a recent example of relevant assistive technology promotional work highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264619612442069">Skills for Care (2010)</xref>, UK-based Norfolk County Council’s employed specialist assistive technology workers to develop, promote and deliver technology related services. These ‘AT champions’ assist older people and other vulnerable adults to live at home and reduce the need for care home or hospital admissions, through the application of assistive technology as part of housing support and care arrangements. Workers undertake necessary assessment activities, in conjunction with colleagues from social services and health agencies, and actively consider and promote the use of assistive technology as a primary source of support. The potential for their largely non-specialist support workers to work effectively with people with sight loss, in similar ways to those referred to in the Norfolk case study, was an issue taken up by the Thomas Pocklington Trust when designing the AT programme under consideration in this article.</p>
<p>In 2009/2010, Thomas Pocklington Trust (Pocklington), a major provider of housing and support services to people in England with sight loss, carried out a programme that sought to understand staff and service users’ knowledge of, and attitudes towards, assistive technology, particularly daily living devices. In order to inform these aims, Pocklington organized demonstrations of daily living devices in three of the Trust’s supported housing centres, in Birmingham, Plymouth and West London, and in one of the Trust’s resource centres, in South London. Pocklington funded two independent consultants to co-ordinate the demonstration programme and a third consultant to evaluate the programme. The programme included holding a varying number of demonstration sessions over a three-month period at each of the four centres, providing service users and staff the opportunity to view, hear about, see demonstrated, and try out, a range of devices that assist in domestic activities of daily living.</p>
<p>The overall aim of the rest of this article is to present an account of the programme’s key findings, in the form of lessons learned and their implications for good practice and policy development in the field of assistive technology. First, there is a description of the programme, the devices displayed and participants’ engagement with the demonstration sessions. This is followed by explanation of the evaluation methods before presentation of major themes underpinning lessons that can be drawn from the programme. The article’s final focus is the programme’s implications for practice and policy that builds on the programme’s findings and further develops knowledge transfer and staff support initiatives.</p>

<title>The demonstration programme</title>
<p>Programme planning meetings involved support workers, managers, research staff, and the consultants referred to in the introduction. All worked closely to reach agreement on the range of devices to display, as well as various operational matters. The two programme consultants, one an experienced rehabilitation worker, the other an experienced research consultant with an occupational therapy background, provided training for support staff, the majority of whom had not previously received any specific assistive technology training. In this respect, the consultants informed staff about the range and uses of daily living devices, involved staff in role play to try out and build confidence in using selected devices, and discussed strategies for engaging service users in the forthcoming demonstration projects. Staff at each centre were also encouraged to learn more about, and collaborate with, local ‘disability living’ resource centres.</p>
<p>The demonstration programme was designed to be informative, interesting and engaging. Staff leading demonstration sessions carefully described the operation of devices before passing on items for participants to handle. After demonstrating the devices, staff invited comments and questions before assisting those who wished to try out the devices for themselves. The items on display throughout demonstrations were broadly similar across the centres and were selected, by the occupational therapist consultant, from a range of devices, shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0264619612442069">Box 1</xref>.</p>

</boxed-text>
<p>Service users at the housing centres were introduced to the range of daily living devices in communal lounges or other designated areas. Typically, these service users voluntarily participated in demonstration sessions in small groups, accompanied by those members of staff leading the session. As mentioned, there were opportunities for service users to ask questions and share experiences, prompted by the description of displayed devices and the hands-on nature of the sessions. Displays were left out to be viewed over a period of a few weeks, which allowed service users to view items in their own time and repeatedly, enabling further deliberation and reflection. Those who chose not to attend the demonstration sessions or to informally view the displays were, in the main, service users with comparatively little interest in technology or who reported that they preferred to rely on tried and tested strategies, for example using a finger rather than a liquid level indicator to alert them to the required volume of water in a cup, or relying on an old tin opener, which could still be used successfully.</p>
<p>Staff at the drop-in resource centre adopted different strategies from those in the housing centres, showing and discussing relevant items within group meetings that regularly take place, as well as during informal discussions with individuals and at community events. For example, resource centre staff took advantage of the weekly cookery classes held at the centre to introduce relevant assistive technology devices for use in the domestic kitchen, and also showed general household devices to those coming in for meetings of the local macular degeneration society. The resource centre manager also attended local community events to raise the profile of assistive technology and show items and devices.</p>
<p>Service users and staff across the centres were initially informed about the demonstration sessions through routine forums, newsletters and word of mouth. Those who took part were self-selecting. In total, sixty service users and thirty-five members of staff and took part in the programme. Service users, whose ages ranged from 47 to 84, had varying levels and types of sight loss, and many also suffered from other health problems or disability, including diabetes, arthritis and hearing loss. Clearly, these relatively small samples do not represent wider populations of visually impaired people and support staff, but, as we see, the issues they raise are an indication of areas of interest, as well as concerns, that social care staff, support workers, occupational therapists and allied professionals may usefully consider.</p>

<sec id="section6-0264619612442069" sec-type="methods">
<title>Evaluation methods</title>
<p>Generally, the remit of the evaluation was to appraise how well the programme had succeeded in identifying the information, support needs and preferences of visually impaired service users with regard to daily living devices, and to identify models of good practice for the involvement of service users in the introduction of assistive technology, as well as advice on how such processes can usefully be developed. Specific elements of the evaluator’s work were to:</p>
<list id="list1-0264619612442069" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>undertake pre-demonstration ‘benchmark’ individual interviews and focus groups, with staff and service users, to explore awareness and experiences of daily living devices;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>observe demonstration sessions in each centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conduct post-demonstration individual interviews and focus groups with relevant staff, service users and family members, to gather perspectives on the benefits or disadvantages of particular daily living devices, as well as the strengths and limitations of the project;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>highlight lessons learned from the programme and consider key themes and implications for possible future assistive technology research and development work.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Pre- and post-individual interviews with service users took place in their flats or in quiet areas of their housing scheme or resource centre. Focus groups with service users took place in communal areas of the respective centres. The evaluator also conducted similarly timed individual interviews and focus groups with members of staff at each centre, usually in designated meeting rooms. Forty service users and thirty members of staff chose to be involved in the evaluation interviews, that is, two-thirds, and slightly over a half, respectively, of the totals involved in the demonstration sessions, outlined earlier. The evaluator took notes during individual interviews and focus group sessions, and later subjected this data to thematic and content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264619612442069">Silverman, 2004</xref>).

<title>Lessons from the demonstration programme</title>
<p>The lessons that can be drawn from the programme evaluation are usefully discussed in respect of four key themes: awareness and attitudes; introducing assistive technology; targeting individual needs and priorities; and challenges and opportunities. Before this discussion it is useful to note the displayed daily living devices that were most favourably received during the demonstration session.

<p>As <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text3-0264619612442069">Box 3</xref> indicates, the most popular items are effective and easy to use, design features that strongly appeal to people with sight loss. Indeed, ease of use is particularly crucial to older people having to adjust to sight loss and much needed patience and morale can be severely tested by devices that are too complex or ‘fiddly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264619612442069">McCreadie and Tinker, 2005</xref>). The range of items displayed generated much interest, as participants reflected on the ways in which such devices could facilitate personal routines and domestic tasks.</p>
<sec id="section8-0264619612442069">
<title>Awareness and attitudes</title>
<p>People with sight loss typically require provision of low-level support in order to carry out activities of daily living with the same effectiveness as their sighted peers, yet access to adequate information about services and technology is noticeably lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264619612442069">Percival and Hanson, 2005</xref>). During pre-demonstration interviews and focus groups the majority of service user participants acknowledged that they lacked information and confidence as regards utilizing daily living devices, drawing attention to:</p>
<list id="list2-0264619612442069" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>difficulties that could be readily alleviated by existing devices, of which they knew nothing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a desire for assistive technology solutions to intractable problems, such as identifying and distinguishing tinned foods;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>concern about cost and possible disruption to established routines.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Staff awareness and confidence are also important issues when discussing assistive technology’s role in the lives of older people, including those with sight loss, and in pre-demonstration interviews and focus groups staff highlighted:</p>
<list id="list3-0264619612442069" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>limited knowledge of assistive technology devices;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>lack of confidence in providing appropriate assistive technology advice to service users;</p></list-item>

<title>Introducing assistive technology</title>
<p>Introducing people with sight loss to assistive technology and raising their awareness and confidence in its use depends on a range of issues, including design, cost, maintenance and compatibility with other aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0264619612442069">Tinker and Lansley, 2005</xref>). Indeed, issues of reliability and ease of use regularly arise in studies of assistive technology, which indicates the importance of obtaining users’ views on their satisfaction with devices and also their involvement in the design and development of AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264619612442069">Cutler, 2005</xref>). These and other factors were highlighted during observation of the demonstration sessions as well as in post-demonstration interviews and focus group discussions. In particular, participants’ views indicate that the <italic>ways</italic> in which daily living devices are introduced is important and should include:</p>

</list>

<sec id="section10-0264619612442069">
<title>Targeting individual needs and priorities</title>
<p>We know from previous research that factors such as the type and duration of sight loss, amount of social support, domestic environment, and presence of additional disabilities, all impact on individual preferences for, and appropriateness of, assistive technology devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264619612442069">Barlow and Curry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264619612442069">Buildings Research Establishment, 2004</xref>). It is clearly important that people with sight loss have access to technologies that best meet their individual needs and enhance their personal lifestyle. In post-demonstration interviews staff emphasized the importance of a person-centred appraisal that paid careful attention to the individual’s routines and priorities. Staff formed this opinion having discovered that such an approach was effective when informing service users of the programme and helped raise confidence to subsequently take part. Staff indicated that an individual’s circumstances, their knowledge, experience, priorities and needs, directly impact on the level of engagement with assistive technology. For example, daily living devices may be of particular interest and serve a very clear purpose at certain times in a person’s life, such as when a person first moves into a housing with care scheme or when their sight loss significantly deteriorates, circumstances that applied to some of the participants.</p>
<p>Confidence is recognized as a key issue for older people when first confronted with sight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264619612442069">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>) and staff involved in the programme suggested, during post-demonstration focus group discussions, that early induction in the uses and benefits of daily living devices is likely to help an individual better manage daily activities and thereby build confidence. Individual appraisal of assistive technology options has to take place at a pace that is sensitive to older people’s abilities and does not cause personal unease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264619612442069">Alzheimer’s Society, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264619612442069">Roberts, 2009</xref>) and staff concluded that this message has to be taken seriously if they are to foster an environment in which service users are prepared to try out a range of devices that might initially appear unfamiliar and complicated.</p>
<p>The range of unmet need and limited awareness about assistive technology, highlighted in the programme, suggest that people with sight loss could benefit from more regular assessment by occupational therapists and rehabilitation workers, as well as ongoing advice from better informed support staff. Ways in which this may achieved are explored in the final section of this article.</p>

<sec id="section11-0264619612442069">
<title>Challenges and opportunities</title>
<p>Effective, targeted assessment is required so that an assistive technology package is appropriate and meets low vision user needs. As we have seen, general support staff may currently lack the necessary awareness and confidence to undertake such assessments. Rehabilitation workers who specialize in sight loss are particularly qualified to assess and give advice on assistive technology, although their numbers are relatively low, totalling just 500 across the UK according to a recent statement by rehabilitation officers for the visually impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264619612442069">Rehabilitation Officers for the Visually Impaired (ROVI), 2011</xref>). Occupational therapists, who number 31,591 according to the Health Professions Council (HPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264619612442069">HPC, 2012</xref>) are also well placed to carry out assessment and advise people with sight loss about assistive technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264619612442069">Copolillo, 2009</xref>), but recent research indicates that a significant proportion of occupational therapists believe their pre- and post-qualifying education as regards sight loss is insufficient, with only two percent confident in assessing and advising people with sight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0264619612442069">Ward and Awang, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for good practice and policy development</title>
<p>Evaluation of the programme described in this article indicates a number of important strategies to facilitate good practice and policy development as regards introducing, demonstrating and assessing suitable daily living devices for older people with sight loss. These strategies are detailed below in relation to information networks, demonstration programmes, knowledge transfer and staff support, and future research strategies.</p>
<list id="list5-0264619612442069" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Information networks</italic>: People with sight loss depend to a significant extent on verbal communication and so require regular and ongoing updates, through talks and information sessions, in order to learn about, reflect on and consider relevant assistive technology. Information and communication strategies could, therefore, usefully include provision of regular bulletins in various formats, with updates about the range of assistive technology and the latest daily living devices to come on the market, as well as the facilitation of peer groups, to share information and experiences about assistive technology solutions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Demonstration programmes</italic>: Displays and demonstration sessions should be considered as part of an ongoing strategy, to raise awareness and share knowledge about assistive technology, and also, possibly, allow for the borrowing of devices so that service users can try out items before purchase. Such projects could usefully be provided, or facilitated, by relevant staff in a variety of settings populated by older people with sight loss, including day centres, day hospitals, lunch clubs, older people forums, disability peer group meetings, as well as in living environments such as sheltered housing schemes and residential care homes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Knowledge transfer and staff support</italic>: Housing and support staff working with people who have sight loss have assistive technology information and support needs of their own. In order to develop a capacity to be pro-active and offer individually appropriate advice and encouragement, such staff require targeted training and support to raise their awareness of the range, efficacy and applications of assistive technology, and to increase their knowledge of local authority provision and mechanisms for referrals to occupational therapists, community physiotherapists, care managers and rehabilitation officers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Future research strategies</italic>: Future research would usefully build on the programme discussed in this article by adopting three evidence-based approaches: surveys that track and monitor the use of assistive technology by people with sight loss; action research that facilitates and evaluates the impact of changes in use of assistive technology; and cost-effectiveness studies that generate hard data on the benefits of assistive technology for people with sight loss.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The question of how assistive technology can be effectively introduced to the significant numbers of older people with sight loss is timely but previously un-addressed, a concern that led Pocklington to establish the demonstration programme reported on in this article. The programme and its evaluation has helped increase our understanding of the perceptions and preferences of older people with sight loss as regards daily living devices. Issues such as design, usefulness, acceptance and timely advice, are clearly important to people with sight loss, as they are to people with a range of care and support needs. The programme also served to remind us that ‘the importance of low-tech interventions should not be forgotten, as these also have the power to transform lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264619612442069">Hanson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A particularly important outcome of the demonstration programme has been our increased understanding of the benefits of introducing daily living devices as part of an independent living strategy that is not technology led but, instead, prioritizes and respects personal preferences and aspirations. In association with this, the programme also supports the drive for staff to work with service users in a way that integrates professional service delivery and use of assistive technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264619612442069">National Occupational Standards, 2008</xref>) and for providers to carefully listen to service users if they wish to facilitate access to a range of products that ‘hit the spot for different groups of older people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264619612442069">Roberts, 2009</xref>: p. 9).</p>
