<article-title>Stress and DNA damage</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>The acute stress response is adaptive, but when stress is chronic it can produce abnormalities that contribute to a wide range of disorders that affect many body systems. Chronic stress can lead to telomere shortening and DNA damage, which could explain its wide, spread deleterious effects. The sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) are the two predominant stress response systems, and it has now been shown that increased activation in either of these systems can lead to DNA damage. In the sympathetic nervous system, 4 weeks of infusion of the B2-adrenoreceptor-agonist isoproterenol increased DNA damage in mouse thymus that was related to a decrease in p53 levels. It was shown that DNA damage can result from 2 pathways, one involving Gs-PKA-dependent signaling that generates reactive oxygen species and the other involving B-arrestin-1 dependent p53 degradation which results in impaired DNA repair mechanisms. These two pathways could act synergistically to produce DNA damage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858411428043">1</xref>) The involvement of the HPA axis in DNA damage has been shown in a study of elderly men and women (65–83 years old) where a robust association between markers of oxidatively generated DNA and RNA damage and the 24-hour urinary excretion of cortisol has been demonstrated. Compared to individuals in the lowest quartile, individuals and the highest quartile of cortisol excretion had approximately 60% higher excretion of markers of oxidatively generated DNA and RNA damage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858411428043">2</xref>) The findings that demonstrate DNA damage following increased activity in both the sympathetic and HPA systems now provides an improved understanding of some of the possible mechanisms by which chronic stress produces adverse health outcomes across a wide range of conditions. In the treatment of chronic stress, environmental interventions and stress management training, including aerobic exercise, have been shown to be effective. An improved understanding of the biologic mechanisms by which stress produces its deleterious effects can provide additional avenues for management of this problem. For instance use of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol has been associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s disease, which suggests that the use of adrenergic antagonist treatment should be more fully evaluated in other conditions. Also, improved methods to assess chronic HPA over activity can now be utilized to guide interventions that would normalize this system. Taken together, the findings provide improved evidence that DNA damage could be an important mechanism in the deleterious effects of chronic stress, and they suggest new possibilities for stress management and treatment.</p>

<article-title>Peripheral cytokines, neurogenesis and cognitive function in aging</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>During aging there is a marked decline in adult neurogenesis, which is accompanied with impairments in cognitive function. Physical exercise increases neurogenesis and improves learning in aged animals. Now using heterochronic parabiosis that generates vascular anastomoses that provides for a shared circulatory system between young and aged mice, it has been shown that blood borne age-dependent factors can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis. Young mice that were exposed to an old systemic environment or that received plasma from old mice had decreased neurogenesis, decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired spatial learning and memory and impaired contextual fear conditioning. Proteomic screens identified six plasma factors that were increased in both aged mice and in young mice exposed to an old systemic environment. One of these, CCL11, is a chemokine involved in allergic responses and it was found to be increased in the plasma and cerebral spinal fluid of older humans. Intraperitoneal injection of CCL11 in young mice decreased neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory, and intraperitoneal or intra-hippocampal injection of a CCL11 antibody blocked the CCL11 induced decrease in neurogenesis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858411428043">1</xref>) Local immune signaling in the brain is an important modulator of neural stem/progenitor cell function and neurodegeneration and the identification of systemic immune related factors as contributors to impaired cognitive function during aging is an important advance. It not only provides the opportunity to identify additional peripheral factors contributing to impaired cognitive function, but it also provides the opportunity to discover pro-neurogenic–rejuvenating factors that could improve cognitive function during aging. A direct application would be to identify systemic factors that contribute to the exercise-induced improvement in cognitive function. This would improve our understanding of the systemic components of exercise-induced benefits, which in turn could lead to the direct application of pro-neurogenic rejuvenating factors to reduce age related cognitive decline.</p>

<article-title>Nicotine exposure during adolescence produces long lasting synaptic changes</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>Adolescence is a period with increased vulnerability to initiation and subsequent use of addictive drugs. Adolescent smokers have impaired working memory and attention and an increased prevalence of behavioral problems later in life. It has previously been shown that that nicotine exposure in rats during adolescence produces an impairment of attention and an increase in impulsivity in adult hood, which is not seen in adult rats exposed to nicotine. Now, it has been shown that adolescent nicotine exposure produces a long lasting reduction in synaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor protein (mGluR2) levels in medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC), which was not seen in adult rats exposed to nicotine. When tested as adults, rats exposed to nicotine during adolescence had impaired function of presynaptic terminals on mPFC mGluR2 synapses. Local infusion of a mGluR2 agonist into the mPFC of rats that had received nicotine as adolescents reversed the abnormalities in attention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858411428043">1</xref>) These findings now provide an important possible molecular explanation for the attention deficits seen in adolescent smokers that could contribute to the behavioral problems experienced later in life. Since up to 19% of 12th grade adolescents in the USA smoke, this has important public health implications. It provides clear evidence that adolescent smoking injures brain function, which strengthens the rationale for eliminating adolescent smoking. In addition, it provides the opportunity for possible interventions to prevent and/or treat the impaired attention resulting from adolescent smoking with specific mGluR2 agonists. Although abstinence from smoking during adolescence would be the most critical intervention, since this is not possible, the use of medications to specifically normalize the impairments of attention later in life could be an important therapeutic advance.</p>
