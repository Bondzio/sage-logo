<p>This book examines death and dying from a social perspective and focuses on one of the key element of palliative care as it was originally developed by Dame Cicely Saunders, namely the individuals’ experience and ability to participate actively in their own dying process. Death Dying and Social Differences focuses on death as a social phenomenon and how the perception and experience of death and dying is influenced by culture. Furthermore, the book analyses the wide range of social factors and differences that can affect both the individuals’ and their families’ experiences. A strong argument is made that social statues and socioeconomics place some individuals and families in need of specific palliative care that is sensitive to their particular needs. The book also argues how palliative care should be sensitive to specific age groups, such as older people and teenagers and the needs of people that have specific physical and/or social conditions that make them different from the general population. This includes people with mental health issues, dementia or intellectual disabilities, as well as those in vulnerable groups due to neglect, abuse or substance misuses. Specific needs of asylum seekers, refugees, the homeless, travellers and prisoners are also addressed.</p>
<p>Death, Dying and Social Differences highlights how death is not the great leveller and points out key issues that make the experience of dying more difficult for some than others and the specific role that palliative care has for those who are affected by social differences.</p>
<p>This book is an incredibly valuable addition to the knowledge base of modern palliative care, as it highlights the specific needs of groups that, due to their social circumstances, are more vulnerable than others and are in greater need for specific care at the end of their life. Whilst the book does not set out to solve the issue of social differences, it makes a huge contribution to the holistic delivery of palliative care by making health and social practitioners aware of how social differences affects the quality of life and experience of those who are dying.</p>
<p>Death, Dying and Social Differences is an important resource for health and social care practitioners, policy makers and academics who are interested in developing and contributing to modern palliative care delivered in line with its original principle of individual based and holistic care.</p>
