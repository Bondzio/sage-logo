<abstract>
<p>The Supergen HiDEF (Highly Distributed Energy Future) project explores possibilities for decentralising five features of energy systems: resources, control, network infrastructure, participation and policy. This paper addresses issues of decentralised resources and participation (markets and commercial arrangements). It outlines some practicalities of an ‘active demand side’, supported by a brief overview of social and behavioural aspects of electricity use. Examples are derived from the international literature on behavioural aspects of energy use and residential load management programmes. Four potential active demand options are analysed in outline, in relation to customer involvement and likely enabling technologies. They are: overall demand reduction, static tariffs for peak reduction, dynamic tariffs for load management with variable supply, and continuous load-balancing through dynamic demand. Each of these can offer something to the utility; but what might it offer the customer, and what issues might it raise? The paper proposes development of a framework for evaluating ‘active demand’ options in terms of what they offer to small-scale end-users, to assist with planning for low-carbon energy transitions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912464623" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Electricity supply has traditionally been planned using a ‘predict and provide’ paradigm, whether on a half-hourly, seasonal or long-term basis. The scale of demand has been accepted as a ‘given’ that must be met, and supply systems are designed and operated accordingly. This has allowed the customer to remain a largely passive participant in the system. Even those on basic time-of use tariffs are likely to have little awareness of the importance of timing in the supply and use of electricity. Only the occasional blackout has served as a reminder that we cannot take supply completely for granted.</p>
<p>However, the nature of supply is altering, with a growing number of small-scale generators and a higher proportion of renewable generation. In ecological and economic terms, it makes sense to use renewable supply whenever possible in order to minimise the use of fuel for generation, and to minimise transmission and distribution losses. The challenge is to do this as effectively as possible through demand response and then (if necessary) through thermal or other storage.</p>
<p>The nature of demand is also changing, typically becoming more ‘peaky’, especially in the residential sector. The growth of ITC demand, the adoption of electric vehicles and heat-pumps, and the increase in standby loads all add to the complexities of load management. As a consequence, various concepts of ‘smart grid’ are emerging, primarily as ways of addressing the priorities of the supply industry. All involve two-way communications, and therefore some degree of customer participation. This could mark a major shift in the nature of the industry, given that customers are used to playing a minimal, peripheral role in electricity systems, particularly in the residential and small business sectors. They use electricity, pay for it, and sometimes complain or seek advice when something goes wrong with their supply or billing arrangements. End-users are normally interested in energy <italic>services</italic> such as heat, light, cleanliness and entertainment, and these, along with the size of the electricity bill, are likely to hold more meaning than the physical or tradable properties of electricity that preoccupy engineers and economists. Customers on some form of static time-of-use tariff, and those with storage heaters and hot water tanks that are programmed to run on cheap off-peak electricity, in fact contribute to demand management already. But they are not necessarily aware of it, or of how their electricity reaches them. Except in a very few instances, they and their suppliers are some way from participating in systems that reflect the marginal costs of production (and the mix of primary sources) at any given time.</p>
<p>This picture has changed a little in recent years, as some customers have adopted microgeneration and some are becoming more conscious of their overall usage and trying to reduce it. We are some way from agreement on what an active demand side could and should achieve, but can at least say that it implies a shift away from ‘predict and provide’ to something more like ‘predict, adapt, educate, co-provide, and store’. Demand is more widely seen as something that can be manipulated in different localities and at different scales (not only with large industrial and commercial customers), in order to optimise the working of a system. This calls for more sophisticated responses to local conditions, and infrastructure that can enable this. As hub-and-spoke infrastructure changes to something more network-like … ‘the social and cultural nature of energy demand may mean <italic>effective interventions are specific to a time and place, not universally applicable</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912464623">1</xref></sup> (p.189).</p>
<p>The HiDEF project is part of the research response to the challenge posed by these changes in infrastructure. It includes work on innovative commercial frameworks and business models for participants in the distributed energy marketplace and, preceding that, work on the broad social impacts and acceptability of distributed energy technologies. This article is concerned with investigating how electricity users might take a more active role in electricity system management, and with working out how best to define and explore some issues that arise when the use of ICT spreads down from the transmission level, right through to individual appliances.</p>
<p>The method behind the article is to introduce, briefly, some household energy demand issues as these relate to developments in electricity systems, select some generic load management options from those described in the literature, and look at potential advantages and drawbacks of each from the customer standpoint, as a prelude to carrying out further research on the viability of demand response. The paper sets out a basic framework for evaluating ‘active demand’ options such as efficiency and conservation, load-shifting and frequency response, in terms of what they might offer to residential electricity users. The options have been selected for their applicability to the UK context – in particular, to a temperate climate, a generation mix that is dominated by fossil fuels but with a growing proportion of wind, and a deregulated market in which network management and metering are separated from retailing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912464623"><title>Social and behavioural aspects of electricity use</title>
<p>Now that it is technically feasible to design electricity systems with some form of ‘active demand side’ that includes residential customers, research into viability is badly needed. To date, the emphasis has been very much on the technical and economic possibilities for keeping electricity systems up and running, from the supplier perspective. Optimistic and widely-promoted views of these developments hold that the development of ‘smart grids’ (or even ‘the Smart Grid’) will make the most of existing generation assets and will also act as a bridge to a low-carbon economy in which large numbers of ‘empowered’ consumers and prosumers (Prosumer  =  consumer who also produces/generates) collaborate readily with retailers and network managers.</p>
<p>However, this is some distance away. Proto-smart-grids are being tested out in many places around the world but, with a few exceptions, only large-scale industrial and commercial electricity users have experience of taking part in day-to-day grid and network management, through interruptible contracts, time-varying tariffs with interval metering, storage contracts, and various enabling technologies to ensure and measure compliance. We are still discovering what forms of small-scale ‘active demand’ are feasible in different climates and regulatory regimes, and making preliminary judgements as to where it is desirable, and in what form – for example, how high consumption needs to be before it is worth installing a smart meter and any other enabling technology to assist in demand management. The issues are reviewed in a recent paper on the social implications of residential demand response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912464623">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Householders’ relationship with electricity suppliers will change as they become equipped with interval metering, two-way communications with the supplier, microgeneration, storage and frequency-response-enabled appliances. At this stage, though, only a few are in a position to enter the debate over active demand as informed participants. One survey of attitudes to sustainable community infrastructure, including smart metering and community load management, found that only 6% of a sample of 1000 householders spontaneously warmed to the idea of a smart meter, although 83% went on to think of smart metering a positive proposal when it was explained to them; and 81% supported the idea of in-home hubs to control appliances. There was broad support for community energy systems that would balance power demand and supply, including some direct load control. However, focus groups conducted to supplement the survey saw external control as controversial and an invasion of privacy, even at low level or for short periods of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912464623">2</xref></sup> This study, published in 2009, is one of many that illustrate ambivalence about the introduction of new technologies and new supplier-customer relationships. However, attitudes are an imperfect guide to actual practices, and it is important to take such surveys as snapshots of the public mood rather than predictions of likely uptake of new technologies. The nature and degree of concerns about smart metering varies widely – for example, smart meters have been rolled out with barely any comment in Sweden, while proving highly controversial in the Netherlands – and this points to the importance of factors such as levels of trust in suppliers and government, types of regulation, and perceived impacts on everyday life.</p>
<p>Privacy concerns surface many times in research and policy-making in relation to demand management and ICT. People may have become very accustomed to sharing confidential information online and over the phone network, but the idea of third parties having access to personal data can still be disturbing, especially if it might be used for unwanted marketing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912464623">3</xref></sup> The halting of the Dutch smart meter roll-out, while data protection issues were taken through the courts and debated in parliament, has been particularly striking and cautionary to the metering and energy industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912464623">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Major utilities are by far the dominant actors in the business of making electrons flow through wires, with access to the bulk of physical, intellectual and administrative resources to make them work. Yet utilities do not necessarily command much public trust,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912464623">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912464623">3</xref></sup> and this can be a serious issue when more active cooperation and tested, credible communications between suppliers and customers are needed in order to allow an ‘active demand side’ to function effectively. Customers are unlikely to alter the scale and timing of their use of wet appliances (for example), to invest in low-energy lighting, or to hand over control of their water heater to a utility, unless they are convinced that there is a valid reason for doing so, and that they will be rewarded for it in some way. Some research is beginning to address this. For example, the recent review of worldwide demand response programmes carried out by VaasaETT illustrates how developing good customer relations can greatly improve effectiveness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912464623">5</xref></sup> while a detailed examination of privacy issues in relation to smart metering points to ways in which high-resolution data can remain within the household or business as the default arrangement, only going to the utility with the explicit consent of the customer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912464623">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A substantial proportion of electricity customers in OECD countries – perhaps half – say that they wish to take some sort of interest in managing their usage, investing in microgeneration or adopting efficiency measures. This may be in order to save money, because they are attracted by new technologies, or because they wish to experiment and develop new patterns of living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912464623">7</xref></sup> But it is realistic for any investigation into energy services to start from an assumption that most people will not see themselves as actively involved in network management. Some may be familiar with the idea of storage, through living with storage heaters, and some may be getting used to the idea of microgeneration. But concepts such as load-balancing and pricing risk are unlikely to crop up in the conversations that electricity users have with each other. This means that researchers need to be prepared to investigate some basic issues in relation to daily routines and their impact on patterns of demand, and on customers’ knowledge of the options open to them, in order to incorporate these with financial and load-control aspects of the customer-utility relationship. To put it another way, a range of potential ‘user dimensions’ of distributed electricity systems need thinking through carefully at an early stage in any research into householders’ participation in smart grid arrangements, in order to formulate questions that relate to their experience.</p>
<p>Some of the user dimensions, covered in the literature on social and behavioural aspects of energy use and technology adoption, are listed below, with some sample references.
<list id="list1-0957650912464623" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Household size, composition, routines, social conventions and decision-making all affect the scale and pattern of demand. Daily routines are influenced by social and institutional conventions (for example, about how warm a home should be, how often clothes need to be washed and how they are dried, and how much ICT equipment is purchased and left switched on). However, these conventions are adopted and interpreted in many ways, which helps to explain why electricity consumption by similar numbers of people in identical buildings can vary by a factor of three or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912464623">8</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The meaning of ‘home’ to the householder. For example, is it a ‘nest’ for sleeping, eating and storage; a workshop for making, mending, maintenance and experiments; or a place for entertainment and display? This is likely to affect the degree of interest in active demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912464623">9</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Involvement/experience in design, adoption and use of new technologies. These would include renewable microgeneration, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. There is growing evidence that these technologies often fail to live up to their ‘technical potential’, partly due to design that fails to recognise ‘user logic’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912464623">10</xref></sup> and also partly due to a lack of know-how among installers and users.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912464623">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912464623"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912464623">13</xref></sup> Conversely, when users are involved in design, adoption, and use, the outcomes can be productive: for example in relation to self-build and the adoption of ‘smart home’ technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912464623">14</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Willingness to allow external control of domestic appliances. This is an important consideration for this paper, when considering the implications of different types of load control for the customer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912464623">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912464623">16</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Views on the importance of privacy, transparency, anonymity, choice, and sharing of data. Anxieties about data privacy have affected the uptake of smart meters in countries such as the Netherlands and the US, in particular, although ways can be found to avoid unwanted datasharing;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912464623">6</xref></sup> while the importance of trust in utilities and other institutions has been highlighted in relation to development of microgrids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912464623">17</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Experience of non-standard tariffs. These may be time-varying tariffs or capacity-related (where the unit cost of electricity is related to the customer’s contracted peak demand, as in Italy). Such experience means that the customer has had some exposure to the idea that electricity is not uniformly available at consistent wholesale prices, and that network capacity may be limited. This experience may be something on which to build a fuller understanding of residential energy and what is involved in demand management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912464623">18</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interest in, and use of, feedback and advice on energy use and generation; adoption of efficiency measures. Again, these indicate some basic knowledge and experience that can be built upon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912464623">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912464623">19</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This list indicates many pathways to customer engagement in active demand. It also cautions against any ‘techno-optimist’ approach which assumes that simply installing new equipment in a home will produce the desired outcome. Below is a simple analysis of what four ‘active demand’ options might mean to the customer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0957650912464623"><title>From passive to active demand – four illustrative options</title>
<p>The dimensions listed above indicate possibilities for demand-side activity, although the types of activity may vary from complex experimentation, planning and control to the simple process of signing up to a load-control agreement and permitting installation of the enabling technology. They also suggest that an individual may experience particular advantages or drawbacks from aspects of active demand, depending on their scale and patterns of usage and generation, their views of data privacy, and the extent to which they are willing to adapt or hand over control of the timing or level of energy services. The services which seem most amenable to time-shifting are water or space heating, laundering and dishwashing; those which do not necessarily have to happen at specific times. End-uses with a wide range or continuum of potential settings may also lend themselves to remote control: space heating and cooling, water heating, and lighting (voltage control).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912464623">Table 1</xref> illustrates this in relation to four potential means of altering network and retail arrangements, all relevant to highly-distributed electricity supply, demand and control technologies and customer roles involved in each. It is derived from literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912464623">20</xref></sup> and from discussion with colleagues on the HiDEF project. The economic aspects of demand response are covered exhaustively elsewhere and are only touched on here, where the focus is on what a customer needs to <italic>do</italic> in order to participate.

<list-item><p>Overall <italic>demand reduction</italic> may not seem directly relevant to a paper that mainly deals with load management in the home home. It is included on the grounds that reduction in overall demand can be a major policy objective for reasons of energy security and social welfare;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650912464623">21</xref></sup> because reducing domestic loads may produce greater environmental benefits than shifting them,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957650912464623">22</xref></sup> and because overall demand reduction, electrification of end-uses, peak demand management and the introduction of variable renewable generation are all intertwined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650912464623">23</xref></sup> From a policy viewpoint, demand reduction greatly improves the prospects for achieving targets for the proportion of supply met by renewables. It is likely to be a familiar concept to energy users, in the form of ‘energy saving’ or ‘energy conservation’; also an attractive one, if combined with the prospects of improved comfort, home improvement, and secure, affordable energy services. The main perceived drawbacks tend to be the mental effort and practical hassle involved in making changes, and the upfront cost of efficiency investments. The relative importance of these two will differ between households, of course, but the significance of the first appears to be routinely underestimated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912464623">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912464623">11</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A great deal of the research literature on demand reduction and how best to achieve it falls under one of two headings. The first is ‘efficiency’, with a focus on technical development to improve the ratio of fuel or energy input to energy service, and the programmes that can support efficiency improvements, such as appliance labelling and minimum standards. The second is ‘practice’, with a focus on how energy services are delivered, and how they might change as a result of how users go about their lives – for example, through rethinking the <italic>meaning</italic> of an energy service such as warmth (achieved through heating space, through activity or insulation, or some combination), adopting different <italic>technologies</italic>, increasing <italic>knowledge</italic>, or changing <italic>routines.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912464623">8</xref></sup> As the table indicates, both efficiency and practice will be involved in any sustained demand reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650912464623">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957650912464623">24</xref></sup>

<list-item><p><italic>Static time-of-use (TOU) tariffs</italic>, constant over relatively long time periods, are often cited as the main rationale for smart metering. Even in countries with relatively low potential for load-shifting (that is, with low space heating and/or cooling loads), it is worth investigating customer willingness to adopt time-of-use pricing on an opt-in or opt-out basis, with or without enabling technology such as timers and direct load control of water heaters. This means, in effect, willingness to accept a change in energy services. Altering the timing of dishwashing or laundry is an example of what would probably be perceived as a minor change in service (although night-time operation might be unacceptable in a small or shared dwelling), while load-shifting home entertainment or PC usage is far less likely to be acceptable. Shifting the use of cookers appears highly valuable to networks (because of the high potential for load-shedding); but the timing of cooking is also valuable to users (who are unwilling to alter mealtimes); and it is unrealistic to expect much time-shifting of this particular energy service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650912464623">25</xref></sup> Accepting some external control of a heat pump, air conditioner or heater would involve some change to the nature of the service, and customers will decide, in effect, how much interruption is acceptable in exchange for a given type and level of incentive. We still do not have a comprehensive view of how much residential load people are willing to shift, and what types of load, but indications are that it is very unlikely to be more than 20% of peak load, mostly from shifting the timing of wet appliance use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650912464623">25</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<p>The recent Irish trials of smart metering involved some 5000 participants who were equipped with smart meters and offered various combinations of TOU tariffs, frequent and informative bills with detailed energy statements, display monitors (for real-time and historic feedback), and incentives. The trials offer some useful, and sometimes unexpected, insights into how customers responded to variable pricing, and the extent to which displays and informative billing affected response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957650912464623">26</xref></sup> For example, the average outcome from a combination of some version of TOU tariff and some form of demand-reduction stimulus (improved billing, feedback display, and/or incentive) was 8.8% peak and 2.5% overall savings; the peak reduction rose to 11.3% when the TOU tariff was combined with feedback displays and bimonthly informative billing. Interestingly, peak demand proved inelastic to the ratio between peak and off-peak prices, and there was no ‘tipping point’ price beyond which electricity was seen as too expensive and there was a marked fall-off in usage. It was as though the main factor behind customer response to static time-of-use pricing was a new awareness of the <italic>existence</italic> of time-variable prices. There was little evidence of a rational-economic, sliding-scale type of response.</p>
<p>Findings from a review of 214 trials worldwide, though Strömbäck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912464623">5</xref></sup> showed that there was some increased response associated with higher peak: off-peak price ratios, ranging from 3% peak clipping when the ratio was less than two to 6% when it was more than four. These trials show clearly that prices are significant determinants of response, but not the only ones: education, interaction and feedback also make a difference, as does the extent of automation. For example, when TOU trials were analysed according to whether or not they included a customer education element, 122 trials that did involve education achieved average overall savings of 4% and peak savings of 6% compared with controls, while 92 with no user education resulted in an average 1% <italic>rise</italic> in overall consumption and consumption and average peak savings of 4%.</p>
<p>Finally, a measure of automation in 35 of the trials analysed in Strömbäck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912464623">5</xref></sup> – that is, allowing some direct load control by the utility/network operator, or setting a timer to switch appliances such as air conditioners and water heaters off at peak times – was associated with average peak savings of 16%, over three times those achieved in 215 trials without any automation. Careful testing of enabling technology for automated response, to make it as effective and customer-friendly as possible, is clearly an important element in making TOU pricing work well for individuals and systems.</p>
<p>For prosumers, the introduction of TOU pricing can offer an added incentive to use their own generation, as much as possible during periods of high prices for grid electricity – for example, doing the laundry during a bright, hot afternoon in California for an owner of solar PV, or on a cold winter evening in western Europe for a householder with micro-CHP. (Even without dynamic pricing, though, a knowledge of the relative prices for electricity imports and exports can incentivise prosumers to manage their loads in particular ways.)</p>
<p>The relationship between overall demand reduction and demand/load management is complex, depending on specific circumstances, and one does not automatically imply the other. ‘Pure’ load-shifting leaves overall consumption unchanged, of course. But when high real-time prices or other ‘shortage’ signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650912464623">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957650912464623"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957650912464623">29</xref></sup> lead to reductions in discretionary demand, some of it is unlikely to be compensated for later. Lighting is an example. When load management has some awareness-raising component and is not purely automatic, as indicated above, it is likely to have some impact on overall consumption.
<list id="list4-0957650912464623" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Dynamic tariffs</italic>, or real-time pricing (RTP) in which customers are charged in relation to current spot prices, are inherently more complex and need careful presentation, although relatively simple systems can be designed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957650912464623">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957650912464623">31</xref></sup> While attention is usually focused on the economics of such schemes, the literature also shows potential for benefits from increased awareness and control. A shift to dynamic tariffs marks a dramatic change from the normal customer-utility relationship, in that it exposes consumers and prosumers to the hour-to-hour movements of electricity wholesale markets (sometimes posted a day in advance), if not to the minute shifts in network frequency. A measure of customer protection from price risk may have to be built-in in order to make RTP acceptable: e.g. in Sweden there are tariffs which guarantee that prices will not rise above a certain level during the winter for electrically-heated homes; or tariffs are designed so that customers cannot be disadvantaged financially by switching from a flat-rate to a real-time tariff. Customers can also be alerted at times of particularly high prices. We are only beginning to see how such a shift in relationship works in practice, but peak savings in the region of 9% have been achieved in 10 trials <italic>with</italic> automation and 12% from 15 <italic>without</italic> automation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912464623">5</xref></sup> (This is a reversal of the pattern of saving from TOU trials with and without automation, not yet fully understood.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Dynamic demand</italic> comes at the far end of the spectrum of customer involvement, in that it involves load-balancing from second to second, and the customer is not expected to do anything beyond installing smart appliances that respond to network frequency. It may be combined with dynamic tariffs, but this is not inevitable. As the cost of ‘smarting’ a kitchen appliance is already a small proportion of the whole, it seems likely that all new cold appliances, at least, will be smart within a decade.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Dynamic demand could become particularly valuable at local level in situations where network-balancing is difficult due to a combination of erratic demand and supply, e.g. where there is substantial embedded generation along with heat pumps and electric vehicles. Its significance for electricity users is very slight in that they have to do very little. They can choose to buy a ‘smart’ version of a washing machine, freezer or other appliance, and they may also choose some form of dynamic tariff. The likely impact on energy services is also slight, particularly if there is a manual override for functions such as spin-drying, (and it could be argued that there is an overall service benefit if networks function more reliably). But dynamic demand does mark a step in the direction of more distributed control and the use of the demand side to balance the network, and to that extent it can be described as a form of active demand.</p>
<p>These four options are not tightly bounded. For example, overall demand reduction will also have an impact on peak demand; a static time-of-use tariff with multiple price bands may differ very little from real-time pricing at hourly intervals; and the smart appliances that are beginning to be used for dynamic demand also have a place in responding to real-time prices or to static TOU prices. However, the four options serve to illustrate how an active demand side can involve different levels of active or conscious action on the part of the electricity user or prosumer, and why these need to be taken into account at the planning stage.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0957650912464623"><title>Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>This article has attempted to set out four options for an ‘active demand side’, a crucial aspect of smart grids, from the point of view of the residential electricity user. Beginning with a consideration of what might be involved in the transition from passive ratepayer or consumer to active participant, it set out factors that need considering when planning specific types of ‘active demand’ for a carbon-constrained electricity system. In asking why a householder might wish to cooperate in managing an electrical system, with a view to outlining possible market solutions, we have to take into account some complexities of household energy management. These are not just economic: they also involve issues of trust, daily habits and practices, familiarity with different technologies and tariffs, energy literacy, and approaches to living.</p>
<p>The literature on social aspects of overall demand reduction and load management is a useful preparation for qualitative work with electricity consumers and prosumers, in order to test how an ‘active demand side’ can be developed that has consent and cooperation, without taking unacceptable risks with data, comfort or household economics. This initial analysis of four ‘active demand’ options from the customer standpoint shows that electricity pricing is far from being the only factor that needs to be taken into account in planning for active demand. It indicates the sometimes uncertain relationship between demand response (system management) and demand reduction. It also highlights the significant steps that customers may feel they are taking in adopting a riskier form of pricing (that is, dynamic or real-time pricing), and deciding to hand over control of one or more end-uses to a supplier. Attention tends to focus on the economics of ‘active demand’ options, but it can be seen that they also involve changes in technology, user practices, and regulations. Indeed, it is the combination of all these factors that leads to the crucial outcomes in terms of impacts on the network and on energy services. For that reason, a framework for evaluation of active demand options should take them all into account, and it should be set up in a way which recognises that some users will be interested in electricity supply and use, but all will be concerned about their energy services. Services therefore need to be a central focus of inquiry, remembering that the ability to control usage is highly valued by users and can therefore be seen as a service in itself.</p>
<p>While preparatory exercises in understanding the demand side do not guarantee well-supported demand response, they can improve the chances of success, and help in avoiding customer alienation and misapplications of technology.</p>
