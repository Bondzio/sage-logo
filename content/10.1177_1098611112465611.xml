<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this research note was to compare Detroit police officers with other City of Detroit employees in terms of the length of their retirements and the age at which they die. Data on retired and deceased police officers and other city employees were obtained from the City of Detroit (<italic>N</italic> = 7,325). Ordinary least squares regression equations were estimated using age at death and length of retirement as dependent variables. The results show that retired officers die significantly younger than other retired city employees and that officers have significantly shorter retirements prior to death than other city employees. Given the limitations of the data analyzed here, the reasons for the differences among retired police officers and other retired workers with regard to mortality largely remain speculative. However, the findings suggest that additional attention to health concerns and issues among current and retired officers may be warranted in policy as well as in research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An important and fairly well developed line of occupational research examines the mortality outcomes of workers after retirement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098611112465611">Frank, Biola, &amp; Burnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611112465611">Hult, Stattin, Janlert, &amp; Jarvholm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611112465611">Kim &amp; Moen, 2002</xref>); however, there is little research that examines the experiences of police officers in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611112465611">Raub, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611112465611">Sardinas, Wang-Miller, &amp; Hansen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti, Vena, &amp; Petrolia, 1998</xref>). Although few studies have examined the postretirement mortality of police officers, many studies have documented the serious health-related issues prevalent among police officers, including sleep disorders and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098611112465611">Fielder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098611112465611">Rajaratnam et al., 2011</xref>), burnout and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098611112465611">Gershon, Barocas, Canton, Li, &amp; Vlahov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098611112465611">Hall, Dollard, Tuckey, Winefield, &amp; Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098611112465611">Schaible &amp; Gecas, 2010</xref>), injuries and assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098611112465611">Brandl &amp; Stroshine, 2003</xref>), posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611112465611">Maguen et al., 2009</xref>) and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098611112465611">Violanti et al., 2006</xref>). Some studies have highlighted the lifestyle, resulting from the stress and demands of police work, which encourage or contribute to unhealthy habits (e.g., poor diet, heavy alcohol consumption; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098611112465611">Feidler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098611112465611">Gershon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098611112465611">Rajaratnam et al., 2011</xref>). Further, studies have linked occupational stress to serious physical health problems, including but not limited to coronary artery and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098611112465611">Holmes, Krantz, Rogers, Gottdiener, &amp; Contrada, 2006</xref>), conditions that often cause early death. Given the demands of the job, and the behavioral and health consequences of those demands (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098611112465611">Luo &amp; Ruiz, 2012</xref> for a review), there is good reason to believe that a career of police work may have negative effects on retired officers’ longevity. Indeed, police officers themselves often assume that they will die shortly after retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611112465611">Raub, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, for police officers, retirement itself may also present unique problems of adjustment and stress. As a result of the distinctive features of the occupation (e.g., use of coercive authority, social isolation, and a pervasive sense of danger), police officers develop remarkably strong bonds among one another. They are often referred to, and refer to themselves as a brotherhood or as a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098611112465611">Holmes &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>), often seeing themselves as distinct from ordinary citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098611112465611">Bonifacio, 1991</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611112465611">Crank, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611112465611">Langworthy &amp; Travis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611112465611">Van Maanen, 1973</xref>). Police work is an occupational lifestyle, providing officers with the core of their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098611112465611">Skolnick &amp; Fyfe, 1993</xref>). As they leave this lifestyle, and lose their status and identity, retired police officers may experience some of the adverse consequences of retirement more intensely than their civilian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611112465611">Caudill &amp; Peak, 2009</xref>), also perhaps affecting their postretirement longevity. Despite these conventional notions, however, we know relatively little about the lengths of officer retirement, or officer mortality after retirement. The extremely limited research on police officers’ death after retirement presents inconsistent findings and suffers from a number of methodological shortcomings.</p>
<p>The lack of research on the issue, and shortcomings of existing research, is understandable but unfortunate. In particular, access to retired police officers for research purposes (especially with regard to their mortality) is much more difficult than access to currently employed officers, the issues faced by retired police officers are generally not as salient to police managers as those faced by current police officers, and since retired police officers are out of the occupation, they are of less interest to analysts who study the occupation and organization. Arguably, however, police and civic leaders have an ethical obligation to pay serious attention to the health and welfare of retired officers, particularly in the form of reasonable retirement policy and benefits.</p>
<p>The purpose of this research note is modest: To compare retired City of Detroit police officers with other retired City of Detroit employees in terms of the age at which they died and the length of their retirements. Given the paucity of research that has directly examined this issue, this study represents an important step toward a better understanding of police postretirement mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1098611112465611">
<title>Previous Research</title>
<p>Three studies have specifically examined the mortality rates and age at death of police officers in the United States: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611112465611">Raub (1988)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611112465611">Sardinas et al. (1986)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti et al. (1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611112465611">Sardinas et al. (1986)</xref> examined the ischemic heart disease (IHD) related mortality of Connecticut firemen and policemen for the years 1960-1978. Using standardized mortality odds ratios (MOR) and death certificate data, the authors found that MOR as a result of IHD for policemen was greater than that for firemen, suggesting that policemen have shorter lives than firemen. This study, however, suffers from several limitations, including that only IHD related mortality was examined, the amount of “exposure” to the occupation was unknown (i.e., the amount of time police officers and firefighters were employed in the occupation is not specified), and only subjects between 25 and 59 years of age were included in the study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611112465611">Raub (1988)</xref> compared mortality rates of 732 Illinois State Police (ISP) retirees to the actuarial “standard tables” used by the ISP Retirement System. He found that, when compared to the predictions of these standard tables, ISP officers who retired between 1955 and 1986 were significantly more likely to be alive. In addressing questions about officer mortality, however, this study also suffers from several shortcomings. In particular, it appears that the standard tables used in the study were based on whether or not officers were alive at certain “years since retirement” but it is not clear if the author accounted for the differences in retirement age among the sample officers and those who were used to construct the standard tables. In other words, it is possible that ISP police officers retired at younger ages than the population used to construct the standard tables, thus biasing the results. Furthermore, the author did not directly examine officer age at death. In making comparisons to the standard tables, the author also did not take into account officers’ rank/position in the department, the type of retirement that was taken (e.g., early retirement, disability retirement), or the officers’ race or gender, and few details are provided about the age at which officers retired.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti et al. (1998)</xref> conducted a cohort study of city of Buffalo police officers, specifically examining mortality rates and causes. The cohort consisted of 2,693 White male officers who worked for the Buffalo Police Department a minimum of 5 years between January 1, 1950 and December 31, 1990. The authors found that the average age at death for the 1,035 officers who had died was 66 years, which was significantly younger than the mortality ages for the U.S. White male population during those years. To assist in interpreting these results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611112465611">Ruiz and Morrow (2005)</xref> added that according to a 2001 Department of Health and Human Services study, the average age at death among Americans during the study’s approximate timeframe was 77.2 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti et al. (1998)</xref> also found that their cohort of police officers was significantly more likely than U.S. White males (based on standardized mortality ratios) to die of certain forms of cancer (esophagus, colon, and kidney), Hodgkin’s disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide. A significantly lower mortality rate was observed among police officers for infective and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, and accidents.</p>
<p>Clearly there is too little research from which to draw conclusions about the mortality of retired police officers. Not only do the findings of the limited prior research conflict, the prior studies suffer from significant methodological shortcomings. The present study adds to what is known about police officer mortality by comparing a relatively homogenous sample of retired police officers and other city workers on age at death and length of retirement.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The data for this study were obtained from the City of Detroit Retirement Systems Office. This office maintains a data file on current retired city employees as well as city employees who have died after retirement. For purposes of this study, a request was made of the Retirement Systems Office for data on retired city employees (police officers and general city employees) who died between January 1, 1995 and July 20, 2010. Specifically, for each deceased retiree, the following data were requested: department from which the employee retired (i.e., police department or other city department, not including fire department), type of retirement (e.g., service, duty disability), sex, date of birth, date of hire, date of retirement, and date of death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1098611112465611">1</xref></sup> From these data, age at death (year of death minus year of birth) and length of retirement (date of death minus date of retirement) were calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098611112465611">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098611112465611">Table 1</xref> provides the descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis.</p>

<p>In total, 7,325 cases (retired employees who died between January 1, 1995 and July 20, 2010) were included in the data set.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1098611112465611">3</xref></sup> Of these cases, 6,873 were general city employees (not including fire department employees) and 452 were police officers.</p>

<sec id="section4-1098611112465611">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>To examine the age at death and length of retirement of police officers and general city employees, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equations were estimated with age at death and length of retirement as the dependent variables. The primary independent variable of interest in the analysis was department of employment (police officers vs. other city workers). As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098611112465611">Table 1</xref>, other variables included as controls were sex of employee, type of retirement,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1098611112465611">4</xref></sup> and age at retirement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1098611112465611">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We began the analysis with collinearity diagnostics. The bivariate correlations revealed no clear problems of collinearity. None of the bivariate correlation coefficients exceeded .52. To check for multicollinearity caused by the combination of two or more variables, we examined variance inflation factors (VIFs). None of the VIFs obtained from either model were greater than 1.46, a value well below the generally accepted limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611112465611">Neter, Kutner, Nachtsheim, &amp; Wasserman, 1996</xref>, p. 387).</p>

<title>Age at Death: Police Officers and General City Employees</title>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098611112465611">Table 2</xref>, the OLS regression analysis of age at death shows that police officers died significantly younger than general city employees. In fact, all else equal, police officers died more than 6 years younger than general city employees. The analysis also reveals that employees who retired with retirement classifications other than regular service retirements died significantly younger (7.30 years) than employees who retired with service retirements, that males died significantly younger (2.48 years) than females, and that employees who retired at older ages died at older ages than employees who retired at younger ages.</p>

<title>Length of Retirement: Police Officers and General City Employees</title>
<p>Also of interest is how police officers compare with other city employees with regard to length of retirement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1098611112465611">Table 3</xref>). The OLS regression analysis of length of retirement reveals that police officers had significantly shorter retirements than general city employees, with police officers having retirements nearly 74 months (over 6 years) shorter than other city employees. The analysis also shows that employees who retired with retirement classifications other than regular service retirements had significantly shorter retirements than employees who retired with service retirements, that males had significantly shorter retirements than females, and that employees who retired at older ages had significantly shorter retirements than employees who retired at younger ages.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare Detroit police officers to other City of Detroit employees in terms of the length of their retirements and their age at death. The results show that, on average, retired police officers die significantly younger than retired general city employees and they have significantly shorter retirements prior to death than general city employees.</p>
<p>Given the data available for this study, we cannot empirically explain the seemingly premature deaths of police officers postretirement; however, previous research may assist in this regard. One explanation calls attention to officers’ maladaptive responses to the demands of the job. Specifically, the nature and demands of the job (e.g., shift work, exposure to misery and conflict, constant potential for danger, risk of physical injury, public apathy, and court process) may lead officers to certain dysfunctional habits and attitudes as coping mechanisms. These habits and attitudes may result in unhealthy outcomes. The unhealthy outcomes may eventually lead to earlier death compared to other city employees. Where the demands of the job are not great, dysfunctional habits and attitudes may not develop, nor may the associated unhealthy outcomes (and premature death). Much research has highlighted the unhealthy behaviors of officers, and their consequences. For example, research has shown that compared to the general population, a greater proportion of the police drink alcohol excessively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098611112465611">Kohan &amp; O’Connor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611112465611">Richmond, Wodok, Kohoe, &amp; Heather, 1998</xref>) and smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611112465611">Richmond et al., 1998</xref>). Accordingly, alcohol-related liver disease as a cause of death was found to be twice that of the general population, lung cancer deaths are also more common among the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611112465611">Richmond et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611112465611">Violanti et al. (1998)</xref> also found that police officers have an elevated risk of dying from cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the relatively early death of police officers after they retire relates to the emotional disruption that results from retirement itself. Retirement involves leaving not only the job but everything that it represents. As it has been described many times, being a police officer is not just a job; it is a way of life. Retirement then means losing more than just an association with a job; it involves leaving a strong subculture that has been in place since the start of the officers’ career. Retired officers are no longer part of this subculture, they no longer experience and share unique and potentially dangerous situations with other officers, situations that further encourage and strengthen bonds among officers, and they may lose much of their social support network. Retired officers also lose the prestige and status of being a police officer. They lose part of their identity. Furthermore, many retired officers have few skills beyond what was learned as a police officer, limiting post retirement job opportunities, especially jobs that carry the same status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611112465611">Caudill &amp; Peak, 2009</xref>). In essence, the “crisis” of retirement may bring with it negative health outcomes, potentially leading to premature death.</p>
<p>The findings of the study have several implications. First, additional attention to health concerns and issues among current and retired officers may be warranted in policy as well as in research. In particular, the physical and mental health and well-being of currently employed officers can have a significant impact on the organization (e.g., officer productivity, sick days, health insurance costs) to say nothing of the impact on officers themselves. The health of officers while employed may have implications for the health of officers after they retire, and ultimately for their longevity after retirement. Second, the findings inform discussions about appropriate retirement plans. Retirement plans that require officers to work longer (i.e., defined contribution benefit pension plans) will essentially shorten officers’ retirements even further. As such, “20 and out” or “25 and out” pension plans may have an empirical rationale. For equity purposes, police officers and other city employees should be able to enjoy similar retirement lengths. Finally, the findings also suggest the potential importance of retirement planning on the part of officers. Administrators should institute programs to help officers prepare for retirement, for life on the other side of the thin blue line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611112465611">Caudill &amp; Peak, 2009</xref>). Employer–sponsored employee preretirement programs result in numerous positive outcomes including better postretirement health, better social interactions, and a sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611112465611">Yen, Schultz, McDonald, Champagne, &amp; Edington, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While this study adds to what we know about retired police officers’ age at death and length of retirement, like other research in this area the study also has limitations. In particular, race, education, and lifestyle factors, issues known to be related to health and mortality outcomes, could not be examined in the study as these data were simply not available. Measures of lifestyle (including health habits), for example, may help determine if it is the work of police officers (i.e., stress) or other lifestyle related factors that lead to early death. This study also did not examine causes of death as these data were also not available. Future research that examines the causes of death could enhance our understanding of the differences between police officers and other occupations and help explain differences in mortality ages. The generalizability of the results also remains an issue. The context in which Detroit Police officers work is not typical of most departments in the country. Nonetheless, it is important to conduct analyses on individual police departments in order to consider the context in which police officers work. One may expect to find different results where the demands of the job are also different (and where the maladaptive behaviors may also vary). Indeed, future studies comparing departments of differing sizes and types are needed. For example, some police agencies have ongoing weight and physical fitness standards, whereas many others simply require officers to meet these standards at the time of hire. Finally, this study includes retired employees who died within a 15 year time frame. A longer time fame may provide a larger sample and greater confidence in the results.</p>
<p>Given the unique nature of the occupation, it seems plausible that officers would have shorter retirements and life spans, and the current study supports these notions. Yet, at present, we still know relatively little about police officers’ length of retirement or age at death. Continued research in this area may help to inform retirement policies, as well as preretirement planning and other health-related programs within police departments. Government leaders and police policy makers have an obligation to consider the health and welfare of their employees.</p>

<p>Research has shown that individuals who retire with “early retirements” are at risk of earlier mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611112465611">Hult et al., 2010</xref>). This is due not to the early retirement per se but to health issues before retirement, which may have led to early retirement. Indeed, as discussed below, analyses of the data here also showed that police officers who retired with “early retirement” and other “nonservice” classifications died at younger ages than officers who retired with regular “service” retirement designations.</p></fn>

<label>5.</label>
<p>It is necessary to control for age at retirement given that initial analyses revealed that police officers retired, on average, at significantly younger ages than general city employees. Specifically, police officers retired at an average of 53.2 years of age, compared to general city workers at 60.8 years of age. The reason that police officers retired at a younger age than general city employees is that, on average, police officers began their careers for the city at an earlier age than general city workers and police officers have earlier retirement eligibility.</p></fn>
