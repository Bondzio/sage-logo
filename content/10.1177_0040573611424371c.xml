<p><italic>Teaching Preaching as a Christian Practice: A New Approach to Homiletical Pedagogy</italic></p>

<p>This text is the product of a two-year consultation of 14 homiletics scholars, sponsored by the Wabash Center for Teaching and Learning in Theology and Religion. Divided into four sections, the consortium designed the text first to create an argument for preaching and teaching preaching as Christian practices. Next, they delve into a full range of necessary components to preaching and teaching. Third, through pedagogical assessment of preaching practices, the authors provide criteria and methods of assessment. Lastly, they offer an overview of curricular designs and fit of preaching courses in theological studies. Because the target audience is homiletics instructors the goal of the text is to serve as a resource in critical reflection on practices of preaching and of teaching preaching.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the increasing consideration of practices in practical theology to bear meaning-making activities, homiletic scholars here engage the discussion between practical theology and homiletic studies. They conceptualize the practice of preaching to involve basic, dominant features: practices entail actions; they are shared in common forms and goals; they are embedded with meanings; they involve intimate strategies and habitus; and they are guided by teleological purpose. These features not only shape what we learn about preaching traditions, they become the driving features of learning the practice and therefore teaching preaching practices. The reader will perceive these forces at play throughout the components of learning preaching (for example: exegeting the text, congregations, and social milieu, or sermon forms and delivery). Ultimately, these components of preaching practices not only comprise the curricular design, but serve to assess the learning activities.</p>
<p>With a focus on how the practices of preaching in contexts of faith communities may serve to shape the practices of learning and teaching preaching, this text argues for a reorientation of homiletics pedagogy. Their key distinction is that practices of preaching determine the learning activities and the instructive tools to teaching practices. Throughout this book the authors emphasize that “learning-centered” homiletics is an evolution extending from recent generations of the “learner-centered” approach to teaching preaching. It is worth noting that this distinction from the learner-centered approach appears to be a rather narrow or singular representation of its impact in recent homiletics, albeit an appropriate assessment of a major movement in the academy of homiletics. I wonder how a broader engagement of learner-centered traditions — like apprenticeship models of teaching and learning preaching in some church traditions — might actually reveal learning-centered approaches already fundamental as a robust foundation to build their argument for learning-centered teaching practices. Notwithstanding, the text offers a strong resource for understanding how the centrality of practices in practical theology may serve teaching practices and pedagogy of homiletics. Their exploration of teaching and learning rooted in contextual practice is extremely vital and instructive.</p>
