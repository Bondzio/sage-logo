<p>This new edition of a best-selling text book comes at an uncertain time for social workers in England. Poised to take advantage of the opportunities to enhance their practice by government social policy (of all parties) stressing choice and control and urging care at home, the profession faces a climate of resource constriction and some doubts over the value of employing social workers when non-qualified staff are cheaper.</p>
<p>This timely new edition of the book offers the opportunity to explore some of these challenges facing the profession. It is also able to reflect on the ways in which the proposed Professional Capabilities Framework for social workers may enhance social work practice with older people. The authors are keen to stress, and do so on several occasions, that there never was a ‘golden age’ of social work practice with older people. Their caution in how social workers should act, communicate and behave illustrates their awareness that practice has not always been respectful and anti-ageist.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two. The first half takes a broad gerontological perspective outlining elements of demography and morbidity that may lead some older people to encounter social workers. There is welcome attention to long-term conditions and to the accumulations of hearing and sight loss since these are important in heightening needs for social care. The second half discusses practice and the key tasks of social workers. Despite the ‘transformation’ advocated in English social care services, this account of practice makes it clear that social workers are still very likely to be engaged in assessment, support planning, monitoring and review. They may continue to be of assistance in helping individuals who are moving between home, care home, and hospitals. Such interfaces or transitions can be managed well but also roughly and insensitively.</p>
<p>It is the theme of continuity therefore that underpins much of this book and this means it has the potential to be useful beyond narrow service settings in England. Good practice seems remarkably timeless and while policy may change, supportive social work encounters may have a great deal of consistency. Social workers’ own professional roles have always been rather uncertain when working with older people and gerontological social work is limited as a concept or professional interest area in Europe compared to North America.</p>
<p>This is a welcome new edition of a readable textbook for students and practitioners alike. The format is broken up with case examples and research highlights. The case examples are highly relevant to practice although, in my view, more engagement with IT systems and records would be worth exploring.</p>
<p>It would be very encouraging if social work research had more to add to any further editions; for many of the research highlights captured in the text relate to services surrounding social work and the wider gerontological literature. One major limit to the development of social work practice with older people in the UK currently is its lack of a robust and rigorous research base. Calls to bring practice and research together do not always acknowledge that the research base is so thin. Such research needs to engage with older people to explore not only the wider social care market but to investigate the effect good social work could potentially have on their lives. Social workers may then be able to articulate their practice wisdom.</p>
