<abstract>
<p>Culturally responsive educational practices have arisen as effective means of increasing culturally diverse students’ academic achievement and psychological well-being; however, the relational processes involved are not well understood. Using grounded theory, this study examines the relational processes of one culturally responsive teacher and her fifth grade African American students.

It includes the connective interactions between the teacher and student, the connective interactions between the teacher and the whole class, and teacher transparency and joining. Rich descriptions of each theme are provided as well as implications for teacher practice and preparation.</p>

<p>African American students lag significantly behind their White peers on all standard measures of academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911429581">Aud et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, they are almost two times as likely to drop out of school as White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911429581">Aud et al., 2010</xref>) and are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911429581">Blair &amp; Scott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911429581">Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &amp; Peterson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085911429581">Skiba et al., 2008</xref>). Given these negative statistics, it is very easy to focus solely on the failures of teachers of African American students. Yet some teachers are highly effective in helping African American students achieve and thrive in school. Researchers studying the practices of such teachers report that these teachers use instructional methods that recognize and affirm the communication styles and cultural identities of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911429581">Foster, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911429581">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911429581">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">Foster, Lewis, &amp; Onafowora, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911429581">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>; Karunagan, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson Billings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911429581">Phuntsog, 1999</xref>). Labeled <italic>culturally responsive</italic> or <italic>culturally relevant teaching</italic>, these instructional methods capitalize on the students’ own social and cultural backgrounds to facilitate student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911429581">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy, Ross, Gallingane, &amp; Hambacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">Brown, 2004</xref>). Such efforts have been linked with academic gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911429581">Foster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">Foster et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911429581">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911429581">Pransky &amp; Bailey, 2002</xref>) as well as indications of improvements in the psychological well-being of culturally diverse students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911429581">Cummins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911429581">Diaz-Greenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Obviously, the particular instructional practices of such teachers differ depending on their students’ cultural affiliation. Murell, for example, describes three themes within African American culture that influence effective teachers’ practice: (1) communalism, (2) the epistemological belief that knowledge is socially constructed, and (3) verve, the high stimulation and energetic action of the culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911429581">Foster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911429581">King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, when working with African American students it may be important to understand communalism and how teaching and learning are a joint venture embarked on together as a family, with set traditions, practices, and ways of interacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). Moreover, African American students may not learn best when their learning is oriented to objects, but instead they learn and develop when their learning is focused toward people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). Finally, it may be important to account for verve, the African American cultural tendency toward high levels of stimulation to action, energy, and ability to tend to multiple concerns concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911429581">Berry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>). Consequently, teachers wanting to create a learning environment that integrates African American students’ culture might use multimodal teaching methods and multimedia in their instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only do highly effective teachers of African American children use culturally responsive instructional methods, researchers report that such teachers often use distinctive ways of structuring their social relationships with their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911429581">Brown, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085911429581">Weinstein, Curran, &amp; Tomlinson-Clarke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911429581">Weinstein, Tomlinson-Clarke, &amp; Curran, 2004</xref>). In her seminal works, Nel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911429581">Noddings (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085911429581">1992)</xref> introduced the “ethic of care” and emphasized the need for caring to be at the center of the education system. She highlighted the importance and complexity of teachers establishing caring relationships in which students are viewed as more important than any subject matter. Although Noddings and several of her contemporaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911429581">Birch &amp; Ladd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911429581">Brophy &amp; Good, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911429581">Wubbels, Brekelmans, &amp; Hooymayers, 1991</xref>) underscored the importance of the teacher–student relationship in improving students’ academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and positive experiences of school, there is a dearth of information about the distinctive ways that such teachers develop their relationships with their African American students. In the past, most researchers assumed that effective relational methods were applicable to all students regardless of income level or cultural background. Only recently have researchers begun to identify teaching methods and relational behaviors associated with specific groups of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911429581">Foster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">Foster et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911429581">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911429581">Pransky &amp; Bailey, 2002</xref>). At the current time, there is limited research available describing the relational behaviors of culturally responsive teachers of low-income, African American students and the responses of these students to the teachers’ behaviors. Foster and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">2003</xref>) noted that despite a growing body of literature justifying culturally responsive educational practices, it is often difficult to conceptualize what culturally responsive teachers are doing in the classroom.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the teacher–student relationship in enhancing student motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911429581">Furrer &amp; Skinner, 2003</xref>) and achievement, there is a need to examine the specific practices that highly effective teachers of African American children use to develop their relationships with their students. The purpose of this study was to examine the ways in which one highly successful teacher structured her relationships with her low-income, African American elementary school students. Two questions guided this research effort:</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>As the focus of the study was the examination of the interactions of a highly effective teacher with her low-income, African American students during their first days of school, the researchers sought to identify a teacher with a record of effectiveness with such students. The set of videotapes examined in the current study depicted a highly effective teacher of mathematics conducting lessons with her low-income, African American fifth-grade students in the first week of school during the 2006-2007 school year. These videotapes were recorded as a part of a professional development project sponsored by a Center for Learning associated with a college of education at a large university in the Southeastern United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042085911429581">
<title>Participant</title>
<p>Ms. M was invited to participate in the professional development project because of her demonstrated effectiveness in facilitating the academic achievement of her low-income, African American students. Each year, her students had some of the highest mathematics gains in the state’s standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911429581">Chun, 2008</xref>). Specifically, in the 2006-2007 school year, the year in which the videotapes were recorded, 56% of her fifth-grade students obtained mathematics scores on or above grade level on their fifth-grade test. Among the students attending her elementary school in fourth grade in the previous 2005-2006 school year, only 35% were on or above grade level in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911429581">Florida Department of Education, n.d.</xref>). This indicates a 21% increase in the number of students performing at or above grade level, assuming all other factors are the same. Empirical data regarding Ms. M’s impact on her students’ behavioral, social, and emotional development are not available, although members of the professional development project have noted her effectiveness in those areas as well (E. Peterek, personal communication, January 7, 2009).</p>
<p>Ms. M is an African American, fifth-grade teacher at a Title 1 school in north central Florida in which 65% of the school’s students qualified for free and reduced lunch. Ms. M holds her bachelor of arts in elementary education, and at the time the videotapes were made, she had been teaching for approximately 29 years. The videotapes depict her teaching of mathematics to a class of 50 fifth-grade students during the first week of school. (Because of her demonstrated effectiveness in teaching mathematics in the 2006-2007 school year, she was assigned to teach mathematics to all the fifth graders in the school). Thus, the students in the videotapes are from her homeroom class as well as another fifth-grade class. The teacher of the other fifth-grade class served as an assistant for Ms. M’s during her mathematics class. In addition, the videotapes depict the first week of school, and thus, although Ms. M’s students may have been aware of her reputation as a mathematics teacher in their school, the videos still reflect the initial stage of the relationship development process.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Due to the nature of the research questions, grounded theory was utilized for data analysis. The data analysis process was conducted primarily by the first author, with the fourth author serving as someone to check the biases of the first author and provide peer debriefing. The second and third authors served as consultants during the research design and data analysis phases. The videotaped data were examined by the first author and analyzed using the video analysis software, Studiocode (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.studiocodegroup.com">www.studiocodegroup.com</ext-link>). This software program combines the video with a timeline so that the researcher’s codes can be applied to instances or video segments. Thus, upon the completion of initial coding, the software has compiled a short “movie” of all of the instances of a particular code, facilitating the application of the constant comparative method.</p>
<p>The primary researcher followed the three specific phases of coding in grounded theory: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911429581">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911429581">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The researcher open-coded each video three different times, each time having a different focus: (1) teacher’s verbal actions, (2) teacher’s nonverbal actions, and (3) student responses to the teacher’s verbal and nonverbal actions. To ensure credibility and monitor researcher bias, the fourth author independently watched and coded the videos using a standardized coding sheet. The researcher and the research assistant then met to discuss their findings and to identify areas of agreement and disagreement. Following these meetings, the primary researcher used the constant comparative method to search for emerging themes, categories, subcategories, and their relationships with one another. This information became the basis for the emergent theory. The researcher then met independently with the second and third authors to discuss the theory and expound on and clarify the selected codes. She then met with the fourth author for peer debriefing to explain the initial theory and to receive feedback regarding whether the theory was grounded in the video data, to limit researcher bias and further refine the theory. Theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911429581">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) was reached upon examination of four 40-min videotapes</p>
<p>Throughout the data analysis process, steps were taken to facilitate the enhancement of trustworthiness and credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911429581">Golafshani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911429581">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). In describing the emergent themes the researcher also attempted to provide rich, thick descriptions to enhance the reader’s understanding of the “sending” context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911429581">Creswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911429581">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). The researcher also kept an audit trail and documented her reflections and process of interpreting data through the use of theoretical memos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911429581">Glaser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911429581">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911429581">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). In addition, the researcher used triangulation of the data analysis process and peer debriefing with the fourth author to promote trustworthiness and credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911429581">Creswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911429581">Golafshani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911429581">Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911429581">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Two separate research questions were originally posed in this study. The first question addressed how a culturally responsive teacher developed relationships with her low-income, African American students, and the second question addressed how she used her relationships with students to facilitate students’ learning. However, analysis of the teacher’s interactions with her students revealed that these relational operations were so intertwined that these two questions were most effectively answered as one question rather than two. Consequently, a theoretical schema was developed depicting three major dimensions of teacher–student relationship development. These dimensions were: emotional connectedness, facilitating conditions of relationship building, and students’ affective responses. The focus of this article is to describe how this teacher created emotional connectedness by depicting crucial relational processes. Knowledge of these specific relational processes can be helpful to both in- and pre-service teachers as they develop their own relational practices with low-income, African American elementary students.</p>
<sec id="section6-0042085911429581">
<title>Emotional Connectedness</title>
<p>The major dimension of emotional connectedness was conceptualized as the specific interactions that fostered a sense of attachment and emotional bonding between the teacher and the students. These interactions may be contrasted with interactions that generate emotional distance like nagging, reprimanding, harsh punishment, or shaming. Emotional connectedness has three critical themes: (1) the teacher’s connective interactions with his or her individual students, (2) teacher’s connective interactions with the class as a whole, and (3) teacher transparency and joining the classroom community.</p>

<title>Creating teacher–student connections</title>
<p>A significant theme of emotional connectedness was Ms. M’s use of a combination of interactions with individual students that built connections and bonding between teacher and student. The positive teacher–student interactions reflected in the video data can be categorized into four general sub-themes: (1) attending to individual students through listening intently and empathizing, (2) conveying a belief in students and holding high expectations for them, (3) reconnecting disengaged students, and (4) ensuring individual student’s success.</p>
<sec id="section8-0042085911429581">
<title>Attending to individual students</title>
<p>Attentiveness at the individual level related to how Ms. M actively acknowledged and attended to the thoughts, feelings, and personal needs of her individual students through her words and actions. For example, when interacting with students Ms. M leaned in and got at the student’s eye level instead of speaking to students from a standing position. She also expressed her desire to truly understand what the student was trying to say through her use of clarifying statements or questions: “What does that mean?” or “What did you say?” She also paraphrased what her students said and responded to individual students’ feelings and concerns. For example, when one of her students hurt his finger and thus was having difficulty writing Ms. M said, “Oh! Let me give him a band-aid. I need to give him a band-aid.” She walked toward the injured student and said, “If you can’t write it, don’t worry about it Zachary. You gotta put it in there later. Okay?” Though she continued to hold the expectation that the Zachary needed to get the work done, she simultaneously showed concern for him.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0042085911429581">
<title>Reengaging individual students</title>
<p>Regardless of the teacher and her ability to engage relationally and academically with her students, there are bound to be periods of student emotional or academic disengagement. Ms. M would not allow a student to distance him or herself, nor would she ignore the disengagement. Instead she responded quickly, actively attempting to reengage the distracted or emotionally withdrawn student yet avoiding using ridicule or punishment. The result of such efforts was the student’s reengagement. For example, when a student was staring off into the distance Ms. M touched his paper and gently said, “concentrate, concentrate,” and kept walking. The student paused and then began to write on his article. In this example and in others there was an absence of ridicule or punishment, but instead Ms. M gently but firmly reengaged the student to the academic task.</p>
<p>In other instances, Ms. M found it necessary to converse with individual students to get them back on track academically. One example involved a series of interactions between Ms. M and Ronald, a student who had been demonstrating difficulty in paying attention and understanding the mathematical material during instruction throughout the week as well as on test day. About 10 min into the test, Ronald was staring at his paper, with his pencil tucked behind his ear and with his chin in both hands. Ms. M walked up to him and said, “Take your hands down, get to work.” Two minutes later Ms. M returned to Ronald who was looking around the room and said, “Try it, try it. Concentrate. Concentrate.” He continued to just stare at the paper, look around the room, or tap his pencil to his finger. After about 10 min he tried to get her attention, and Ms. M leaned in to listen to him. Ronald shared, “I don’t know how to do this.” Ms. M looked him in the eye and asked, “Do you know your multiplication facts?” Ronald hesitantly replied, “yes.” Ms. M looked down at his test and asked, “What is seven and three, how are they related? What number times seven is twenty-one?” In response, Ronald whispered, “I don’t know” and looked down in his lap. Ms. M then said, “Instead of you out there on the cart asleep yesterday, you know what you should have had open,” as she pointed to his math journal. She proceeded to help him with two problems. Again he said he did not know the multiplication fact and she said, “That is why it is important to write your multiplication facts every day” and then helped him figure out the answer. She asked him, “You got it? Now you try one on your own.” Ronald leaned forward and started to work. Although Ronald was sitting quietly at his desk and not distracting his neighbors, Ms. M noticed his disengagement and actively attended to reengaging him and thus communicated to him that she valued his engagement, participation, and connection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0042085911429581">
<title>Believing in individual students</title>
<p>Ms. M repeatedly showed her individual students that she believed in their academic abilities and social capabilities through her words and her actions. She invited and encouraged her students to express their ideas and opinions and share their knowledge. In fact, most of the class time was spent in an interactive process between the students and the teacher. Ms. M consistently asked for volunteers from the class with the question, “Who wants to explain it?” She then had students go to the board and teach a concept like perimeter, or acknowledged, “I am sure you understand the prefix ‘un’.” In addition to encouraging student voice, Ms. M communicated her faith in individual student’s abilities to think critically. One of the ways she demonstrated this was by giving individual students extended time to think when answering a question. She allowed her students an opportunity to process the question and share the knowledge or information that she was confident the students possessed. In addition, Ms. M often pushed her students to examine the process by which they arrived at a correct answer. Frequently, if a student gave an answer, Ms. M questioned the individual even further by asking, “How did you come up with [X]?” or “How would you prove [X]?” The correct answer was not all that she was seeking, but instead comprehension and critical thinking. In another instance, when the other teacher in the classroom started to help another student on the test, Ms. M stopped the teacher saying, “No, no. He has to try.” The student looked up at her as Ms. M asks, “What does it say right here?” The student responded, “Give an example.” Ms. M continued, “For what? Define means give us the definition. You know what we have been going over every day.” The student nodded his head. Thus, Ms. M pushed him to figure it out on his own, conveying to him that she believed he had the capability within himself.</p>
<p>Often her beliefs in her students’ academic abilities were coupled with beliefs in the student’s ability to follow the rules and interact appropriately with others. Although students did not demonstrate discipline problems, Ms. M did redirect student’s behavior and guide individual students both verbally and nonverbally. Although she did not act vindictively or out of anger, Ms. M was very firm in her guidance, clearly expressing her dislike of certain behaviors and her expectation for a different behavior. The firmness and high standards was constant regardless of the behavior, and the redirecting of behavior was very fluid. When a student was leaning back in his chair with only two legs on the floor, she approached him, touched the chair, and said firmly, “Chair on the floor, pull it up,” and kept on walking. The student immediately did so and got back to work. She would direct silently as well, tapping the side of a student when he was sitting up on his knees in his chair. The student quickly responded and sat on his bottom. Although she had to guide students in this way, she also praised her students (though not excessively). For example, after administering a short pop quiz, she collected a student’s paper and looked at his answers as she kept walking. She turned back at the student and smiled at him as she took another student’s paper. She then turned and reached for his hand and shook it. She pointed at him and gave him a small smile, then gave him a “thumbs up” and smiled even wider.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042085911429581">
<title>Ensuring individual student success</title>
<p>Not only did Ms. M set high standards with regard to her students’ academics, she also took measures to attend to each individual student’s academic needs to help them meet the standards. She would not let a student fall behind and made sure that each individual student comprehended the material that was presented. Ms. M repeatedly asked, “Are there any questions?” And she followed up her words with actions. When a student raised his hand and said he did not understand volume, Ms. M stopped and returned to the board and explained the process of finding the volume again. She then checked in with the student to make certain that the student now understood. Absent from any of these interactions was any evidence of shaming or questioning concerning why the student did not understand. Ms. M took a direct approach to responding to wrong answers and correcting individual student’s incorrect answers. If a student gave a wrong answer she might say, “No sir” or “No ma’am” and move on to asking another student. Most of time she used their incorrect answer to facilitate the student’s learning. The following example depicts this facilitation.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ms. M [asking the whole class]:</speaker>
<p>What is six times nine?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>63</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Class:</speaker>

<speaker>Ms. M [Turns to student]:</speaker>
<p>My question is, you yelling out 63, how you coming up with</p>
<p>63? In your mind you are saying six times nine is what?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>63</p>

<speaker>Ms. M:</speaker>
<p>Is six times nine 63?</p>

<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>No</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ms. M [Turns to class and says empathically]:</speaker>
<p>Oh, so she made a mistake, so now what</p>
<p>is the answer?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Class:</speaker>
<p>54</p>

<speaker>Ms. M [Turns back to student]:</speaker>
<p>What is six times nine?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>54</p>
</speech>
<p>Ms. M’s focus on making sure the student knows and understands the correct answer conveyed to the student that it was important to Ms. M that the student know and understand the information. She also conveyed this message to individual students by her constant engagement and her consistent monitoring of the student’s progress. Ms. M never sat down or did her work while the students were engaged in another task. Instead Ms. M constantly walked around and checked on individual students’ work to ensure that individual students understood and completed their academic tasks, even guiding note taking with comments like, “You must write with a capital letter here.”</p>

<sec id="section12-0042085911429581">
<title>Creating teacher class connection</title>
<p>A surprising finding was that in addition to interactions between the teacher and individual students that built a sense of emotional bonding, Ms. M also engaged in connection-enhancing interactions with the class as a whole. Although these interactions were similar to those with individual students, there were also some unique aspects that enhanced the teacher’s emotional connection to her class. She emphasized the importance of the individual student as part of the class as a whole. The five general subthemes of creating teacher class connection include (1) defining the class as a community, (2) attending to the class as a whole, (3) believing in the class, (4) ensuring the success of the class, and (5) using the class’s funds of knowledge and culture.</p>
<sec id="section13-0042085911429581">
<title>Defining the class as a community</title>
<p>Ms. M stressed the collectivistic nature of the class and conveyed a commitment to building a relationship with the entire class. At the outset she showed the class she valued the class’s input in the learning process by prompting the class with, “Tell me some things that you might want to learn in math.” She communicated that the learning process was to be engaged in together, a value that is emphasized in African culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). The centrality of the class as a community was further underscored by how Ms. M attended to the inclusion of every student and in doing so indicated the importance of each student as part of the class. Due to the large number of students in her class, some students had to sit at tables at the edge of the room and had to turn to face the board. On the first day Ms. M went around the room and touched base with these students to make sure they could see the board.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Ms. M always made sure that students had their basic materials, providing pencils and paper for the students as needed, and even asking the students to share their own materials with one another. She would not begin until every student was prepared, thus not leaving any one student behind. Similarly, at one point a student was struggling with the concept of perimeter, and Ms. M encouraged two students to help, asking, “So can you explain it to him? What ways can you show him to help him understand about perimeter?” Ms. M created an environment in which it was expected that student members of the classroom community would provide for one another whether it be physically or through helping each other instructionally. In another instance she asked a student for the definition of perimeter and he hesitated to give an answer and she asked, “You know the definition for perimeter?” The student looked down at the desk and then shook his head “no.” She directed the rest of the class to help him when she stated, “Alright, let’s give him the definition again, what is perimeter class?” Although she could have given him the definition herself, by her questioning this teacher conveyed to her class that it was important that every member of the class understood the material when she stopped the entire class to go over material again when one student did not understand a concept. She then checked in with the student afterward, “Now do you understand?” Once, the student said, “yes,” Ms. M continued the lesson.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0042085911429581">
<title>Attending to the class as a whole</title>
<p>Ms. M demonstrated skills in assessing and attending to the emotional and cognitive states of her class as a whole. She was attuned to her class’s engagement with and mastery of the academic material and expressed empathy toward the class’s experience. At times the students began to drop in their energy level or could be seen displaying body language that could be perceived as conveying boredom. Instead of ignoring this and continuing, Ms. M shows that she cares about the class’s experience by acknowledging their feelings. For example, she empathized with them one day by saying, “I know you get tired of the lessons over and over and over again, but it is important that we do it over and over again. Alright?” She also showed them she understood how difficult the material could be and that she cared about their struggle by saying, “It’s okay for you not to understand but you have to let me know.” Her attentiveness to her class was demonstrated by her flexibility with regard to lesson plans, recognition of the need to review material more extensively, or judgments concerning the class’s comprehension of the information. At one point, most of the students chorally responded giving the incorrect definition of an “un-like fraction.” She stopped them, recognizing their confusion and said, “Take a deep breath. In. Out. In. Out,” as she made hand motions indicating when to breathe in and out. The students responded by taking deep breaths, with some students doing so exaggeratedly. She then told them to close their eyes or put their heads on the desk, which they did. She then said, “Think of ‘un’. What does ‘un’ mean to you?” The students with their eyes still closed shouted, “Not.” Ms. M then said, “Now give me the definition for unlike fractions. Take a deep breath before you give it to me please.” Through this interaction with the class Ms. M, and the examples described above, Ms. M demonstrated that she was attuned to the students’ experience in her classroom and was willing to be responsive to their needs and feeling states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085911429581">
<title>Believing in the whole class</title>
<p>Not only did Ms. M. demonstrate in the teaching process her belief in individual students, she also communicated that she believed in her class’s abilities and potential. She communicated that she expected the best, accepted no excuses, and emphasized the class’s responsibility for their own learning. In addition, she supportively challenged and encouraged the students to work harder, go faster, and achieve more. Therefore, she conveyed that it was not just individual students who needed to do well and reach high standards, the entire class needed to do the same. Ms. M let her class know from the outset, “I accept no excuses.” She reemphasized this and her high expectations when she told the class a story about the past year’s students. “Some of them came in last year, ‘I had to go to the hospital to see my aunt’ and then I asked the question, ‘were you the doctor? Did you take care of your aunt?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then maybe you can sit in the waiting room and do your homework assignment.’ I accept no excuses. . . . When I give you an assignment this is what I expect for you to do. Bring your assignment.” At one point she asked the class to chorally provide the definition of a mathematical term. Only a few students responded and then tapered off. She announced to the class, “We are going to have to do better than that. Read it again.” Because Ms. M believed in the capabilities of her students and expected the best from her class, she encouraged and supportively challenged her class to push themselves beyond what they felt they were capable of doing. This would take the form of challenging them to write faster, write more clearly, state the correct answer, or just participate more actively.</p>
<p>As her class met the demands and high standards she set for them, Ms. M. affirmed the strengths and progress of the entire class. She commented on the class’s efforts through giving compliments and words of praise to the class as a whole and showing excitement and pleasure in her class’s accomplishments. She not only praised the class but also stressed that she believed the students should be proud of themselves as well. Although Ms. M did not give numerous compliments and praise to individual students, she did compliment the class as whole. Typically this consisted of brief statements such as “very good,” “good job,” and “alright!” or clapping for the class. She had the students recognize their own advancement by repeatedly telling them, “Give yourself a hand” or even “Give yourself a hand because you have really done a super job.” Ms. M also tended to point out how far the class had come. On the first day she commented, “You are starting off at day one learning how to do mixed numbers, very good.” Ms. M not only noted how far they had come but how much further they could go. For example, when the class repeatedly was getting answers correct, she said, “If you are getting this on day four can you imagine by the end of the year what you will have going for yourself?” The process of looking for, finding, and complimenting strengths demonstrated her investment in her class, and her high standards demonstrated her faith in their capabilities and potential. The expression of these positive messages created numerous opportunities for positive teacher–class interactions to build on in developing a relationship between the teacher and the class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085911429581">
<title>Ensuring the class’s success</title>
<p>Much in the same way that Ms. M ensured that every individual student was making progress academically, she also did the same with the entire class. As indicated, Ms. M used the student’s seatwork time to walk around and check on individual student’s progress. At the same time she was able to gauge the class’s progress as a whole. For example, when Ms. M was walking around the classroom checking what students were writing in their math journals, she announced, “We need to practice our writing.” She also both gauged the class’s readiness and their engagement by checking in with her students. Ms. M often asked her class, “Are we ready?” These questions were not a formality. Ms. M expected the entire class to answer. Once when she asked, “Are you ready?,” only some students answered quietly, “yes.” She asked again much louder and waved her hands back and forth in front of her and exclaimed, “Are you ready?” The class shouted back, “Yes.” Ms. M sighed and said, “Okay, I thought at one time you weren’t ready.”</p>
<p>Similar to checking the class’s readiness and engagement as described previously, Ms. M would also maintain the class’s engagement by giving directives to either direct the class’s focus or continue the class’s participation (e.g., asking the students to “read what you have again” or directing them by saying, “Eyes on the board”). Ms. M also checked the class’s understanding and comprehension of the material throughout the class period by asking, “Let me see the hands of those students who understand.” Therefore, Ms. M expressed, by what she said and what she did, that she was invested in the success of her class as a whole. Ms. M reemphasized to the class on multiple occasions that they could and should ask questions if they were unsure of something, even pleading with the students saying, “Please if you don’t understand the math, stop me at some point.” She took measures to repeatedly check that her class was paying attention and ready, check her class’s comprehension, and direct her class’s focus. Because the class was a community, no one was allowed to fall behind. To make certain that this did not happen, she monitored the entire class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0042085911429581">
<title>Using the class’s funds of knowledge and culture</title>
<p>Although instructional methods and pedagogy were not the focus of this research study, Ms. M had positive interactions with her class and developed relationships with her class through the way she taught information and used her relationships in the learning process. Ms. M used the existing skills and competencies that the group had obtained from their families, their communities, and their experiences as a basis for the way in which she structured her class and taught new material.</p>
<p>Ms. M used the class’s knowledge bases and competencies as a foundation from which to present information. Ms. M built upon the strong emphasis of family and kin within the African American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murell, 2002</xref>). One example of this was when she had the problem; “3/9 of 27 = ” written up on the board. She pointed to the 9 and the 27 and asked the class, “Are these numbers in the same family? Are they related?” and later when discussing similar problems stated, “We talk about family and talk about how they are related.” She also used family terms to teach the class the concept of least common multiple. She wrote “½ + ¼ = ” on the board and referring to the 2 and 4 said, “They are in the same family but you are going to pick the oldest child. Looking at ½ plus ¼ in your mind, who is the oldest?” The class replied, “four.” By connecting the material to the family she showed that she cared enough to relate the material to what is relevant and pertinent to their lives.</p>
<p>Ms. M also made mathematics relevant by incorporating music and beats into her classrooms as a bridge to teaching and solidifying mathematical concepts. For example, she taught the students how to change a mixed number to a fraction using a beat. Thus, if the mixed number is 3 ½, the “mixing it up” would proceed as follows: “two (snap) times three (snap) equals six (snap) plus one (snap) equals seven (snap) over two (snap).” Ms. M would then say, “huh?” and they were to repeat “seven over two.” She repeated the same problem over and over so that the class learned the rhythm, and once they perfected that she played a CD that had the same rhythm. The students used this CD to practice changing mixed numbers to improper fractions every day. In addition to using the music and the beat, Ms. M also combined dance and performance with the course content. She called it “dancing with math” or the “math dance.” Each dance move corresponded to a mathematical concept. For example, for “parallel” the students put their hands straight up in the air above their heads. For a line the students put each hand straight out at the shoulder level with their hands open. For a line segment, it is the same motion, but their hands were closed in a fist. She also taught them angles within “dancing with math.” To reinforce the concept of a right angle and where their hands should be positioned she related a right angle to cheerleaders when they say, “give me an L.” Thus, when she asks them to do the movement of right angle, she prompted them with, “What do cheerleaders say?” and she responded by keeping her hands in the position of a right angle and exclaimed in a teenager’s voice, “Give me an L!”</p>
<p>Lastly, Ms. M also incorporated the communication styles of oral storytelling, narratives, and call and response as well as incorporating performance into their classrooms, all of which are common aspects of African American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911429581">Foster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). Ms. M used call and response throughout her teaching by asking questions and having the students respond chorally. Ms. M would often act out points that she was trying to make, but perhaps more importantly, she created opportunities for the students to perform as well. As mentioned, some ways Ms. M did this was through having the students dance, sing, and change mixed numbers into improper fractions with the music. She also called students to the board to demonstrate concepts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0042085911429581">
<title>Being transparent and joining</title>
<p>The third theme that emerged as an integral component to emotional connectedness was Ms. M’s willingness to share herself with her students and actively join the community of learners. Joining was conceptualized as the process in which Ms. M minimized the separation between herself and the students, such that the she too became a member of the class community alongside her students. Although a hierarchy between teacher and student was maintained, Ms. M slightly flattened that hierarchy. Rather than disclosing personal information about herself to the students Ms. M joined with the students in multiple ways. She physically joined the students by dancing and singing along with her students. Moreover, she joined by voicing her thought processes, being playful and joking with her students, and revealing her fallibility.</p>
<sec id="section19-0042085911429581">
<title>Voicing her thought process</title>
<p>Ms. M did not separate herself from her students by acting as the “all knowing” teacher who kept information from his or her students; instead, she verbalized her thinking and provided insight into what, how, and why she thought certain things. Specifically, she revealed her thought processes with regard to her reasoning for her actions and her plans for the class. Absent from the teaching of Ms. M was the phrase “because I said so.” Alternatively, she expressed her reasoning behind her behaviors, decisions, and procedures. For instance, Ms. M did not just tell her class to keep their chairs pulled up but explained on multiple occasions, “Make sure you pull your chairs up because I do walk.” Ms. M voiced her thinking most frequently with regard to the reasoning behind her teaching procedures. In one instance, the class messed up when reciting a definition, and Ms. M stated in response, “Now you see why we have to keep going . . . why we have to go over and over. Some of you say I understand, but at this point you do not understand. That is why it is very important that we go over and over and over and over.” Ms. M also shared her thought processes concerning what was to come next in the class. Through this the class knew what Ms. M was going to do next and/or the plans the teacher had for them. For instance, Ms. M shared her plans regarding class time: “We are going to move on to something else,” “Next thing we are going to do is the math dance,” and “We are going to have to keep reviewing until you understand what unlike fractions mean.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0042085911429581">
<title>Sharing her imperfections</title>
<p>Paralleling her tendency to share her thought processes with her class, Ms. M. also revealed her imperfections to her students or allowed her students to teach and/or correct her. Consequently, she disclosed to their students that she was not “all knowing,” that she too made mistakes, and at times needed assistance. For example, Ms. M was up at the board referring to a problem on the board and asked the class, “What is five times two?” The students hesitated, and Ms. M looked at the board and saw that the board read “5 X 6.” She said, “I mean five times six. I’m sorry.” By Ms. M’s acceptance of correction and disclosures of mistakes, she stepped off the pedestal of “teacher” and potentially became more relatable to the students as just a human being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0042085911429581">
<title>Being playful</title>
<p>The students were given insight into Ms. M’s personality through her playful interactions with her students. Although she was committed to her students’ learning and was serious when needed, she also made sure to have fun and laugh in the process. Whether it was through playfulness in presenting and checking comprehension of an academic topic or joking with students as a way of breaking the ice, Ms. M periodically interspersed her class periods with humor and laughter. Ms. M revealed her lighter side when she shared her views on learning and teaching by disclosing, “Learning is noisy and I am noisy.” Not only was Ms. M willing to get noisy in her interactions with the students and let them be noisy when she asked for it, but Ms. M also joked playfully with her students in the context of academics. She asked her students one day, “Let me see the hands of those who have learned something so far.” All of the students raised their hands. Ms. M waved her hands in front of her, scrunched up her face smiling and said, “Oh boy am I good,” as she snapped her fingers. Ms. M also tried to playfully trick her students on a number of occasions. For example, she was checking the class’s comprehension of numerator and denominator. She would say, “top,” and they were supposed to respond, “numerator” conversely; when she said, “bottom,” they were to respond, “denominator.” She was quizzing them saying “top” and “bottom” repeatedly, and the students were responding correctly, and then with a small smile, she tricked them by saying “numerator,” and the students repeated “numerator” instead of “top.” Ms. M smiled widely and said, “Ahhhh,” and the class laughed and smiled at their mistake.</p>
<p>In summary, the major dimension of emotional connectedness that emerged from the data reveals how Ms. M emotionally bonded with her students through teacher–student connections, teacher–class connections, and transparency and joining. Ms. M developed one-on-one relationships with individual students through a series of connection-building interactions interwoven in her instruction and communication of her investment in her students’ lives. Similarly, she expressed her investment in the class as a whole as she reemphasized the class as a community and created a communalistic atmosphere in which high expectations were held for the entire class. How Ms. M developed relationships with her students appeared to be tied to her willingness to share herself and become a part of the community of learners.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To illustrate the major dimension of emotional connectedness, rich descriptions of how a culturally responsive teacher interacted with and communicated with her students were provided. The themes and subthemes of emotional connectedness will be discussed regarding their relevance and how they relate to existing research. Prior to discussing the findings, however, the researchers would like to note that although the findings presented in this research study depict the culturally responsive practices of one teacher, this teacher was not perfect and she too struggled in the classroom. The work of culturally responsive teachers is a very challenging and labor-intensive process and the practices depicted in the findings have been developed and refined over time. In addition, the findings are discussed in relation to low-income, African American students. However, many of these practices (e.g., attending to students and the class, reengaging individual students, ensuring individual students and class’s success, voicing thought processes, sharing imperfections, and utilizing culture) can be applied to all students. Thus, they could potentially be common practice for all teachers.</p>

<title>Teacher–Student and Teacher–Class Connections</title>
<p>Although the research literature repeatedly talks about the importance of the teacher–student relationship and its connection to positive student academic outcomes, some teachers are unsure as to how caring for students can be implemented in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911429581">Weinstein et al., 2004</xref>). As pointed out by Weinstein and her colleagues, teachers often conceptualize caring and relationships in “warm, fuzzy terms” in which they are supposed to be only nurturing, nice, and not push the students too hard. In addition, teachers cite numerous obstacles to such relationship building like having many students, the focus on standardized testing, and the demand to cover the curriculum within a shorter time frame. However, the findings of the current study demystify the relationship-building process.</p>
<p>Ms. M revealed that developing a relationship with students entails connecting not only with individual students but also with the class as a whole. She depicts multiple ways of connecting with students, and thus, demonstrated flexibility in how teachers might be culturally responsive in developing their relationships. This does not mean that already busy teachers have to add another task to their days. Ms. M showed that relationship building is not a separate task that a teacher does in addition to teaching. Instead, her relationships with students were developed in the context of the teaching process, echoing the assertions made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911429581">Noddings (1984)</xref> regarding soliciting answers from students. She notes how caring can be involved in the teacher’s intentional “receiv[ing] not just the response but the student . . . she is not seeking the [just] the answer but the involvement of the cared for” (p. 176). Thus, it is not always necessary to set aside time to “build a relationship” with a student or the class. Instead, relationships can be built through a series of positive teacher–student or teacher–class interactions that occur naturally in the classroom. The teacher–class connections that emerged from the data of Ms. M’s classroom depicted communalism, a central feature of African American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). Although each student was seen as an individual and relationships were built with individual students, she also stressed the significance of the individual student as a member of the class as a whole and their connections among one another. Through her actions, Ms. M emphasized the concept: “I am because we are; and because we are, therefore, I am” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911429581">Mbiti, 1970</xref>), a phrase that reflects the collectivistic nature of African Americans. Consequently, she took measures to emphasize that her class existed as a community and that she was invested in the class community.</p>
<p>Ms. M’s ability to balance attending to her individual students and the class as a whole while still implementing her lesson plans appears to be a relevant skill set of culturally responsive teachers. For her, attending to students included taking the time to listen carefully to the thoughts and feelings of individual students as well as assessing and responding to the emotional and cognitive states of the class as a whole. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911429581">Noddings (1984)</xref> calls such attentive listening being “receptive” to and “engrossed” in the student. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">Brown (2004)</xref> has noted that such listening is a powerful way of establishing relationships with individual students. There is an absence in the literature regarding how teachers are attentive to their class as a whole, and yet this was an area in which Ms. M responded in terms of the class’s level of engagement, understanding of the material, and need to adjust lesson plans. Given that low-income, culturally diverse students, particularly African American students, can be marginalized and discriminated against in schools settings, being truly listened to and having one’s feelings recognized may be significant.</p>
<p>One of the subthemes that was particularly evident in the data with both teacher–student interactions and teacher–class interactions relates to the teacher’s messages about the belief in and her high expectations for her individual students and her class. This parallels the existing culturally responsive literature that has highlighted the importance of holding high expectations for African American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911429581">Brown, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>). Bondy and her colleagues (2007) have noted that caring is demonstrated when teachers expected their students to succeed and communicated their belief in their students. Believing in students and holding high expectations may serve to motivate students and help them believe in themselves as learners and capable human beings. This is crucial to their ability to achieve academically and set and reach goals.</p>
<p>Although the expression of these expectations and beliefs in the abilities of individual students and the class were evident, Ms. M went beyond merely stating these expectations. Not only did she provide her students with encouragement and support, but she also challenged them to meet her high expectations. She demonstrated a willingness to do everything in her power to help her students succeed. This intensity and commitment to African American students may be related to the teachers’ own African heritage and the African American philosophy of education. This philosophy is rooted in the historical struggle of African Americans beginning with their enslavement and prevention from receiving an education. The philosophy highlights the importance of education in the statement, “freedom for literacy and literacy for freedom,” as education was linked to African Americans’ ability to view their identity as a free people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911429581">Perry, 2003</xref>). It is important to note that whether a teacher is African American or not, he or she can still fully commit him or herself to their students’ success. This wholehearted investment can serve as the extra push that a student or a group of students need and appears essential for relationship development. The students’ experience of the teachers’ commitment to them and their learning can facilitate the students’ reciprocal commitment to the teacher, their relationship, and the learning process.</p>
<p>An area that is heavily discussed within culturally responsive pedagogy relates to the use of culturally diverse students’ existing knowledge, culture, skills, and competencies in instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911429581">Nieto, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085911429581">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911429581">King, 2004</xref>). The relational aspects of culturally responsive educational practices are often relegated to the use of culturally congruent communication styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911429581">Brown, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911429581">Gay, 2000</xref>). Ms. M used instructional methods and communication styles that were based in the African American cultural theme of verve and communalism, including the use of dance and music, performance, storytelling, verbal expressiveness, and call and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911429581">Foster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911429581">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911429581">Perry, 2003</xref>). She also built upon the strong emphasis of family and kin within the African American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911429581">King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murell, 2002</xref>). Ms. M’s effort to connect the curriculum, and school in general, to the students’ lives and knowledge base reflects a relational component and a basis for relationship development. The use of culturally responsive pedagogical methods involves the teachers knowing their students and their students’ community. It also involves investing the time and energy into creating culturally responsive lessons that facilitate their low-income, African American students’ achievement and overall success. Furthermore, in making these efforts Ms. M affirmed her students’ culture and lived experience and conveyed a desire to make the students’ learning experience a positive one in which the students can maintain and build their cultural identity.</p>

<title>Being Transparent and Joining</title>
<p>Concepts relating to teacher transparency have been discussed in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911429581">hooks (1994)</xref> as she relates the importance of the teacher maintaining his or her sense of self and sharing of him or herself with his or her students. This idea is integral to the dimension of emotional connectedness that emerged from this study’s findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that culturally responsive teachers are personal with their students, but they related this to teachers sharing information about their personal lives and using humor. However, the current findings indicate that teacher transparency goes beyond sharing personal information and involves, as noted by hooks, sharing themselves in terms of their thought processes, imperfections, and their playfulness. Ms. M revealed herself to her students so that the students not only know facts about her but also know her as a human being with thoughts, feelings, and fallibilities.</p>
<p>Ms. M made an effort to join with the class community instead of remaining as a separate entity. Therefore, it appeared that the teacher no longer conceptualized it as “me and my students” but as “we.” The “we” is again part of an emphasis on communalism and the belief in the interconnectedness of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911429581">Boykin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911429581">King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911429581">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). It also reflects the African-centered epistemological belief in socially constructed learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911429581">Hale, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911429581">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>), that it is not just students who learn from teachers but that teachers can learn from students as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911429581">hooks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911429581">Murrell, 2002</xref>). Consequently, in the act of being transparent and joining the classroom community, the teacher is presenting him or herself not only as a teacher but also as a relatable human being who demonstrates a desire for an authentic relationship with his or her students.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the process of joining and being transparent does not necessitate eliminating the hierarchy that exists between the teacher and the student, nor does it require the teacher to abandon his or her authority. Researchers have noted that maintaining authority is important in culturally responsive practices with African American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911429581">Bondy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911429581">Brown, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911429581">2004</xref>), as Ms. M was able to do. Thus, these findings suggest that there might be a critical balance between being transparent while simultaneously upholding one’s authority.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0042085911429581">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are some limitations inherent in the study’s design and methodology. First, the sole form of data collection used in the study was the series of videotaped observations of Ms. M teaching her class of students. Unfortunately, Ms. M. died unexpectedly and hence was not available for member checking or additional interviewing. This limited methodological triangulation, as no additional information as to her purpose, intentionality, or awareness of her behavior was available. Moreover, the design of the study limited the opportunity for member checking to increase credibility or triangulation with other data sources to increase trustworthiness. The videotapes analyzed for this study depicted interactions of one teacher and her low-income, African American fifth-grade students. Consequently, the findings are specific to one teacher and one class of fifth-grade students. Ms. M was an African American teacher teaching African American students; thus, it cannot be determined whether sharing similar cultural values and experiences influenced how she developed and used the relationships to facilitate learning. Moreover, as she is a woman, it is difficult to ascertain the role of gender within the relational processes. Also, this study focused on the initial relationship development between Ms. M and her students during the first week of school and thus may not be representative of the teacher–student interactions that take place throughout the rest of the year. Finally, although measures were taken by the primary researcher to limit researcher biases through the use of theoretical memos, peer debriefing, and triangulation of the interpretive process, the researcher was the primary investigator, and thus, her subjectivity and bias in all likelihood influenced the data analysis process. For example, the researcher was not looking for negative processes of relationship development that may have been present or for practices that actually perpetuate educational hegemony.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0042085911429581">
<title>Implications for Teacher Preparation and Practice</title>
<p>The findings of the current study on the key aspects of teacher–student relationship development also have implications. In particular, these findings suggest implications for the preparation of teachers as well as for current teacher practice. The importance of cultural competency and multicultural awareness is evident throughout the findings of the current study. In order for teachers to truly believe in their students and hold high standards for their students, they need to explore and challenge their biases and deficit-based assumptions regarding low-income, culturally diverse populations.</p>
<p>To facilitate developing the teachers’ increased awareness and the skills in working responsively with culturally diverse students, there should be increased multicultural coursework required for teacher certification. Such coursework would provide teachers with more training regarding culturally responsive educational practices and their implementation, including opportunities to observe teachers using culturally responsive instructional methods and relational practices. The coursework must go beyond content, however and move toward intensive teachers’ self-exploration of their own privilege, prejudices, and beliefs as well as an analysis of the Eurocentric basis to the U.S education system. This is a crucial step; otherwise teachers may acquire the multicultural knowledge without integrating it into their educational worldview and practice. This tendency to fail to integrate multicultural knowledge by some may be an indicator that teaching culturally diverse students requires a commitment to continual acknowledgment of the role that culture plays in learning and a commitment to teaching in a way that bridges the culture of the school with the student’s home culture. Consequently, teacher training may need to promote a paradigm in which teachers are seen as social change agents versus maintainers of the status quo where Eurocentric cultural norms and practices are dominant.</p>
<p>There are also important implications for teacher practice. There is clearly much to be learned from effective teachers and their ability to implement culturally responsive educational practices and build relationships with their students. Consequently, school districts need to identify particularly effective culturally responsive teachers and compensate them to mentor new teachers. This mentorship should include an opportunity for the mentees to observe their mentors during the school day to learn from their instruction methods and relational practices. In addition to the observation period, opportunities must be provided in which the observers can dialogue with and question the master teacher on his or her practices. This should be followed up by chances for the master teacher to observe the new teachers and provide feedback. Such mentorship would give new teachers concrete examples of culturally responsive educational practices and the chance to discuss these practices and their implementation with teachers who have successfully done so. Similarly, schools should invest in hiring an extra staff person, perhaps a former master teacher, who could serve as a consultant regarding the culturally responsive pedagogical practices and lesson plans. This person could work alongside the school counselor who collaboratively consults with teachers concerning culturally responsive relationship development. Last, schools should require that teachers and other school personnel participate in professional development activities that center on increasing teachers’ cultural awareness and the development and implementation of culturally responsive educational practices within their classrooms.</p>
<p>The findings of the study emphasize and describe the relational component of culturally responsive educational practices with low-income, African American students. Although teachers have an established knowledge base in terms of relationship building, this is a particular expertise of school counselors. Moreover, school counselors also receive extensive multicultural training. Consequently, it is advisable that teachers pair with their school counselors concerning culturally responsive relationship development. Acting as coexperts, the teacher and counselor can combine their expertise to create culturally responsive classrooms in which all students succeed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0042085911429581">
<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>In addition to the implications for practice and theory, the results of this study suggest implications for research. Using videotapes of a highly effective teacher of African American students, the researcher was able to gain an abundance of data regarding the relationship-building processes of Ms. M with her low-income, African American students. The analysis of the videotapes was enhanced by the software program Studiocode. This software simplifies the qualitative data analysis process of videos by allowing researchers to code instances within the video of certain behaviors. This gives the researchers the capability of viewing all of the instances within a code such that the instances can be compared and contrasted as well as more richly defining the code itself. Moreover, one could also use this software to examine frequencies of behaviors by counting instances of behaviors, the total time of certain behaviors, and the percentage of total time of the video. Given the numerous capabilities of the software and the wealth of data its videotapes can provide researchers in education and in counseling, the Studiocode software appears to have the potential to facilitate future qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method research surrounding culturally responsive teachers and beyond. The major dimension of emotional connectedness that emerged describes how one culturally responsive teacher developed and used her relationship with the students to facilitate learning.</p>
<p>As a result, future research should be conducted to determine whether the themes and subthemes of the theory can be applied to other teachers engaged in teaching low-income, African American students in other contexts. In particular, it is important that researchers investigate the relational processes used by culturally responsive teachers of a variety of academic subjects and at different educational levels. Such studies may reveal that a teacher’s relational practices vary based on the age of the student or the academic subject matter. Also, given the large percentage of White or Latino teachers and the fact that the current study examined the relational processes of one African American teacher, a similar study needs to be conducted examining how culturally responsive White, Latino, Native American, and/or Asian American teachers develop and use relationships with their low-income, African American students to see whether the findings differ. Similarly, future research should examine the relational practices of culturally responsive teachers with other culturally diverse student groups as well as with English language learners.</p>
<p>As discussed, culturally responsive educational practices have been linked to increases in culturally diverse students’ academic achievement and decreases in problematic classroom behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">Foster et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911429581">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911429581">Pransky &amp; Bailey, 2002</xref>). However, teachers are often determined to be effective and culturally responsive based on peer or administrator nomination. Teachers’ effectiveness with culturally diverse populations has been substantiated through students’ scores on achievement tests as well as teacher reports or parent reports of student performance and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911429581">Foster et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911429581">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911429581">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911429581">Pransky &amp; Bailey, 2002</xref>). Such assessments indirectly suggest a teachers’ cultural responsiveness but do not quantitatively measure the teachers’ culturally responsive educational practices. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate a classroom-based observation rubric that teachers could use to self-assess the extent to which they feel that they are engaging in culturally responsive practices in their classrooms. A rubric could serve as a professional development tool for teachers and as a medium through which school counselors might consult with teachers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the midst of the discrepancies in academic achievement, special education, and behavioral referrals between low-income, African American students and their more privileged White peers, there are culturally responsive teachers whose low-income, African American students are excelling. Given the importance of the teacher–student relationship, as indicated in the literature, it is important to explore what these teachers do to build and use their relationships to facilitate learning. Based on the analysis of videotapes of one culturally responsive master teacher, it appears that emotional connectedness is a key piece in relationship development. Emotional connectedness includes not only the teacher’s connective interactions with individual students but also a focus on the class as a whole. It also includes the teacher’s willingness to be transparent and to share her thoughts as well as show her playful side. These findings are important given that they yield new information regarding how a highly effective teacher built relationships with her students and how such relational processes may be cultivated by both pre-service and in-service teachers.</p>
