<p>John C. Poirier, in ‘The Roll, the Codex, the Wax Tablet and the Synoptic Problem’ (<italic>JSNT</italic> 35.1: 3-30), argues that Synoptic source critics, particularly F. Gerald Downing and Robert A. Derrenbacker, Jr, have exaggerated and misrepresented the problems with Luke’s use of Matthew on the Farrer Hypothesis, as well as failed to consider the role that the medium of wax tablet may have played in Luke’s use of Matthew on that theory. However, in several areas, Poirier’s argument is problematic, misleading and in need of revision.</p>

<body>
<p>I am always pleased when a colleague takes my work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13480082">Derrenbacker 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13480082">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13480082">2011</xref>) in the Synoptic Problem seriously, as John C. Poirier did in a recent issue of <italic>JSNT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>), for the Synoptic Problem remains an esoteric subset of an already esoteric guild. I am also pleased that Poirier agrees with my fundamental thesis, namely that Synoptic source critics need to take seriously the ways in which ancient writers worked with source material and the mechanics of ancient book production. However, Poirier does take F. Gerald Downing and me to task in our arguments that, on the Farrer Hypothesis (FH), particularly as articulated by Michael Goulder,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13480082">1</xref></sup> Luke’s use of Matthew makes little sense mechanically and is inconsistent with what we know about ancient compositional practices. Instead, Poirier concludes that ‘Farrer’s and Goulder’s shared vision of Luke is completely at home in the ﬁrst-century world, as are those aspects distinct to Goulder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>Poirier’s argument focuses on my contention that Luke’s reverse re-contextualization of Mt. 25–16 at Lk. 13.22–18.8, particularly as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13480082">Goulder (1984)</xref>, is inconsistent with ancient compositional practices and is mechanically problematic. In response, he offers three basic points, all of which I will address. First, there are, in fact, examples of ancient authors working backwards through a source (scroll) text, as Luke is doing with Matthew; it is not so anachronistic as I make it out to be. Second, my contention that the posture of ancient writers impacted what could be accomplished and the non-existence of writing desks are exaggerated elements in my argument against Farrer’s (and Goulder’s) Luke. Third, I neglected to give the wax tablet its due in my imagination of how Luke may have incorporated Matthew on the FH.</p>
<p>To counter my claim that Goulder’s description of Luke’s reverse re-contextualization of Mt. 25–16 is technologically problematic, Poirier introduces Clement of Alexandria’s potential reverse re-contextualization of Philo’s <italic>De Posteritate</italic> in Book 2 of Clement’s <italic>Stromateis</italic> (c. 198–203 <sc>ce</sc>). Poirier references Annewies van den Hoek, who argued that, at <italic>Strom.</italic> 2.5.3–2.6.4, Clement ‘evidently did not go forward through his scroll of [Philo’s] <italic>De Posteritate</italic> but turned it backwards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13480082">van den Hoek 1988</xref>: 152). This, argues Poirier, is evidence that ‘[m]oving backward through a roll is not an unknown practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>However, this evidence is based on several assumptions, some of which are misleading and do not hold up under the weight of scrutiny. First, it assumes that the medium in which Clement found Philo was the scroll. However, there is considerable evidence suggesting that the codex was beginning to emerge as a competing medium for the scroll by the late second/early third centuries <sc>ce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13480082">2</xref></sup> And because Goulder is assuming that the medium of Matthew (a scroll) determined how Luke accessed Matthew (in reverse), this potential analogy only has validity if one assumes that Philo was accessed by Clement in scroll form.</p>
<p>The second problem with this analogy has to do with what is assumed about the type of literary relationship that existed between Philo and Clement. There is no doubt that Philo’s works influenced, and occasionally served as sources for, Clement’s writing. However, in suggesting that Clement is an example of a reverse re-contextualization of a written source, Poirier is assuming that Clement and Philo enjoyed the same type of literary relationship as did Luke and Matthew on the FH. Closer analysis of <italic>Stromateis</italic> 2.5.2–2.6.4 yields a picture of Clement’s use of Philo that is very different from Luke’s use of Matthew on the FH. First of all, the six apparent places where Clement accesses Philo (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142064X13480082">table</xref> below) exhibit only sporadic paraphrase and the occasional direct quotation for just a few words. Here, Philo is being consulted, at best, infrequently and occasionally. This is very different from what Luke is doing with Matthew on the FH, where Luke quotes from Matthew extensively and at great length as his chief written source.</p>

<p>The other problem with this analogy has to do with differences in length. Clement’s text is considerably shorter than Lk. 13.22–18.8, just a few paragraphs that are easily viewable in their entirety on one or two pages in a critical edition of Clement’s Greek text. As well, in the ﬁrst three instances of Clement’s use of Philo (again, see below), Philo’s parallels texts could conceivably have been all on the same ‘page’ open in front of Clement, hence no ‘scrolling backwards’ would have been necessary! (The reader will note that I have included the page number in the Loeb edition of Philo to indicate the relative position of Clement’s apparent source text.) This is also the case with the last two parallel texts.</p>
<p>When it comes to Luke’s use of Mt. 25–16, however, we have something very different. Luke’s use of Matthew on the FH is both comprehensive and extensive, with Luke culling lengthy sections from his source text Matthew. Luke 13.22–18.18 constitutes 154 verses, where, in Goulder’s description, Luke has direct visual contact with nearly 300 verses of Matthew in chs. 25–16, 68 verses of which have a direct parallel in Luke. As well, at the level of pericope, there is extensive agreement between Luke and his source text, Matthew. For example, in the Lament over Jerusalem (Mt. 23.37-39//Lk. 13.34-35), 85% of Matthew’s 55 words show up in Luke’s version of the saying. Similarly, 43% of Matthew’s 60 words in Mt. 24.37-39 show up in Lk. 17.26-30 (‘As it was in the days of Noah …’). As a result, what Luke is doing with Mt. 25–16 on the FH is very different from what Clement is apparently doing with Philo in the examples provided by Poirier; it is hardly analogous to Luke’s use of Mt. 25–16.</p>
<p>The contention is not whether writers move backwards (or forwards) in their source texts (this is indisputable); all major solutions to the Synoptic Problem imagine this taking place to one degree or another. The contention is whether what Luke is described as doing with Luke’s reverse re-contextualization of Mt. 25–16 has an analogous example from the literary world of antiquity. Poirier has not provided such an example.</p>
<p>Poirier also objects to my appeal to the posture of writers in antiquity and their non-use of writing desks, ﬁnding it exaggerated and ignorant of the use of reading stands or some other type of furniture that could hold an exemplar text. Poirier mentions a number of examples of ‘tables’ used to support texts, potentially including the ‘table-like structure’ found in L30 at Qumran, commonly identiﬁed as the ‘scriptorium’ given the discovery of a few inkwells in that room. However, at least in terms of the Qumran ‘scriptorium’, there is still no consensus on the original purpose of that room and the function of the ‘table-like structure’ contained therein.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13480082">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the end of the day, all source critics must concede that ancient writing technology and mechanics placed restrictions on what could be accomplished by ancient writers and that the posture of the writer was one such factor. The overwhelming evidence suggests that writing desks, as a space for writing and laying out any reference materials on the same surface, did not exist in antiquity. Even if we imagine the evangelists utilizing some kind of stand or table to support an exemplar text, we still need to recognize that this surface is not the same surface that supports the text being composed (the writer’s lap/thigh) and that the posture of the writer meant that an exemplar text would have been not on the same surface, nor in the same visual plane, as the text being composed. It continues to be my contention that all Synoptic source theories run into problems when the writer is imagined to be conflating two or more source texts for extensive periods and with relatively high degrees of verbal agreements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13480082">Derrenbacker 2011</xref>: 441-44), particularly in light of writing posture and the mechanics of writing in antiquity. This is the most signiﬁcant problem for the Two-Gospel (Neo-Griesbach) Hypothesis (2GH) as, at virtually every pericope in Mark, the evangelist is conflating two source texts, Matthew and Luke. This also continues to be a problem for both the FH and the Two-Document Hypothesis (2DH), since both exhibit some conflation, but less so than with the 2GH.</p>
<p>In addition, Poirier implies that I am confusing the activities of scribes with writers. Referencing Tuckett’s review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480082">2007</xref>) of my book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13480082">Derrenbacker 2005</xref>), Poirier picks up on his ‘key question’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480082">Tuckett 2007</xref>: 189) as to whether I am describing the activities of ‘scribes’ or the activities of ‘authors’. However, I am not so sure the question is as ‘key’ as Poirier (or Tuckett for that matter) makes it. On the contrary, I would contend that it would be a serious mistake to see a scribal/authorial (compositional) dichotomy. Alan Kirk has argued recently that the ‘tendency in gospel scholarship to associate “scribe” narrowly with the copyist function’ is highly problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13480082">2012</xref>: 1). Instead, one should see a continuum of scribal activity that involved cultivation of literary tradition and composition. As Kirk argues, the ‘origins of the synoptic gospels themselves might be found in a scribal <italic>Sitz</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13480082">Kirk 2012</xref>: 1). Kirk, then, concludes that the scribal/compositional dichotomy does ‘not stand up to scrutiny’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13480082">2012</xref>: 18), and that the ‘synoptics themselves fall variously upon this cultural spectrum [i.e., the varied spectrum of scribal activity in antiquity]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13480082">2012</xref>: 25). So whether we are thinking about ‘authors’ or ‘scribes’, we should conclude that we are thinking not about a literary dichotomy, but a compositional spectrum where all shared the same posture when writing and were working with the same limitations that their writing technologies created for their compositions.</p>
<p>Poirier also argues that both Downing and I ‘fail to consider the use of the <italic>wax tablet</italic> as a rough-draft medium for the writing of a Gospel’, what Poirier describes as an ‘important step found in most literary writing of the period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 19). So Poirier appeals to the ancient medium of the wax tablet to bolster the description of Luke’s compositional program on the FH. Among other things, if one were to imagine Luke working with a ‘stack’ of wax tablets that housed drafts of his Gospel material, then one could imagine how Luke was able to ‘rearrange the so-called travel-narrative material so freely [i.e., 9.51–18.14]’, rearranging ‘these tablets in any order desired’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 23). This is not unlike the argument put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13480082">Sato (1994)</xref>, who argued that Q, on the 2DH, circulated as a <italic>Ringbuch</italic> or ‘loosely bound fascicle that was always amenable to further additions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13480082">Sato 1994</xref>: 179). Similarly, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480082">Gerhardsson (1961</xref>: 160-61) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X13480082">Lieberman (1962</xref>: 203) have suggested that Jewish pupils during the Roman era kept the teachings of their instructors on tablets or in notebooks, perhaps including the disciples of Jesus. I have argued likewise in a recent paper delivered in Mainz, Germany, soon to be published in a collection of essays from that conference on narrative and metaphor in Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13480082">Derrenbacker forthcoming</xref>). There, I pick up on my suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13480082">Derrenbacker 2005</xref>: 253-54) that Q could be imagined in the form of a codex and argue that Matthew and Luke, on the 2DH, may have had access to Q in the form of a proto-codex, like a notebook. This, I argue, could account both for Matthew’s freer movement through Q, as well as Q’s disappearance.</p>
<p>So I commend Poirier for discussing a potential medium that may have housed earlier drafts of Gospel material and for thinking beyond the traditional view that the evangelists’ medium was limited to the scroll. These sorts of suggestions allow Synoptic source critics to think more realistically about how the Gospels were composed in the literary world of the ﬁrst century. Indeed, the evidence suggests that wax tablets were used widely in the ancient literary world and that wax tablets could house drafts of lengthy works. For example, Plato’s secretary – Philip of Opus – copied the entirety of Plato’s work <italic>The Laws</italic> from wax tablets onto papyrus, a work that is some 400 pages in a modern published edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13480082">Millard 2000</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>However, while it is technically possible for Luke to rearrange his ‘stack’ of wax tablets to reconﬁgure the sequencing of the material he includes in Lk. 9.51–18.14, Poirier still has not offered an appropriate literary analogy from antiquity that would mirror what Luke is apparently doing with Matthew on FH, nor has he offered a motivation for this re-sequencing. Poirier does offer an intriguing explanation for the so-called ‘great omission’ of Mk 6.45–8.26—‘Luke was nearing the end of his supply of wax tablets, and that he recognized that he had to skip over a portion of Mark in order to ﬁt all of the pre-Passion Week Markan material into a complete section’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 23). However, it strains credulity to suggest that the ‘great omission’ was simply caused by Luke running out of appropriate writing supplies, particularly given Luke’s apparent social status, seen most readily in his likely employment of an amanuensis to assist in his rather complicated writing project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13480082">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the support that Poirier provides to bolster his claim that ‘[b]y all accounts, the wax tablet was an important part of just about <italic>all</italic> literary writing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13480082">Poirier 2012</xref>: 22, emphasis original) in actuality does not exclusively deal with the wax tablet medium. For example, the <italic>pugillares</italic> (‘tablets’) referenced in the primary and secondary literature surveyed on p. 22 do not necessarily indicate <italic>wax</italic> tablets, but may indicate other proto-codex-type media (e.g., wooden tablets, parchment/papyrus notebooks, etc.). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480082">Roberts and Skeat (1983</xref>: 24-29) discuss parchment <italic>pugillares</italic>, particularly a published edition of Martial’s poetry that circulated in a codex-like medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13480082">5</xref></sup> So I would want at least to modify Poirier’s conclusion, making it more accurate: ‘By all accounts, the <italic>proto-codex</italic> (which could include wax tablets), was an important part of just about <italic>all</italic> literary writing.’ And on this score, Poirier will know that I have not failed to consider this medium – the proto-codex – in my discussions of the Synoptic Problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13480082">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>I thank Poirier for his serious interaction with my ongoing research. He and I would agree, I think, that Synoptic source critics need to continue to take more seriously the compositional conventions of antiquity. My response has identiﬁed some areas in Poirier’s argument that I believe are in need of some rethinking and further clarity. And, for the time being, I still tend to agree with Mark Goodacre, an advocate of the FH, who argued that Michael Goulder’s depiction of Luke’s ‘scrolling backwards through Matthew and picking up cues in that reverse order’ continues to be the ‘most implausible element in Goulder’s thesis on Luke’s use of Matthew’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142064X13480082">Goodacre 2002</xref>: 118 and 118 n. 33).</p>
