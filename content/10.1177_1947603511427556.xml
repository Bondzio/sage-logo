<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An emerging treatment for patients with osteoarthritis is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), whereby small cartilage explants are removed from patients, chondrocytes isolated, and subsequently grown (“expanded”) in 2-dimensional (2-D) monolayer culture medium <italic>in vitro</italic> until a suitable density is reached prior to re-introduction into the patient via a 3-dimensional (3-D) support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947603511427556">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947603511427556">2</xref></sup> When cultured in 2-D monolayers, chondrocytes switch from spherical/ellipsoid morphology to one that is spread/attached, and to date, these changes have not been quantified in dimensional terms but have been found to be independent of other changes in chondrocytic phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603511427556">3</xref></sup> A decline in the expression of chondrocyte-specific type II collagen upon monolayer culture has been largely documented and is used, often in conjunction with changes in type I collagen expression, as a phenotypic marker. Additionally, the transcription factor Sox9, a regulator of type II collagen production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947603511427556">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947603511427556">5</xref></sup> has been shown to be down-regulated in response to 2-D culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947603511427556">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511427556">7</xref></sup> and is often used as another marker in chondrocyte differentiation. As well as expressing the correct matrix proteins, the chondrocyte response to mechanical signals is essential for the development of suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> engineered tissue, and thus, mechanotransduction, the process of sensing and responding to these signals, offers an essential marker of the chondrocytic phenotype. It has previously been shown that both <italic>in situ</italic> and freshly isolated chondrocytes lack the capacity for regulatory volume increase (RVI), whereas following 2-D culture, it has been shown that chondrocytes are able to robustly regulate volume following an increase in extracellular osmolality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511427556">8</xref></sup> It has been suggested that chondrocyte RVI is principally mediated by the NKCC and stimulated by latrunculin B (implicating the actin cytoskeleton) and gadolinium chloride (GdCl<sub>3</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603511427556">9</xref></sup> Interestingly, this therefore raises the suggestion that the response to change in extracellular osmolality is potentially a key marker of the differentiated phenotype as well as the standard matrix markers currently used.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of chondrocyte RVI to GdCl<sub>3</sub> suggests a relationship with stretch-activated membrane channels and in particular calcium. Previous work has shown that in response to changes in extracellular osmolality, chondrocytes exhibit a rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), thought to be mediated by sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947603511427556">10</xref></sup> with a morphologically dependent sensitivity to inhibition using GdCl<sub>3</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511427556">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been shown that culturing chondrosarcoma chondrocytes in the presence of GdCl<sub>3</sub> induced the loss of a differentiated phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511427556">12</xref></sup> As changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> appear to be linked to the morphological/phenotypic state of chondrocytes as well as volume regulation, calcium signaling offers a potential third marker of phenotype. We have recently shown that REV5901, a cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor antagonist, is capable of mediating a calcium rise in chondrocytes mediated by IP3-dependent store release and NCX in freshly isolated chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947603511427556">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> response to REV5901 loading offers a novel mechanotransduction marker of culture-induced dedifferentiation.</p>
<p>In order to determine quantifiable cellular changes during chondrocyte monolayer culture, changes in cell morphology were determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in addition to studying the expression of key molecular markers of phenotype by RT-PCR. Additionally, mechanotransduction responses of the chondrocytic phenotype were explored through determining the changes in RVI capacity and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signaling in response to REV5901 loading to explore changes that can be utilized as phenotypic markers in future research.</p>

<title>Measurement of Chondrocyte Morphology, Volume, and RVI</title>
<p>The change in morphology of chondrocytes during culture was observed by studying the cell dimensions including depth (average vertical dimension), width (average shortest dimension parallel to the culture substrate), length (average longest dimension parallel to the culture substrate), volume, and sphericity (the ratio of the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as a given chondrocyte to the surface area of the chondrocyte). Chondrocytes were seeded 2 hours prior to imaging and incubated in the dark with 5 µM calcein-AM at 37 °C for 30 minutes prior to acquisition of images using CLSM, whereby calcein was excited using a 488-nm argon laser, the photometric data collected at a bandpass of 510 to 535 nm, data sampled at 512 × 512 pixels, and 3-D z-stacks acquired using a z-step of 1.0 µm, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947603511427556">19</xref></sup> The extracellular osmolality was subsequently raised to 540 mOsm (42%) and images acquired 1.5, 3, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Images were reassembled in Imaris version 7.1 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) and isosurface objects created at 60% threshold, permitting the calibrated volume for a sphere, for freshly isolated chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947603511427556">19</xref></sup> However, due to their irregular shape, a threshold of 60% was deemed unsuitable for “flat” chondrocytes, including C-20/A4 chondrocytes, as the “isosurface” object did not contain the cell body. The depth of the nucleus at 60% threshold was termed “nuclear coefficient” (dη) and was thus used to standardize the apparent volume (V<sub>10%</sub>) of chondrocytes obtained at 10% threshold (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S2</bold>) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947603511427556">20</xref></sup> The following formula was based on the assumption that the depth of a round nucleus of a chondrocyte is approximately equal to that of the “flat” chondrocyte: V = V10%<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1947603511427556">

Finally, chondrocytes cultured at LD exhibited a steady increase in cell number (doubling time of 3.7 ± 0.2 days), and this culture density was therefore selected for all expansion experiments despite a reduction in viability to 71.0% ± 8.7%.

<p>Upon the introduction into 2-D monolayer culture, the most prominent observation was a change in morphology, whereby chondrocytes acquired a “flat” fibroblast-like structure within 9 days of culture, which included flattening of the nucleus. There was a decrease in cell depth (a) in response to culture from 4.08 ± 0.11 µm in freshly isolated chondrocytes to 2.2 ± 0.2 µm, 2.0 ± 0.1 µm, and 2.2 ± 0.1 µm in P1, P2, and P3 chondrocytes, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511427556">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Conversely, a significant increase in cell length was observed upon 9 days in culture from 6.0 ± 0.1 µm in freshly isolated to 12.5 ± 1.8 µm in P1 chondrocytes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) with no further change upon culture. These changes were confirmed by quantitatively comparing the sphericity of the cells, whereby freshly isolated chondrocytes exhibited sphericity of 0.7 ± 0.0, which significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) during the first passage to 0.5 ± 0.0 with no further changes observed during the culture period (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 and 0.69) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511427556"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Phenotype and Expression Profiling of Cultured Chondrocytes</title>
<p>Changes in the expression of key marker genes of the chondrocyte phenotype were determined to correlate those to changes in cellular morphology. A significant up-regulation of collagen was observed as early as the first passage, with relative expression level of type I collagen increasing from 1.00 ± 0.064 to 2.7 ± 0.6 after 9 days in culture (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511427556"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). The expression levels of type II collagen increased transiently within 9 days of culture from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 1.6 ± 0.2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) and subsequently returned to baseline levels after 14 days of culture, with no significant differences observed compared to freshly isolated chondrocytes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18). The ratio of type II collagen to type I collagen expression was therefore reduced by a factor of approximately 2 from as early as the first passage to 0.6 ± 0.2, indicating an early onset switch of phenotype that was maintained for the remainder of the culture period with no further subsequent change (<italic>P</italic> = 0.79) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511427556"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). The expression of the chondrocytic transcription factor Sox9, a key regulator of chondrocytic phenotype, was also studied upon 2-D culture to confirm data obtained from the collagen ratio for the purpose of determining the switch in chondrocyte phenotype. A significant yet transient 1.8 ± 0.4–fold increase in <italic>Sox9</italic> expression (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) was observed within 9 days of culture and declined upon further culture to baseline levels observed in freshly isolated chondrocytes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511427556"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). This increase coincided with the transient rise in type II collagen expression, indicating a potential role for <italic>Sox9</italic> in type II collagen expression and suggesting that dedifferentiation occurred in a 2-step trend.</p>

<title>RVI in Freshly Isolated and 2-D Expanded Chondrocytes</title>

When comparing the relative percentage change to freshly isolated chondrocytes, there was a significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) decrease in volume to 588.60 ± 15.32 µm<sup>3</sup>, 639.549 ± 14.435 µm<sup>3</sup>, and 628.328 ± 19.84 µm<sup>3</sup> in P1, P2, and P3 chondrocytes, respectively. Unlike freshly isolated chondrocytes, 2-D cultured chondrocytes exhibited RVI, whereby at 20 minutes after osmotic challenge, P1 chondrocytes recovered 99.6% of their original volume, P2 chondrocytes recovered 99.9% of their original volume, and P3 chondrocytes recovered 99.6% of their original volume. While the recovery of volume was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) for any of the passages, it was conceivable that the rate was different, and therefore, the rate of volume recovery, measured as t<sub>½</sub>, was calculated. Interestingly, P1 cultured chondrocytes exhibited linear volume recovery with a t<sub>½</sub> of 9.6 ± 0.6 minutes, termed “slow” RVI. Conversely, both P2 and P3 cultured chondrocytes exhibited biphasic volume recovery, a “robust” RVI of 2.8 ± 0.5 minutes and 3.5 ± 0.5 minutes between 1.5 minutes and 5 minutes, followed by “slow” RVI of 10.1 ± 0.7 minutes and 10.9 ± 0.5 minutes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1947603511427556"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1947603511427556"><bold>D</bold></xref>).

<title>Phenotype-Dependent Responses to REV5901-Induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> Rise</title>
<p>The role and signaling pathway of REV5901 were studied in response to 2-D culture.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been well documented that the <italic>in vitro</italic> 2-D culture of chondrocytes induces a switch in phenotype from “differentiated” (chondrocytic) to “fibroblast-like” (dedifferentiated). These changes are evident by the loss of the round morphology and the decrease in type II to type I collagen expression ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947603511427556">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947603511427556">25</xref></sup> Despite evidence of redifferentiation in 3-D culture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947603511427556">25</xref></sup> the ability of dedifferentiated chondrocytes to redifferentiate is limited to the number of passages they undergo in 2-D culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1947603511427556">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603511427556">27</xref></sup> Therefore, the loss of the chondrocytic phenotype is a major setback to chondrocyte expansion, and thus, ACI as functional cartilage is made predominantly of collagen type II. These distinct changes were studied in response to a standardized cell culture technique to further our understanding of chondrocyte phenotype and 2-D culture-induced dedifferentiation, with the aim of developing functional markers of the chondrocytic phenotype.</p>
<p>Firstly, the culture methodology was optimized using different seeding densities in serum-enriched media. At HD and MD, chondrocytes did not undergo significant cell growth possibly due to contact inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947603511427556">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1947603511427556">29</xref></sup> despite maintaining viability, as determined by trypan blue staining (data not shown). However, chondrocytes cultured at LD divided at a doubling time of 3.7 days, which is comparable to previously published data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1947603511427556">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511427556">31</xref></sup> Interestingly, it appeared that chondrocytes cultured at LD exhibited significantly larger cell death when compared to MD and HD cultures, which is possibly attributed to cell-to-cell interactions promoting cellular survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is the first observation of limiting effects of HD chondrocyte culture on cell division despite similar observations reported upon HD culture in porcine hepatocytes, whereby an initial &gt;90% viability was followed by a decline with time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1947603511427556">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first and most apparent effect of monolayer culture was the loss of the round morphology quantified by studying the sphericity of chondrocytes. By the ninth day in monolayer, a drop in sphericity was observed with no change recorded upon further culture, thereby indicating the complete loss of morphology as early as the first passage, as previously observed by others but not quantified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1947603511427556">33</xref></sup> This switch in morphology was further confirmed by studying accompanying changes in cellular dimensions, whereby upon culture, there was a decrease in cell depth, increase in cell length, and increase in chondrocyte cell volume. While the values for volume of freshly isolated chondrocytes were in accordance with those reported in the literature, this is the first time that a change in cell volume has been reported during culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603511427556">34</xref></sup> The increase in cell volume upon culture may be attributed, but not exclusively, to actin reorganization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603511427556">35</xref></sup> which has been shown to be sufficient to induce changes in cellular volume in transforming growth factor–treated epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1947603511427556">36</xref></sup> Another potential reason for the increase in chondrocyte cell volume is the release from maturational arrest upon serum-supplemented 2-D culture of chondrocytes previously shown to induce hypertrophic-like properties including type X collagen expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1947603511427556">37</xref></sup> shown to undergo up-regulation upon 3-D encapsulation of P5-7 auricular chondrocytes prior to apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603511427556">27</xref></sup> No up-regulation, however, was observed here in the expression of NKCC1, another hypertrophic tissue marker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1947603511427556">38</xref></sup> Further work to confirm the potential of 2-D culture for the induction of chondrocyte hypertrophy is required to determine the effect of serum on the expression of other hypertrophy markers including matrix metalloproteinase 13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947603511427556">39</xref></sup> and bone sialoprotein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1947603511427556">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The modification in the expression “battery” of chondrocytes in response to 2-D culture was documented by RT-PCR and densitometry analysis. The ratio of col2:col1 has long been used as a marker of chondrocyte differentiation, and we have similarly reported a decline in col2:col1 ratio within the first passage, which decreased insignificantly upon further culture. Type I collagen expression levels increased upon 9 days in culture (P1) and remained elevated for the remainder of culture as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511427556">7</xref></sup> Interestingly, the expression of the chondrocyte-specific type II collagen transiently yet significantly increased 9 days in culture prior to returning to baseline levels. Similar observations were reported upon 3-D encapsulation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes, whereby a transient up-regulation of type II collagen was observed up to the twelfth day in culture in porcine auricular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603511427556">27</xref></sup> and in primary human chondrocytes derived from passages 1 to 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947603511427556">41</xref></sup> These data demonstrated that the loss of phenotype may occur in 2 stages, whereby an intermediate phenotype in P1 chondrocytes (thereafter termed “mesodifferentiated”) was characterized by the up-regulation of both collagens in 2-D culture prior to the ultimate suppression of type II collagen expression.</p>
<p>As Sox9, an early chondrogenic marker in mesenchymal stem cells, has been shown to regulate the expression of type II collagen in chondrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1947603511427556">42</xref></sup> Sox9 expression levels reported here were also used as a marker of chondrocyte differentiation, whereby the level of Sox9 expression increased following 9 days in culture and simultaneously to the rise in type II collagen expression, prior to subsequent decline upon further culture. The simultaneous increase in type II collagen expression may be therefore attributed to the up-regulation in <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in P1 chondrocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of transient up-regulation of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression upon 2-D culture.</p>
<p>The capacity of chondrocytes to exhibit RVI in response to a hyperosmotic challenge was studied as a novel marker of phenotype, with volume regulatory mechanisms classified into “slow” and “robust” as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511427556">11</xref></sup> whereby P0 (differentiated) chondrocytes did not exhibit RVI. We have shown that P1 chondrocytes exhibited linear volume recovery deemed “slow” RVI over the course of the experiment. Conversely, P2 and P3 chondrocytes exhibited logarithmic volume recovery deemed “biphasic”, with robust RVI followed by slow RVI at rates similar to those observed in P1 chondrocytes. Previous work by us has shown a heterogeneous response to hypertonic challenge in 2-D cultured chondrocytes, whereby 54% of dedifferentiated chondrocytes exhibited RVI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511427556">8</xref></sup> We here observed a more homogeneous response within 3 different stages of 2-D culture with a switch from slow to robust RVI. This may be attributed to potential selectivity of the culture protocol. Although cartilage is often deemed a homogenous tissue, recent work has indicated the existence of a progenitor population within cartilage with distinctive capacity to maintain a chondrocytic phenotype upon culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1947603511427556">43</xref></sup> Indeed, differences in the regulation of chondrocyte pH were observed between the zones <italic>in situ</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1947603511427556">44</xref></sup> and it may be argued that monolayer culture stimulates the outgrowth of a population of chondrocytes, which are later studied as dedifferentiated chondrocytes, often found to exhibit homogeneous mechanotransduction responses.</p>
<p>It has to be noted however that the newly developed methodology for the acquisition of “flat” cell volume figures assumes a high degree of similarity in response to hypertonic challenge between the nucleus and the cell. The ratios of percentage change in values for cell volume acquired using the nuclear coefficient formula in response to hypertonic challenge (relative to values in isotonic conditions) were compared to their counterpart ratios using values for cell volume obtained at 10% thresholding, and no significant differences were found (data not shown).</p>
<p>As no change in <italic>NKCC1</italic> expression upon 2-D culture has been detected here or by others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511427556">7</xref></sup> it can be suggested that the change in actin cytoskeletal organization upon 2-D culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603511427556">35</xref></sup> may have induced the activation of NKCC1 transporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511427556">8</xref></sup> Indeed, NKCC, and thus RVI, is regulated by F-actin, and interestingly, it has recently been shown that reorganization is linked to stretch-activated calcium channels, whereby the treatment of freshly isolated avian chondrocytes with Gd<sup>3+</sup> induced RVI in response to hypertonic challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603511427556">9</xref></sup> Additionally, recent work in our research group has shown that NKCC1 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not abolish the capacity of C-20/A4 chondrocytes to exhibit RVI, thereby suggesting the involvement of other channels including epithelial sodium channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1947603511427556">45</xref></sup> or the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1947603511427556">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signaling in response to loss of phenotype upon 2-D culture were studied using REV5901 as an inducer of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise, and it was observed that there was a decrease in intracellular store contribution to REV5901-induced calcium rise in response to 2-D culture. Previous work has shown that mechanical pressure enhanced the sensitivity of inositol triphosphate receptors (activated in response to REV5901 loading),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947603511427556">13</xref></sup> possibly providing calcium-dependent chondroprotective mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1947603511427556">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1947603511427556">48</xref></sup> Therefore, it can be suggested that the loss of phenotype may also contribute to the reduction in intracellular store sensitivity to REV5901 upon 2-D culture. Conversely, an increase in store operation via IP3 receptor up-regulation in response to culture, however, has been seen of both myocytes and smooth muscle cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1947603511427556">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1947603511427556">50</xref></sup> There was no change in total extracellular calcium influx upon REV5901 loading in response to culture despite changes in individual channel contribution to calcium influx as determined by using calcium channel inhibitors. The IF in the presence of ruthenium red did not undergo any significant change upon culture, suggesting no change in the role of TRPV channels in calcium homeostasis upon 2-D culture. Our work was nevertheless mildly limited by the nonspecific effect of ruthenium red as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1947603511427556">51</xref></sup> and as a consequence of this, we are not able to discern the individual TRPV channels involved. Of interest are TRPV1, which has been previously shown to be up-regulated in response to 2-D culture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1947603511427556">52</xref></sup> and TRPV4, a key regulator of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1947603511427556">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Changes in the capacity of sodium-sensitive calcium channels and SACC to regulate REV5901-mediated rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in response to culture were more prominent. The IF of sodium-free BPS decreased upon culture, which supported previous observations of an unidentified channel shown to mediate Gd<sup>3+</sup>-insensitive rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in freshly isolated bovine articular chondrocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511427556">11</xref></sup> and thus suggested NCX as a potential candidate. Conversely, the sensitivity of REV5901-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise to Gd<sup>3+</sup> inhibition increased upon 2-D culture, thereby confirming previous reports that SACC is involved in mechanotransduction following a change in either morphology and/or phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511427556">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511427556">12</xref></sup> Moreover, treatment of chondrocytes with Gd<sup>3+</sup> has been previously shown to induce the loss of a differentiated phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511427556">12</xref></sup> potentially via a calcium-dependent pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1947603511427556">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together, these data have confirmed and quantified changes documented in response to 2-D culture, and these differences were considered “markers” of dedifferentiation necessary for future experiments. Indeed, the differentiated phenotype encompasses more than the collagens produced, and mechanotransduction responses as a marker of phenotype should be used to provide a more accurate understanding of chondrocyte function during expansion for the purposes of ACI therapy. As similar conclusions have been drawn in other species including porcine and avian tissue, future work to ascertain the applicability of these conclusions to human chondrocytes is required. Additional work to assay changes within the first 9 days in culture is required to better understand the cause and effect relationships between the various markers. Nevertheless, these data suggested the existence of a distinct phenotype in P1 chondrocytes previously undefined, characterized by 1) the up-regulation of type II collagen and Sox9 and 2) the exhibition of slow RVI and Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and termed “mesodifferentiated” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1947603511427556"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
