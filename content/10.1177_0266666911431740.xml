<abstract>
<p>The transformation of African agriculture with modern technologies, including information and communication technology (ICT) has been proposed as the required strategy for improving agricultural and rural economies of African countries. In this direction, this study investigated the catalysts and impact of ICT investment, ownership and use in the cassava value chain in south-western Nigeria. The study used in-depth structured interviews to collect data from 139 cassava growers, processors and marketers. Snowball and random sampling were used to select the respondents. A model was articulated to capture the catalytic and transmission processes in ICT investment and use in the cassava value chain. It predicts that in value chains dominated by small and medium enterprises (SME), ICT investments are unlikely to progress beyond basic low-end ICT unless there is expanded market demand for output of the SME. The model highlights key process points that policy may target in order to improve the use of ICT by SME to leverage their value chain activities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human development is perceived in terms of sustainable improvements in the satisfaction of a number of mutually complementary human needs of peoples and countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666911431740">Howkins and Valantin (1997)</xref> identify five categories of these needs: (i) healthy and secured life quality; (ii) literacy, education and skill development; (iii) steadily improving income and economic welfare; (iv) choice and participation in socio-economic affairs; and (v) efficient and evolving knowledge systems and technology. Two of the categories, namely, literacy, education and skill development, and efficient and evolving knowledge systems and technology are really about information and knowledge, and about the research and information and communication technologies (ICTs) needed to create, share and use information and knowledge.</p>
<p>ICTs are the electronic technologies that are used to acquire, create, store, share and use information. ICTs range from traditional electronic technologies such as radio and television, through basic types such as hand-held calculators, consumer electronics and mobile phones for voice and SMS, to sophisticated types such as computers, data networks, geographical information and positioning systems and the services associated with these technologies. ICTs are useful as consumption goods or as production inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666911431740">May, Karugia and Ndokweni 2007</xref>). Particularly for traditional and basic technologies and among owners of small enterprises, ICTs may be acquired to serve both purposes simultaneously.</p>
<p>The declining costs of ICTs are creating new opportunities for developing countries and their enterprises to harness these technologies to serve their development goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666911431740">Mansell and Wehn 1998</xref>). The challenge, however, is how ICTs can best be used to promote the productivity and growth of firms, particularly the small and medium enterprises (SME) that dominate the economies of developing countries. Some studies of manufacturing firms in developed countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666911431740">Morrison and Berndt 1991</xref>) observed a negative relationship between information technology-related variables and firm performance. At the industry level the results are mixed, with some studies reporting a positive impact of technological investments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666911431740">Kelley 1994</xref>), while other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666911431740">Berndt and Morrison 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666911431740">Koski 1999</xref>) found no significant effect of ICT investments in improving overall business performance or in enhancing work processes. At the detailed firm level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666911431740">Hitt and Brynjolfsson (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666911431740">Dewan and Min (1997)</xref> present results indicating a positive relationship between investment in technology and firm performance. Some firm-level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666911431740">Oyelaran-Oyeyinka and Lal 2004</xref>) and country-level studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666911431740">Kraemer and Dendrick 1994</xref>) have also noted that ICT investment may result in wasted resources and opportunities when not carefully matched with firm- or country-level goals, strategies, absorptive capacities and available social infrastructure. The general lesson is that profit from ICT investment and use at the firm level may depend on such variables as economic sector, firm size, human resources, managerial culture, and even country characteristics such as public policies, knowledge, skills and enterprise of the population, and ICT and supportive social infrastructure, among others.</p>

<title>Research problem</title>
<p>Most farming activities in Africa are on a very small scale. The problems of small-scale farmers in Africa are multifaceted and, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666911431740">Laven (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666911431740">Hess et al. (2007)</xref>, include: land sub-divisions and small farm sizes, leading to diseconomies of scale and low productivity; inadequate knowledge and skills in modern farming techniques and optimum methods of management; storage difficulties and inadequate farmer experience with the marketing of produce; poor linkages between farmers, processors, markets, researchers and extension workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666911431740">Munyua (2007)</xref> also noted that African farmers often lack adequate information on inputs, markets, credit, improved technologies, commercial farming and other aspects of rural development, and that the use of ICTs to deliver training and information is a critical ingredient for improving access to markets, production and productivity.</p>
<p>Other studies have revealed low usage of ICT by African small scale farmers to access agricultural knowledge and information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666911431740">May, Karugia and Ndokweni (2007)</xref> observed that one of the key factors affecting use of ICT in agriculture was inappropriate ICT policies, especially those targeting rural communities and rural development, language barriers, poor information sharing culture, and the fact that not all people in rural areas have even the low-end ICTs such as radio and television. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666911431740">Omorogiuwa and Tchouansi (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266666911431740">Richardson (2006)</xref> also highlighted such constraints as poor telecommunications connectivity in rural areas and inadequate skills and resources. Furthermore, although there have been various attempts to introduce ICT to small-scale farmers in Africa to provide effective communication and information services, these efforts have been mostly through uncoordinated projects.</p>
<p>A dramatic transformation of African agriculture is clearly needed. The transformation would involve strategies on diverse fronts aimed at removing or lessening the impact of the identified constraining factors. It would also entail the optimal integration and use of ICT with other productive inputs in all aspects of agricultural value chains. But answers are still needed for some key research questions concerning ICT usage in small scale African agriculture. Among the questions are: What appropriate types and mix of ICT with other productive inputs would transform the productivity of small scale African agriculture and related rural activities? What catalytic and transmission mechanisms would help move African agriculture towards the desired state? What policy strategies targeting the catalytic and transmission mechanisms are required? The desire to help find answers to these and related questions motivated a case study that focused on the input, process and output variables in the cassava value chain in Nigeria that may be targeted by policy strategies towards promoting output and efficiencies in the value chain activities.</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266666911431740">Porter’s (1985)</xref> value chain model highlighted the importance of the interdependencies of the processes that contribute to the ultimate value of the output of a production activity. A value chain describes the full range of activities required to bring a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production and input of various producer services, to the delivery to final consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666911431740">Kaplinsky and Morris 2001</xref>). The value chain provides an important construct that facilitates the understanding of the distribution of returns from the different activities of the chain. By breaking a chain into its constituent parts of design, supply, production, and distribution, one can better understand its structure and functioning and perhaps more importantly, assess its scope for systemic competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666911431740">Kaplinsky and Morris 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>An agricultural value chain contains several stages that successively add value to an agricultural produce or product. The stages include:<list list-type="alpha-lower">

<title>ICT in agricultural value chains</title>
<p>Technology is employed to some degree in every value creating activity, and changes in the technology can impact competitive advantage, efficiencies and productivity by changing the activities themselves or by making possible new configurations of the value chain. In the digital age, ICT are the transformative tools for redesigning and improving the efficiencies of value chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666911431740">Porter and Millar 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266666911431740">Somogyi and Galliers 1994</xref>). However, the transformative capacity of ICT in a production activity depends on the extent to which information communication and information processing tasks are performed in the processes of the activity. The more information intensive a process is, the greater would be the extent to which ICT can be used to support and transform the activity.</p>

<p>Information systems researchers have empirically demonstrated that information technology (IT) investments enhance firms' productivity, customer service delivery and comparative advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666911431740">Barua and Mukhopadhyay 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266666911431740">Weil (1992)</xref> found that heavy use of transactional IT investment was significantly and consistently associated with strong firm performance, but that heavy use of strategic IT was neutral in the long term and associated only with relatively poorly performing firms in the short term. Hence, he concluded that early adopters of strategic IT could have spectacular success, but once the technology becomes common, the competitive advantage is lost. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666911431740">Barua, Kriebel and Mukhopadhyay (1995)</xref> proposed a theory of IT complementarities to argue that the initial effects of IT should occur at the level of organizational processes that use the IT resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666911431740">Chen and Zhu (2004)</xref> measured information technology’s indirect impact on firm performance using data envelopment analysis based on the Theory of Production theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266666911431740">Tallon, Kraemer and Gurbaxani (2000)</xref> ascertained the contribution of information technology to firms' performance and concluded that the impact of IT on intermediate business processes serves as an effective measure of IT business value. The findings of their study suggest that the contribution of IT to firm performance can be measured across intermediate business processes where organizations have traditionally focused IT resources as a means of accomplishing organizational objectives.</p>

The study provides evidence that shows that firm performance is linked to the level of IT investment intensity in the sample of companies investigated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666911431740">De Silva and Ratnadiwakara (2008)</xref> assessed the information search costs of smallholder vegetable farmers in Sri Lanka, and found that ICT investment reduced the transaction costs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666911431740">Jenson (2007)</xref> used micro-level survey data to show that the adoption of mobile phones by fishermen and wholesalers was associated with a dramatic reduction in price dispersion, the complete elimination of waste, and near-perfect adherence to the law of one price.</p>

Their survey found a positive correlation between average enterprise size and use of advanced ICT, which is rising over time. Besides lowering transactions costs, reducing uncertainties and other positive effects well-addressed by most information-theoretic analyses, the paper concludes that use of ICT can additionally increase competitiveness of SME by facilitating information flows and reducing transaction costs. They also noted ICT should not be regarded in isolation because it is at best one factor among others that contribute to improved firm performance.</p>

<title>Cassava value chain in Nigeria’s economy</title>
<p>Nigeria, with an estimated population of about 120 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266666911431740">United Nations Development Programme 2001</xref>), is the most populous nation in sub-Saharan Africa. Its landmass of about 923,768 square kilometres is divided into 36 political states, grouped under six geopolitical zones – North Central, North East, North West, South-South, South East and South West. More than 55 percent of Nigerians are female; the poverty rate is about 67.8 percent and about 70 percent of the people live in the rural areas. Nigeria is the largest cassava producing country in the world, accounting for 19 percent of the world output and 34 percent of Africa’s output. Nigeria’s output is a third more than that of Brazil (2<sup>nd</sup> world largest producer). The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the 2002 cassava production in Nigeria to be approximately 34 million tones, which is higher than the output of any of the other food crops in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666911431740">Promoting Value-Adding in Nigerian Agriculture 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>By zone, the North Central zone produces about 29 percent of the national output, while the South-South, South West, South East and North West zones produce 24 percent, 20 percent, 20 percent and 7 percent respectively. Very little cassava is produced in the North East zone. But the bulk of the cassava growing in the country is still bedevilled by subsistence farming and poor market orientation, low level of specialization, fragmentation of holdings, and low level use of technology and inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666911431740">Promoting Value-Adding in Nigerian Agriculture 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Cassava is produced mainly by small farmers as a food and cash crop. Cassava has traditionally been a staple food crop for peoples in the southern and middle-belt parts of Nigeria. The crop plays a major role in country’s food security as 80 percent of Nigerians in the rural areas eat a cassava-derived meal at least once a week and a majority eat such meals at least once a day. It accounts for the livelihoods for over 30 million farmers, and countless cassava processors and traders. Cassava is processed into different processed food products that are subsequently prepared into food. The products include <italic>garri</italic>, <italic>lafun</italic>, <italic>fufu</italic>, etc. However, cassava is rapidly being transformed into a cash crop as more industrial and foreign market uses of processed cassava products, including glucose, starch, ethanol, etc, are being found and promoted by government.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, cassava is predominantly a food crop, compared to Brazil and Thailand where it is mostly an industrial and an export crop, respectively. Nigeria faces a major challenge in its current inability to diversify the use of cassava as food, feed, and as a basic raw material in agro industries. Nigeria also does not have a comparative advantage in the export of cassava chips, pellets and starch, due largely to high production costs.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives are being implemented by stakeholders, including the governments and cassava growers associations, to increase yields and cultivated area. The Presidential Initiative on Cassava has mandated millers to integrate 10 percent cassava flour to wheat flour in making bread, a move aimed at increasing the industrial utilization of the crop. Farmers' groups (or clusters) are being organized to use mechanized equipment, high yielding varieties and improving farming practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666911431740">Promoting Value-Adding in Nigerian Agriculture 2005</xref>). The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria is implementing some cassava development projects, including the Cassava Enterprise Development Project (CEDP). The principal emphasis of the CEDP is to support micro- and small-scale agro processing activities. The goal is to diversify and strengthen the rural economy in selected geopolitical (particularly the South-South and South-East) zones in Nigeria using cassava as the engine of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666911431740">Integrated Cassava Project, n.d.</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0266666911431740">
<title>Small and medium enterprises in Nigeria</title>
<p>Most of the cassava growers, processors and marketers in Nigeria are individuals, households or small and medium enterprises (SME). A major problem faced by Nigerian SME is the poor state of physical infrastructures in the country. These include poor roads, unreliable public electricity supply and inadequate communications infrastructure. The situation is worse in rural areas than in urban areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666911431740">Lal (2007)</xref> identified poor public electricity supply and limited communication connectivity infrastructure as major factors inhibiting diffusion and intensive utilization of ICT by the SME. The study also found that firm-level variables, such as financial capacity and technological absorptive capacity, influenced the intensity of the adoption of ICT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266666911431740">Olaitan (2006)</xref> summarizes the government-sponsored programmes and initiatives to facilitate access to finance by SME. However, the effectiveness of these policies and programmes are often constrained by various challenges faced by SME and the financial institutions. A survey commissioned by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nigeria PRISMS Project during 2004 and 2005 found that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sourced their finance, in order of importance, from personal savings, informal sources, microfinance institutions, cooperatives, community banks, government sources, and commercial banks.</p>

<title>ICT infrastructure, markets and services in Nigeria</title>
<p>ICT for rural development may be categorized into four main types – radio/TV, telephones, computers and the Internet. Radio is the most accessible ICT in rural areas, largely because of its portability, low cost and ease of use. Radio programmes in local languages targeting farmers and rural dwellers have existed for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666911431740">Omenesa 1997</xref>). In the past few years new government-owned radio stations have been established in several small towns and rural communities across the country, and licenses for private community FM stations continue to be granted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666911431740">Aderinoye, Ojokheta and Olojede (2007)</xref> found that 81.4 percent (or roughly four out of every five) Nigerians owned a radio, while only 31.6 percent of Nigerians owned television sets. Most TV owners reside in the urban areas, where the epileptic electricity supply situation further constrains the regular use of owned TV sets. Access to and use of telecommunications, computers and the Internet in Nigeria gained momentum only after 2000. The number of fixed lines, which was about 700,000 in 2002, had almost doubled by the end of 2005, while the number of mobile lines had risen from about 1.56 million in 2002 to about 20 million by 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666911431740">Olubamise and Awe 2007</xref>). Mobile telephony has rapidly become the most popular method of voice communication in Nigeria, and growth has been so rapid that Nigeria has been rightly described as one of the fastest growing GSM markets in the world. Roadside call centres now abound, especially in urban areas and small towns. These are operated mostly by women aged 20–29 years who had completed secondary school, although increasing numbers of unemployed male youth are also venturing into that business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666911431740">Obayelu and Ogunlade 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Survey research design strategies were used to collect data in the study. Data were collected primarily through structured interviews with sampled cassava growers, processors and marketers. The interviews were administered by the researchers and four research assistants. The interviews were based on a structured in-depth questionnaire designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The interviews were recorded, except where the interviewees were uncomfortable with the use of the recording equipment.</p>
<p>Preliminary literature and field investigations revealed that most cassava growers, processors and marketers in the study area are registered members of associations of growers, processors and marketers respectively. Growers, processors and marketers who are registered with associations or trade groups are likely to be not too small, and are likely to be market- rather than subsistence-oriented. The study therefore used the leadership and membership of the associations to identify and select the samples of cassava growers, processors and marketers surveyed in the study. Snowball and random sampling techniques were used to identify prospective interview respondents. The snowball approach was used to identify all the growers, while both methods were used to select processors and marketers. The random sampling approach was used ad hoc within markets and processing clusters to select some of the processors and marketers. Altogether, 139 respondents were interviewed, comprising 56 growers, 39 processors and 44 marketers.</p>
<p>Four research assistants were recruited and trained for the interviews, which were mostly conducted in the local language. The assistants were trained in the proper translation and asking of questions during both a pre-field workshop and the pilot administration of the interviews that were facilitated by the researchers. The interviews were conducted during April and May 2009, during the planting period for cassava timed for harvest in November.</p>
<p>Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses were performed on the collected data in order to answer the research questions of the study.</p>

<title>Research Question 1: What SME and SME-owner variables predict ICT ownership, investment and use in the value chain?</title>
<p>The results of the data analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666911431740">Table 1</xref>
 show that, for the growers (which were dominated by men), education of owner, change agent visits, credit seeking and credit obtained directly predicted the ICT-related variables. These results mean that the SME became more inclined to invest in, own and use ICT in their operations when they received more visits by change agents, or their owners/managers had higher levels of education, or sought and used more credit. However, an inverse relationship was observed between age of owner and perceptions of ICT usefulness, meaning that the older the grower, the less likely he/she would consider ICT as useful for the cassava growing business.</p>

<p>For the processors (which were dominated by women) however, inverse predictive relationships were observed between the ICT-related variables and many of the SME and SME-owner variables, including: age of the SME, credit obtained, sex of SME owner (male processors being more likely to invest in, own, and use ICT than female processors), and credit seeking. Nevertheless, direct relationships between participation in business networks and ICT ownership and ICT use were also observed.</p>
<p>For the marketers (which comprised men and women in almost equal proportions), there were significant relationships between some of the ICT-related variables and education of owner (direct), size of marketing operations represented by workers employed (direct), working capital (direct), commercial orientation of firm (direct), and owner’s knowledge and experience, represented by education of owner and knowledge of value chain activities (direct). A direct relationship means that one or more of the ICT-related variables (ICT investment, ICT ownership or ICT use) increases as the mentioned firm or owner variable increases. Moreover, ICT use is predicted directly by SME owner participation in business networks (i.e. trade associations and thrift and credit cooperatives), and change agent visits. This means that ICT use would increase in response to increases in each of these variables. These variables are knowledge and environmental connectivity and exposure variables, suggesting that ICT use among marketers may be promoted through programmes that expose them to new ideas and innovations.</p>

<sec id="section16-0266666911431740">
<title>Research Question 2: What interdependencies exist between ICT-related and production process variables in the value chain?</title>
<p>This question concerns the reasonable expectation that ICT ownership, expenditure and use would bear strong relationships with such production process variables as communication, information processing, research and innovation. The analyses and results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666911431740">Table 2</xref>
) showed, first, that there were significant correlations between each of ICT ownership, ICT expenditure and ICT use and the levels of communication, information processing, research and innovation by the SME. Secondly, that information processing diversity correlated significantly with almost all the other variables, followed by communication intensity and communication diversity in that order. Thirdly, that research and innovation activities correlated least with the other variables. These results suggest that ICT ownership, investment and use were probably motivated more by the information processing and communication activities of the SME than by their research and innovation activities, possibly because these latter activities were not undertaken frequently by the SME. Finally, that correlations among the variables were more numerous and stronger for the marketers than for the growers, and least for the processors. The latter findings suggest that the marketers, being in the service sector, were probably better able to use their investment in and use of ICT to drive their information processing and communications activities more intensively than the growers and processors, who are in the primary and manufacturing sectors respectively.</p>

<title>Research Question 3: Do ICT ownership, investment and use bear expected positive relationships with output values and output-input ratios of the different value chain activities?</title>
<p>Most studies of the impact of ICT investment and use on firm performance have focused on the connection between ICT use and firm performance in terms of such variables as output quantities, output values, turnover, productivity, or technical efficiency. Accordingly, one of the research objectives of this study was to investigate the relationship between the ICT-related variables and total output values and output-input coefficients of the value chain participants.</p>
<p>The results of the analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666911431740">Table 3</xref>
 show that ICT ownership predicted directly the total output values of growers, processors and marketers, but not their output-input ratios. The interpretation of this is that ICT ownership predicted total turnover of the firms, but not the efficiency with which the firms were able to convert input into output. The other two ICT-related variables – average ICT monthly expense and ICT use – did not predict total output value or output-input ratio of the firms. ICT ownership makes ICT use more convenient and is, therefore, likely to promote ICT use experimentation and innovation, such as the intensive or spur of the moment uses of ICT to seek information and knowledge on better production techniques or prices. However, although such uses of ICT may provide information and knowledge that improves output and output values when used, they may also lead to higher and wasted ICT-related expenditures, which drives down the output-input ratios. This may explain why ICT ownership was found positively related to output values, but not related to output-input ratios of the value chain operators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0266666911431740">
<title>Research Question 4: What are the catalytic and transmission mechanisms through which ICT-related variables influence production process and output variables, or vice versa?</title>
<p>This is the primary research question that motivated this paper, so relatively much more space is devoted to it. As background, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666911431740">Kottermann and Boyer-Wright (2009)</xref> identify three domains of ICT use – individual, business and government. They also note that education and on-the-job training of individuals play important roles in ICT use in the three domains; that education quality is positively associated with ICT use by individuals, but weakly associated with ICT use in the business domain; and that on-the-job training is positively associated with all three ICT use domains. SME straddle the individual and business domains. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666911431740">Lal (2007)</xref> also found that firm-level variables, such as financial capacity and technological absorptive capacity (the latter of which depends on education and on-the-job training), influenced the intensity of ICT adoption among Nigerian SME. But the question still remains: what variables catalyze the behavioural mechanisms that lead to higher levels of ICT use and firm output, or vice versa?</p>
<p>Three findings of this study are pertinent. Firstly, ICT ownership was predicted by both SME and owner variables such as education, participation in trade and credit networks and commercial orientation of the firm. Secondly, ICT ownership predicted some of the production process and output variables, whereas ICT investment did not. This suggests that ICT use convenience facilitated by owned ICT, rather than the actual amounts invested by SME in low-end and low cost ICT, is likely to be a key determinant of the instrumental use of the ICT by the SME to improve their value chain activities. Thirdly, ICT ownership makes access to and use of ICT very convenient but often also entails overhead or operational costs of ownership and use. In the context of SME and their owners, ICT ownership may be instigated by either productive or consumptive needs, and the consumptive needs might even be stronger than the productive needs in respect of low-end and communication-oriented ICT such as radio, TV and cell phones. Conversely, the productive needs for the ownership of high-end and information processing-oriented ICT such as computers, Internet and databases would be stronger only for bigger SME. For the bigger firms, the greater risks associated with their increasing scale of operations, resource use, outputs and competitive threats would instigate them to invest in, own and use more sophisticated, more effective and more efficient high-end ICT.</p>
<p>These perspectives and findings, as well as insight gained from analyses of qualitative information from the interviews with SME owners and managers in the study, were used to analyse and model the catalytic and transmission mechanisms that connect ICT-related and production-related variables among the cassava value chain participants.</p>
<p>The analyses suggest that the catalytic and transmission mechanisms for the smaller categories of SME would be:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Consumptive or social needs of SME owner for basic ICT (radio, TV, cell phone), catalyzed by exogenous standard of living improvements or peer pressure.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Purchase of episodic access to basic ICT services (e.g. roadside cell phone services).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Purchase and ownership of low-end and low-cost ICT in order to facilitate convenient access to and use of ICT for personal consumptive, and later, productive social connectivity, information exchange and knowledge acquisition.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Gradually increasing use of owned ICT in SME productive activities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Improved operational connectivity and efficiency of the SME, due to the intertwined interests of SME and SME owner.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>This transmission mechanism would be consumption-initiated, would be consumption-dominated in the early stages, and would be sustained more by personal and social needs than by productive needs. ICT investment and use would continue to be limited to the low-end low cost variety, unless there are one or more exogenous catalysts that propel the SME out of its ‘low level ICT equilibrium trap’ to acquire more sophisticated and more expensive ICT. The catalysts could be intervention by change agents, training programmes for SME, mass media adverts, or exogenous boost in market demand and prices for SME output.</p>
<p>The response of SME to long-term boosts in market demand and prices would then instigate another set of catalytic and transmission mechanisms as follows:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Exogenous expansion of markets and demand for SME output (e.g. new industrial and foreign markets, new industrial and food uses of SME output, etc).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Improved market prices of SME output.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Increased SME output in response to the improved demand and prices.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Improving financial resources of the SME.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>SME perceptions of increased uncertainty and risk of potential losses associated with the increased scale of operations alongside more intensive but inefficient use of owned low-end ICT for communication and information processing.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Investment in high-end and more efficient ICT for communication and information processing purposes, including ICT knowledge and skills improvement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Intensive and diverse uses of high-end ICT for information processing and internal and external communication.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>This second catalytic and transmission mechanism is production-dominated, and would be driven and sustained by improving market demand, SME output and financial resources, increasingly uncertain market conditions for SME output in local or foreign markets. The consumption-dominated and production-dominated transmission mechanisms can each be decomposed further into its temporal sequence, i.e. 1 and 2 (consumption-dominated), and 3 and 4 (production-dominated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666911431740">Figure 2</xref>). The hypothesis underlying these catalytic and transmission mechanisms is that the consumption- and production-dominated mechanisms would activate in the labelled temporal sequence (1, 2, 3, 4), with the balance of force shifting gradually toward the latter mechanisms as an SME grows in size.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The important predictors of ICT ownership, investment and use among growers, processors and marketers were age of firm, and the firm owner’s gender, age, education, knowledge, credit seeking and extent of participation in trade and credit associations. Most of these variables are connectivity and exposure variables, and signpost the need to encourage younger and better educated people to venture into cassava-related businesses, as well as educational programmes and information and business networks that expose the value chain participants to new ideas and innovations, including the innovative uses of ICT.</p>
<p>ICT-related variables were not strong variables for predicting output values and output-input ratios in the value chain activities. Output value is the product of output quantity and output average selling price. Hence, total output value for a period is the same thing as the turnover of a firm for the period, and is sometimes used to measure the size or intensity of operations, of a firm. The lack of significant relationships between ICT-related variables and output-input ratios corroborates the findings of some previous studies, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666911431740">Berndt and Morrison (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666911431740">Koski (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266666911431740">Strassman (1985)</xref>.</p>
<p>On the basis of the empirical evidences obtained in the study, a model of time-sequenced catalytic and transmission mechanisms is proposed to explain the interconnection of firm, firm owner, ICT-related and production-related variables in the context of SME and their owners in the cassava value chain. The model predicts that, in the absence of dramatic increases in the output of the SME catalyzed by increased demand for output from existing or new markets for cassava produce or products, ICT use would be limited to low-end ICT such as radio, TV and cell phones. However, once SME output begins to expand, the increased costs and risks associated with higher levels of output, market prices and income would instigate intensive and sophisticated uses of low-end ICT and, ultimately, increasing investment in and use of high-end ICT. These predictions appear to fit in well with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666911431740">Matambalya and Wolf (2001)</xref>, who reported positive correlation between average enterprise size and use of advanced ICT among SME in Kenya and Tanzania, which is also rising over time.</p>

<p>The significance of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666911431740">Figure 2</xref> is in its highlighting of the various points in the environment and behaviour of SME and their owners which public or private sector strategies may target in order to promote improved, beneficial and sustainable investment in and uses of ICT by the SME and their owners. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0266666911431740">Table 4</xref>

<p>The relationships observed in this study between output values and ICT investment and use variables were not as strong as expected from theories that predict positive instrumental value of ICT investment and use in productive activities. This might be due to the possibility, noted by some studies, that ICT use influences production outcomes, not directly, but indirectly through more efficient production processes. The possibility of such indirect relationships between the ICT-related variables and output value and output-input ratios among the cassava value chain participants seems corroborated by the findings of this study concerning the significant relationships between some of the ICT-related variables and some of the production process variables, particularly, communication diversity, information processing diversity, and market participation diversity. These findings suggests that research effort should focus more on discovering the catalytic and transmission mechanisms between stages and variables in agricultural value chains, as this study set out ought to do.</p>
