<abstract>
<p>Mesial temporal sclerosis is uncommon in childhood but has been associated with febrile status epilepticus. SCN1A gene mutations are linked to multiple epilepsy syndromes with patients frequently presenting with prolonged febrile seizures. After observing mesial temporal sclerosis in a child with SCN1A gene mutation, we retrospectively reviewed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in all patients with SCN1A gene mutation identified between 2005 and 2010. We identified 20 patients with SCN1A mutations. Six patients had evidence of definite mesial temporal sclerosis with 2 patients having bilateral abnormalities. Another 4 patients were defined as having possible mesial temporal sclerosis. This patient group revealed that 50% had findings consistent with definite or possible mesial temporal sclerosis and many did not have a history of prolonged febrile seizures. We conclude that mesial temporal sclerosis is a common finding in children with SCN1A mutations. Many of these children will have Dravet syndrome but not all.</p>

<p>Mesial temporal sclerosis is a major etiology for epilepsy in adult populations but has been an uncommon finding in children with epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435325">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811435325">2</xref>
</sup> In adults, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is now thought of as a syndrome itself presenting initially with febrile seizures in childhood and later onset of temporal lobe seizures associated with mesial temporal sclerosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is evidence that prolonged febrile seizures may cause hippocampal changes; however, there is also evidence that a genetic predisposition or underlying hippocampal abnormality may be present before the onset of febrile seizures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435325">3</xref>
</sup> Currently, prospective studies are being conducted to look at the possible connection between febrile status and mesial temporal sclerosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811435325">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Epilepsies associated with mutation of the SCN1A gene are also connected to a high incidence of prolonged febrile seizures. More than 300 SCN1A gene mutations have been reported in association with a wide variety of epilepsy syndromes, ranging from fairly benign syndromes such as generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus to severe epileptic encephalopathies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435325">5</xref>
</sup> Dravet syndrome was the first epileptic syndrome linked to SCN1A gene mutations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811435325">6</xref>
</sup> Dravet syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe epileptic encephalopathy beginning in infancy with prolonged febrile seizures with unilateral or bilateral tonic-clonic activity. Patients later develop nonfebrile events, including myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and absence, as well as partial-onset seizures, both simple and complex. Patients generally have normal development early but later suffer developmental decline and delay along with ataxia. Epilepsy is generally refractory to medical management. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus was also linked to SCN1A gene mutation; however, these patients generally have a milder phenotype with multiple febrile seizures that may start early or persist past 6 years of life. They also may develop afebrile seizures. Afebrile seizure phenotypes include generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and rarely, even atonic seizures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435325">7</xref>
</sup> Although generalized seizures and hemiclonic seizures are the classic seizure types associated with SCN1A-associated epilepsy syndromes, temporal lobe epilepsy has also been reported occasionally in genetic studies of families with various SCN1A gene mutations.<sup>

</p>
<p>At our institution, we observed several patients with SCN1A gene mutations and mesial temporal sclerosis on MRI. On the basis of these findings, we decided to retrospectively review all of our patients with SCN1A mutations and evaluate their MRI findings with a specific focus on the incidence of mesial temporal sclerosis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811435325" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review of patients with SCN1A gene abnormalities detected between 2005 and 2010 was conducted. Individual decisions were made by the treating physician as to the patient’s evaluation. Patients were acquired by reviewing results of all SCN1A testing performed at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital over this time period. All patients included had documented abnormalities in SCN1A gene sequencing analysis (Athena Diagnostics Inc., Worcester, Massachusetts) and MRI studies available for review at our institution. Because of the retrospective nature of this study and evolving changes in radiology at our institution, imaging was performed with either 1.5- or 3-Tesla MRI, and not all patients had the same protocol performed for epilepsy or for evaluation of mesial temporal structures. All of the scans included at least a coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence angled to the temporal lobes, a coronal T2-weighted sequence, an axial T2-weighted sequence, and a sagittal T1-weighted sequence. All imaging was reviewed independently by 2 neuroradiologists (ZP and DR). The 2 reviewers then met to reconcile their findings for a final interpretation. The neuroradiologists were aware that these patients had a diagnosis of epilepsy and an SCN1A gene mutation, but they were unaware of the details regarding the individual’s epilepsy severity or seizure types and had no knowledge of previous MRI reports.</p>
<p>Patients were divided into 1 of 4 groups on the basis of their MRI findings with regard to the mesial temporal structures: (1) definite mesial temporal sclerosis, (2) possible mesial temporal sclerosis, (3) abnormal mesial temporal structures, or (4) normal. Patients were said to have definite mesial temporal sclerosis if hippocampal volume loss/atrophy, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal changes, and alteration of the internal architecture were identified. Patients were placed in a possible mesial temporal sclerosis group if 2 of these findings were present. Patients with only 1 of these changes or another unspecified abnormality in the mesial temporal structures (often referred to as “hippocampal dysmorphia”) were grouped as having abnormal hippocampal structures. The fourth group consisted of patients with normal mesial temporal structures. In addition to MRI review, chart review was performed to look at age of seizure onset, history of febrile seizures and/or status epilepticus, type of seizures, cognitive function, and family history. This study was approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Review Board.</p>

<sec id="section2-0883073811435325">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-two patients with SCN1A gene mutation were identified. Two patients did not have an MRI available for review by our neuroradiologists but by report were normal. Of these 20 remaining patients, 8 had a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, 7 had findings consistent with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, and 5 had refractory epilepsy that did not fit into classic clinical definitions for either of these syndromes, primarily because they did not have a history of febrile seizures or myoclonic seizures.</p>
<p>Of the 20 remaining patients, there were 15 males and 5 females. All but 4 patients had onset of epilepsy within the first year of life with a range from 3 months to 4 years (median age of onset 6 months). Age at MRI ranged from 10 months to 14 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811435325">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Six patients had definite mesial temporal sclerosis (30%). Two of the 6 patients with definite mesial temporal sclerosis actually had changes consistent with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Four patients had possible mesial temporal sclerosis (20%), of which 2 individuals had bilateral abnormalities consistent with possible mesial temporal sclerosis. Three patients had abnormal mesial temporal structures (15%). The remaining 7 patients had normal mesial structures (35%) and all had overall normal brain MRIs except for 2 patients with small arachnoid cysts.</p>
<p>Of the 6 patients with definite mesial temporal sclerosis, 4 had Dravet syndrome with prolonged febrile seizures. The other 2 patients did not have a history of prolonged febrile seizures, although 1 had a history of simple febrile seizures. Two of the 6 patients with definite mesial temporal sclerosis had findings consistent with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Of the 4 patients with possible mesial temporal sclerosis, only 1 had Dravet syndrome and 2 others had a history of simple febrile seizures. Among the 3 children with abnormalities of the temporal structures, only 1 had Dravet syndrome, and of the other 2 neither had a history of febrile seizures, but 1 patient had multiple episodes of status epilepticus. In the 7 patients with normal MRI, 2 had Dravet syndrome, 1 had prolonged febrile seizure, and 1 had a simple febrile seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811435325">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our series of patients with SCN1A gene mutation, mesial temporal sclerosis and abnormalities of the mesial temporal structures were seen more frequently than any other radiologic abnormality. More than half of the patients in our study had abnormalities in the mesial temporal structures, with 6 patients having definite mesial temporal sclerosis (30%), 4 patients with findings consistent with possible mesial temporal sclerosis (20%), and 3 patients with morphologically abnormal hippocampal structures (15%). Also, many of the patients had abnormalities in both temporal lobes rather than just unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis.</p>
<p>Although mesial temporal sclerosis is fairly common in this population, the overall incidence of mesial temporal sclerosis in the pediatric population is unclear; however, it is believed to be relatively uncommon. Ng et al reviewed 3100 consecutive brain MRIs performed at 2 pediatric institutions and found a prevalence of mesial temporal sclerosis of 0.77% in MRIs performed for any reason. All of the MRIs showing mesial temporal sclerosis were performed for the evaluation of seizures, and 4 of the 24 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis had a history of febrile seizure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811435325">2</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Berg et al found only 5 isolated cases of mesial temporal sclerosis (9 further cases of mesial temporal sclerosis were found associated with other pathology) in their review of 518 MRIs from childhood epilepsy patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811435325">10</xref>
</sup> Specifically looking at cases of childhood temporal lobe epilepsy, Spooner et al evaluated a group of children with newly diagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy and found that 10 of 62 had MRI changes consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811435325">11</xref>
</sup> In surgical cases, cortical dysplasia and low-grade tumors are the most common etiologies, although many of these patients also had findings consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis, so-called dual pathology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811435325">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811435325">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Classically, there are no typical MRI findings associated with Dravet syndrome or generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, with most patients initially having normal MRI. Siegler et al studied MRIs of patients with clinically diagnosed Dravet syndrome, and found that 10 of the 14 patients had mesial temporal sclerosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811435325">14</xref>
</sup> This was believed to be related to the prolonged febrile seizures associated with the disease, and patients in the study typically had prolonged febrile hemiconvulsions lasting more than 30 minutes. Many of these children initially had normal MRI with development of mesial temporal sclerosis seen on subsequent imaging. The earliest case was seen at 14 months of age. Conversely, a study by Striano et al reviewed MRIs from patients with clinical Dravet syndrome on the basis of whether or not the patient had an SCN1A gene mutation. The investigators found that 39% of patients without a mutation had an abnormal MRI compared with 11.4% having abnormalities in the group with the SCN1A mutation. They found only 1 case of mesial temporal sclerosis; interestingly, this was in the group with positive SCN1A genetic testing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811435325">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In our current study, patients were evaluated on the basis of positive SCN1A genetic testing, regardless of clinical phenotype, so the severity of epilepsy ranged from generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus to classic Dravet syndrome, and not all patients had prolonged seizures or febrile convulsions. Some of the patients in our study did not fit clearly into either of the syndromes, because they had not had febrile seizures. In our cohort, only half of the patients with definite or possible mesial temporal sclerosis had a history of prolonged seizures. Five of the 6 patients with definite mesial temporal sclerosis had a history of febrile seizures but only 4 had episodes of prolonged seizures, which in the past has been linked to development of mesial temporal sclerosis. One of the patients with definite mesial temporal sclerosis actually was an atypical patient who did not fit into the classification of Dravet or generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus, having only nonfebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures and atypical absence seizures. In the group of patients with possible mesial temporal sclerosis, only 1 of 4 had a history of febrile status epilepticus.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that mesial temporal sclerosis is caused by an underlying abnormality, which may be developmental or genetic, which then leads to complex febrile seizures and later temporal lobe epilepsy. In this cohort of patients, the 1 common factor for all the patients was a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene, which may support the argument for genetic causation of mesial temporal sclerosis or abnormalities of the temporal structures. Other studies looking at familial cases of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus caused by mutations in SCN1A and SCN1B included subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy, some of whom did display mesial temporal sclerosis. Some of these patients also had no preceding history of prolonged febrile or simple febrile seizures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811435325">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811435325">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811435325">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our study was limited by the retrospective nature and the lack of control over the adequacy and consistency of the MRI techniques used, which reduced the certainty with which the diagnosis of mesial temporal sclerosis could be made in some cases. The possible mesial temporal sclerosis group may have been able to be more definitively regarded as having (or not having) mesial temporal sclerosis with improved MRI procedures. The significance of this group is unclear, as is the significance of the number of patients with “dysmorphic” mesial structures. It is possible that these patients may develop more well defined mesial temporal sclerosis in the future, or it may be that they have some other developmental abnormality of the temporal lobes. A prospective MRI evaluation of these patients may be helpful in the future to observe if development of mesial temporal sclerosis occurs, or if a change in MRI technique could clarify the abnormality present. Other limitations in our study include that our neuroradiologists were not blinded to the fact that patients had epilepsy and the SCN1A gene mutation. However, they were not aware of the severity or details of the patients’ epilepsy. In addition, there was no age/sex-matched control group for comparison.</p>
<p>Mesial temporal sclerosis in childhood epilepsy is much less common than in adult populations, especially in younger children. However, in this group of patients with the SCN1A gene mutation, the finding of mesial temporal sclerosis was common. Mesial temporal sclerosis has been seen before in Dravet syndrome patients with multiple prolonged seizures; however, in our patient population with the SCN1A mutation, many children had mesial temporal sclerosis or some degree of mesial temporal abnormality that the severity of their epilepsy might not have predicted. In conclusion, mesial temporal sclerosis is a common finding in children with SCN1A gene mutations, most of whom will have Dravet syndrome, but some patients may have less severe epilepsy syndromes.</p>
