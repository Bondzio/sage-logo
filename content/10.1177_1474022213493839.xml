<abstract>
<p>This article argues that Qualitative Comparative Analysis can be a useful method in case-based evaluations for two reasons: a) it is aimed at causal inference and explanation, leading to theory development; b) it is strong on external validity and generalization, allowing for theory testing and refinement. After a brief introduction to QCA, the specific type of causality handled by QCA is discussed. QCA is shown to offer improvements over Mill’s methods by handling asymmetric and multiple-conjunctural causality in addition to counterfactual reasoning. It thereby allows the explicitly separate analysis of necessity and sufficiency, recognizing the relevance of causal packages as well as single causes and of multiple causal paths leading to the same outcome (equifinality). It is argued that QCA can generalize findings to a small, medium and large number of cases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Establishing causal relations and understanding complex processes in a way that leads to theory development is a central feature of case-study evaluations. The latter, however, need to confront the problem of generalization as findings obtained out of one case do not automatically extend to other cases, no matter how similar. In research methods, there is a tendency to postulate a tradeoff between a fine-grained understanding of complex causal relations and the ability to generalize. This article argues that QCA overcomes this tradeoff by allowing the researcher to identify moderately complex causal relations while offering the opportunity to generalize and synthesize information from a small, medium, or large number of cases.</p>
<p>Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a family of approaches and techniques for research and data analysis (for a primer see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474022213493839">Ragin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474022213493839">Rihoux and Ragin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474022213493839">Schneider and Wagemann, 2012</xref>) that, since Ragin’s seminal work in 1987, has been widely applied in the social sciences and in particular in the analysis of public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474022213493839">Rihoux et al., 2011</xref>). It is focused around conceptualizing empirical cases as configurations of a ‘truth table’, where each configuration is a sequence of zeros and ones that mean presence or absence of a series of conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022213493839">1</xref></sup> Cases do not necessarily need to be fully assigned to a configuration and can be assigned a partial membership to one or more configurations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022213493839">2</xref></sup> Each configuration or sequence of zeros and ones represents an ideal-type where some conditions are fully present and others are fully absent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref> above). One of the single conditions is called ‘outcome’ and is the condition the researcher wants to explain by understanding how it combines with others over a set of cases. QCA thus aims at generalizing the explanation of the outcome in a way that covers not just one case but a small, medium or large number of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022213493839">3</xref></sup> If different cases belong to several different configurations (several rows of the Truth Table), it can be hard to synthesize the information on the relevant causal factors. In these cases QCA offers a procedure called ‘Boolean minimization’ that gradually reduces the complexity in the solution (which initially looks like the logical sum of the relevant truth table rows) by finding a configuration that is both simpler and logically equivalent to the complex solution. This way, the researcher sees which causal relations apply to the entire population clearly and without losing any information.</p>

<title>QCA and causal inference</title>
<p>This section addresses QCA’s ability to identify moderately complex causal patterns and to attribute a particular type of context-sensitive causality that goes beyond Mill’s methods for single-cause attribution, leading to a kind of theory development that is suitable for complex settings. Much has been written on the connections between evaluation and causal inference and on how one of the main tasks of evaluators is explaining results and attributing them to one or more causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022213493839">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474022213493839">Weiss, 1997</xref>). Mill’s methods provide procedures for attributing a single effect to a single cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022213493839">Befani, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022213493839">Mill, (2002[1843])</xref>); in particular Mill’s Method of Difference is at the basis of the popular counterfactual logic in evaluation. According to Mill’s Method of Difference, if two situations that are identical except in the presence of cause and effect, with both the cause and the effect present in one situation and absent in the other, can be found, then the effect can be safely attributed to the cause. The reason is that no other possible cause could be responsible for the effect as every other possible cause is present in both cases, while the effect is present only in one.</p>
<p>In philosophical texts, the Method of Difference is usually discussed in conjunction with another of Mill’s methods: the Method of Agreement. Applying the latter means looking for two situations presenting the same effect that are different in every possible cause except one. If these two situations are found, the effect is to be attributed to the only cause present in both cases: the reason being that every other possible cause is present in only one situation, while the effect is present in both. Mill’s methods have stood the test of time and in broad terms are still in use but they have been considerably refined (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022213493839">Befani, 2012a</xref>, for a review). Among their problems are that a) they don’t explicitly address asymmetric causality – that is, they don’t specify whether the causal relations they seek to identify are necessary, sufficient, neither or both; b) they don’t address conjunctural causality – that is, situations where the causal relation is to be established between an effect and a combination of multiple causes, a causal package, rather than a single cause; and finally, c) they don’t explicitly address situations where the same effect is produced by different causes (equifinality).</p>
<sec id="section3-1474022213493839">
<title>Improving on Mill’s methods</title>
<p>QCA is compatible with both Mill’s methods and with the above-mentioned improvements: causal asymmetry, equifinality and conjunctural or ‘package’ causality. This section will show, first, how QCA handles causal packages; second, examples will be used to demonstrate that QCA is compatible with equifinality; and, finally, causal asymmetry will be dealt with.</p>
<p>The Truth Table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>) refers to the evaluation of an intervention and presents all the possible logical combinations of the three theorized causal factors of the success of that intervention (i.e. Institutional Capacity in a given country; Multi-Donor Basket Fund (MDBF) as a funding mechanism; and National Ownership of the intervention). In the initial theory, all three conditions are assumed to contribute to success. The analysed empirical cases cover only four of the eight possible truth table configurations (A, B, C and D) while no data exist for the other four (E, F, G and H). The last column reports how many cases have been assigned to each configuration. The three cases assigned to combination A are all successful, as are the one case assigned to combination B and the two cases assigned to combination C. The two cases assigned to combination D are both unsuccessful.</p>
<p>According to a simple application of Mill’s Method of Difference success can be attributed to MDBFs: cases in B and D are identical, except for the outcome and the presence of an MDBF. Following the counterfactual logic as it is normally applied, evidence in B and D is enough to declare an MDBF the cause of success. The problem with this logic is that the context in which an MDBF makes the difference is ignored: when we move to a context where the intervention is owned at the national level (National Ownership is positive), MDBFs stop making a difference. Cases in A and C are both successful in spite of the fact that only one configuration (A) has an MDBF.</p>
<p>QCA shows that the causal relevance of basket funds is contingent on another condition – the absence of national ownership. In other words, it shows that no single cause makes the difference in all situations.</p>

<title>Conjunctural causality: Programmes combine with, rather than add up to, other causes</title>
<p>Conjunctural causality refers to the idea that causal power can be dormant or be triggered depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022213493839">Elster, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022213493839">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022213493839">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022213493839">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). One of the strengths of case studies is the opportunity to observe several potential causes of an effect in action simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022213493839">Brady and Collier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022213493839">George and Bennett, 2005</xref>). While it is generally accepted that programmes are not the only causes of the desired effects,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022213493839">4</xref></sup> causal models differ in the way they conceptualize the relations among programmes and the effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022213493839">Befani, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022213493839">Brady, 2002</xref>). Put simply, most regression-based models see effects as a money box of a certain size, to which each cause contributes a number of pennies. The aim of the analysis is to establish then how much each ‘donating-cause’ independently contributes to (or steals from) the box, one of these donating-causes possibly being the programme or something that the programme aims at influencing.</p>
<p>Other approaches based on theory, mechanisms and systems – e.g. realist evaluation (see section ‘Contexts and theory development’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474022213493839">Pawson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022213493839">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>) – don’t ‘believe’ in causal independence. They see the capacity of causes to contribute to an effect as contingent or dependent on the context or systems in which the causes are embedded. These approaches aim to ensure that an error such as the above – when we assumed Basket Funds would be successful in general, without taking the ‘absence of national ownership’ context into account – would never be made. For this reason the role of each causal factor is made sense of ‘in conjunction’ with other causes, rather than ‘in addition’ to them.</p>
<p>Another example is outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474022213493839">Table 2</xref>, illustrating the difference between causes adding up to each other versus combining with each other. The example refers to a sample of young farmers who have benefited from EU Rural Development policy but report quite different scores in terms of performance and innovation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022213493839">Befani (2012b)</xref> uses QCA in an attempt to explain these differences in performance and analyses three conditions related to their behaviour in times of crisis. When conceptualized as independent variables, none of these strategies is correlated with success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022213493839">5</xref></sup> However, if we stop isolating variables within cases (i.e. if we stop looking at columns) and start looking at cases as wholes (i.e. start looking at rows) we notice that while both success and failure are associated with several different configurations, two types of configurations are always associated with failure. The first (cases J, K and L) combines all three tendencies together (lowering costs, lowering prices and setting up promotional offers) while the second (cases S and T) combines the absence of all three tendencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474022213493839">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>On the financial side, we have farmers trying everything or nothing at all, but the outcome is always negative: both types of extreme strategies fail. There is no correlation with the outcome because opposite strategies lead to the same outcome: summing up the scores and calculating the average didn’t get us anywhere. However, if we look at combinations, we do discover something interesting: that ‘extreme’ strategies lead to failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474022213493839">7</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-1474022213493839">
<title>Contexts and theory development</title>
<p>In the literature, combinations of causal factors are conceptualized in various ways. One is the famous realist, Context-Mechanism-Outcome configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474022213493839">Pawson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022213493839">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>), where mechanisms are behaviours, choices, reasoning, decisions that take place in a structure of resources (skills, legal frameworks, social networks, wealth, knowledge, etc.) called ‘the context’. In trying to add new opportunities to the set rather than unrealistically hoping to change or replace the whole context, programmes hope to influence reasoning, decisions, choices and behaviours. The central idea is that the latter are triggered in a given ‘resource-rich’ context, while they may be inhibited in a ‘resource-poor’ one. Mechanisms are the triggering sparks that thrive on a prepared terrain (the context) to produce the outcome.</p>
<p>Another similar duality<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474022213493839">8</xref></sup> is the distinction between remote and proximate factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474022213493839">Schneider and Wagemann, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474022213493839">2012</xref>). Remote factors are relatively stable over time; they cannot easily be altered by the actors, particularly in the short term, and as a consequence they are often treated as exogenously given. Proximate factors, by contrast, can be more easily altered, are ‘causally closer’ to the outcome in time and related more directly to human action.</p>
<p>Contexts and remote factors relate to the broad sociological concept of ‘structure’ (and are sometimes referred to as ‘structural factors’) while mechanisms and proximate factors relate to ‘agency’ and action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474022213493839">9</xref></sup> Separating mechanisms from contexts, proximate from remote factors, and agency from structure is analytically very risky in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Even in macroeconomic analysis, the temporary state of the economy is sometimes called the ‘economic conjuncture’, to refer to implications that are only temporary and related to a specific time (or phase of the economic cycle). Macroeconomic policy cannot ignore the conjuncture: on the contrary, it needs to be based on it. Depending on which phase of ‘the conjuncture’ or economic cycle we are in, the same macroeconomic policy can have positive or negative effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474022213493839">10</xref></sup> For policy purposes, it is not of much help knowing what happens ‘on average’, which is perhaps a zero effect: it is more helpful to study the positive cases in order to produce more of them and the negative cases in order to prevent them from materializing.</p>
<p>The particular type of causality handled by QCA is also called ‘conjunctural’, because it allows contextual influence to be seen, and draws attention to the conjunction of events rather than the average of their isolated parts. In surfacing similar paths to different outcomes, QCA allows contextual relations to emerge; in particular, in terms of the different effects that an intervention has depending on the context in which it is implemented. The effect changes when the context changes because different mechanisms are activated within it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474022213493839">Sager and Andereggen (2012)</xref> used QCA to assess the influence of a number of factors on the acceptance of transport policy projects in Switzerland. They discovered that involving external experts enhances acceptance, or not, depending on contextual factors. In projects with no prior history an ‘ignorance compensation’ mechanism is activated: stakeholders lack knowledge or experience, and experts are seen as helpful in avoiding planning mistakes and getting the project off to a good start. By contrast, when projects are implemented under financial constraints, stakeholders value financial prudence more than knowledge acquisition: and the avoidance of external advice enhances acceptance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474022213493839">11</xref></sup> because experts are seen as an additional item of expenditure that diverts resources from other uses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474022213493839">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022213493839">Befani et al. (2007)</xref> used QCA to show the influence of two mechanisms on the quality of the implementation of an administrative procedure (the Swiss Environmental Impact Assessment [EIA]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474022213493839">13</xref></sup> The two mechanisms are: ‘clarity of the project definition’; and ‘the organization of a discussion among stakeholders early in the EIA process’. While the presence of both mechanisms leads to a positive outcome, and the absence of both to a negative one, in intermediate cases, whether one of the two mechanisms makes the difference, or not, depends on the context. One contextual dimension that triggers or inhibits the mechanisms is project size. In small projects, if the relevant stakeholders have a discussion at the early stages of the process, the outcome will be positive (implementation quality will be high); otherwise it will not. In small projects the discussion makes the difference. The same discussion is irrelevant for those undertaking large projects. This is because those carrying out small projects must acquire the necessary knowledge through discussions with the relevant agencies, whereas large projects are usually undertaken by bigger firms with more experience and relevant expertise, and they can therefore acquire this knowledge elsewhere. In big projects, the most important mechanism is defining the project clearly. The latter is not so important in small projects, for which the procedure is technically easier and there is more margin for adjustment. But big projects usually include subprojects that need separate assessments and for them the procedure is more difficult to apply. So the clarity of project definition is not important in general, but can be depending on the project size.</p>
<p>The political environment plays a similar role to project size in activating or inhibiting the two causal mechanisms. In settings that are politically and culturally insensitive toward environmental issues, it is the early discussion that determines implementation quality. In such contexts, people have a limited interest in whether a project is environmentally friendly or not: the EIA is likely regarded as laborious paperwork. A discussion at an early stage enhances acceptance of the procedure and facilitates implementation. Without the discussion, those responsible for implementing the project are likely to remain passive, or active in delaying implementation. In a sensitive context, on the other hand, early discussions are less important for acceptance because the EIA is already regarded as an important instrument. What matters here is project definition: a project that is unclearly defined leads to controversy among the stakeholders because some will fear that the environmental regulations might be undermined. The disagreements about the correct application of the instrument will delay the process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474022213493839">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be clear at this point how QCA can help demonstrate the causal influence of the context. It should also be clear why QCA is compatible with equifinality: the idea that there are different, equally successful paths to the effect. For example, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref> success is observed when both institutional capacity and basket funds are observed (irrespective of national ownership); but this is not the only ‘winning combination’ because the combination of national ownership and institutional capacity (irrespective of basket funds) is also successful. In the example above, different combinations of contexts and mechanisms lead to a positive outcome in terms of EIA implementation quality. The third improvement over Mill’s methods, causal asymmetry, will be dealt with in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section6-1474022213493839">
<title>Causal asymmetry: Necessity and sufficiency</title>
<p>Mill’s methods do not analyse necessity and sufficiency separately; however, it has been understood at least since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474022213493839">Mackie (1974)</xref> that, for an effect, a cause can be:</p>
<list id="list1-1474022213493839" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>necessary but not sufficient;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sufficient but not necessary;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>both necessary and sufficient;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>neither necessary nor sufficient.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When cause and effect are in constant conjunction such that we never observe the effect without the cause, or the cause without the effect, then we have symmetry between cause and effect. In other words, each implies the other, and we observe the effect ‘if and only if’ we also observe the cause. This relation is sometimes depicted with the double-ended arrow C ↔ E, which represents the double implication C =&gt; E and E =&gt; C. It is very hard to find examples of causes that are both necessary and sufficient for an effect. One example might be a human being and its signature: a specific signature is produced only by a specific person, and that person is the only person capable of producing that signature.</p>
<p>Those causes that are sufficient but not necessary are easier to locate. Sufficiency without necessity is observed when the cause logically implies the effect or C =&gt; E, but the effect does not imply the cause. A cause is said to be sufficient but not necessary for an effect when it invariably produces the effect but it is not the only cause capable of doing so: the effect can also be produced by other causes. For example, a well-placed gunshot to the head is sufficient to kill a person, but there are many other ways that a person can die. We can satisfactorily have lunch in a number of ways, we do not necessarily need to eat the same thing or in the same place every day. Each different meal will be sufficient to reduce our hunger, but none is necessary. Sufficiency refers to interchangeability and equifinality of causes. In the example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>, two different combinations (institutional capacity*basket fund and institutional capacity*national ownership) equally lead to success. There are many ways to skin a cat.</p>
<p>Necessity without sufficiency (C &lt;= E) is also more easily found than symmetric causality. It is observed when the effect logically implies the cause but the cause does not imply the effect. A cause is said to be necessary but not sufficient for an effect if, whenever the effect is observed, the cause also is. In other words, the effect is never observed in the absence of the cause: but the cause does not invariably produce the effect and is sometimes observed when the effect is absent. In our example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>, institutional capacity is necessary for success (whenever success is observed, institutional capacity also is; success is never observed in its absence) but it is not sufficient, because in at least one configuration (two cases) institutional capacity leads to (is observed jointly with) failure (lack of success).</p>
<p>While symmetric causality is hard to find, in complex settings so are necessity and sufficiency; single causes are rarely constantly and regularly necessary or sufficient. Most frequently, causes are only necessary or sufficient within a specific group of causes. An interesting and useful development on asymmetric causal thinking is represented by INUS (Insufficient but Necessary component of an Unnecessary but Sufficient package) and SUIN (Sufficient but Unnecessary component of an Insufficient but Necessary package) causes that operate within causal packages.</p>
<p>When dealing with INUS causes, the causal package as a whole is sufficient, like configuration B in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>: a combination of institutional capacity, multi-donor basket funds and national ownership is sufficient for success. This sufficiency is, however, contingent on the presence of the multi-donor basket fund; if we take it away (and obtain configuration D) the package no longer leads to success. In other words the presence of multi-donor basket funds, while not necessary for success by itself (as shown in configuration C), is necessary for the three-component package of configuration B to be sufficient. The condition is thus said to be an INUS cause. The SUIN cause refers to necessary but insufficient packages. In our example we saw that institutional capacity is necessary for success but not sufficient. We can imagine institutional capacity to be itself a package with different interchangeable components, each of them sufficient to attest the presence of institutional capacity, although none of them necessary for it. Each of these components would be a SUIN cause because it would be <bold>S</bold>ufficient to show the presence of institutional capacity, although <bold>U</bold>nnecessary for that; and as we saw institutional capacity is (an) <bold>I</bold>nsufficient but <bold>N</bold>ecessary (package). The term ‘package’ has a different meaning in INUS and SUIN causality. In the former case it refers to a combination, or logical intersection; in the latter case to a logical union, or a group of interchangeable causes.</p>
<sec id="section7-1474022213493839">
<title>Analysing necessity and sufficiency</title>
<p>Analysing necessity with QCA is relatively straightforward: the researcher groups the successful cases and looks for conditions that are regularly present in this group (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref> the only necessary condition is institutional capacity). Conversely, the analysis of sufficiency can be trickier because single conditions or combinations of a small number of conditions tend to be associated with both negative and positive outcomes. As more conditions are added to the combination, sufficiency of the package becomes more likely. If the sufficiency analysis returns several complex combinations (e.g. combinations of several conditions) that are equally sufficient, it is hard for the researcher to find a simple enough way to explain the outcome. In these cases the ‘solution’ is the logical sum of several different combinations and is not particularly useful for either understanding, explaining or developing theory.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the analysis of sufficiency, QCA offers a procedure (the Quine-McCluskey algorithm of logical minimization) that gradually reduces the complexity of the configuration without losing any information on the cases, and thus provides the researcher with a simpler, easier-to-interpret configuration that is logically equivalent to the complex one. See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1474022213493839">Box 1</xref> for the solutions pertaining to the example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>. The solutions show that Institutional Capacity, while not sufficient on its own, becomes so when combined with either Multi-Donor Basket Fund or National Ownership.</p>

<title>Ground-preparing factors and triggering events</title>
<p>One special case of causal combination is the conjunction between triggering events and ground-preparing factors. The latter are useful to better understand necessity because ground-preparing factors are necessary for the effect, while the former are useful to better understand sufficiency (in the INUS form) because, in the context of a well-prepared and ready background, triggering events are sufficient to activate the effect. Historical changes are never produced by single events and usually historians distinguish between events that create the conditions for other events to happen (the necessary factors), and ‘straws’ that break the proverbial camel’s back<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474022213493839">15</xref></sup> (the sufficient causes within a given background). Similarly, programmes are less often ‘magic bullets’ that trigger change in and of themselves, but mostly prepare the ground for long-term change, including by ‘repairing’ some very dangerous ‘faulty parts’ that might trigger system failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474022213493839">16</xref></sup> Knowing whether some conditions are required for a programme to work is important in order to make it work.</p>
<p>An unpublished part of the evaluation of the strategy of an international development organization demonstrated that in order for the organization to positively contribute to changes in national policy and national reforms, two conditions needed to hold: a relatively high national income<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474022213493839">17</xref></sup> and a good understanding of administrative procedures. These conditions were not sufficient for success, not even jointly: in some cases capacity development and national ownership were additionally needed; in other cases more deficient in terms of capacity development, it appeared essential that the organization managed to disseminate knowledge smoothly and strengthened its profile in the country. However, success was never possible in a situation of low income and bad understanding of administrative procedures. Each of these conditions appeared to be necessary, ground-preparing factors for success; and absence of either was shown to be sufficient for ‘the machine to break’ (sufficient for a negative contribution to national change on behalf of the organization).</p>
<p>Another example of an intervention that can be shown to function as one ground-preparing factor in a wider system or causal field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022213493839">Mackie, 1965</xref>) is the EU Rural Development Policy (RDP) for young farmers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022213493839">Befani (2012b)</xref> found that benefiting from the RDP is necessary for young farmers to become successful but is not sufficient:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474022213493839">18</xref></sup> other factors are needed. However, even if it is not sufficient, failing to acknowledge that the RDP has at least ‘prepared the ground’ means underestimating its causal relevance (or ‘impact’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474022213493839">19</xref></sup> If we assess causal factors only by their capacity to trigger a final outcome, we fail to recognize the relevance of the ground-preparing factors that are, causally, no less important than the triggers because the latter would not be effective without the former.</p>

<title>External validity and generalization</title>
<p>Using a sophisticated approach to causal inference is important to explain why an intervention is successful or not and to develop a theory of why that intervention worked in the past, is working at present or will work in the future, and under what circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022213493839">Cartwright and Hardie, 2012</xref>). A related issue of interest to policy makers is how generalizable a theory can be: does the theory apply to one case only? Will it expire at some point in the future? Is it valid for similar cases? If so, which ones?</p>
<p>The ability of a set of findings to apply or be generalizable to a large number of cases is usually referred to as external validity. The latter is usually considered to be a strength of statistical studies, particularly of observational studies based on large-n samples. However, target populations differ in size and studies require samples of different sizes to achieve the same strength in external validity (or ability to generalize). Some theories or causal relations are specifically targeted to small populations: for example, it is hard to argue that evaluating the behaviour of South American national environmental agencies after a reform of international climate change norms requires a large-n sample, because there are only a small number of national environmental agencies in Latin America. In such cases the target population is small enough for even small-n studies to be ‘externally valid’/fully generalizable.</p>
<p>Traditionally, QCA has been considered suitable for limited, middle-range generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474022213493839">Ragin, 1987</xref>): according to an old rule of thumb, crisp-set QCA (csQCA) was regarded as typically suited to sets of cases ranging from five to thirty. However, some scholars do not see this limitation. In any case, since the advent of fsQCA, it has become obvious that, in addition to small n, QCA can handle a medium as well as a large number of cases. One recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474022213493839">Vis, 2012</xref>) has compared fsQCA and regression analysis by applying them to the same data set on the conditions under which governments increase their spending on active labour market policies. The study has concluded that, while fsQCA can handle the same number of cases as regression (53) and is thus as strong on external validity, it leads to a fuller understanding of the conditions under which the outcome occurs, providing richer information on the complexity of causal relations.</p>
<p>The ability to generalize does not merely depend on sample size. It also depends on how many different ‘paths’ to the outcome are covered in the sample: how many different contexts and causal influences are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022213493839">Cartwright and Munro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022213493839">Cartwright and Hardie, 2012</xref>). When there are size limits on the sample that can be extracted from a population, even statistical techniques take causal relations into account. Stratified sampling techniques sacrifice randomness in favour of attention to the different sources of causal influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022213493839">Cicchitelli et al., 1992</xref>), which is exactly what QCA never fails to do, even when it does not cover a large number of cases.</p>
<p>In other words QCA generalizes findings while refining them at the same time, preserving a moderate level of diversity in the multiple, explanatory paths to the outcome that apply to an increasingly large number of cases.</p>

<title>Theory testing and refinement</title>
<p>Like other case-based methods, QCA is strong in deriving new hypotheses, exploring causal mechanisms and modelling complex causal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022213493839">George and Bennett, 2005</xref>); however, it is also strong in testing, refining and validating findings across a small, medium or large number of cases. In this section we review two applications of QCA that have tested and refined theories across sets of, respectively, 17 and 11 cases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474022213493839">Sager (2006)</xref> tests a theoretical statement on the ability of the progressive model of metropolitan governance to facilitate policy coordination in transport projects.

<p>The initial theory was confirmed in two contexts: the ‘high-pressure, high-conflict’ situations where evaluations act as ‘referees’, and the ‘low-pressure, low-conflict’ situations where evaluations act as ‘awakeners’. In high-pressure, low-conflict contexts where evaluations act as ‘triggers’, the theory was refined as quality was discovered to be necessary even when evaluations have no novelty value. No evidence was available for a fourth context where evaluations acted as ‘conciliators’. As in the metropolitan governance example, QCA refined a broad-brush theory by specifying which parts of the theory apply to which contexts.</p>
<p>How generalizable are the new, refined theories? They can hardly be defined as universal laws; but because they have been shown to hold for a medium number of cases (17 and 11), they are also quite far from being ‘one-case-only’ exceptions. It is worthwhile remarking that the findings mentioned in earlier parts of the article refer to eight cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474022213493839">Table 1</xref>), 28 cases (the young farmers of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474022213493839">Table 2</xref>), 17 cases (the conditions that influence acceptance of transport policy projects in the section ‘Contexts and theory development’), 15 cases (the evaluation of the Swiss EIA in the section ‘Contexts and theory development’) and 30 cases (the necessary conditions for an international organization to contribute to national reforms in the section ‘Ground-preparing factors and triggering events’). None of these evaluations have used fsQCA: if they had, the findings could have been potentially generalized to 50 or 100 cases or more.</p>
<sec id="section11-1474022213493839">
<title>The dialogue between theory and data: An asset for synthesis</title>
<p>The ability to include a small, medium or high number of cases is certainly an asset when it comes to synthesizing findings from multiple evaluations. However, it is not the only feature of QCA that benefits syntheses: another is the possibility to maintain a direct ‘dialogue’ between theory and the data from empirical cases. In the above examples, while reducing the importance of some conditions that were initially thought to be important, QCA drew attention to others that were initially thought to be less important. For example, the outcome ‘quality of implementation of coordinated policy decisions’ in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text2-1474022213493839">Box 2</xref> was included because the first four findings were not considered satisfactory: the link between coordination and the progressive model of governance appeared weak. After observing the unexpected result, the researcher ‘went back to the cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022213493839">De Meur and Rihoux, 2002</xref>) and looked for other outcomes that could possibly be linked to the model more strongly, checking if the unexpected result was consistent with the qualitative evidence at the case level. Shortly afterwards, a new theoretical model with a new outcome was tested.</p>
<p>This iterative procedure, or ‘dialogue’, between theory and data, is particularly useful when synthesizing information from different sources and authors that are not immediately or easily comparable. In such cases it is likely that researchers have focused on different aspects of the cases and some data will likely be missing; but if a quick first QCA analysis reveals some conditions to be important, the researcher can go back to the cases, reconstruct or retrieve the missing information, and test the model that includes those conditions over a larger set of cases than was previously possible.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Case-based evaluations need not only explain why a programme worked or not, but in some circumstances should be able to produce generalizable findings. This article has argued that QCA not only offers the opportunity to use sophisticated models of causal inference and develop moderately complex theories, but also provides the means to test, refine and validate those theories, generalizing them to either a small, medium or large number of cases. Like mechanism-based, holistic and narrative approaches, QCA is suitable to explain outcomes (although it allows a less sophisticated explanation than those approaches); and like statistical methods, it is suitable for generalization (although a slightly less powerful generalization). It brings together the best of both worlds, the best of qualitative and of quantitative methods. However, as with other research tools and approaches, QCA is not without limitations. The robustness of QCA findings has yet to receive systematic attention in the literature, even though a few strategies have been proposed to test the sensitivity of findings to model specification and design choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474022213493839">Schneider and Wagemann, 2012</xref>) and there is no reason to believe that the method is inherently less robust than others. A widely recognized limitation of QCA is its weak ability to handle variations in time; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474022213493839">Schneider and Wagemann (2012)</xref> outline four strategies to overcome this limitation, including a new variant of QCA originally introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022213493839">Caren and Panovski (2005)</xref>, called temporal QCA or tQCA. Another limitation is that the same finding ‘a single condition is necessary/sufficient for the outcome’ has a different meaning depending on how many conditions are included in the initial model; and the finding is more powerful the more conditions are included in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474022213493839">21</xref></sup> In spite of these limitations QCA appears an essential tool for case-based evaluations, with its ability to combine the richness and fine granularity of explanation-oriented enquiry with increasingly wider opportunities for generalization.</p>

<p>In QCA, variables are normally referred to as ‘conditions’ because while variable-based methods use a branch of mathematics called calculus, QCA is based on a branch of mathematics called set-theory.</p>

<p>In the crisp-set version of QCA (csQCA) cases are either fully in or fully out of a set (represented by a sequence of zeros and ones) while in the fuzzy-set version (fsQCA) cases have partial membership to single conditions and to combinations of conditions.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1474022213493839">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Some scholars use a rule of thumb where csQCA is optimal to handle five to thirty cases while fsQCA can handle a much larger population size; others do not see a link between the type of QCA and the number of cases.</p>

<p>Effects are produced by several causes even according to the proponents of randomized studies, who aim to ‘eliminate all possible causes, even the unobservable ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474022213493839">Yin, 2003</xref>) through RCTs.

<p>Note that <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474022213493839">Table 2</xref> is a data set, where rows are cases, and is not to be confused with a truth table, where rows are the logically possible combinations of a number of conditions.

<p>In QCA’s notation (borrowed from formal logic), the solution is written as: (lowering prices AND setting up promotional offers AND lowering costs) OR (NOT lowering prices AND NOT setting up promotional offers AND NOT lowering costs).

<p>In analytical sociology, mechanisms refer to a broader combination than in scientific realism; however, the distinction with the context is not so clear cut, even nominally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022213493839">Elster, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022213493839">Hedstrom, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>In attempting to answer the question ‘Why is it easier to break something than to build it?’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474022213493839">Jonathan Morell (2012)</xref> notes that ‘in order for the system to function, dependencies among those parts need to be maintained . . . all the dependencies need to function, while only a few need to break for failure to cascade through the system’.</p>

<p>Here is the final solution in QCA notation: Positive contribution to national reforms = (~LOWINC * ~ ADMINNOTUND * ~ CAPDEV * ~ KNOWISS) + (~LOWINC * ~ ADMINNOTUND *capdev* NATOWN) = (~LOWINC * ~ ADMINNOTUND)*( ~CAPDEV * ~ KNOWISS + CAPDEV * NATOWN). Negative contribution to national reforms = LOWINC + ADMINNOTUND + KNOWISS * ~ NATOWN. In QCA notation, the sign ‘~’ stands for logical negation. So high income is denoted as ‘~lowinc’ because it’s the logical negation of low income (denoted with ‘lowinc’).</p>

<p>It is necessary because 92% of successful young farmers have highly benefited from RDP, but not sufficient because only 61% of those who highly benefited went on to become successful.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1474022213493839">
<label>19.</label>
<p>This is further confirmed by the high percentage of unsuccessful among those who do not benefit from it: 80% of those who did not highly benefit from the RDP went on to become unsuccessful. Not benefiting from the RDP is almost sufficient for failure.</p>

<p>The construct ‘policy coordination’ is articulated into four sub-constructs and QCA is performed on each, in an attempt to explain each kind of outcome by the presence or absence of the main features of the progressive model of metropolitan governance.</p>

<p>This is because they all have been shown to be redundant. For example, if we start with six conditions and obtain four necessary conditions for an outcome, it means that the other two are not necessary; while if we start only with those four that we eventually discover to be necessary, we will still see that they are necessary but we do not know anything about the other two. Similarly, if we start with five conditions and obtain a sufficient combination of two conditions, it means that values of the other three conditions vary in ways that are irrelevant to predict the outcome. In contrast, if the initial model includes only those two conditions, the sufficiency of their combinations is still correct but no information is provided on the other three conditions, which instead of being irrelevant for the outcome might also be sufficient, alone or in combination.</p>
