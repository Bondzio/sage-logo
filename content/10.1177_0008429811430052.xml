<abstract>
<p>The cohabitation of philosophy with the study of religion has such a long history that we have not been motivated to consider the terms of that relationship. This paper proposes that this relationship needs to be examined radically. That is to say it proposes to query the nature, or possible natures, of the relationship of philosophy to the study of religion by posing such questions as the following: What kind of philosophy belongs in the study of religion? Constructive? Critical? Does philosophy have an independent role in the study of religion or does it, rather, best play the role of ‘handmaiden’? To the extent that philosophy plays an integral part in the study of religion, how should philosophy reflect the global and cross-cultural nature of the study of religion? To what extent does a philosophy that is integral to the study of religion need to change in order to reflect the philosophical agendas integral to other religions than Christianity? </p>
<p>La cohabitation de la philosophie avec l’étude de la religion a une si longue histoire que nous ne nous sommes pas penchés sur les termes de cette relation. Cet article montre le besoin d’un examen radical de cette relation. C’est-à-dire qu’il propose d’interroger la nature, ou les natures possibles, de la relation que la philosophie entretient avec l’étude de la religion à partir de plusieurs questions: Quels types de philosophie font partie de l’étude de la religion? Constructive? Critique? La philosophie a-t-elle un rôle indépendant dans l’étude de la religion ou est-elle plutôt dans le rôle de « servir » ? Dans la mesure où la philosophie est une partie intégrante de l’étude de la religion, comment la philosophie devrait-elle refléter la nature mondiale et culturellement croisée de l’étude de la religion ? Dans quelle mesure, une philosophie faisant partie intégrante de l’étude de la religion doit-elle être transformée de façon à rendre compte des programmes des religions autres que la Chrétienté?</p>

<title>Of Philosophy, of Religion, and of ‘Of’</title>
<p>When we consider the future of the philosophy of religion, I think we should look critically at both the term ‘philosophy’ and the term ‘religion’ but also the sense of ‘of’ involved. Let me explain. While, in principle, neither term should be left unanalyzed, I want to propose a future for philosophy of religion that depends on revising the concept of religion with which we work. While taking note of the way philosophers of religion work in the Anglo-American analytic tradition, I do not propose to change this way of working so much as to change that with which they work. For good or for ill, I want to insist on trying to adapt classical analytic philosophy to a new task, rather than shifting to a different mode of doing philosophy. I well appreciate that philosophers from the various Continental or phenomenological traditions might complain that they will not, therefore, get a hearing. True, they have long made religion the object of their thinking. In the meanwhile, classical analytic philosophy of religion has fallen into something of a rut. While it has dealt with religion, it has not sufficiently scrutinized the concept of religion as commonly understood, at least in the West. What I propose, then, is not a new way of doing philosophy so much as a new product resulting from the application of philosophical techniques of analysis to a novel conception of religion.</p>
<p>The meaning of ‘of’ raises another matter, as Kevin Schilbrack pointed out in his response to my presentation at the International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR). I also steer clear of that meaning of philosophy <italic>of</italic> religion where the sense of ‘of’ places emphasis on doing philosophy in some sort of ‘religious’ way. The ‘of’ of philosophy of religion is thus the ‘of’ that signals an application of philosophical methods <italic>to</italic> religion, not the ‘of’ signaling that this philosophizing one does bears religious characteristics. Choosing to make ‘religion’ a variable and philosophy a constant, so to speak, also means that I am not proposing anything like some new philosophical theology or speculative philosophy. In both those cases, in their respective ways, philosophy departs from the model of ‘garden variety’ analytic philosophy. I am, instead, proposing a relatively new notion of religion that will be the focus of a more traditional kind of philosophizing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0008429811430052">
<title>Of Religion</title>
<p>‘Religion’ for classic analytic philosophy of religion has typically been conceived as ‘beliefs,’ ‘doctrines,’ ‘theologies,’ and such. I shall call this conception of religion ‘cognitivist.’ As such, classical analytic philosophy of religion assumes religion primarily to be (or to be more interesting) in its propositional form. What matters in religion is religious thoughts or words. This point of view, I assume, is a relatively recent product of the modern historical phenomenon of religious confessionalism generated by Protestant and Roman Catholic Reformations. Historian Benjamin J. Kaplan has argued, for instance, that the modern stress on religion as belief came about during the early modern period around the time of the Protestant Reformation. Kaplan does not, however, deny that, at least for Christians, the command both to ‘believe’ and to ‘confess’ dates from the apostolic age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430052">Pelikan, 2003</xref>). But, rather, Kaplan notes that Reformation confessionalism adds the most recent emphasis on and definition to an already well-entrenched trend in Christianity. The conditions set by the struggles over the Reformation intensified the insistence upon belief as the ultimate criterion of religiousness. In a divided Christendom, one was pressed to take sides in order to establish lines of loyalty with a degree of precision. Therefore, religion came ‘increasingly to mean belief in a particular creed, and a life lived in accordance with it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429811430052">Kaplan, 2007</xref>: 31). The classical analytic philosophy of religion inherits this tendency.</p>
<p>Classical analytic philosophy of religion also, of course, reflects the dominance of Christianity in the West, and the resultant assumption of ‘religion’ in the Christian mode. Here, as I noted, the prominence of creeds—‘confessions of faith’—in both Latin and Eastern Christianity has made it easy to assume that beliefs are the essence of religion. And, even without the added tension created by the struggles of the Reformation period, Christianity always recognized its links to confessions of faith. Historian Jaroslav Pelikan has, for example, collected hundreds of creeds dating from the time of the early Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430052">Pelikan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Likewise, Western philosophical traditions as a whole, rooted in medieval philosophical theology—Augustine, Aristotelianism, Scholasticism, Thomism—predispose Western philosophers of religion to make beliefs the focus of philosophical inquiry. Inquiries into the doctrine of original sin, the problem of evil, the paradoxes involved in Jesus’ dual divine/human nature, the validity of various proofs of God’s existence and so on—all have dominated Western philosophy of religion since the early middle ages. And though traditions of early modern Western philosophy of religion emerged in large part to rival the medieval world’s solutions to problems in the philosophy of religion, they actually maintained the medieval concern with such matters as doctrines and beliefs. Thus, since Descartes, the Empiricists and others sought—like the medievals—to reconcile Christian <italic>beliefs</italic> to new knowledge. In the case of the early moderns, the rise of modern science, skepticism and such challenged Christian <italic>belief</italic>. Thus, the philosophers stayed fixed in the world of religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, then, the precursors of classical analytic philosophy of religion presumed that what mattered about religion were the <italic>propositions</italic> it asserted. With these consisting of words, statements, not practices or feelings, this meant as well that ‘religion’ was, often, routinely identified with ‘theology.’ This identification lies at the basis of the frequent confusion between classical analytic philosophy of religion and ‘philosophical theology.’ By contrast, we might compare the way religion was conceived by a pre-modern like Francis of Assisi (1181–1226). Two aphorisms nicely capture Francis’ relegation of beliefs, dogmas and theologies to a place of secondary importance beneath something we might call ‘life.’ Francis is reported to have told his disciples that: ‘It is no use walking anywhere to preach unless our walking is our preaching.’ ‘Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words.’</p>
<p>Classical analytic philosophy of religion, therefore, sees ‘religion’ as a ‘spiritual,’ disembodied, if not entirely intellectual, object. Of course, these philosophers know about religious feelings, bodily practices, modes of religious social organization, architecture and the like. But these are not the proper objects of philosophy. What matters about religion neither has weight nor takes up space. Religion as a temporal or a historical phenomenon is peripheral to philosophic inquiry into religion. Classical analytic philosophy of religion thus has nothing to do with calendrical matters, such as feast days, cycles of practical religious observance, days of atonement, holidays—‘holy-days.’ Nor with the part of religion that reflects temporal processes of change essential to religion. Philosophers may note how beliefs change from time to time. But what matters is the belief, not the ‘time,’ so to speak. Again, philosophers may take note of cultural, social, generational, or inter-subjective aspects of the beliefs under examination. But, it remains the beliefs themselves that matter, not their embeddedness in cultural or social networks.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the monotheistic heritage of Judaism and Christianity has had a powerful, and powerfully unexamined, effect on the conception of religion assumed by classical analytic philosophy of religion. Religion presumes a discrete, bodiless, personal and ‘interventionist’ deity at the center of religious life. Such a view of the nature of religion as centering on a superhuman power suggests that people are viewed as on the brink of calamity. ‘<italic>Nur ein Gott kann uns retten</italic>,’ one might say—‘only a God can save us.’ Thus religion’s salience resides in its dwelling at the extremes in human life, in ‘crises.’ Religious people are on the edge, lurching toward calamity. Given this vision of the human situation, it makes excellent sense to see religion as an interventionist practice, which offers salvation from these extremes of crisis, calamity and catastrophe. The logic of religion thus understood dictates that salvation becomes the business of a god or some other higher power. The tendency here is to see religion as something wheeled in to ‘intervene’ in crises. But, is this the only way to conceive religion?</p>
<p>Durkheim did not think so. He develops a sense in which religion is the presumed nurturing basis for normal life. I am asking whether this different conception of religion can be the basis for a different philosophy of religion. Once we presume life to be a series of potential catastrophes, religion as engaging a superhuman being swooping in for the rescue becomes logically inevitable, or as the CogSci types would say, ‘natural’ (<italic>sic</italic>).</p>
<p>Yet, one is tempted to ask about the rest of life—when we are not, for example, ‘white-knuckling’ it during a rocky bit of air travel? We need authority and value to inform our sense of human flourishing. Does anything worthy of the name ‘religion’ provide that? While it may be hard to let go of superhuman power, a god to intervene at times of crisis, perhaps we should consider the alternative of a non-interventionist ‘sacred’ that Durkheim developed. This ‘sacred’ was for him an abiding source of power, authority, legitimacy and purpose. The Durkheimian sacred lays the foundation for human flourishing. Durkheim provides a language of transcendence, a grammar facilitating ways ‘good to think’ about human flourishing, but one that does not demand Intervention-Man to swoop in with his red cape to save the day. Buddhist Nirvana is precisely such a sacred. Nirvana sets the limits of the ultimate, sacred value that has given Buddhist civilization the core values informing it for well over two millennia. To Buddhists, ‘interventionism’ is the job of lesser beings, such as the <italic>devatas</italic>. Not accidentally, here is precisely where Durkheim decided to expand the definition of religion beyond interventionist theism by defining religion as the administration of the sacred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0008429811430052">
<title>Another Kind of Philosophy of Religion: Some Examples of such an Inquiry</title>
<p>I thus offer the idea that this different conception of religion as the object of philosophy of religion would generate another sort of philosophy of religion. Why? Since the normal objects of philosophical inquiry would be themselves different from those typical of the past, the end result produced by this new philosophy of religion would be unlike that produced before by classical analytic philosophy of religion. In this respect, the model of analytic political philosophy can serve as a model for a new philosophy of religion. Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor, Ernest Gellner and others show how the skills of analytic philosophy can be, and have been, taken into the political domain. Their analytically sophisticated, as well as historically informed, studies of toleration, liberty, equality, diversity, secularism, power and so on—politics ‘on the ground,’ so to speak—should serve philosophy of religion with persuasive models of how the new philosophy of religion might look.</p>
<p>I propose that in this sense religion would be regarded as ‘the administration of the sacred.’ As an abiding source of energy, identity, legitimacy and purpose, as framing a world of meaning, this (Durkheimian) sacred lays the foundation for human flourishing. As a kind of language of transcendence, religion in the Durkheimian mode offers a grammar facilitating ways ‘good to think’ about human flourishing.</p>
<p>But how, precisely, would this kind of philosophizing look? What objects would it take up, and what questions or problems would it address? Here are the beginnings of an answer to such questions. Philosophy of religion would apply analytic skills to this non-interventionist sacred as, among other things, involving affiliation of various kinds, as material, as concerning practices, as bound up with the emotional life, as embodied, as expressed in cultural, social and inter-subjective formations. Let us take these in order.</p>
<sec id="section4-0008429811430052">
<title>Affiliation</title>
<p>One of the most fundamental aspects of religious life is how individuals link or <italic>affiliate</italic> with one another. By means of affiliation, individuals create or discover identity, whether or how their acts have legitimacy and purpose. Thus, the pervasive fact of human affiliation generates a series of questions, such as the following: Is religious affiliation essentially hierarchical? Must it be authoritarian? How do rites establish affiliation? Why are the bonds of affiliation formed in religions often stronger than natural ones?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0008429811430052">
<title>Cultures and Communities</title>
<p>Once we establish affiliation as a normal part of being human, and thus religious, we will want to understand the many different forms of sociability that affiliations assume. Here ‘culture’ or ‘society’ may be treated as ‘emergent’ in human life, and thus as generators of their own peculiar set of problems for religion, regarded from a critical—philosophical—point of view. Can there be ‘society’ without sacrifice? What are the minimum conditions for speaking of a religious culture or society? Why, if they actually do, do men seem to rule? Why is the Buddhist Sangha the longest lived voluntary community in the world?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0008429811430052">
<title>Materiality</title>
<p>We live a life in time and space, one that has meaning in part because of the shape of the material world that surrounds, envelopes and, thus, sustains us. Religious architecture, for example, plays a powerful role in grounding life in a wide range of senses. What would Islam be without minarets or the <italic>ka’aba</italic>, Christianity without a horizon dotted with steeples, Buddhism without <italic>stupas</italic> or pagodas? While the religions mentioned might still exist, would they be fundamentally the same without the predictable visual background of their distinctive architectures? Or consider slighter changes in sacred sites. Change the color of an historic New England Congregational church from white to day-glow orange. What happens? What material changes would make a particular sacred site more so, or less? Does walling or fencing in a cemetery make it more, or less, sacred? Is there a general or even universal language of sacred space? Under what conditions does the materiality of religion serve or hinder a religion?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0008429811430052">
<title>Practices</title>
<p>Debates over the relative importance of what people ‘do’ over against what they ‘think’ are nothing new in the study of religion. Indeed, they are nothing new in the entire field of the study of human action in general. One such question is whether there is a sense in which practices are merely external. The implication here is that if they are ‘external,’ they are not as valid a measure of religious vitality as, say, inner experience or beliefs. The assumption is that there is something inauthentic and empty about a religion that places emphasis on ‘practices.’ But, is this true, and why? An entire series of related questions surfaces once we begin to probe such issues. To what extent, for example, can a regime of religious practices exist in the absence of beliefs? How do religious practices and moral principles articulate? Can they?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0008429811430052">
<title>Emotional Life</title>
<p>Perhaps the most refractory, but nonetheless ordinary, feature of religious life is the life of the emotions. Feelings, moods, experiences and attitudes fill the world of religious life equally with, if not more than, other dimensions of human life. What is religion without feelings of guilt and glory, moods of sublimity and confidence, experiences of transport and despair, attitudes of reverence and awe? Focusing on emotions points us, as well, to the mechanisms of emotional manipulation or expression. Why, for instance, are religious music and the emotions so closely linked? How does religion work with the ‘emotions’? By way of manipulating the creation or destruction of ‘moods’? Then, perhaps, we should not assume that emotions and cognition stand apart. Do religious emotions, for instance, have cognitive value? Is there such a thing as religious emotional intelligence?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0008429811430052">
<title>Bodies</title>
<p>Our bodies might, perhaps, be considered just a subset of the material nature of human existence. But, in their unique and intimate relation to our identities, they are surely more. I ‘am’ my body in a way I am not the <italic>stupa</italic> before which I offer frangipani garlands. We are virile, nubile, or senile; young, old, or middling; Gen-X, Gen-Y, or Boomers among some other slices of the demographic pie; male or female, straight or gay, white, black, brown, and more. How do these few bodily differences—of the many one might mention—make a difference? Why do they make a difference? Likewise our bodies may be regarded in whole or in parts—the king’s sacred ‘body politic’ or the odor of sanctity rising from the corpse of some saint, the Buddha’s tooth or a whisker from Muhammad’s beard, the ‘hand’ of God or of the <italic>curandera</italic>. What matters most? Furthermore, what is the role of fundamental biology, if any?</p>
<p>I would conclude here by reaffirming the view that these questions are meaningfully called <italic>philosophical</italic>. That is to say, they are second-order questions, conceptual, if you will. They belong more to the tradition of classical analytic philosophy of religion because of their critical nature. The effort here is not to advance a certain worldview, but to examine critically the grounds of our thinking about religion, taken in its non-interventionist, non-cognitive aspect. I am not saying that we should abandon the study of religious beliefs. But there are good reasons to reach beyond the propositional and cognitive approach, to a notion of religion that is more faithful to the view articulated by Durkheim among others. Religion is the administration of the sacred, and the sacred has material, temporal, spatial, social, cultural, emotional embodiments that await our critical examination.</p>
