<abstract>
<p>Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins occurs commonly in human cancers. Bfl-1 is highly expressed in some types of malignant cells, contributing significantly to tumor cell survival and chemoresistance. Therefore, it would be desirable to have chemical antagonists of Bfl-1. To this end, we devised a fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) using Bfl-1 protein and fluorescein-conjugated Bid BH3 peptide, which was employed for high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Approximately 66 000 compounds were screened for the ability to inhibit BH3 peptide binding to Bfl-1, yielding 14 reproducible hits with ≥50% displacement. After dose-response analysis and confirmation using a secondary assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), two groups of Bfl-1-specific inhibitors were identified, including chloromaleimide and sulfonylpyrimidine series compounds. FPAs generated for each of the six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins demonstrated selective binding of both classes of compounds to Bfl-1. Analogs of the sulfonylpyrimidine series were synthesized and compared with the original hit for Bfl-1 binding by both FPAs and TR-FRET assays. The resulting structure-activity relation analysis led to the chemical probe compound CID-2980973 (ML042). Collectively, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the HTS assay for discovery of selective chemical inhibitors of Bfl-1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mitochondrial pathway for cell death is governed by members of the Bcl-2 family proteins. Several homologs of Bcl-2 have been identified, with some functioning as blockers and others as promoters of cell death, constituting a family of more than 27 genes in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057111429372">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111429372">3</xref></sup> Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1) interact with BH3-only pro-apoptotic members (e.g., Bid, Bad, Bim, Puma, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, Nbk/Bik) to regulate pro-apoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bak, which trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors that promote activation of caspases, causing apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057111429372">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111429372">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057111429372">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The human genome contains six genes that encode anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057111429372">2</xref></sup> Among these is Bfl-1 (also known as A1 in mice), a nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB)–inducible member of the Bcl-2 family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057111429372">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111429372">9</xref></sup> Bfl-1 promotes the survival of immune and inflammatory cells, including mast cells associated with allergy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057111429372">10</xref></sup> Given that transgenic overexpression of various anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in lymphocytes causes autoimmunity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057111429372">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057111429372">12</xref></sup> Bfl-1 may represent a target for certain autoimmune and allergic diseases. In addition, Bfl-1 is highly upregulated in therapy-resistant B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), acute myelogenous leukemia with poor prognosis, large B-cell lymphomas, and some other cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057111429372">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057111429372">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057111429372">13</xref></sup> Bfl-1 appears to play a critical role in tumor cell survival and chemoresistance, as demonstrated by the observation that Bfl-1 knockdown by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) can restore apoptosis of drug-resistant leukemia and lymphoma cells in culture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057111429372">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057111429372">16</xref></sup> thus suggesting the importance of Bfl-1 as a therapeutic target for cancer. Bfl-1 has also been shown to be responsible for resistance of malignant cells to chemical inhibitors that neutralize other members of the Bcl-2 family, implying that inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> can be insufficient to achieve apoptosis when Bfl-1 is highly expressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057111429372">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057111429372">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057111429372">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Synthetic BH3 peptides bind anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins with nanomolar affinities, promoting apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057111429372">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057111429372">20</xref></sup> Nonpeptidyl compounds have been identified that compete with BH3 peptides for binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, mimicking BH3 peptides and creating interest in development of these molecules as potential cancer therapeutics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111429372">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087057111429372">22</xref></sup> Of note, systematic analysis of all chemical inhibitors of Bcl-2 thus far described in the literature reveals that few of the synthetic compounds or natural products previously reported bind Bfl-1 with a biologically relevant affinity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111429372">21</xref></sup> and none binds selectively to Bfl-1. Thus, the pocket on Bfl-1 that binds BH3 peptides is presumably sufficiently different from other Bcl-2 family members that it should be possible to obtain selective inhibitors, either directly from screens of diverse libraries or secondarily through chemical analoging of hits that interact with Bfl-1.</p>
<p>To this end, we have devised a homogeneous fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) based on binding of recombinant soluble Bfl-1 protein to synthetic Bid BH3 peptide conjugated with a fluorochrome. In this assay, the rotation of fluorochrome-conjugated peptide ligand is slowed upon binding the Bfl-1 target protein, thus affecting the interaction of the fluorochrome with polarized light. High-throughput conditions were optimized, and approximately 66 000 chemical compounds were screened as proof of concept. The primary hits were further confirmed using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. We succeeded in obtaining two groups of Bfl-1-specific inhibitors, including a chloromaleimide series that has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087057111429372">23</xref></sup> and a sulfonylpyrimidine series described here. The active sulfonylpyrimidines were demonstrated to bind selectively to Bfl-1 among the six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Despite the general challenges of identifying inhibitors of protein–protein interactions by high-throughput screening (HTS) and the length of BH3 peptides (~16 amino acids), these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the FPA reported here for identification of compounds that interact competitively with the BH3 binding site on Bfl-1, which may serve as a starting point for optimization and eventual generation of drug candidates.</p>

Using a modified Bis-Tris buffer, we achieved a 30% increase in the assay window (signal-to-noise ratio), 3-fold relative to the K<sub>d</sub>, allowing a 33-fold reduction of protein concentration and an improvement in the signal stability from 15 min to 24 h compared to PBS buffer without detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111429372"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111429372"><bold>1B</bold></xref>, data not shown). In the optimized FPAs, the concentration of Bfl-1 is approximately equivalent to the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub> = 9.2 ± 0.2 nM) of its complex with the fluorescent BH3 peptide ligand. Similarly, a TR-FRET assay was optimized using the same modified Bis-Tris buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111429372"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>; K<sub>d</sub> = 2.9 ± 0.3 nM). In addition to decreasing the assay protein requirements, the optimized conditions also improved assay sensitivity. We note that our experience has been that each batch of recombinant Bfl-1 protein should be tested and protein concentration adjusted as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111429372"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>.</p>

Alternatively, FITC–Bid peptide was added to wells without Bfl-1 protein (first column, 16 wells, white circles). Fluorescence polarization was measured after 10 min. Data represent fluorescence polarization (mP) measured in individual wells, constituting 176 replicates for each condition in a 384-well format. The Z′ score was calculated. (B) For chemical library screening, GST–Bfl-1 (3 nM) was incubated with FITC–Bid BH3 peptide (2.2 nM) with DMSO alone or with 20 µM of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) library compounds (blue). Fluorescence polarization was measured as previously described.

<p>The assay was screened against the entire NIH small-molecule library, which at the time consisted of ~66,000 compounds, searching for chemical inhibitors that displaced FITC–Bid BH3 peptide from GST–Bfl-1 protein, resulting in 44 primary positive results, with an average Z′ factor of ~0.75 ± 0.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057111429372"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). “Hits” were defined as compounds that induced a ≥50% decrease in fluorescence polarization without increasing fluorescence intensity by ≥25% (thus eliminating compounds that interfered with the assay due to their autofluorescence). After correcting for fluorescence interferences, the primary screen then yielded 20 hits. These hits were cherry picked from assay plates and retested, resulting in 14 confirmed hits, representing a hit rate of 0.021%.</p>
<p>A TR-FRET secondary assay used the same molecular interaction between the FITC–Bid BH3 peptide and the GST–Bfl-1 protein, except terbium-conjugated anti-GST served as the fluorescent donor for exciting the FITC BH3 peptide. Of 20 compounds active in the primary FPA-based screen, 14 demonstrated inhibitory activity in the TR-FRET assay. These were the same 14 compounds that showed reproducible activity in the FPA (above).</p>
<p>Compound dose–response curves were generated using both fluorescence polarization (FP) and TR-FRET assays for the 14 validated hits. Compounds that did not display a sigmoidal dose–response curve or that increased fluorescence intensity (some compounds increased fluorescence intensity at concentrations higher than the screening concentration) were eliminated. Finally, seven compounds appeared to be promising based on dose–response results from both the FP and TR-FRET assays (IC<sub>50</sub> values summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087057111429372"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

<title>Characterization of Compound Selectivity for Bfl-1</title>
<p>The seven validated hits from the screening could be divided into three groups based on structural features of the compounds: #1 (MLS-0053105 = CID-1180676) is a chloromaleimide, #2 to #5 (#2, MLS-0047123 = CID-2980973; #3, MLS-0009480 = CID-1151859; #4, MLS-0051609 = CID-3244140; #5, MLS-0051509 = CID-3237441) comprise a sulfonylpyrimidine series; and #6 and #7 MLS-0019296 (CID-5389865) and MLS-0025736 (CID-8423532) are quinolinyl-oxadiazoles. The reactivity of these compounds with other targets previously screened and deposited into the PubChem database at the time of our discovery revealed that the chloromaleimide showed reactivity in only 1 of 30 assays tested, the sulfonylpyrimidines in 3 of 60 assays, and the quinolinyl-oxadiazoles in none of 29 assays tested. Thus, these three chemical series do not show promiscuous activity with other classes of targets.</p>
<p>To test compound selectivity against all six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein members, we established FPAs that monitor the binding of various fluorochrome-conjugated BH3 peptides to the recombinant GST fusion proteins. BH3 peptides were selected based on our prior comparison of binding affinities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087057111429372">27</xref></sup> resulting in pairings for the binding assays as follows: Bfl-1/FITC–Bid BH3 peptide, Bcl-W/FITC–Bim BH3 peptide, Bcl-2/FITC–Bim BH3 peptide, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>/FITC–Bim BH3 peptide, and Mcl-1/FITC–Bak BH3 peptide. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087057111429372"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> summarizes the IC<sub>50</sub> values of seven validated compounds for each of the six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members.

The sulfonylpyrimidine compounds showed superb selectivity against Bfl-1, with no inhibition of other Bcl-2 family members at concentrations as high as 100 µM.

Specifically, 1,3-diketones were reacted with S-substituted carbamimidothioates to afford the corresponding S-alkylpyrimidines. Oxidation of these products at 25 °C with mCPBA furnishes the desired sulfonylpyrimidine analogs. We synthesized and tested a series of compounds, and in vitro data were generated to provide SAR data on the hit series. Initial studies focused on analogs in which the phenyl ring and/or the sulfone substituent were modified, and some of these compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087057111429372"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. For example, a 3-methoxy substituent is tolerated (MLS-0066988 = CID-751044), whereas a 3,4-dimethoxy derivative (MLS-0051609 = CID-3244140) is less potent than the parent molecule. It also appears that replacement of the phenyl ring with a heteroaryl moiety such as furan (MLS-0050257 = CID-3237865) or thiophene (MLS-0041503 = CID-655335 and MLS-0051774 = CID-3245258) is viable. Truncating the sulfonyl side chain to a methylsulfone moiety as in MLS-0066988 (CID-751044), MLS-0050257 (CID-3237865), MLS-0051609 (CID-3244140), and MLS-0051774 (CID-3245258) appears to lead to a modest reduction in potency compared with the lead compound. Homologation of the carbethoxymethylene side chain to the carbethoxyethylene variant (MLS-0046458 = CID-2219262) leads to a slight reduction in potency. More pronounced increases in side chain length, as in compounds MLS-0041503 (CID-655335), MLS-0039077 (CID-2037235), MLS-0050749 (CID-3238559), and MLS-0008909 (CID-654688) leads to further reduction in potency.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bcl-2 family proteins have been implicated in several diseases. Bfl-1 (known as A1 in the mouse) is an NF-κB-inducible anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, which has been implicated in cancer and allergic diseases. With respect to cancer, defective apoptosis is a hallmark of many human tumors and is frequently responsible for resistance to therapy. Transcriptome profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) identified Bfl-1 as a gene signature associated with chemoresistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057111429372">15</xref></sup> Short-hairpin RNAs targeting Bfl-1 mRNAs induce apoptosis of certain lymphoblastoid B-cell lines and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057111429372">15</xref></sup> Thus, selective inhibitors of Bfl-1 could find applications for certain lymphomas or lymphoid leukemias, most likely those where constitutively high NF-κB activity or overexpression of Bfl-1 is observed.</p>
<p>Novel small molecules that target Bcl-2 family proteins are now in clinical trials. ABT737 and its orally available derivative ABT263 are the best characterized and show selective and potent activity against Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-W, but not Bcl-B, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111429372">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057111429372">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057111429372">29</xref></sup> Although impressive single-agent responses to ABT737 or ABT263 have been reported in early clinical trials for some types of malignancy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057111429372">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057111429372">29</xref></sup> many tumor cell lines in vitro and most types of solid tumors in patients show resistance to these compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057111429372">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057111429372">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111429372">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057111429372">29</xref></sup> The failure of tumor and leukemia cell lines to undergo apoptosis in response to ABT737 or ABT263 in culture has been convincingly attributed, in several cases, to concomitant expression of other members of the Bcl-2 family not targeted by these compounds, including Bfl-1 in some instances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057111429372">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111429372">21</xref></sup> In this scenario, Bfl-1-selective compounds could serve as a complement to selective chemical inhibitors of Bcl-2/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> such as ABT737/ABT263 for cancer treatment.</p>
<p>With respect to allergic diseases, expression of Bfl-1 is observed in mast cells in vivo and induced in cultured mast cells upon ligation of IgE bound to cell surface Fc receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057111429372">10</xref></sup> Various gene silencing experiments have suggested that Bfl-1 is required for survival of mast cells following IgE cross-linking, preventing “activation-induced cell death.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057111429372">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057111429372">30</xref></sup> Thus, compounds targeting Bfl-1 may find utility for certain allergic diseases.</p>
<p>Bfl-1 is highly expressed in lymphoid tissues in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111429372">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087057111429372">31</xref></sup> The endogenous functions of Bfl-1 are largely unknown, due to difficulties with accomplishing targeted gene ablation in mouse models. Unlike the other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that have all been successfully ablated in mice, the mouse ortholog of Bfl-1 consists of a cluster of four replicated genes (i.e., four copies of the gene, termed A1a, A1b, A1c, and A1d). Thus, to the extent that the Bfl-1 inhibitory compounds described here cross-react with murine A1 orthologs, they may provide a useful tool for investigating the function of A1 proteins in mouse models.</p>
<p>The most potent of the Bfl-1 inhibitory compounds described here are only marginally active against the target protein in vitro, with approximately micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. Inhibiting (or mimicking as is the case here) protein–protein interactions is a challenge for small molecules, especially in the case of Bcl-2 family proteins where the ligand binding site is large, accommodating BH3 peptides of ~16 amino acids in length. However, the ability to identify small compounds (molecular weight [MW] &lt;500) that show micromolar activity bodes well for employing some of these compounds as a starting point for further optimization. Given the size of the BH3 peptide binding site, it is unlikely that extensive analoging on the sulfonylpyrimidine or chloromaleimide scaffolds will drive potency into the nanomolar level. Rather, by analogy to ABT-737 and ABT-263 (which have MW of ≈813–975 Daltons and yet possess excellent pharmacological properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057111429372">28</xref></sup>), use of technologies such as “chemical fragment” screening by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), x-ray crystallography, or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) will likely be required to identify complementary chemical moieties that could be covalently linked onto the sulfonylpyrimidine or chloromaleimide scaffolds to increase the surface area of the BH3 peptide-binding pocket filled by the compounds.</p>
<p>In this report, we demonstrated that Bfl-1-binding compounds show activity in a mitochondrial assay that measures Bfl-1-mediated protection of these organelles. The advantage of this bioassay over a cell-based assay is that it avoids many of the variables that affect compound performance irrespective of target binding, such as cell membrane permeability, serum stability, and plasma protein binding. Interestingly, the sulfonylpyrimidine and chloromaleimide compounds showed different activity profiles in this assay, where sulfonylpyrimidine CID-1151859 induced release of SMAC from isolated mitochondria, whereas chloromaleimide compound CID-1180676 did not. Given that the exemplary chloromaleimide compound tested here was more potent against Bfl-1 by about 6- to 11-fold (depending on the assay method), the ability of the sulfonylpyrimidine to stimulate release of proteins from mitochondria cannot be explained by its Bfl-1 inhibitory activity. Thus, the sulfonylpyrimidine compound possesses a bioactivity separate from Bfl-1, although this bioactivity can be neutralized upon addition of Bfl-1 protein (but not Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> protein) to the mitochondria assay. Because the chloromaleimide did not induce SMAC release from mitochondria, we used recombinant active Bid (a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein) to stimulate protein release from mitochondria in vitro, demonstrating that recombinant Bfl-1 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> block the impact of Bid, with chloromaleimide CID-1180676 (also known as MLS-0053105 and ML041) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mli.nih.gov/mli/mlp-probes/?dl_id=1289">http://mli.nih.gov/mli/mlp-probes/?dl_id=1289</ext-link>) neutralizing Bfl-1 but not Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. Thus, we favor the chloromaleimide series as a starting point for future optimization campaigns.</p>
