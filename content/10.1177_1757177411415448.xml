<abstract>
<p>We discuss the pros, cons and potential risks of on-site decontamination methods used on neonatal units for articles indirectly associated with infant feeding, such as breast pump collection kits and neonatal dummies (pacifiers, comforters or soothers). Some practical recommendations are made and areas requiring further review are indicated. For neonatal units, decontamination methods involving use of chlorine-releasing disinfectants or domestic steam-producing equipment should be reassessed. They would not be considered acceptable on intensive care units for adult patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Very low birthweight and sick infants on neonatal units are particularly susceptible to infection and this may sometimes come from equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177411415448">Jones et al, 2001</xref>). Articles directly associated with infant feeding, such as bottles and teats on these units are usually discarded after one use (although some units may retain the option for decontaminating them on site in specific circumstances). However, use of disposable equipment can be limited by cost and practical considerations and certain articles that are indirectly (rather than directly) associated with infant feeding, may be decontaminated on site. These articles include breast milk collecting kits when undergoing repeated use by one mother, neonatal dummies (pacifiers, comforters or soothers) and bottle brushes.</p>
<p>Breast pump collection kits are used to help supply the nutritional, anti-infective and immunological factors in breast milk to infants who are unable to breast feed directly. Although hand expressing is encouraged to maintain the milk supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411415448">Boo et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757177411415448">Unicef UK Baby friendly initiative Step 5, n.d.</xref>) many mothers of infants on neonatal units will use an electrical breast pump with a suitable collection kit. Official guidelines recommend that these collection kits should be sterile before every use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177411415448">British Dietetic Association Paediatric Group, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177411415448">United Kingdom Association for Milk Banking, 2001</xref>). Between different mothers, use of sterile equipment is essential. However, problems arise when a kit is in repeated use by the same mother. For very high risk infants, some units may be able to comply with the recommendations for a sterile kit each time. The main drawback of this practice is that it is expensive as kits may be used eight or more times a day by each mother for as long as the infant is on the unit, which may be weeks or months. Also, if equipment is disposed of after being used, the large amount of plastic that is discarded raises environmental concerns. Even if kits are autoclaved instead of being disposed of after each use, the neonatal unit is likely to be charged for the autoclaving process with resulting financial implications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411415448">Table 1</xref>). In addition, delays and lost parts have been reported when equipment is sent to a central processing department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177411415448">Gould, 2005</xref>). Autoclaving also limits the useful life of these kits.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As a result of the above issues, breast milk collection kits that are in continuous use by the same mother are often decontaminated on site on the unit. We previously published a review of the literature and current practice for decontamination of breast pump collection equipment on neonatal units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>). In this review, we used Medline as well as the databases available at the Royal College of Nursing Library, including the British Nursing Index and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). This literature search has now been updated using the same criteria and databases and also a search on the database, Midwifery and Infant Care. Subject headings included the following: infection control, breast pumps, infants and decontamination. Our original review had concluded that a number of different decontamination methods were being used but that the most appropriate method for this procedure was uncertain and controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>). We found one main new article in the most recent search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177411415448">Doxtator and Zoutman, 2006</xref>) and similarly to our previous conclusions, the authors of this article found that there was ‘limited and conflicting information available surrounding the cleaning and reprocessing’ of breast pump collecting equipment.</p>
<p>There is limited literature on the above databases for decontamination of bottle brushes and infant dummies. However, it has been reported that infant dummies are easily contaminated with microbial flora, which offers ideal conditions for biofilm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411415448">Comina et al, 2006</xref>). A further article also emphasized the need for regular decontamination of this equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177411415448">Arbeitsgruppe GkinDe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present article is to consider the pros, cons and any potential risks of on-site decontamination methods used for the above equipment. We discuss whether the methods available are practical, reliable, appropriate and cost effective. The information considered is from the literature mentioned above and from the experience of the authors in this field. (However, the potential risk of toxicity when plastics containing bisphenol A are subjected to heat methods of decontamination, is not included in the discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177411415448">Quitmeyer and Roberts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757177411415448">US Department of Health and &amp; Human Services, n.d.</xref>).</p>

<title>Decontamination methods used in neonatal units for breast pump collection kits, dummies and bottle brushes</title>
<p>With regard to breast pump collection kits, a survey of 25 tertiary neonatal units found that chemical disinfection was the commonest option occurring in 14 (56%) units Autoclaving or steam-producing equipment was reported for four (16%) units, use of disposable equipment each time in two (8%) units and washing the equipment in one (4%) unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177411415448">Shetty et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For bottle brushes, any of the above methods may be in use on neonatal units. For decontaminating neonatal dummies, individual units may have their own protocols. Manufacturers’ recommendations for different makes and types of dummy can vary from use of steam-producing equipment, boiling for two minutes, use of chemical disinfectants or washing in hot water with a ‘mild’ detergent and rinsing.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of the main methods of decontamination are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411415448">Table 2</xref>, with particular reference to breast pump collection kits. Most of the methods are well known but the details of the steam-producing method and the simpler method of washing, rinsing and drying alone, may be less familiar. These on-site methods are briefly discussed below, together with some comments on the use of industrial-type dishwashers.</p>

<title>Steam-producing equipment</title>
<p>This equipment was originally intended for use in the home. Articles and equipment have moisture on them at the end of the cycle (see discussion section). Even so, issues such as speed of processing, convenience and low cost have meant that this equipment is in use in some neonatal units. Articles are placed in either of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A specifically designed free standing electrical steam-producing unit to which water has been added at the base. After the cycle is completed, the lid should not be opened until the equipment has been allowed to cool down, because of the risk of scalding from the steam/boiling water. It should be emptied and wiped dry after every use. Articles should be used within a time limit specified by the manufacturers, usually a few hours.</p>
<p>(2) A water-containing basket or bag, which is placed in a microwave. For hospital use, the bags or baskets have an advantage over the free standing steam producing units in that there is a possibility of single patient use and the procedure is quicker. However, this method is still based on the generation of steam and care needs to be taken to avoid scalding. The baskets are easier to clean and dry thoroughly after each use than the free standing steam-producing unit, which is a more complex piece of equipment. Bags are disposable after being used for a certain number of times but this needs compliance and monitoring. Neither bags nor baskets should be shared or passed on to another mother when no longer needed by the first mother.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177411415448">
<title>Wash, rinse and dry and store dry</title>
<p>This process is just thorough cleaning. It may be used for certain articles that need to be socially clean but do not require disinfection or sterility. It is a simple method which has been used successfully in some units for breast pump collection kits undergoing repeated use by one mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411415448">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411415448">D’Amico et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>). However, each stage should be carried out with care and all articles involved should be single patient use. It is an inexpensive method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411415448">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>A warm water detergent wash is followed by a thorough rinse in running water. The quantity of detergent used should be measured and should not exceed the required amount. Subsequent physical drying may be carried out either by using good quality paper towels or by allowing sufficient time for articles to dry in air. For both of these alternatives, staff need to emphasize the importance of complete drying. Cloths should not be used as they may remain wet (D’Amico et al, 2003). Equipment is then lightly covered and stored dry on a clean surface. (The paper towels previously mentioned could also be used to cover containers used for dry storage.) Any storage containers should have good access to air, so that any previously undetected moisture will evaporate. Containers should be single patient use, washed daily, rinsed and thoroughly dried. When no longer required by the one mother, they should be discarded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177411415448">
<title>Industrial-type dishwashers</title>
<p>Industrial-type dishwashers may be in use in some milk kitchens for neonatal units. Regular maintenance is necessary and the temperature reached should ensure that articles are dry at the end of the process. A method of identifying individual pieces of equipment from specific mothers is needed and equipment associated with infant feeding on neonatal units needs to be processed separately from other articles.</p>

<title>Breast pump collection kits</title>
<p>Although not generally classified as a medical device, these kits are more complicated pieces of equipment than bottles and teats. They consist of a number of parts which should be fully dismantled and decontaminated after every use.

<p>Between mothers, sterility of the kits is essential. Discarding the kits is usually preferred to autoclaving them, which is expensive and risks the return of incomplete sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177411415448">Gould, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177411415448">Shetty et al, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>During repeated use by one mother</title>
<p>In general, decontamination is carried out on site (although occasional units may autoclave kits between each use or discard them each time). Initially, each mother is given her own kit, which is for her use only. It must be decontaminated after each use and discarded when she no longer needs it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>). On-site decontamination is usually performed by the mother. The pros and cons of the methods that are available are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411415448">Table 2</xref>. Compared with discarding or autoclaving the kits after every use, the method of washing, rinsing, drying and storing kits dry is inexpensive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411415448">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The tubing connecting the kit with an electrical pump should be sterile and remain dry during use. It does not need to be decontaminated as it does not come in contact with the milk. However, if it is splashed or falls on the floor, the outside of the tubing should be damp wiped over and dried. Moisture should not enter the tubing but if this happens, it should be discarded.</p>

<title>Dummies for neonates (pacifiers, comforters or soothers)</title>
<p>Neonatal dummies are for individual infant use only and should be discarded when the infant no longer needs them. A significant number of dummies for premature infants and other neonates are hollow inside with central areas that can be difficult to access adequately. If a chemical disinfectant or steam-producing decontamination method is used, bacterial colonisation may be limited to some extent but varying amounts of moisture and liquids, bacteria, detergents, disinfectants and organic residues may be retained within the hollow area. These substances can come out through small holes around the base of the dummy and reach the surrounding areas. Further comments and recommendations for discarding these dummies are given in the Conclusion.</p>

<p>Each mother needs her own brush, which is marked to identify the user and discarded when no longer required.

They are then stored dry and separately from other equipment associated with infant feeding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Little work has been carried out to determine whether the time honoured approach of decontaminating certain articles on site is acceptable for a modern neonatal unit.</p>
<p>For breast pump collection equipment undergoing repeated use by one mother, it would be preferable for the on-site decontamination process to involve the use of heat (if equipment is not discarded after each use). However, the on-site methods available in hospital, which involve a heat process, have disadvantages and possible risks.</p>
<p>The domestic steam-producing method does not comply with the requirements of NHS Estates Health Technical Memorandum 2030 for washer-disinfectors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411415448">Table 2</xref>). Although this method is sometimes referred to as ‘steam sterilisation’ it does not sterilise. Articles and equipment are wet after the process and this is unacceptable for a hospital unit. If equipment is wet, bacterial growth may occur and one of our authors has grown <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> from water in the bottom of an electrical steam-producing unit, which had been left wet (E.Price, personal communication). Even though manufacturers put a time limit on use of articles decontaminated by this process, errors, omissions and unexpected delays are still possible. The free standing steam-producing unit also has the disadvantage that there is usually no possibility of single patient use for this equipment in hospital.</p>
<p>Dishwashers may be used in the home situation but articles to be decontaminated should be fully dismantled. If industrial-type dishwashers are used in hospital, as mentioned above, articles associated with infant feeding should be processed separately from other articles and an adequate temperature is required to ensure drying. Also, care may be advisable if salt has to be added to machines because of the susceptibility of the developing neonatal kidney. Use of detergents should be monitored, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The method involving use of chlorine-releasing disinfectants on site is often called cold water ‘sterilisation’, although it does not sterilise, and other issues and possible risks are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411415448">Table 2</xref>. This method has been recommended for decontamination of breast pump collection kits on the grounds of cost and microbiological effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177411415448">Shetty et al, 2006</xref>). Even so, its reliability, practicality and safety for neonatal units have been questioned. As colostrum is collected in very small quantities (as little as 1–214;mls on initiation of lactation), there is a possibility that any disinfectant solution left within a kit after assembly could dilute and affect the composition of the colostrum and possibly also have an effect on the neonatal gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411415448">Atkinson, 2001</xref>). A tissue culture study has demonstrated a toxic effect of a hypochlorite disinfectant, although the need for caution when extrapolating from in vitro models was also mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177411415448">Price et al, 2006</xref>). Infants on present day neonatal units are even more premature than their predecessors and likely to be more susceptible to insults involving the gut. The need for rinsing after use of these disinfectants has been controversial and it was originally claimed that the 1–214;mls of hypochlorite remaining on feeding equipment would be non-toxic and need not be rinsed off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177411415448">Miller and Yudkin, 1971</xref> cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177411415448">Lucas, 1977</xref>). However, this comment referred primarily to ‘larger infants’. For premature infants, a subsequent report noted that the amount of hypochlorite disinfectant remaining after soaking utensils could form a significant proportion of a small volume feed and could add to its sodium content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177411415448">Lucas, 1977</xref>). Also, replies to a questionnaire from 71 UK neonatal units revealed that 48 (68%) did not rinse off the disinfectant after use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177411415448">Price et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>If disinfectants (or detergents) are not thoroughly rinsed off articles associated with infant feeding, there may be a risk of an adverse effect on the development of the protective bacterial flora of the gut and exposed skin, especially if this contact occurs regularly and over a prolonged period. Normal bacterial colonisation of the infant gut, is important for development of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411415448">Björkstén, 1999</xref>) and such colonisation also promotes growth of gut organisms producing important vitamins, such as vitamins B and K (the latter being important for blood clotting).</p>
<p>Further to the above points, outbreaks of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> infection have been reported in some units using chlorine-releasing disinfectants for breast pump collecting kits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177411415448">Gransden et al, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177411415448">Jones et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177411415448">Moloney et al, 1987</xref>). In one report, the technique used by staff was found to have several faults, including incomplete dismantling of equipment, inadequate cleaning and incomplete immersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177411415448">Gransden et al, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Breast pump collection kits in repeated use by the same mother need to be clean and dry but it may be questioned whether sterility is essential. Although mothers of infants on neonatal units may be keen to provide their breast milk, they may welcome a simpler approach to decontaminating the equipment. Many mothers are under a number of pressures and English may not be their first language. Further consideration may be given to the more straightforward method of thoroughly washing, rinsing and drying articles. This method is inexpensive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411415448">Table 1</xref>) and reduces the requirement for compliance with a long series of instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411415448">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411415448">D’Amico, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>). Even so, careful teaching is required for all stages of this process but especially with regard to the importance of drying equipment completely and storing it dry. Also, use of too much detergent should be avoided. The amount of detergent used should be measured and it should be fully rinsed off afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177411415448">Price and Ayliffe, 2008</xref>). Although controversial, there is some animal study and other evidence for possible detergent toxicity involving the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411415448">Anon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177411415448">Charles, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411415448">Clark, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411415448">Fox et al, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177411415448">Mercurius-Taylor et al, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177411415448">Roe, 1984</xref>) and pre-term infants are particularly susceptible to such insults. Incomplete rinsing of detergents may have become more common in recent years (possibly influenced by television advertisements and other programmes showing food plates dripping with soapsuds after washing). Monitoring and observing staff and parents during all stages of the teaching process is necessary for this method and pictorial aids and DVDs are useful. There is also an advantage in that staff will be able to emphasize the importance of hand washing while they are observing and talking to the mothers.</p>
<p>Developmental care considerations recommend avoidance of unpleasant tastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177411415448">Lui et al, 2007</xref>). These may occur if rinsing is inadequate following use of either detergents or disinfectants (or salt, which is still sometimes mentioned in older publications for cleaning teats, although it is no longer acceptable practice).</p>
<p>For neonatal dummies, full and easy access to all areas is essential for adequate decontamination. However, the hollow design of many dummies can make safe and adequate on-site decontamination impossible. Substances retained inside the central area may ooze out through holes and contaminate the infant’s skin and mouth, with a possible risk of an adverse effect on the susceptible neonatal gut. (See comments in the Conclusion below).</p>
<p>If bottle brushes are used communally there is a risk of cross infection. They need to be kept for individual mother use with separate storage for each mother.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For breast pump collection kits and bottle brushes in repeated use by one mother, the straightforward method of carefully washing, thoroughly rinsing, drying and storing these articles in dry conditions may be more easily and efficiently carried out than the more complicated methods described above involving chemicals or production of steam. (In any case, the two latter methods should be preceded by a detergent wash and rinse). These chemical and steam methods have significant possibilities for error. It may not always be realised that certain adverse consequences (including infection or possible toxicity) may be related to the method of decontamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411415448">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177411415448">Lucas, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177411415448">NHS Estates/Department of Health, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177411415448">Price et al, 2006</xref>). Use of industrial – type dishwashers or washer-disinfectors should also be considered. With regard to detergents, the amount used should be limited to no more than is necessary for adequate cleaning and the detergent should be thoroughly rinsed off afterwards in running water.</p>
<p>If dummies for neonates are in use, easy access to all areas of these articles (especially the central areas) is necessary for safe and effective decontamination. All parts of the dummy should be thoroughly rinsed and dried at the end of the process. However, the design of many neonatal dummies can often mean that this is not possible and the dummy should then be discarded after each sucking episode.</p>
<p>More research is needed into the practicality, safety, reliability and cost effectiveness of all on-site decontamination methods at present in use on neonatal units. Observational studies and regular audit would provide further information as to how well the various stages of these on-site procedures are actually being carried out. Better education for staff and parents would also improve practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411415448">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411415448">Gilks et al, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Neither the steam production method intended for domestic use nor the chemical immersion method would be considered acceptable for use on an adult intensive care unit Their use on neonatal units should be reassessed.</p>
