<abstract>
<p>Despite decades of intervention to promote equal pay, the gender wage gap in Australia persists. A key explanation is that equal pay strategies have had limited capacity to address the subtle, historical undervaluation that keep wages low in highly feminized areas of employment, especially where care work is performed. In this article, we examine a recent attempt to address the undervaluation of care work through a test case of the expanded equal remuneration clause in the Fair Work Act 2009. A highly feminized area of employment, the social and community services industry proved a strategic context for the case. We discuss three significant aspects of the case: the recognition given to the undervaluation of care work; the divergent interests of non-government sector employers and business associations; and strong contestation over who should pay, arising from the government’s third-party role as purchaser of social and community services.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612442278" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In August <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442278">2011</xref>, Australian women’s full-time ordinary-time earnings were 82% of men’s, while women’s total earnings, which include earnings from part-time work and overtime, were 65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442278">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 2011</xref>). These figures have changed little since the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442278">ABS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612442278">Cassells et al., 2009</xref>). In 2010, the Australian Services Union (ASU) embarked upon the latest in a series of interventions to achieve equal pay in an application made on behalf of several unions representing employees in the social and community services (SACS) industry. This industry delivers care services, that is, face-to-face services that help recipients meet their daily physical, psychological, emotional and developmental needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442278">Standing, 2001</xref>), and which develop human capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612442278">England et al., 2002: 455</xref>). Further, the workforce is highly feminized: around three-quarters of SACS employees are female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442278">ABS, 2010</xref>) and this figure is higher (around 80%) when considering only those employees in occupations involving direct contact with clients, including social work, welfare work, child care, personal care and nursing assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612442278">Meagher and Cortis, 2010: 20</xref>). Central to the case put by unions and industry advocates was the contention that care work is undervalued, in large measure because it is ‘women’s work’.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine key elements of this Equal Remuneration Case, which was ultimately successful, resulting in significant increases in the rates of pay in the SACS modern award. We discuss the case in the context of previous pay equity principles, which have not been effective in addressing the undervaluation of highly feminized industries, including those where care is performed. First, we argue that recognition of the undervaluation of care work by unions, employers and the Full Bench of Australia’s industrial tribunal, Fair Work Australia (FWA), is a critical, and potentially far-reaching, development. Second, we outline opposition to the union claims by business associations and contrast this with the support given by most of the SACS industry employers. Third, we explore the complex role of the government in this case. Although most of the SACS employers subject to the claim are non-government organizations, the services they provide are largely funded by federal and state governments, whose commitment to increase funding to cover increased wages proved important in the unfolding of the case.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612442278"><title>The Evolution of Pay Equity Principles in Australia</title>
<p>Over the last few decades, attempts to achieve equal pay have had little impact on pay rates in highly feminized areas of Australia’s sex-segregated labour market. Strategies in the federal context have been particularly constrained. The formal achievement of ‘equal pay for equal work’ in 1969 was able to increase pay only for women working alongside men, and not for the majority of women in jobs segregated from, and not identical to, those of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612442278">Rafferty, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612442278">Short, 1986</xref>). The expansion of the federal principle to ‘equal pay for work of equal value’ in 1972 and the extension of the male minimum wage to women in 1974 were more effective in narrowing the wage gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185612442278">Gregory and Duncan, 1981</xref>). However, an attempt to expand the principle to recognize comparable worth in 1986 was unsuccessful, and progress through the federal system stalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612442278">Rafferty, 1994</xref>). In principle, the provision in the Industrial Relations (Reform) Act 1993 expanded to protect ‘equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value’, but, in practice, its effectiveness rested on applicants proving discrimination as a cause of the wage gap. This deterred possible claims where pay differences resulted from the more subtle, historical and cultural undervaluation of feminized work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442278">Smith, 2011a</xref>). The Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 maintained the need to prove discrimination, and required proof of equivalent work using detailed comparisons of female- and male-dominated jobs. Pay equity, and the federal system’s capacity to promote it, were further undermined by the decentralization of wage fixation since the early 1990s, culminating in ‘Work Choices’, with its radical removal of the ‘no disadvantage test’ and reductions in the power of the national industrial umpire. These changes had disproportionate effects on women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612442278">Peetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612442278">Smith, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout this period, state systems progressed equal pay through a series of inquiries and reviews, and a handful of subsequent cases (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442278">New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission (NSWIRC), 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612442278">Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (QIRC), 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612442278">Todd and Eveline, 2004</xref>). In the government-initiated inquiries in New South Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442278">NSWIRC, 1998</xref>) and Queensland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612442278">QIRC, 2007)</xref>, pay equity advocates built a significant evidence base detailing the influence of gender on wage-setting, and this helped compel industrial tribunals to develop equal remuneration principles to improve wages in occupations traditionally undervalued due to gender. In New South Wales, the inquiry process opened up scope for pay equity advocates to argue the value of feminized skills like care and nurturing, which had been previously overlooked in wage-setting, although these opportunities were not fully realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612442278">Cortis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The inquiries in both New South Wales and Queensland developed principles that obliged each Industrial Commission to assess the wide range of factors influencing work valuation; overturned requirements that work value be proven with reference to male-dominated comparators; and shifted emphasis from proving ‘direct’ discrimination to demonstrating ‘undervaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442278">Smith, 2011a</xref>). Some wage increases were subsequently won in strongly feminized occupations, including for childcare workers and public sector librarians in New South Wales, and for dental assistants and community service work in Queensland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442278">Smith, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612442278">Smith and Lyons, 2007</xref>). Nationalization under Work Choices, however, halted progress through these avenues.</p>
<p>An equal remuneration claim for SACS workers in Queensland in 2009 set an important precedent for the Federal Equal Remuneration Case. A highly feminized industry, wage regulation for this sector has lagged in all states. It was only in 1991 that the first Award was made for social and community services (in New South Wales), and a lack of subsequent arbitration has meant that regulation has remained minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612442278">Briggs et al., 2007: 504</xref>). Underpinning the success of the Queensland case was the fact that unions and employers produced an ‘Agreed Statement of Facts’ at the outset. This acknowledged mutual understanding that SACS work was undervalued care work, that government funding and industry features had contributed to this undervaluation, that changes in the value of the work had not been recognized in award rates, and that undervaluation was raising public interest concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612442278">Fisher, 2009: 3</xref>). The Queensland Industrial Relations Commission subsequently recognized gender-based undervaluation and increased community service workers’ pay by between 18% and 37%, phased in over three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612442278">Fisher, 2009</xref>). This provided an evidence base, pay rates and legal arguments that could be used as the basis for pursuing equal remuneration nationally.</p>
<p>Central to the Queensland case were arguments about the undervaluation of care. These arguments drew on international research demonstrating that women’s work in providing care or nurturance is undervalued, related to pervasive cultural expectations that care work be performed out of altruism or duty, not for money, and to the idea that workers in caring occupations willingly accept lower pay for the opportunity to perform satisfying or mission-driven work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612442278">Budig and Misra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612442278">England et al., 2002</xref>). The incorporation of a wide range of historical and cultural explanations for undervaluation in the Queensland decision was a historic breakthrough in industrial relations in Australia, overcoming the long-standing impediments to framing pay equity cases in female-dominated industries.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612442278"><title>The Equal Remuneration Test Case</title>
<p>Developments in Queensland, and the characteristics of the industry, made SACS a strategic context in which to progress equal pay federally. Although the Federal Equal Remuneration Case was not founded on an agreed statement of facts, on 30 October 2009, the federal government and the ASU had signed a ‘Heads of Agreement’ under which the government promised to support the ASU’s pursuit of a test case. The timing was good: prospects in the federal system had been renewed following a parliamentary inquiry into pay equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612442278">House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations (HRSCEWR), 2009</xref>); state industrial powers (except for Western Australia) had been referred to the Commonwealth; a SACS Modern Award was in development; and a new equal remuneration provision had been included in the Fair Work Act 2009. This Act gave Fair Work Australia the discretionary power to ensure ‘equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal or comparable value’ (Part 2-7), expanding opportunities to address the undervaluation of feminized work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612442278">Baird and Williamson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In its statement of claim that opened the case, the ASU submitted that work performed by employees in the SACS industry had been undervalued for reasons related to gender. They mounted many of the arguments used in Queensland and proposed incorporating the rates established through the Queensland case nationally, along with more generous ‘sleepover’ rates and higher commencement rates for some qualified employees (in line with conditions in Queensland and New South Wales, respectively). After a lengthy process involving more than 100 submissions, 20 site visits and evidence from numerous workers, managers, union officials and academic experts, in May 2011 Fair Work Australia’s Full Bench set down its interim decision. The Bench accepted the unions’ contention that, given the nature of the work, the skills and responsibilities involved, and pay rates for comparable work in state and local government, SACS workers do not receive equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442278">FWA, 2011</xref>). Significantly, the Bench recognized that gender was an important influence, although it did not explain the whole pay gap and extended the submission process to help identify the portion of the pay gap attributable to gender, and to develop appropriate remedies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442278">FWA, 2011</xref>: 282). The case was adjourned again in October to facilitate conciliation between unions, the federal government and other interested parties. This conciliation resulted in a joint submission by the ASU and Australian government that set out shared views as to the extent of undervaluation, proposed adopting pay rates awarded in the 2009 Queensland Equal Remuneration decision, and committed federal government funding to cover increased costs for the services it funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612442278">ASU and Australian Government, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In February 2012, the final decision was handed down. In a four-to-one majority decision, Fair Work Australia accepted the pay rates proposed by the unions and the federal government and awarded increases of between 19% and 41%, as well as a 4% loading in recognition of barriers to bargaining, both to be introduced over eight years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612442278">FWA, 2012</xref>). Three themes stand out in the proceedings of the case and the interim and final decisions. First is the extension, to the national system, of the breakthrough made in the Queensland case: the recognition that undervaluation of care work was related to gender and a cause of pay inequity. Following the logic of the Queensland case, the argument that SACS work is care work was core to the applicants’ arguments for undervaluation, and the Full Bench accepted this argument in its interim decision. Moreover, the Bench asserted that, while not all gender-based undervaluation is due to care, any undervaluation of SACS work that is due to care should be understood as gender-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442278">FWA, 2011</xref>: 253).</p>
<p>The proposition that SACS care work was undervalued was broadly, but not unequivocally, supported by other parties to the case. Most SACS employers and their peaks supported union claims, arguing that the ‘soft’ skills much SACS work involves have been overlooked, and that much of the work has been traditionally performed without pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612442278">Jobs Australia (JA), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612442278">National Disability Services (NDS), 2011</xref>). These employers agreed with the unions that poor recognition of the value of SACS work, not least through inequitable rates of pay, contributed to a range of workforce problems in the sector, including difficulty in attracting and retaining staff, and low morale. One exception was the large national employer, Mission Australia, whose representatives contended that the characterization of SACS work as care work was irrelevant to the many non-service delivery employees in the industry who were also subject to SACS Awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612442278">Mission Australia, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Initially, the Australian government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612442278">Australian Government, 2010</xref>) did not submit that SACS work was undervalued on the basis of care; but post-conciliation, its joint submission with the ASU treated direct care in SACS work as a proxy for gender-based undervaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612442278">ASU and Australian Government, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185612442278">Briar and Junor, 2011</xref>). This is a significant and historic development, given the long-standing institutional hurdles inhibiting recognition of care, and the likely costs to government in remedying this gender-based undervaluation.</p>
<p>Second, although the vast majority of SACS employers supported the claim, business lobby groups opposed it throughout. These groups, which represent large employers in the retail, accommodation, construction and manufacturing industries (and not generally in the human services), argued that SACS wage increases would generate wage claims in other female-dominated industries, and would distort the relativities designed into the Modern Award safety net (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612442278">Australian Federation of Employers and Industries (AFEI), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612442278">Australian Industry (Ai) Group, 2011</xref>). Australia’s largest business association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), argued that the SACS Modern Award contained wage rates set on a gender-neutral basis, and that there were flaws in the methodology comparing non-government organization and public sector workers, as these served as ‘a blank cheque for applicants to make claims that are simply about increasing rates of pay on account of what other employees are paid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612442278">ACCI, 2011</xref>: 11). Business associations also expressed concerns about the likely impact of the case and of potential wage increases on SACS businesses, including job losses, worsening staff-to-client ratios, compromised services in regional areas and the scaling back of programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612442278">Australian Business Industrial (ABI), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612442278">Ai Group, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the complex role of the government was a significant theme in the case. The argument that the government should cover the increased costs arising from higher Award rates was a rare point of agreement among the business associations, SACS employers and unions. Along with the unions, business associations and employers argued that the government should provide additional funding to minimize the adverse effects of the claim on employers. SACS employer Mission Australia, which supported many of the perspectives expressed by the employer associations, argued that even if governments fully funded the wage increase, the decision would lead to reductions of those services that do not receive government funding, or are only partially government-funded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612442278">Mission Australia, 2011</xref>). These views are not surprising, since governments provide almost three-quarters (73%) of all funding to welfare services, broadly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612442278">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), 2011: 348</xref>). The interim decision clarified the tribunal’s position on the implications of heavy reliance on public funding in the sector: wage increases not met by increased government funding would cause serious difficulties for employers, and the cost implications would be important to the Bench’s final decision.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, governments expressed equally strong concerns about the adverse budgetary impact of any wage increase, despite giving their in-principle support for equal pay throughout the case. This apparent conflict of interest is not surprising either, as one submission from several women’s organizations argued that governments have historically <italic>benefited</italic> from undervaluation, in the context of service contracting; as purchasers, they have never known, nor had to pay, the true costs of social service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612442278">Women’s Organizations, 2011</xref>). Requirements to compete for scarce programme funding have also held down staffing costs, and short-term project-based funding has placed workers in a weak bargaining position to argue for higher pay.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, from the outset, the federal government had committed to participating in the proceedings, as documented in the ‘Heads of Agreement’ with the ASU. But this document flagged federal government concerns that the resulting pay rises would have significant financial implications and that any increase to rates should be gradually phased in to account for the capacity of governments to meet increased costs. A source of anxiety for SACS workers throughout the case was that the federal government reserved any commitment to provide extra resources to funded service providers, reminiscent of their refusal to cover the wage increases resulting from increased SACS Award rates awarded by the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in 2001. The federal government did, however, commit to fund any increase soon after Fair Work Australia had handed down its interim finding, and then in November announced a AUD$2 billion outlay to cover wage rises provided that they did not begin until 2012–2013 and were phased in over six years. At the time of writing, however, state governments had not finalized their funding commitments. Fair Work Australia’s final decision noted the opposition of the New South Wales and Victorian governments, largely on the basis of cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612442278">FWA, 2012</xref>). To alleviate financial pressures and reduce the risk that services would be reduced in response to any increased costs, the final decision extended the implementation period from the six years proposed in the Joint Submission to eight years.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612442278" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Fair Work Act 2009 removed critical institutional hurdles to recognizing the undervaluation of feminized work and, although the test case of the new equal pay provision faced opposition from employer associations and uncertainty about governments’ capacity to pay, the tribunal found SACS work to be undervalued on the basis of gender, and awarded the wage rises set out in the union and federal government’s joint submission. Important to the logic of the decision was the characterization of SACS work as ‘care’. This is significant as care has rarely been recognized by industrial tribunals and has now been acknowledged as a factor contributing to the undervaluation of female-dominated work. While employers within the SACS industry perceived benefits of increased wages, those associations representing employers outside the industry may well have been concerned about flow-on effects with good reason. Workers in other female-dominated social service fields, including childcare and aged care, remain on low rates of pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612442278">Productivity Commission, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612442278">2011b</xref>). The wage outcomes announced in February 2012 have consolidated the historic interim decision’s recognition of the undervaluation of care. It remains to be seen how unions, employers, governments and Fair Work Australia will build on this to more fully achieve gender pay equity in the coming years.</p></sec>
