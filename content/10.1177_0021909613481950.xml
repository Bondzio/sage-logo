<p>After Olusegun Obasanjo’s attention-seeking autohagiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909613481950">1980</xref>) on his role in the 30-month-long and brutal war by Nigeria to annihilate the Republic of Biafra was published in 1980 by Heinemann, some of the actors on the Biafra side – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909613481950">Alexander Madiebo (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909613481950">Joe OG Achuzia (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909613481950">Hillary M Njoku (1987)</xref>, and others – who played major combat roles also took the cue to pen and publish their own accounts of the war. However, the stories that emerged from their books failed woefully to reveal the gruesome facts and events that constitute the intricate aspects of that war as they relate to the Igbo, at whom its brutality and the atrocities that led to it were directed by Nigeria. Rather than look at the Nigeria-Biafra war as an isolated event, as Obasanjo’s annoying narrative particularly portrays, the complete story of the war would emerge only when written by individuals who rely on painstaking research to produce chronological accounts that incorporate all the events that triggered the war and the conduct of the Nigerian side and its actors in their prosecution of the war proper. To do that will reveal some troubling facts about the war and the events that led to it and its prosecution proper.</p>
<p>One of those realities about the war – which is clearly Africa’s first total war – include the indisputable fact that the intention of its prosecutors, which included Nigeria and its international supporters and collaborators, the most notable being Great Britain, was to use it to achieve the final solution of their age-old perceived ‘Igbo problem’ (p. 5) in the Nigeria project. This immediate assertion quickly begets another: that the war and the string of atrocities that preceded it represent acts of genocide – ‘any act committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group’ (p. 7) – against the Igbo (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909613481950">United Nations, 1948</xref>). As Paul R Bartro, a Holocaust scholar himself, explains in his contribution to the volume under review:<disp-quote>
<p>those who argued that the Nigerian authorities were not intent on destroying the Igbo as a race in that war on the premise that no wholesale slaughter of Igbo occurred in the aftermath of the war must come up with a characterization for the massive death toll among the civilian population if no genocidal intent existed on the part of federal Nigeria. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The corollary to the couple of assertions made above is the one that argues that the end of the war did not translate to the end of the persecution of the Igbo in Nigeria given that Igbo survival in the war rankled their ardent haters in Nigeria to a degree that inspired official state policies that constrained and continues to constrain Igbo self-rehabilitation in almost every realm of life in the Nigeria project. The three that quickly come to mind are the abandoned property decree that robbed the Igbo of their legitimately acquired landed property in other parts of Nigeria, the bank deposit forfeiture policy and the indigenization decree.</p>
<p>Two recent books – Chinua Achebe’s <italic>There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra</italic> (Penguin, 2012) and the first book under review here, <italic>The Nigeria-Biafra War: Genocide and the Politics of Memory</italic> (edited by Chima J Korieh, a history professor at Marquette University in the United States of America [USA]) fit the bill for the sort of books that showcase complete narratives on the Nigeria-Biafra war. So does another: the second book also under review here, <italic>Remembering Biafra: Narrative, History, and Memory of the Nigeria-Biafra War</italic> (2010), which Korieh edited with Ifeanyi Ezonu. For someone like me who received and read an advance copy of Achebe’s book, the revelations contained in the two edited collections about the orchestrated persecution of the Igbo, especially in the months that preceded the war and during the course of the war proper, are as troubling as those contained in Achebe’s, which will receive separate attention from this reviewer in the near future – hence the need and relevance for review.</p>
<p>The said series of revelations in the two books point at another troubling fact: every act of brutality directed at the Igbo was officially formulated, sanctioned, and disseminated to boot by Nigeria and its rulers. The question then becomes: where then is the sincerity of the much trumpeted ‘No victor, no vanquished’ proclamation by Nigeria and its rulers at the end of the Nigeria-Biafra war? Christian Chikwendu Ukaegbu proffers a response to this query in his contribution to the first volume: ‘the under lying goals of Nigeria to emasculate and keep the Igbo emasculated’, he points out, ‘remain unchanged and are still being pursued meticulously …’ (p. 28).</p>
<p>In his introduction to the first book, entitled ‘History and the Politics of Memory’, Korieh disclosed that: ‘From July 6, 1967, Nigeria radio based in Lagos continuously broadcast a war song in Hausa, the words of which translate to “Let us go and crush them. We will pillage their property, ravish their womenfolk, murder their men folk and complete the pogrom of 1966”’ (p. 10). This war song was carried over from ‘speeches by northern leaders that called for ethnic cleansing of the Igbo people, eliminating them from the North’ (p. 10) in the months of May, July, September, and October 1966. This is indeed the reality that exposes the so-called reconciliation, reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Igbo proclaimed by Nigeria at the end of the shooting war as an insidious deceit. They cannot mark a people up for annihilation and at the same time proclaim the intention to reconcile and rehabilitate them.</p>
<p>The extent to which the individual actors on the Nigerian side who played prominent roles in prosecuting the war imbibed the official determination to use the war to finish the task that was put underway prior to its start, to annihilate the Igbo, is also revealed in Korieh’s introduction. A couple of examples of that will suffice here. There is Benjamin Adekunle’s pronouncement in August 1968 when he was a major, saying that he was determined to prevent every Igbo from getting access to food for as long as they refused to capitulate. Photographic archives all over the Pan-European world still bristle with the haunting photographs of kwashiorkor afflicted children, men and women who were starved to death in numbers through the blockade that Adekunle boasted about. Another is from the ‘scrapbook’ recovered from a Nigerian soldier Ganiyu Sodeinde at Bori in Port Harcourt that instructively details what his battalion commander, a Lt. Col. Onifade, drilled into the psyche of troops in his unit, centring on the absolute necessity and need for them to strive to annihilate every Igbo to forestall the likelihood of a post-defeat rising, as was the case with Germany, which became a technology giant after it was defeated, rather than being annihilated in World War II (p. 10).</p>
<p>Korieh’s research disclosed hard documentary evidence showing the names of notable Hausa-Fulani personalities and even British expatriates who played prominent roles in the May–June 1966 pogrom of the Igbo in the north of Nigeria. In the city of Katsina, we are told that the mob first gathered in the palace of the Emir, from which it fanned out into the city to attack innocent Igbo residents. As the massacre was underway, the Emir, ‘Usman Nagogo; the former Northern Minister (of Education) Isa Kaita; Musa Tafida Yar’Adua, former federal Minister of Lagos Affairs; and Magajin Gari; [the] Emir’s son, were parading the town up and down cheering them up’ (pp. 12–13).</p>
<p>In the city of Kaduna, ‘top Hausa civil servants’, British expatriates and students at the Ahamadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, were individually and collectively implicated in the brutal massacre as ‘instigators and collaborators’ (p. 12). They included ‘S. S. Richardson, deputy vice chancellor and director of the Institute of Administration; Professor F. W. Sansome, head of the Department of Botany; and Dr. Eva Sansome, wife of Professor Sansome and reader in the Department of Botany’. Also named are ‘Major A. D. F. Boyle, eastern manager in charge of university transport, security guards and labor force who arranged for a university van (no. Z5144) to transport thugs; and R. B. Walker, superintendent of zoology laboratory’. Hear this also: ‘Reports indicate that Richardson and Lawrence began to hold clandestine and exclusive meetings at night with northern Nigerian students, including Paul Anyebe, Murtala Aminu, Muhammed Arziki, Yameni Othman, A. B. Homkwap, and Mallam Maishanu, after January 15, 1966 … Coincidentally, these incidents characterized by British complicity occurred after the visit of the British high commissioner Sir Francis Cummings-Bruce to ABU in May 1966’ (p. 12). Several scholars including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909613481950">Dan Jacobs (1987)</xref> have previously established the role of the British in solving the Igbo problem definition.</p>
<p>During the course of the war, there were specific acts of atrocity that deliberately targeted and massacred non-combatant Igbo males of all ages, women and children in Asaba, Benin, and Sapele on the orders and direction of known commanders of the Nigerian army (p. 14). One is not sure that many Igbo are aware that Murtala Ramat Muhammed, who later assumed the reins of power through a coup d’état as a military dictator in Nigeria, was implicated in the Benin and Asaba massacres. The same is true of his role as ring leader of the purge/massacre of Igbo officers and rank and file soldiers in the army from 28–30 July 1966. Those blood-curdling atrocities that are not covered by any statute of limitation under international law are still yearning for full and comprehensive investigative attention.</p>
<p>Between them, the 22 scholars who contributed to these two volumes have rightly raised and even addressed some of the pertinent issues of serious concern about the events that preceded Nigeria’s war against Biafra in the period from 1967–1970, and of course the conduct of the war itself and their implications for the Igbo. One such issue raised by Korieh in the first book is ‘the systematic attempt to forget the war … even though its aftermath still shapes a large part of the state of Igbo existence in the Nigeria project’ (p. 22). The dangers inherent in such systematic attempts to forget are myriad and extensive, boiling down to the utter detriment of the Igbo and their destiny as a people. When you recall that the popular Igbo highlife band, the Oriental Brothers International, did once eulogize Murtala Muhammed as a hero after he was bumped off in the Dimka-led coup d’état in 1976, you’d better appreciate the concern raised here over the dangers of the Igbo not rising to the challenge of recovering and preserving the memories of the acts of genocide that were directed at them with the war and the events that led to it.</p>
<p>As Ifeanyi Ezeonu, an analyst and co-editor of the second book who is quoted in the introduction of the first by Korieh, argues, ‘The Jewish consciousness of the decimation of their race under the Nazis has galvanized a massive international hunt for and punishment of former Nazi leaders. But more importantly, it has led to the emergence of the “Never Again” consciousness of the global Jewish politics’ (p. 22). Any wonder then why contributors to the two volumes are all in agreement that ‘unlike the Jews and Armenians – who have suffered genocide – the Igbo have not carried out systematic study or documentation, nor have they used their experiences in the war as a resource to drive their participation in contemporary Nigerian politics’ (p. 22)?</p>
<p>The efforts made in both volumes, which I think should be read together, are worthy and invaluable. They fit quite well and qualify as ‘race-making’ – a sociological endeavour often embarked on by peoples that encountered conditions in society similar to the ones with which the Igbo have been confronted in the Nigeria project; in order to self-preserve, peoples resort to conscious efforts aimed at turning their predicament around to achieve self-worth and improve their collective lot for good.</p>
<p>Without knocking their invaluable contribution in this regard, one must also point out at the same time that, in both cases, contributors to the two books made the inadvertent error of mischaracterizing the Nigeria-Biafra war variously as a civil war. Where is the civil in a war, which was decidedly the extension of a final solution? Furthermore, a war can only be rightly characterized as civil if the parties belonged to a state that emerged through a freely entered covenant. That was far from the situation that gave rise to the Nigeria project. The mere incidence of the parties that waged a war sharing a territorial space that was demarcated by colonial fiat, as was the case about the Igbo in the Nigeria project, does not necessarily translate to the validity of characterizing a war that was levied on a party in the involuntary arrangement as a civil war.</p>
