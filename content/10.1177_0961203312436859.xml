<abstract>
<p>Haematological involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – which ranges from the well-described haemolytic anaemia to macrophage activation syndrome – has a large impact on both morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, association between haematological malignities and SLE – in terms of pathophysiology and molecular genetics – is an obscure entity which has not been clarified evidently to date. Herein, we present a six-year-old female with the diagnosis of SLE who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia following a period of myelodysplasia. It could possibly be coincidental; however, persistent cytopenia, prominent dysplasia on bone marrow smears and azathioprine treatment may be considered as possible triggers for the development of leukaemia in the present case.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312436859" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system, chronic autoimmune disorder. The clinical picture varies according to the involved organ systems. Haematological involvement, which ranges from haemolytic anaemia to macrophage activation syndrome, is an essential element of SLE affecting both treatment and prognosis. In previous studies, haematological findings have been reported to range between 34% and 79%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312436859">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436859">2</xref></sup> But the association between SLE and haematological malignities is extremely rare, particularly during childhood.</p>
<p>In order to underline this association, we present a six-year-old female with persistent peripheral cytopenia and myelodysplasia on repeated bone marrow evaluations who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 10 months after the initial diagnosis of SLE.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312436859" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A six-year-old female – from a non-consanguineous marriage – was referred to our hospital with the preliminary diagnosis of SLE. She presented with nausea, vomiting and hyperbilirubinaemia to a local hospital seven months ago. Laboratory evaluation showed leukopenia and elevated levels of liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [ALT]: 882 IU/L and aspartate transaminase [AST]: 412 IU/L) at that time. She had been thought to have a viral hepatitis. While on follow-up – after icterus subsided – two months later, she began to suffer from intractable afebrile seizures. With the diagnosis of encephalitis, acyclovir (1500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day, for 21 days) and anticonvulsive (phenytoin) treatment were given. As leukopenia persisted, some additional laboratory tests were performed. Because serum complement levels were low and Coombs’ test was positive, she had been referred to our hospital.</p>
<p>Her physical development was normal with a weight of 18 kg (between 25th and 50th percentiles appropriate for age) and height of 105 cm (between 25th and 50th percentiles appropriate for age). No petechia, ecchymoses, icterus or oedema was noticed. Cardiovascular system examination including blood pressure was normal. The liver was 2 cm palpable below the right costal margin. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.</p>
<p>The initial laboratory evaluation at our hospital revealed the following: haemoglobin: 8.9 g/dl, leukocyte: 1.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet: 113 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and reticulocyte: 0.2%. Peripheral blood smear showed normal erythrocyte morphology with rare spherocytes and dysplastic leukocytes – Pelger–Huet anomaly – with a differential count of 36% polymorphonuclear cells, 12% monocytes, 2% eosinophils and 50% lymphocytes without blast. Microscopic Coombs’ test was positive. ALT and AST levels were 393 IU/L and 827 IU/L, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 1886 IU/L (normal; below 680 IU/L). Renal function tests and serum bilirubin levels were normal. Extensive viral serology was negative. Urine analysis yielded proteinuria. Serum C3 and C4 levels were 67.5 mg/dl (79–152 mg/dl) and 23.1 mg/dl (16–38 mg/dl), respectively. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) were positive whereas antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Renal biopsy demonstrated wire-loop appearance, increased thickness of basal membrane and focal segmental endocapillary proliferation. Immunoglobulin M, C3, lambda, kappa, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G and C4 positivity was shown by immune fluorescence. These findings pointed to class III lupus nephritis according to WHO classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436859">3</xref></sup> Liver biopsy also yielded macrovesicular steatosis and rosette formation together with plasma cell infiltration, suggesting autoimmune hepatitis. The diagnosis of SLE was confirmed by the help of histopathological evaluation.</p>
<p>The first bone marrow aspiration, before which no therapy, including steroids, was given, revealed prominent three lineage dysplasia – megaloblastic changes, micromegakaryocytes, Pelger–Huet anomaly, dyserythropoiesis with double-nucleated normoblasts – and increased histiocytes but no haemophagocytosis. Lymphocytosis (50%) was noticed by light microscopy. But no blast was identified by side and forward light scatter techniques and backgating with CD34 and CD45 markers on flow cytometry. No metaphase was obtained by conventional cytogenetic techniques. MLL rearrangement and Philadelphia chromosome were negative by polymerase chain reaction.</p>
<p>Low-dose steroid treatment following pulse methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day, for three days) and azathioprine (1.5 mg/kg per day, p.o.) were initiated for the treatment of SLE. One week later, serum complement levels and liver function tests became normal and leukocyte count increased to 4.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</p>
<p>In the fourth month after the diagnosis, while serum complement levels and sedimentation were normal but anti-dsDNA and ANA were positive, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia developed again. Azathioprine was ceased and pulse steroid treatment was repeated. Unfortunately, cytopenia persisted and bone marrow analysis was performed twice (in the sixth and eighth months). Despite prominent dysplasia in three lineage, blast percentage did not exceed 20%.</p>
<p>On the 10th month after diagnosis, due to persistent fever bone marrow aspiration was re-evaluated. Light microscopic analysis showed 66% lymphoblasts. Flow cytometric evaluation yielded biphenotypic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CD2: 29%, CD3: 26%, CD7: 22%, CD10: 49%, CD19: 74%, CD22: 56%, HLA-DR: 80%, CD33: 1%, CD34: 50%, CD117: 0%, MPO: 0% and tdt: 80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436859">Figure 1</xref>). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no blast. Modified St Jude TXV chemotherapy protocol was started immediately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436859">4</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0961203312436859" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The flow cytometric evaluation at the time of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 94 mm × 135 mm (300 × 300 DPI).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203312436859-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On the 15th day of the remission induction part of ALL treatment, she became febrile, peaking up to 40°C, and splenomegaly was noticed for the first time. Renal function tests deteriorated and proteinuria developed. Because she was neutropenic, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment including antifungal drugs was initiated. Persistent fever and re-development of proteinuria suggested SLE activation and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Serum fasting triglyceride and plasma fibrinogen levels were 1716 mg/dl ( &lt; 200 mg/dl) and 322 mg/dl (219–400 mg/dl). Serum ferritin level was 17.300 ng/ml (30–400 ng/ml). After fulfilling five criteria of the Histiocyte Society, intravenous gamma globulin (0.4 g/kg), dexamethasone and cyclosporine were given according to Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-2004 protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436859">5</xref></sup> Etoposide was also added to therapy. On the fifth day of HLH-2004 protocol, increased lacrimation and nasal stiffness were noticed. After rhino-endoscopic evaluation, we ordered computerized tomography of paranasal sinuses with the suspicion of fungal sinusitis. It revealed non-specific radio-opaque densities completely filling ethymoid cells and maxillary sinuses, suggesting mucormycosis. Thorax CT also showed nodular densities bilaterally and cavitary lesion on the basal region of the right lung. Variconazole and liposomal amphotericin B were added to caspofungin. The sinuses were debrided surgically but fungal invasion was shown to extend into basal calvarial bones.</p>
<p>Her clinical condition deteriorated progressively. She was entubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Despite the intensive antifungal treatment, surgical debridement and supportive therapy for disseminated intravascular coagulation, she died of multi-organ failure and pulmonary haemorrhage.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312436859" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Autoimmune disorders, particularly SLE, are known to be associated with increased risk of lymphoreticular system neoplasia, especially in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436859">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436859">7</xref></sup> Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are the most common malignancies reported in SLE. Cases of leukaemia and myeloma have also been described in adults, rarely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436859">8</xref></sup> Generally, SLE precedes the haematological malignancy, but the neoplasia may develop earlier or concomitantly.</p>
<p>On the contrary, myelodysplasia during the course of immunological disorders is a well-described entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312436859">9</xref></sup> Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can arise in a previously healthy child, usually due to cytogenetic anomalies, and is called <italic>primary</italic> or <italic>de novo</italic>. On the other hand, secondary MDS might appear due to chemo/radiotherapy, drugs and infections as well as autoimmune disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436859">10</xref></sup> The abnormal immune system of SLE probably predisposes these patients to dysplasia. In a Swedish study, doubled risk for leukaemia in patients with SLE was clearly defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436859">11</xref></sup> Also, another nested case-control study revealed that leukopenia at presentation was the foremost haematological abnormality in patients developing leukaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436859">12</xref></sup> Persistent leukopenia was also present in our case. No association between leukaemia development and renal or neurological involvement was shown. The frequency of preceding MDS was reported in approximately one quarter of the patients with SLE developing leukaemia as seen in the present case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436859">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The drugs used for SLE have been thought to be responsible for the development of MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Azathioprine (AZA) is an anti-metabolite drug used in the treatment of SLE since the 1960s. It causes defective DNA mismatch repair, possibly leading to myelodysplasia or even leukaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436859">13</xref></sup>In the present case, AZA was used for four months and then stopped due to cytopenia. But bone marrow aspiration at the diagnosis – before AZA treatment – also revealed three lineage dysplasia.</p>
<p>From another point of view, genetic predispositions might play a role in malignant transformation. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B27 carriers have been shown to have a probable risk for developing autoimmune diseases as well as AML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436859">14</xref></sup> HLA analysis – which did not reveal HLA-B27 – was performed in our patient as part of the bone marrow transplantation donor screening programme.</p>
<p>SLE itself might cause myelodysplasia. Autoantibodies, particularly anti-dsDNA antibodies, permanently attract the attention of researchers in terms of their role in the disease. Anti-dsDNA antibodies have the ability to penetrate into the living cells and hydrolyse DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436859">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312436859">16</xref></sup> Entry of these antibodies into the cells of various tissues, including haematopoietic ones, causes certain cellular dysfunctions such as induction or suppression of apoptosis, leading to impairment of organ functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312436859">17</xref></sup>Anti-dsDNA antibody was strongly positive since the diagnosis of SLE and may also have played a role in the pathogenesis of leukaemia development in this case. We noted severe myelodysplasia on every bone marrow evaluation until diagnosis of leukaemia. MDS is known to have a risk of transformation to AML in approximately 30% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312436859">18</xref></sup> This ratio might be higher in secondary MDS. Complex cytogenetic abnormalities and refractory anaemia with excess blast-2 (RAEB-2) are the known risk factors for development of AML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312436859">18</xref></sup> On the other hand, MDS could, rarely, transform into acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).<sup>19–21</sup> Absence of well-known cytogenetic abnormalities such as monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 together with negative myeloid markers by flow cytometric evaluation may be indicators of the transformation to lymphoblastic malignancy instead of myeloid malignancy. Furthermore, unknown mechanisms in the pathogenesis of SLE, such as autoreactive T cells, may lead to lymphoblastic leukaemia development.</p>
<p>There are still obscure points about malignant transformation in patients with SLE. Persistent dysplasia/cytopenia, complicated disease course, multi-system involvement, drugs and early age at the onset of SLE may all have constituted development of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the present case. Paediatric haematologists should keep in mind myelodysplasia and leukaemia as a complication of SLE and not waste time performing bone marrow aspiration in the case of persistent cytopenia.</p></sec>
