<abstract>
<p>Television is a cultural service and its national renderings of the Olympic Games contribute to the viewers’ understanding of themselves and the world. This study examines the representation of nationality and gender within Slovenian broadcasts of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Results show that evaluative commentary comprised as much as 44% of the dialogue. ‘Home’ athletes were given more prominence, while foreign athletes were largely portrayed through quantifiable features. Male athletes received more commentary than females. Announcers favoured analysing results and predicting outcomes for men, and resorted to personality and physicality depictions in women. A critical discourse analysis uncovered notions about gender and nationality that would be deemed inappropriate in many societies. Sports journalists and broadcasters at TV Slovenija do not have explicit editorial policies addressing chauvinistic dialogue. The absence of a policy is not perceived as an issue as individual announcers abide to their personal, at times conflicting, understandings of proper announcing.</p>

<body>
<p>Broadcasts of the Olympic Games are among the most popular television content: they regularly attract billions of viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113484438">International Olympic Committee, 2008</xref>). Part of their appeal derives from their very broad range of participants: they feature over 10,000 competitors from virtually all nations and provide viewers with insight into different identity groups. National broadcasters frequently build their narratives around these differences and frame the Olympics as a contest between ‘us’ and a variety of ‘them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>), so the media discourse surrounding the Olympics substantially contributes to the formation of identities that span from individuals and groups watching these broadcasts to that of a host city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267323113484438">Moragas Spà et al., 1995a</xref>).</p>
<p>Intersections and interconnections between sport and culture often manifest through the role of language, discursive practices and related forms of communicative inter/action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267323113484438">Meân and Halone, 2010</xref>). Scholars investigating sports media discourse usually study the portrayal of gender, ethnicity and nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323113484438">McCarthy and Jones, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267323113484438">Tomlinson, 1996</xref>). Most research in this field appears to derive from Anglophone countries, specifically the USA and UK, perhaps because of the cultural diversity of both societies which generates more sensitivity to potentially differing representations of myriad social groups.</p>
<p>Media portrayals of diversity in societies that are relatively homogeneous can inspire research that offers specific or alternative views to concepts that are taken for granted in many environments. Despite the strong globalization forces, the world remains a collage of different societies, rather than a single ‘global’ culture. Hence, analyses of media content and representation in post-socialist and post-colonial countries – more than 30 new such entities have emerged on the world geopolitical map since 1990 – present social and communication scholars with different issues and challenges than those typically found in western media.</p>
<p>This article offers a quantitative content and qualitative discourse analysis of Olympic broadcasting on the Slovenian public broadcaster, TV Slovenija. Traditionally, the mission of public service broadcasting has been to inform, educate and entertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323113484438">Harrison and Woods, 2001</xref>) and its purpose goes beyond securing the highest audience and maximizing revenues. Slovenia is a post-socialist, former Yugoslav republic. Its broadcast media market became pluralized after the country had proclaimed independence in 1991. Then, Slovenian broadcasting had to revert from a seemingly monolithic company that was <italic>state</italic> and <italic>national</italic> (and hence controlled by the government) to a <italic>public</italic> one that is predominantly state-funded but autonomous – a difficult but nonetheless necessary process within democratic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267323113484438">Papatheodorou and Machin, 2003</xref>). The former monopolist, government-controlled Radio and Television (RTV) Slovenija became a public service, while private radio and TV stations populated the newly opened electronic media sector in the years that followed.</p>
<p>As a popular media content, sports have traditionally been exposed to contrasting expectations. Examining Olympic media discourse in societies in transition offers insight into the specific discursive mechanisms in countries that lack a long-standing democratic tradition. This research adapts an American typology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2003</xref>) to study the discursive framing of nationality and gender within Slovenian television. In providing a new national perspective of issues of identity within the Olympic telecast, comparisons can be made across nations, formats and government structures.</p>

<title>Discourse in televised sports</title>
<p>Discourse is a set of meanings and statements that produce a particular version of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113484438">Burr, 1998</xref>). Media discourse, including television’s selection, narration and description of events, can alter viewers’ perceptions of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323113484438">Gerbner and Gross, 1976</xref>), as television is recognized to be as much a cultural service as it is an economic service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323113484438">Commission of the European Communities, 2009</xref>: 5). The audience’s understanding of characteristics such as gender and nationality can be altered by television’s manipulations, especially when such practices are repeated over long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323113484438">Eastman and Billings, 2000</xref>). Individuals construct their own identities from the options provided through discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113484438">Hall, 1996</xref>). In a pan-European scope, media discourse can contribute to the perpetuation of national identities over European integration at an emotional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323113484438">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In television broadcasts of sports events, announcers provide the spectators with more than a restatement of what they just saw: they embellish the drama and actively shape the viewers’ perceptions of the action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323113484438">Comisky et al., 1977</xref>). The extent of such subjective commentary, defined as dramatic or evaluative commentary that differs from factual description of play, fluctuates between 27 and 41% in different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113484438">Bryant et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267323113484438">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). Events that feature individuals or teams representing a nation attract many viewers that might otherwise be oblivious to (mediated) sports: the participation of athletes designated as their representatives make them stakeholders. The Olympic Games are organized as to include athletes from all nations, making this event the most grandiose sports event in human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267323113484438">Real, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Meaning is constructed differently according to the historical, cultural and institutional contexts within which interpretations are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267323113484438">Rose and Friedman, 1997</xref>). With the shift from national to (autonomous) public media after 1991, Slovenian journalists ceased to be ‘sociopolitical workers’ upholding the existing political system and had to embrace an impartial and critical role as the fourth estate. In a way, the media were granted the duty and the privilege to determine independently the way identities would be mediated.</p>

<title>Nationality</title>
<p>Despite being the most all-encompassing and a truly popular global event, the Olympic Games provide the most obvious example of inherent nationalism in sports. All nations promote their home nation’s athletes disproportionately, with the only real question being the degree in which it occurs: the share of newspaper coverage devoted to reporting about the country’s own athletes and teams, deemed as a nation’s ‘index of nationalism’, has been documented as spanning from 17 to 79% around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267323113484438">Real, 1989</xref>: 238). On television, each country’s network slants coverage towards native athletes to meet what they deem the audience’s preferences and to attract stronger ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323113484438">Larson and Rivenburgh, 1991</xref>). Media reports of the Olympic Games can contribute to nation-building even in regions with an otherwise strong separatist movement, such as the Catalan media’s exceptional framing of athletes as ‘Spanish’ rather than ‘Catalan’, as it normally does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323113484438">Juncà, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323113484438">Moragas Spà et al., 1995b</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to quantity, athletes of different nationalities are attributed diverse qualities. In American sports broadcasting, domestic athletes are more likely to be portrayed as having greater composure and courage, and as succeeding because of superior concentration and commitment. In turn, foreign athletes are more likely to be discussed in terms of experience, especially in terms of labels such as ‘veteran’ and ‘mature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>). Victorious ‘home’ athletes are labelled ‘golden boys’ and their victories are constructed as ‘heroic’ in other countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323113484438">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323113484438">Moragas Spà et al., 1995b</xref>). In general, home athletes’ qualities are exaggerated and portrayed as emblematic of the nation’s character. Their success is attributed to immeasurable qualities (such as concentration, composure, commitment and courage), whereas athletic ability and experience commonly attributed to foreign nationals can be objectively measured or quantified (by comparing their personal bests, age, years of experience, etc.). Previous research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113484438">Billings et al., 2011</xref>) argues that this additional unquantifiable dimension of home nation athletes has many causes, but could also be the function of language barrier issues that make understanding of foreign athletes’ personalities difficult to depict.</p>
<p>Several studies of the Slovenian sports media universe show that ‘home’ athletes are similarly portrayed in overtly positive terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323113484438">Kuzmanić, 1999</xref>). Sports reporters joined in the efforts of the Slovenian media to construct a new national identity with its mythical features after the proclamation of independence in 1991. The rowers that won the independent nation’s first-ever bronze medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were portrayed as ‘heroes’, and the mere participation at the event was seen as a promotion of nationhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323113484438">Moragas Spà et al., 1995b</xref>: 233).</p>

<title>Gender</title>
<p>Sports television often diminishes women’s athletic qualities and trivializes their efforts and successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>). Female athletes are often constructed according to an adolescent or even prepubescent ideal such as being referred to by their first names, as ‘young ladies’, or as the ‘favourite girl next door’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>). Some commentators who emphasize appropriate femininity focus on traditionally feminine physical and emotional characteristics or behaviours: women are portrayed as attractive, beautiful, graceful, emotional, weak, emotionally unstable, dependent, self-sacrificing and concerned for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>). Female competitors are presented as driven by cooperation rather than competition. Their athletic skills and talents are diminished. These related techniques situate female athletes so they are not perceived as a threat to the patriarchal order: even though they may play sport (and do so well), they must conform to the ideals of a ‘real woman’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In turn, male athletes are typically framed as active, (positively) aggressive, committed, competitive, dominant, independent, skilled, strong, even violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323113484438">Kennedy, 2000</xref>). Men are more likely to succeed because of attributed composure and intelligence, and to fail because they are seen as lacking commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323113484438">Eastman and Billings, 2000</xref>). Unlike women, who are typically reported as performing in ‘female-appropriate’ sports that emphasize the aesthetic movements of the body, men can engage in virtually all kinds of sports without having their sexual orientation questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Slovenian-specific analyses of gender portrayal in sports television are limited to a single study comparing men’s and women’s team handball telecasts on Slovenian television. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113484438">Bon and Doupona Topič (2004)</xref> wrote that broadcasts of men’s games were technically more sophisticated, and that the portrayal of gender tended to conform to the prevailing gender stereotypes. The limited scope of data available does not offer a breadth of understanding; it does, however, hint that Slovenian sports television might not be treating women fairly.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Thus, we have a great deal of insight as to how the Olympic telecast conveys issues of identity within western culture. Scholars elsewhere have also provided worthy insights that, collectively, offer fundamental understandings as to how different nations convey issues of gender and nationality. What is lacking within the literature is a sense of what a country like Slovenia brings to the intellectual table, with its unique mix of transitionary democracy and public television conveyance formats.</p>
<p>Past research of Slovenian sports broadcasting suggested the presence of gender bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113484438">Bon and Doupona Topič, 2004</xref>) and favouritism for Slovenian athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323113484438">Kuzmanić, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323113484438">Moragas Spà et al., 1995b</xref>), so both were consequently anticipated in this study. Tentatively, announcers will favour male competitors by dedicating more than 53% of the dialogue to them – a portion that would mirror the combined share of men in athletics, artistic gymnastics and swimming competitions at the 2008 Olympics. Five hypotheses were formulated to guide this analysis of TV Slovenija’s commentary at the Beijing Olympics:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In Slovenia, the Olympic Games are broadcast on the second channel of the public service broadcaster, TV Slovenija. Unlike American coverage, which concentrates its Olympic highlights in the evening three-hour prime-time slot, TV Slovenija focuses on broadcasting Olympic content live almost around the clock with little distinction for the more desirable demographics and viewership that are often part of American programming decisions. In total, the Slovenian network aired 272 hours and 42 minutes of live and delayed action from the 2008 Summer Olympics (not counting talk shows, studio analyses, etc.) over 17 days.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the broadcasts of three of the most popular individual sports in Slovenia: artistic gymnastics, swimming and track and field. Athletics and gymnastics accounted for six of the 10 most-watched events on TV Slovenija during the 2008 Olympics, and swimming competitions were highly anticipated in Slovenia due to medal expectations but did not attract huge TV ratings due to unfavourable airing times. The aim was to analyse all airings of the three sports (as opposed to, say, only the final stages of the competitions or only prime-time coverage) to ensure a sufficient representation of Slovenian participants since it was expected that most of them would not qualify for the final stages. In the end, a total of 51 hours and 7 minutes of Olympic coverage on TV Slovenija was recorded and analysed: 25 hours and 29 minutes of track and field, 18 hours and 31 minutes of swimming and 7 hours and 7 minutes of artistic gymnastics events. Considerable differences in these durations derive from competition specifics: the athletics part of the competition featured over 2000 participants that competed in 47 events, approximately 1000 swimmers took part in 34 events, while 196 gymnasts competed in 15 events. A small number of broadcasts were not analysed because of last-minute line-up changes or recording difficulties.</p>
<p>First, all descriptors (defined as any adjective, adjectival phrase, adverb or adverbial phrase) pertaining to athletes or teams spoken by commentators were transcribed word-for-word into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Simultaneously, the identity (including gender and nationality) of both athletes and speakers were identified. Only comments by network-employed individuals – play-by-play announcers, technical/colour commentators and on-site reporters – spoken during an actual competition broadcast were analysed. Their dialogue can be supervised by the editors and producers who can control the announcers’ speech and are ultimately responsible for preventing chauvinistic or otherwise improper content and dialogue (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>). Topical programmes (e.g. <italic>Olympic Studios</italic>) occasionally airing before and/or after broadcasts were excluded from the analysis because of their irregular airing times, varying content and references to topics beyond the three sports mentioned or even beyond sports.</p>
<p>For the quantitative content part of the study, each descriptor was coded according to a 19-item taxonomy, which is an expanded version of the classification originally introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman (2003)</xref> to study the discursive framing of gender and nationality variables. It has been used on multiple occasions to study Olympic broadcasting in the United States (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>), and modified versions have been used to analyse other international sports competitions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113484438">Billings and Tambosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323113484438">Ličen and Billings, 2012</xref>). The typology included the following categories: (a) concentration (e.g. ‘concentrating before her routine’); (b) strength/speed-based athletic skill (e.g. ‘strong weapon’); (c) talent/ability-based athletic skill (e.g. ‘an almost perfect execution’); (d) composure (e.g. ‘disappointed’); (e) commitment (e.g. ‘let himself be beaten’); (f) courage (e.g. ‘were most afraid of the pommel horse’); (g) experience (e.g. ‘has Olympic experience’); (h) past achievements (e.g. ‘19.86 this year, the world’s second-fastest time of the season’); (i) intelligence (‘smart decision’); (j) athletic consonance (e.g. ‘very convincing’); (k) expectations about performance (e.g. ‘first favourite’); (l) doping (e.g. ‘cheating’); (m) outgoing/extroverted (e.g. ‘celebrates the Olympic title’); (n) modest/introverted (e.g. ‘has no reason to smile’); (o) emotional (e.g. ‘tears of joy’); (p) attractiveness (e.g. ‘worth a glance’); (q) size/parts of body (e.g. ‘wide shoulders’); (r) background (e.g. ‘the Chinese’) and (s) factual and other. Categories (a) through (l) include attributions of success or failure, categories (m) through (q) focus on depictions of personality or physicality, and categories (r) and (s) are neutral. The expansion introduced the evaluative categories of past achievements, stated expectations and doping because an earlier pilot study conducted on a small sample of broadcasts showed the sizable quantity of this commentary and it was deemed specific enough to merit differentiation from existing categories.</p>
<p>Frequencies of each category of descriptors were then calculated. Significant differences between groups were detected with chi-square analyses by using the percentage of overall comments for distinct groups of athletes as expected frequencies (consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>). Two independent researchers recoded 30% of the coverage, with overall inter-coder reliability using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323113484438">Cohen’s (1960)</xref> kappa reaching 88%.</p>
<p>In addition to the quantitative-oriented content analysis, a critical analysis of the transcribed text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323113484438">Carey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267323113484438">Verschueren, 2000</xref>) was conducted to determine additional characteristics of the sports broadcasting discourse on TV Slovenija. Further, to understand different approaches to commenting on sports and find out the circumstances that might influence the motives for preferring certain wordings, seven semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out with TV Slovenija’s reporters and current and former managing editors of the sports department. In the text, interviewees’ opinions are quoted as personal communication.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 22,731 verbal descriptors were coded and categorized. In the overall composition of the comments, factual and background descriptors represented 53% of the total commentary. This is less than the share recorded in team sports telecasts in other cultures, which ranged between 59 and 73% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113484438">Bryant et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267323113484438">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). Evaluative commentary comprised 44% of the Slovenian commentary. Within evaluative discourse alone, 70% denoted success and 30% described failure. The third group of comments that referred to competitors’ personality or physicality aggregated 3% of the total dialogue.</p>

<title>Nationality</title>
<p>In many societies, specific pronouns are used by the media to identify ‘our’ athletes or teams competing in international events. In Slovenia, announcers frequently use the attributive adjectives <italic>naš, naša</italic> (masculine and feminine singular forms) and <italic>naši, naše</italic> (plural forms). ‘Home’ athletes are customarily given greater prominence: at the 2008 Beijing Games, Slovenian athletes comprised 0.9% of the athletes competing in artistic gymnastics, swimming and track and field events, yet they collected 8% of on-air dialogue in the Slovenian TV coverage. The limited Slovenian scholarship in this field suggests that measurable or quantifiable features will be emphasized in foreign nationals while ‘home’ athletes might be portrayed in more abstract terms, mirroring descriptions found in western media. Ideally, 8% of the commentary in each category would relate to Slovenian athletes. The actual distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323113484438">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The 29 Slovenian athletes that were mentioned in the telecasts received more commentary about talent and ability (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 12.100; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and were more likely to be described as extrovert (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 4.396; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than their foreign opponents. In turn, they were underrepresented in terms of talk about experience (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 29.417; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and past achievements (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 11.931; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Very little prominence was also devoted to the discourse about size and body of Slovenian athletes (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 6.360; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). References to other topics were evenly distributed among Slovenian and foreign nationals.</p>
<p>Notably, Slovenian athletes received more commentary about talent and ability, an immeasurable quality, and were portrayed as more outgoing and extrovert – possibly because Slovenian announcers had plenty of opportunity to meet and talk to them due to physical and cultural proximity. The same announcers had considerably less access to foreign nationals and information about them, so dialogue about them was more focused on quantifiable attributes such as experience, past results and size. Hypothesis 1 is confirmed.</p>
<p>On-air dialogue is thus shaped by the commentators’ acquaintance with the athletes. Familiarity can also influence the depiction of success and failure as past research indicates that ‘home’ nationals tend to receive more positive commentary. A comparison of positive attributions with regard to the competitors’ nationality was conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323113484438">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The only comments that recorded significant imbalance in positive attribution were references to consonance. This category included descriptions that could not be explained with a single variable and which referred to a harmonious concord of multiple factors to produce a result. The most typical of such comments included assessments of ‘good’/‘bad’ performances and references to ‘luck’. Slovenian athletes were more likely to be framed as delivering positive consonance than their foreign peers (e.g. ‘If 17 August is not a happy day for Slovenian sports, then I really don’t know which one should be’; swimming, 17 August). Overall, the Slovenian team did not offer a <italic>supreme</italic> performance: its members won a gold medal in the men’s hammer throw and a silver medal in the women’s swimming 200m freestyle. Notwithstanding, their performances were often met with approval by the announcers: what was normally disregarded when produced by other nationals became a remarkable feat when delivered by Slovenian athletes. Despite this cheering attitude, the share of positive comments about Slovenian athletes did not significantly exceed that directed to ‘foreign’ athletes in any of the other categories. Hypothesis 2 is thus rejected.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, dialogue regarding Slovenian athletes’ performances was saturated with references to ‘ours’. This form of nationalism often influences an individual’s social identity by emphasizing their belonging to an imagined social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113484438">Anderson, 1983</xref>). Patriotic reporting in sports is relatively common in many nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323113484438">Lee and Maguire, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323113484438">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267323113484438">Tomlinson, 1996</xref>). Declaring their support for Slovenian athletes was unabashed by the announcers, arguing it is something in which <italic>all</italic> viewers will engage (e.g. ‘Today of course I am rooting, myself and of course the entire Slovenia, for [hammer thrower] Primož Kozmus’; athletics, 17 August). Kozmus’s victory was framed with a particularly strong patriotic connotation: the award was considered a ‘gold medal for Slovenia’ (athletics, 17 August) and the awarding ceremony was presented as an occasion when ‘we’ll sing our Zdravljica [the Slovenian national anthem] all together’ (athletics, 17 August). Patriotic perspectives were offered even during events or performances involving foreign competitors: the fact that Anastasia Zuyeva, a European swimming champion at the time the Olympics were held, trained in Koper, Slovenia, ahead of the Beijing Olympics was attributed to the fact that ‘she wanted to prepare well’, which was given as the reason ‘she trained at ours in Koper’ (swimming, 11 August).</p>
<p>Nationality was often used as a synonym to avoid repeating an athlete’s name (e.g. ‘Ksenia Semenova is sixth. The Russian will be disappointed, she openly expected a medal’; gymnastics, 18 August). This personal detail was also the single most-mentioned type of background information provided by TV Slovenija’s announcers. This is not surprising as the perpetuation of nations is embedded in the competition system set forth by the International Olympic Committee itself: competitors who fulfil the set athletic requirements then qualify for the Olympic Games through national quotas, and they compete as representatives of countries they hold passports for. Even individual triumphs are often credited to an entire nation: divisions by nationality are widespread and have grown to be perceived as self-obvious.</p>

<title>Gender differences</title>
<p>Of the 22,731 verbal descriptors analysed in this study, 12,725 (56%) related to male athletes, while 9,540 descriptors (42%) referred to female athletes. The remaining 466 (2%) were gender-neutral or related to both genders. The combined gender split for artistic gymnastics, swimming and track and field was a 53/47 ratio of men and women competitors. A split that would mirror the actual gender composition in the observed events was deemed an appropriate estimate of balanced representation in sportscasters’ discourse. However, actual figures differed significantly from the theoretical distribution, with male athletes receiving more than their proportional share of dialogue (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 154.122; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Hypothesis 3 is thus confirmed.</p>
<p>Gender bias often influences the portrayal of participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323113484438">Table 3</xref> offers a review of the frequencies with which different types of comments were made about men and women in TV Slovenija Olympic telecasts.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323113484438">Table 3</xref> reveals significant differences in a number of topics. When success was attributed, men were more likely to be portrayed in terms of commitment (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 9.093; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and announcers recalled their past results and achievements (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 10.864; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), as well as speculated about their placing in upcoming events (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 54.857; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), more often than they did for women competitors. In turn, women received more commentary about concentration (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 4.155; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), their experience (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 4.801; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and in the context of illicit drugs use (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 7.300; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Differences were found in the attribution of personality and physicality descriptors as well: as women were more often described as introvert (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 8.455; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and attractive (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 5.228; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>When interpreting the differences in the attribution of commentary it should be kept in mind that a balanced distribution of commentary is not one that awards exactly half the comments in each category to each gender, but rather one that mirrors the actual overall distribution of all descriptors (57/43). Differences emerged as predicted in eight categories out of 15; not an immense quota but still enough to support the claim that announcers provide different readings of athletic successfulness, personality and physicality in men and women. Hypothesis 4 is thus confirmed.</p>
<p>Determining the extent to which a specific topic or characteristic is ascribed to a certain social group is one way of determining bias in language; another is to ascertain whether these statements denote differing values in terms of success and failure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267323113484438">Table 4</xref> shows the attributions of success to each gender in each category of discourse.</p>

<p>Remarkably, there were no differences whatsoever in the attribution of positive commentary by gender – neither by category nor in the total count. Evaluative commentary was largely positive, with 70% of all descriptors denoting success. An equal distribution of positive and negative commentary was only found in the consonance and concentration rubrics. TV Slovenija’s announcers thus did differentiate the selection of topics discussed about men and women, but did not frame either group as distinctly more successful. Hence, Hypothesis 5 is rejected.</p>
<p>Specific discursive differences were relatively rare; potentially biased themes, such as the exemplification of one gender compared to the other, were found in references to both genders. The only type of discourse that was obviously divergent was the depiction of physical looks and attractiveness of the competitors. Two most striking examples derive from the women’s hammer throw, when announcer Mr Andrej Stare dubbed Aksana Miankova ‘the most, like, “twiggy” hammer thrower in the whole world’ (athletics, 20 August), and noted that Clarissa Claretti had ‘the sexiest figure of all hammer throwers, she put on the least body weight’ (athletics, 20 August).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Slovenian sportscasters devote a substantial amount of their on-air dialogue to evaluative commentary. The 44% share of interpretive dialogue found in this research exceeds the amount of interpretation found in previous studies conducted on team sports in Asian and North American cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113484438">Bryant et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267323113484438">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). The topics discussed by the announcers depend on the gender and the nationality of the athletes. ‘Home’ nationals receive more prominence and are portrayed in terms more abstract than tangible references to personal bests, past results or biographical information. More of their personality traits are presented by the announcers, probably also due to the actual familiarity with the individual athletes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113484438">Billings et al., 2011</xref>). Foreign nationals that are beyond the reach and outside the spotlight of Slovenian viewers and announcers are in turn introduced through facts and measurable achievements. Male competitors, then, draw out significantly more commentary than females do. Men also generate a different kind of attention, with aspects of their performance more likely to be discussed than when women’s events are shown. But even while descriptions tend to conform to stereotypical images of strong and extrovert men, and beautiful and modest women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>), positive and negative attributions are remarkably consistently applied to both groups.</p>
<p>The 8% index of nationalism is very modest; American Olympic broadcasters tend to dedicate every second remark to American athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>), while print media self-centredness spans between 17 and 79% around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267323113484438">Real, 1989</xref>). Unlike in other societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113484438">Billings et al., 2011</xref>), ‘home’ nationals in Slovenian telecasts do not receive statistically more positive ascriptions than foreign athletes. The only exceptions are the assertions of consonance: performances by Slovenian athletes are described using superlatives even when relatively humble placements such as semi-final appearances are achieved. Abundance of this type of evaluative commentary has only modest objective foundations, as few Slovenian competitors could actually compete on par with the world’s best.</p>
<p>The rare medals claimed by Slovenian athletes – two in total in the broadcasts analysed – are consequently met with great excitement by the announcers. Accolades stimulate exclamations such as: ‘At least the silver medal is ours’ (athletics, 17 August) and ‘We lived to see the first swimming medal in history’ (swimming, 13 August). The ambiguity of the first person plural is exquisite as it shares the success with all those who perceive themselves as ‘us’ Slovenians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267323113484438">Oakes et al., 1994</xref>), and at the same time improves the status of the commentators who bask in the reflected glory of medal winners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323113484438">Cialdini et al., 1976</xref>). As acknowledged by the announcer during the hammer throw broadcast: ‘For me, this is also the climax of my career as a reporter’ (athletics, 17 August).</p>
<p>Discursive differences in the gendered attribution of some types of descriptors are noteworthy. Male athletes attract more comments concerning commitment (‘Savitsky is displaying will of steel … keeps competing despite severe pain’; gymnastics, 14 August), past performances and speculations regarding upcoming results. As the great majority (specifically, between 78 and 95%) of these comments are positive, this imbalance contributes to accentuating the supreme overall performative aspect of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>). There are further differences in the personality and physicality rubrics, where women are portrayed as more introvert, and their body and looks are discussed more often than men’s. This accurately mirrors differences perpetuated by American sports television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113484438">Billings and Eastman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113484438">Daddario, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113484438">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>An outstanding feature of Slovenian sportscasters’ discourse is the straightforwardness with which announcers share their ideas about gender and nationality. The most sexist claims were authored by athletics announcer Andrej Stare, who assessed women competitors’ sex appeal while on-air. His remarks were criticized by the current and by two former managing editors of the sports department at TV Slovenija. However, no sanctions were drawn against him: current editor Mr Mile Jovanović explained this by arguing that ‘you can apply some sanctions, but the thing has already been said, anyway; the damage has been done’ (personal communication, 19 May 2010). Andrej Stare himself (a popular and veteran reporter in Slovenia) offered the following reply when asked whether he regretted the remarks he made about ‘sexy female throwers’ (personal communication, 3 June 2010):
<disp-quote>
<p>Not at all. You know, in athletics, female throwers are a specific group of athletes. They sacrifice the beauty of their body for their athletic results, they stuff themselves and become, I’ll say, chubby, stout, even slightly adipose. … And such a woman is considerably less attractive than, I’ll say, a long jumper, who you look at and you get a thousand and one ideas, right? Whereas, for that shot putter, you say, ‘As long as one doesn’t have to look at her’, right? If she were yours, you’d say, ‘Wow, great, we’ve got a gold medal’, right, you would venerate her. Otherwise, I think, aesthetically, through a prism of general aesthetics, it’s not exactly the prettiest sight.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The fact that similar blunders appear to be limited to a single announcer should not be perceived as a mitigating circumstance: when speaking on-air, announcers represent both the media corporation and their colleagues. The managing editor’s explanation that ‘the damage has been done’ means that no measures aimed at preventing such behaviour from occurring in the future are taken.</p>
<p>With regard to pro-Slovenian commentary, announcers’ perceptions of this discursive phenomenon seem multifaceted and even contrasting. Former managing editor of sports at TV Slovenija, Mr Marjan Lah, stated that short references and personal pronouns (e.g. saying <italic>naši</italic>, or ours, rather than <italic>slovenski športniki</italic>, or Slovenian athletes) ‘are admissible in all examples of expressing journalistic contents at home and abroad – especially in old democracies, where national pride is shaped and evident’ (electronic communication, 29 January 2010). In contrast, Andrej Stare argued that <italic>Croatian broadcasters</italic> were the first to start referring to athletes as ‘ours’ in an attempt to build a nation following the war of independence that lasted from 1991 until 1995 and Slovenian announcers picked this theme up from colleagues in Croatia (Andrej Stare, personal communication, 3 June 2010). Despite different perceptions of the origin of patriotic announcing, both recognize the consolidation of national identity as the reason behind it. Mr Miha Žibrat, an announcer and the then president of the Slovenian Association of Sport Journalists, said that although impartiality in sports broadcasting is possible, ‘the viewers do not accept impartiality well’ (personal communication, 25 January 2010). His claim was rejected by managing editor Mile Jovanović, who explained that TV Slovenija has never conducted any research to determine viewers’ preferences, but added that, ever since becoming managing editor, he had never received any complaint about announcers cheering for Slovenia in international competitions.</p>
<p>Editorial stances concerning the appropriateness of references to Slovenian competitors as ‘ours’ are very vague. Mile Jovanović initially noted that ‘when Slovenia or a Slovenian representative plays somebody foreign, I think that we can allow ourselves some partisanship’ (personal communication, 19 May 2010). Later on in the interview, he said that especially older and more experienced staff members argue that commentators on public television <italic>should not</italic> refer to competitors as ‘ours’, or say that ‘we’ are playing. He described himself as ‘in doubt’ regarding what approach is suitable (personal communication, 19 May 2010). In turn, former managing sports editor and announcer, and current news anchor Mr Igor Evgen Bergant said he considered it admissible referring to Slovenian teams as ‘ours’ but not to resort to the first person plural, i.e. ‘we’. He said he deemed the latter ‘<italic>an exaggerated</italic> level of identification, which is professionally inadmissible’ (Igor Evgen Bergant, personal communication, 21 January 2010; emphasis added). Greater autonomy thus does not result in increased self-regulation, but rather in a decline of professional standards. Sports announcers behave as (although mild) patriotic supporters, rather than reporters. Regulation and policies in the former ‘national’ broadcaster promoted national unity (in an inherently multicultural state), but as Yugoslavia was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the promotion of international cooperation and understanding was a strong motive against the perpetuation of banal nationalism through sport.</p>
<p>Indeed, identities are constructed within discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113484438">Hall, 1996</xref>) and people customarily define themselves within the categories that are relevant in the society in which they live at the time. The media strongly influence the determination of these categories, and television has a particularly significant impact in shaping the way people understand and interpret the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323113484438">Gerbner and Gross, 1976</xref>). Television also controls the representation of social groups individuals recognize themselves as belonging (or not belonging) to, in their construction of their own social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267323113484438">Oakes et al., 1994</xref>). The lack of policy regarding a cardinal issue such as appropriate referencing of ‘own’ athletes and teams is a serious editorial limitation. Another is the lack of measures aimed at barring sexist language from public broadcasting despite the fact that this phenomenon has been recognized (and condemned) by announcers themselves.</p>
<p>By watching sports, many viewers satisfy their need for social identification and intergroup comparison. This is a legitimate practice when the impetus originates from the viewers. TV Slovenija’s sportscasters, however, usurp the right to designate the side viewers should cheer – and they do it vigorously. In Slovenia, sports announcers classify themselves and are recognized as journalists; their contract of service defines their position as ‘journalist/reporter’. However, taking sides is in conflict with the roles and functions of journalism in general and of the <italic>public</italic>, rather than <italic>national</italic>, media in particular. Viewers are not necessarily fans, and chauvinist and overt partisan discourse might draw away part of the audience that has other interests in mediated sports. Despite contrary claims by sportscasters, biased reporting is not universal and the rhetoric of the first person plural is not endorsed by major media corporations in Germany or the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113484438">Billings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323113484438">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>). Some sportswriters in Canada even question the legitimacy of <italic>fans</italic> talking about ‘their’ team as ‘we’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267323113484438">Willis, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Slovenia is one of the many ‘new’ nation-states that were constituted upon the fall of the socialist and communist regimes in Eastern Europe after 1990. Media in these countries are faced with the challenge of re-conceiving themselves from <italic>national</italic>, as in <italic>nation-building</italic>, to <italic>public</italic>. The concept of ‘public’ can manifest as a multitude of entities: in the case of TV Slovenija, it is understood as (and limited to) a ‘state’ public and the contents are thus mostly directed towards its territory. Sport is in fact used to cement this ‘new’ national identity also in relation to the ‘old’ Yugoslav identity: Bosnia-Herzegovina, another former Yugoslav republic, was deemed an ‘athletically exotic country’ (athletics, 15 August). Distance from the former country was further increased by noting that ‘ever since ’91, us Slovenians, of course, don’t have anything in common with the Balkan Games’ (athletics, 20 August). Many Slovenian citizens would consider the Balkan region a synonym of Yugoslavia, so taking part in this regional sporting event might be considered a remnant of the old country. Instead, ‘independent’ national greatness was affirmed in an attempt to consolidate national feelings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Television renderings of the Olympic Games on Slovenian television are characterized by several departures from media and journalistic standards: competitors representing the network’s ‘own’ nations are preferred over others, and further distinctions are made when discussing male or female competitors. Patriotic coverage is considered by Slovenian sports reporters and editors as a worldwide characteristic of sports broadcasting and thus admissible, even ‘standard’ practice. Conversely, gendered language is perceived by many (including TV Slovenija’s producers and staff members) as problematic; nonetheless, no steps are taken to reduce the disparaging and stereotypical coverage. Rather than educating viewers and expanding their horizons, television content seems to perpetuate clichés about gender and nations.</p>
<p>This study shows noteworthy aspects of sports media content and discourse in a post-socialist nation. It remains unclear whether these patterns would apply to all former Yugoslav countries or whether they shift, perhaps due to cultural differences or even because of the prolonged state of conflict that characterized the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Sports media have an enormous cultivation potential; future studies should investigate whether media producers in post-socialist and post-colonial countries are aware of this, or do sports in these societies remain a domain in which outsiders and outliers remain unwelcome.</p>
