<abstract>
<p>This study sought to understand the perceptions of parental involvement and parental uninvolvement at a predominantly African American inner-city high school. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 parents and 10 staff at an inner-city public high school. Five major themes emerged regarding the meanings of parental involvement at this school: Participation at School, Being There Outside of School, Communication, Achieve and Believe, and Village Keepers. Results showed that some participants’ perceptions of parental involvement were consistent with earlier understandings of parental involvement. Results also highlighted areas in which earlier models may not address the context of inner-city schools.</p>

<p>Between October 2007 and October 2008, Black and Hispanic students in public and private high schools had higher dropout rates than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912437794">Chapman, Laird, &amp; Kewal-Ramani, 2010</xref>). Further, African American students who attended inner-city high schools had higher rates of academic failure and greater school behavioral problems than their peers living in other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912437794">Bemak, Chung, &amp; Siroskey-Sabdo, 2005</xref>). Findings from several reviews and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate the positive relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement among students at all levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912437794">Fan &amp; Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912437794">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912437794">Jeynes, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912437794">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085912437794">Spera, 2005</xref>). In particular, parental involvement in education has been associated with a variety of positive academic outcomes, including higher grade point averages (GPAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912437794">Gutman &amp; Midgley, 2000</xref>), and increased achievement in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912437794">Senechal &amp; LeFevre, 2002</xref>), writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912437794">Epstein, Simon, &amp; Salinas, 1997</xref>), and mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912437794">Izzo, Weissberg, Kasprow, &amp; Fendrich, 1999</xref>). Other academic benefits include lower dropout rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912437794">Rumberger, 1995</xref>), fewer retentions, and fewer special education placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912437794">Miedel &amp; Reynolds, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, previous research suggests that there is a steep decline in overall parental involvement as students matriculate through school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912437794">Izzo et al., 1999</xref>). Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that a lower percentage of high school students had parents who reported attending a regularly scheduled parent–teacher conference than students in elementary and middle school (61% compared with 86%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912437794">Herrold &amp; O’Donnell, 2008</xref>). Although the behavioral change is clear, the underlying causes behind the behavioral change are not. In the current study, we sought to better understand parental involvement and uninvolvement within this context by conducting in-depth interviews with African American parents and school personnel affiliated with an inner-city high school with primarily African America students.</p>
<sec id="section1-0042085912437794">
<title>Understanding Parental Involvement in Education</title>
<p>Previous researchers have developed a number of models to define and describe parental involvement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912437794">Epstein (1987)</xref> proposed a theoretical framework of six types of involvement (i.e., parenting, volunteering, communicating, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community) to represent different categories of partnerships that support student development and academic success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437794">Eccles and Harold’s (1993)</xref> model of parental involvement incorporated the number of influences on parental involvement (e.g., parent/family characteristics, neighborhood, parent/teacher beliefs, and parent/teacher practices) along with potential child outcomes (e.g., achievement, values, persistence, and self-perception). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437794">Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995)</xref> proposed a parental involvement model that outlined five levels (i.e., parental involvement in decision making, parents’ choice of involvement forms, mechanisms through which parental involvement influences child/student outcomes, tempering/mediating variables, and child/student outcomes) that link parents’ initial decisions to become involved in their children’s education with student outcomes.</p>
<p>The existing frameworks are useful in that they provide a series of possible places to intervene on the behalf of students and families. Furthermore, embedded in the earlier models is the sense that parental involvement is best viewed as an interaction between parents and school personnel, rather than only a parent’s responsibility. Still, much remains unknown about how parents conceptualize parental involvement. In particular, earlier models of parental involvement assume that the perspectives that constitute “parental involvement” for families and school personnel are the same. Given the plethora of frameworks researchers use to describe parental involvement among researchers, it is likely that there are also various understandings of parental involvement between parents and school personnel. Unfortunately, little research supports this assumption at the high school level. In addition, earlier models have excluded inner-city African American high school parents and school personnel in their development. This study sought to better understand the ways in which parents and school personnel at an inner-city high school understand both parental involvement and parental uninvolvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0042085912437794">
<title>Multiple Perspectives of Parental Involvement</title>
<p>There is a paucity of literature on the ways in which high school parents of high school students conceptualize parental involvement. In contrast, there is evidence available from studies conducted at the prekindergarten, elementary, and middle school level showing that parents and school personnel from urban areas may have different understandings of parental involvement. For example, results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912437794">Lawson’s (2003)</xref> study with parents of elementary school students revealed that educators often used a “school-centric” definition that involved parents assisting the school in reaching goals defined by school personnel, such as volunteering in classrooms, attending meetings, and helping with homework. Conversely, parents endorsed a “community-centric” view of involvement, in which their role was to provide basic necessities (e.g., food, shelter) for their families and to protect their children from the negative influences of the neighborhood after school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912437794">Lawson, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912437794">Barges and Loges (2003)</xref> also found slight differences in parental involvement conceptualizations among parents and teachers at the middle school level. On one hand, parents believed monitoring student academic progress, cultivating personal relationships with teachers, involving their children in extracurricular school programs, and developing community support systems were the most important ways that parents could be involved in their child’s education. On the other hand, teachers thought that the best ways parents could be involved with their child’s education were to communicate with both the child and the school, participate in the child’s school activities and the child’s life in general and practice fundamental parenting duties including supervising and disciplining.</p>
<p>The existing literature demonstrates the importance of and the barriers to parental involvement. Still, the need to further analyze and clarify the often unstated assumptions and implicit beliefs that guide what parent involvement means and represents to its primary actors, namely, parents and school personnel, remains. Moreover, studies that have given voice to parents and school personnel’s perceptions of parent involvement were conducted in prekindergarten, elementary schools, and middle schools. They do not address the meanings that African American parents and school personnel make at the high school level. Unfortunately, inner-city African American parents have been described as being less involved in their children’s education when compared with parents of other ethnicities and in suburban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912437794">Smalley &amp; Reyes-Blanes, 2001</xref>). However, it may be that researchers have not accurately captured how inner-city African American parents are involved in their children’s education at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912437794">Crozier, 2003</xref>). It is important to have literature that addresses the limitations of research regarding perceptions of and interaction related to parental involvement within predominantly African American high school and African American families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042085912437794">
<title>Potential Barriers to Involvement</title>
<p>Actively involving parents, particularly those in low-income communities like inner-cities, in their children’s education remains one of educators’ greatest challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912437794">Smalley &amp; Reyes-Blanes, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912437794">Cooper and Crosnoe (2007)</xref> argued that the lack of money, time, and energy limit economically disadvantaged African American parents’ levels of involvement in their children’s education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912437794">Lareau (2003)</xref> indicated that parents living in low-income neighborhoods do not have access to the same financial and educational resources as their middle-class counterparts. Hence, low-income parents may experience <italic>time poverty</italic>. Time poverty refers to the lack of poor working families’ free time to dedicate to their child’s educational concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912437794">Newman &amp; Chin, 2003</xref>). Unfortunately, many African American parents have other children to care for or work schedules that prohibit them from attending school activities, meetings, and parent–teacher conferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085912437794">Machen, Wilson, &amp; Notar, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Other barriers faced by African American families arise from the interactions between the parent and school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437794">Harry (1992)</xref> noted that African American parents reported feelings of isolation, alienation, disengagement, and an array of other negative feelings regarding interactions with personnel at their child’s school. In their frustration and anger toward the school, parents voiced being treated like second-class citizens. Other African American parents are reluctant to become involved because of their own negative experiences as a student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085912437794">Lightfoot, 2004</xref>). Thus, negative interactions with school personnel and negative experiences during childhood also serve as potential barriers to parental involvement among African American parents. Given these barriers, it is likely that African American families living in inner-cities have developed other ways to be involved in their children’s education that are indirect and perhaps behinds the scenes of traditional models of parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912437794">Auerbach, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>This study sought to understand the ways in which parents and school personnel at a predominantly African American inner-city high school interpret the meaning of parental involvement and uninvolvement. In particular, given the range of models that exist to define and describe parental involvement, the authors of this article sought to assess the fit of such models on a previously excluded group (e.g., parents and school personnel at an inner-city high school). The present study contributes to existing literature in three important ways. First, this study provides a rare investigation of perceptions of parental involvement at the high school level. Second, it explores the ways in which different definitions of parental involvement might lead to incorrect assumptions about African American parents’ interests in their children’s education. Finally, it sheds light on some of the possible reasons for parental uninvolvement among high school parents.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437794">Creswell (1998)</xref> noted that qualitative methods are often appropriate for research questions that ask “how” or “what” instead of “why” and when a topic is to be explored in an in-depth fashion. As the authors were interested in <italic>how</italic> African American parents and school personnel affiliated with a predominantly African American high school perceive parental involvement, a qualitative approach was used. In the present study, the term <italic>inner-city high school</italic> refers to a particular kind of urban high school. In contrast to other schools in urban areas, which include various income levels and White students, inner-city schools tend to be public and serve largely poor, students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912437794">Brunetti, 2006</xref>). Many of the students in inner-city schools come from impoverished families and from neighborhoods characterized by high crime, high unemployment, serious gang activity, drug dealing, and recurring outbreaks of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912437794">Zhou, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This study was conducted at a large urban school district in the Midwestern region of the United States composed of 92% students of color, almost half of whom were African American (47%), with the majority from low-income families (86%). Everett Public High (EPH)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085912437794">1</xref></sup> was selected in October 2007 using both a homogeneous case sampling technique and random sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912437794">Patton, 2002</xref>) to ensure an equal opportunity for participation among schools whose student population was more than 95% African American. Nearly all of the high school’s 1,135 students were African American (98.3%) at the time of the study and came from low-income households (92.8%) based on estimates of free/reduced lunch provided by the school. Once EPH was selected, the principal of the school as well as the school’s Local School Council (LSC) was contacted by letter and in person to discuss the nature of the research. After the school’s approval of the research project, the first author continued to attend LSC meetings to understand the issues at the school, to inform the design and development of the research, and to recruit participants.</p>
<sec id="section6-0042085912437794">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The current study involved 25 in-depth interviews, which is consistent with typical qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437794">Creswell, 1998</xref>). School personnel and parents were recruited using a criterion sampling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912437794">Patton, 2002</xref>). Parents and school personnel who had contact with each other in the past 3 months were selected. Eligible forms of contact included phone conversation, face-to-face meeting (scheduled and impromptu), and discussions about the schools’ rules, regulations, and policies. A maximum variation sampling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912437794">Patton, 2002</xref>) was also used to recruit participants. We sought diversity in the number of years that school personnel worked at the school; five school personnel had worked at the school fewer than 5 years and five school personnel had worked at the school 5 years or more. School personnel participants held a variety of positions at EPH, including assistant principal, teacher, counselor, social worker, and security guard. Four parents with above average students (GPA &gt; 3.0), four parents with below average students (GPA &lt; 2.0), and seven parents with average students (GPA = 2.0-2.9) were selected. Parent participants included biological parents, adopted parents, and grandparents raising their adolescent grandchildren as well as single and married parents.</p>
<p>Fifteen parents of high school students and 10 high school personnel participated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085912437794">Table 1</xref>). Participants were mostly female and African American. Participants’ ages ranged from 24 to 62 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 41; <italic>SD</italic> = 10). The highest level of education of all participants ranged from some high school (8%) to graduate school (28%). Although most parents (67%) reported a household income of less than $30,000, most school personnel (60%) reported household income above $60,000.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The first author, an African American woman in her mid-20s, obtained approval to conduct this study through her home institution’s institutional review board and the school district’s Office of Research, Evaluation, and Accountability. Following approval, participants were recruited through a variety of mechanisms, including attending school events, attending school governance meetings, and snowball sampling. A screening tool was used to ensure that school personnel met the criterion to participate. If eligible, contact information was obtained so that a time and location for the interview could be scheduled. Written consent was obtained from participants on the day of their interview.</p>
<p>All interviews were conducted by the first author, completed between September and December 2008, and occurred at a location and a time convenient for participants (e.g., participants’ homes and school classrooms). Interviews ranged from 16 to 87 min. Each interviewee was compensated with a $25 Visa gift card on completion of the interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042085912437794">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Two semistructured interview protocols (i.e., one for parents and one for school personnel) were developed. The protocols had four sections that asked participants about (a) their personal history, (b) their conceptualizations of parental involvement, (c) home–school interactions, and (d) strengths and weaknesses of home–school communication. The protocols were piloted on a high school teacher and parent of a high school student not affiliated with EPH. The interview protocols were revised after they were piloted and as data were collected and analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437794">Creswell, 1998</xref>). The final interview protocols each consisted of 19 questions. For the purposes of this study, questions regarding the conceptualizations of parental involvement among inner-city parents were the focus. Sample interview items include, “What does parental involvement mean to you?” and “What kinds of things do parents do that schools may not recognize as parental involvement?” Participants also completed a brief questionnaire assessing participants’ demographic information, such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, family structure, and educational level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0042085912437794">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis occurred simultaneously with data collection. An inductive approach was used to analyze data, in which study findings emerge from the data and through the researcher’s interactions with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912437794">Patton, 2002</xref>). The audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim. The first author verified all transcripts against the original audiotapes to ensure that the transcripts were accurate. Transcripts were imported into a qualitative software program, NVIVO (QSR International Pty Ltd, Version 8.0, 2006), to assist in data analysis.</p>
<sec id="section10-0042085912437794">
<title>Coding process</title>
<p>Codes were developed during transcription and combined to create a preliminary coding manual. These codes served as descriptive codes, which provided attributes to clusters of text and entailed little interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912437794">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). As knowledge and familiarity of the dynamics of parental involvement at the school increased, interpretive codes were assigned to the data. Interpretive codes reflect the complexity of the context and are categorized with other sections of text that have similar meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912437794">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). The unit of analysis was each participant’s response to a question.</p>
<p>Through the continual process of coding, descriptive and interpretive codes were collapsed with other similar codes, certain codes were expanded to include a broader range of ideas, irrelevant codes were eliminated, and new codes emerged. Once descriptive and interpretive codes were refined, the relationships between the codes were examined through the process of pattern coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912437794">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Pattern codes were developed later in the course of data collection as patterns became clearer. All participant interviews were used to develop the coding manual and achieve a consensus of the ideas presented.</p>

<title>Evaluating the trustworthiness of qualitative findings</title>
<p>Four techniques were employed to augment the credibility of findings. The goal of this process is to ensure that the interpretations of the researcher reflect the perspectives of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912437794">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912437794">Toma, 2006</xref>), which included prolonged engagement, journaling, peer debriefing, and member checking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437794">Creswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912437794">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). A second coder was used to check the consistency of coding. The joint coding was geared toward listening to the words of the respondents together and arriving at a consensus of understanding the ideas presented. When the coders disagreed about the codes for a section of data, they resolved the disagreements by discussing the disputed text until consensus was reached about the codes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to understand the ways in which adults affiliated with a predominantly African American inner-city high school interpret the meaning of parental involvement and uninvolvement. Based on the analysis of in-depth interviews with parents and school personnel, we report the findings related to this aim below.</p>

<title>Meanings of Parental Involvement</title>
<p>The meaning of parental involvement to parents and school personnel in this predominantly African American inner-city high school reflected activities both in and outside of school. Participants agreed that parental involvement was as much the responsibility of the parent as it was of school personnel. Five major themes emerged regarding the meaning of parental involvement at this school: <italic>Participation at School, Being There Outside of School, Communication, Achieve and Believe</italic>, and <italic>Village Keepers</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085912437794">Table 2</xref> lists the frequency with which participants discussed each emergent theme.

<title>Participation at school</title>
<p>Both parents and school personnel argued that it was important for parents to have a physical connection with the school because it allowed them to better understand their child and their child’s high school experience. Examples of parental participation at school included picking up their child’s report card, impromptu visits to monitor their child, being a chaperone on a field trip, attending extracurricular events, and visiting to talk to school personnel. As one parent noted,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Actually, when I’m up here I always go and check on them in class, make sure they ain’t doing nothing, make sure they’re in class for one. I mean that’s just me . . . I always try to stay involved with my kids. (Parent No. 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another reason that parental participation at school was considered to be an important aspect of parental involvement is that it serves as an accountability tool. When parents visit the school, they talk with teachers one-on-one or in groups about their child, participate in decision making, and monitor their child’s behavior. All schools in this district have a local school council whereby an elected group of parents, teachers, and community members make executive decisions for the individual schools. This decentralized governance structure both empowers and informs some parents as they have a firsthand account of the operation of the school. Conversely, school personnel also hold parents accountable for their role in a student’s education when they have face-to-face interactions. A participant who had worked at EPH for fewer than 5 years framed it this way:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think parents should want to look at it like an investment. If I put my money in the bank, I’m going to check on my money . . . So I think this is the kind of attitude you have to have with your child in school. I need to check some things out, so I may be in for a visit. I may not schedule a visit, I may need just come in and check it out maybe just walk the halls and see what the atmosphere is like. Peek my head in the classroom to see if they are on task. Are there expectations? Are they being upheld? (School Personnel No. 4, 2 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similar to the presence of a customer at a financial institution, parental presence at school creates a checks and balances system that otherwise might not exist.</p>
<p>In some cases, parental participation at school permitted school personnel to perform their jobs more efficiently. For example, the attendance office at EPH is often overwhelmed with addressing and dealing with student absences. A program officer who had worked at the school for more than 5 years discussed how parent volunteers assisted the attendance office in addressing student absences:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I know two parents right now that are working through the No Child Left Behind program and volunteering time getting the students who have yet to enroll in school and we’ve been in school 4 weeks. They’re going out within community and they’re going out and find out where missing students are because our enrollment has a big hole in it right now. We are missing 83 students. Next week we are going into our 5th week of school and these students still have not reported. So these parents have gone out into the community and have gone door to door to these students, to see if they’ve moved or whatever the case may be. (School Personnel No. 6, 14 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this example, parents who committed time to gathering students who had not yet enrolled allowed school personnel in the attendance office to focus on the attendance issues of the students who were enrolled. School personnel also stated that parents who volunteer were not only valued but also immensely helpful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085912437794">
<title>Being there outside of school</title>
<p>All participants discussed the importance of being physically and emotionally available to students outside of school. Both parents and school personnel acknowledged that a parent’s presence outside of school can be equally, if not more, beneficial to a child’s academic achievement. Parental presence outside of school was composed primarily of four ideas: basic needs, family activities, educational assistance, and life lessons. Although physical items (e.g., computers, uniform accessories and allowances) were important, students were also influenced by the knowledge and values instilled in them at home.</p>
<p>Parents contended that ensuring students are properly cared for at home is an important aspect of parental involvement. From their perspective, students with a home, food, clean clothes, concerned parents, and access to transportation to school are advantaged because they are prepared and ready to learn with comfort when they attend school. As one parent noted,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Bein’ involved, makin’ sure she has the things for school that she needs, makin’ sure she bein’ there every day on time and you know, she gettin’ her proper rest. Not material, just makin’ sure that, you know, she basically has a clean uniform for attending school and things like that. She got her books and paper all, you know, school supplies she need for school. I make sure so that she can be prepared, ready to go to school and learn . . . Clean shoes, clean uniform. So she won’t be picked on. (Parent No. 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents and school personnel agreed that students who have their basic needs met are more likely to come to school on time, which they considered to be less common among students who have less stable homes.</p>
<p>Once basic needs are provided, parents noted that it is important to devote time to participating in family activities with their children to foster bonding. For example, in response to what parents might do at home or outside of school to participate in their child’s education, a single mother stated,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Care for them, feed them, take them out to trips because I take my kids to Walt Disney World almost every year. We’ll go to Great America on Halloween. We do a lot of activities together. Family nights, picture days, as a family, yeah we do a lot. (Parent No. 21)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Five parents (33%) discussed traditions they have in their families (e.g., cooking, baking, and going shopping together) designed to keep them connected. Participants believed that these activities served as a means to create an open and trusting relationship between parents and children.</p>
<p>Most parents (80%) also stated that their involvement activities outside of school were educational in nature (e.g., buying computers/programs for students to complete school projects, driving students to the library to do Internet research). Eighty percent of school personnel also argued that the easiest and most logical way that parents are involved at home is by checking or pretending to check their child’s homework. Although most parents (67%) stated that they helped or tried to help their child with homework, they often were unable to do the work because of their lower educational levels. Recognizing their limited abilities in a particular subject, these parents took the extra effort to find tutors, mentors, and workbooks to assist their child. For example, a single mother whose son attends the school stated,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah the work is harder to me and it’s different. And some of the stuff that he brings home I’m trying to figure it out. Or maybe I’ll put him on the computer or something. I’ll put him in the car sometimes and take him to my uncles. My uncle is really, really smart. For the most part, the homework. (Parent No. 23)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to four parents (27%), parental involvement also comes in the form of equipping students with values and lessons that are applicable to school and life in general. These life lessons often included parents teaching their children about responsibility, accountability, independence, and budgeting. Many parents noted that it was important for children to know how to navigate the world outside of school as it is for them to succeed academically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085912437794">
<title>Communication</title>
<p>Participants discussed the need for standards, rules, and regulations. Two types of communication were discussed: (1) communication between adults and (2) children and communication among adults within the school. The ways in which parents disciplined their children and conducted themselves at the school were important aspects of communication. Participants who discussed communication between adults and children believed that it was the responsibility of parents to discipline students and acknowledged that discipline could be in the form of corporal punishment, negative reinforcement (e.g., nagging students about doing better in class and ending the nagging when performance improves), as well as other forms of punishment (e.g., not allowing child to drive or taking away the child’s iPod). According to a parent with two sons,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am not a parent that believes spanking is the only way to get a kid’s attention. In this day of computers, TVs, I pods, MP3 players all that good stuff oh and DVD players I mean I have a world of resources that I can take away. I am one of those parents that if you do something, when you walk in the house I am going to be jamming to your stuff . . . They hate that. There is more than one way to discipline a child. Taking the phone you know. I love doing things like that. I am also a parent who is strict disciplinarian, your time is structured; it belongs to me. (Parent No. 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Three school personnel (30%) and a parent stated that some students are eager for attention from school personnel because they lack structure and discipline at home. All 20 participants (80%) who discussed discipline as a component of parent–child communication believed that students not only benefited from firm discipline but also craved the structure provided by such relationships with parents and school personnel. It is not surprising then that three parents (20%) also felt that schools should be allowed to expand the ways in which they penalize bad behaviors at school so that the behavior is punished but students’ educational progress is not hindered. For example, instead of out-of-school suspensions, parents argued that in-school suspensions, community service, or even corporal punishment should be used for students who misbehave. Out-of-school suspensions place students at an academic disadvantage as the students are absent from class during valuable instruction time.</p>
<p>In regard to communication between adults, relative to parents, school personnel discussed more of the appropriate rules, guidelines, and procedures that school personnel and parents should abide by when interacting at school. School personnel believed parents should expect that teachers’ primary aim is to teach their child. In an effort to meet the demands of parents and the profession of teaching, three teachers (30%) said it was important to have a syllabus that outlined the learning objectives, assignments, and any other information related to the class. These teachers asked students to take the syllabus home and share it with their parents because it functioned as a contract between the home and school.</p>
<p>Along with written school expectations, participants who discussed parent–school personnel communication also believed that there was an appropriate manner in which students and parents interact with school employees. During interactions, all parties are expected to listen to the other person, keep an open mind regarding a situation, and refrain from demeaning remarks toward one another. Use of profanity, unfounded accusations, and violence were most frequently mentioned as inappropriate behaviors of parents, students, and school personnel. Participants believed that the interactions between parents and school personnel modeled the ways in which students should interact at school.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If the student is disruptive behavior wise or something, sometimes you can tell when a parent comes up, because they act the same way. If you got a student that’s clowning and cursing and stuff, the parent come up and they’re mad. I say 9 out of 10 times the parents is acting the same way. (Parent No. 8)</p>
<p>So that’s just how it works. There was no attacking me. More or less, the parent was taking responsibility for her own child. It went well. (School Personnel No. 14, 2 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, students tended to mimic their parents’ appropriate and inappropriate behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0042085912437794">
<title>Achieve and believe</title>
<p>As parents discussed their hopes and dreams for students, and over half of them trusted that God’s plan would supplement their aspirations for their child’s future. Participants described parental aspirations as academic, personal, and professional goals that parents have for their children. Although nearly all parents (93%) discussed aspirations for their children as an important component of parental involvement in their child’s education, less than half of the school personnel (40%) discussed parental aspirations. One school personnel noted,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>So I think to some degree the expectation of grades and how hard a kid tries and what they are planning to do in the future, that all comes from what happens at home. (School Personnel No. 15, 5 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents said that they usually verbalized their aspirations to their child in conversations about school and in casual conversations about others who have become successful. A parent discussed Oprah Winfrey to encourage her grandson to do well in school and communicate her aspirations for his success.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I say now, we’re gonna use Oprah Winfrey as an example. You know what I’m talking about? I said she went through all that stuff. But she loves to read. I said education will get you where you need to go. I said she loves her education. She got reading. She’s got education. She got college. Then she went to a radio station. Now look where she’s at. Now you can do the same thing. (Parent No. 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents who discussed their aspirations for their children stated that they hoped their children will graduate from high school and be happy in life. Ten parents (67%) said that they wanted their children to attend at least 1 year of college. Five parents (33%) discussed actual careers (e.g., judge, chef, veterinarian, police officer) that they hoped for their children.</p>
<p>In addition to parents’ verbal aspirations, eight parents (53%) also believed that the presence of God, religion, or spirituality in their child’s life would increase the probability that their child would achieve their educational and career goals. When asked about her aspirations for her grandson, a grandmother stated,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>To grow up and be a productive human being in society. That’s the expectation. And to be educated. Education is so important. And he is one of those children that I know can become educated and keep it. The first thing with [grandson] is to, I want him to focus on being a Christian, and let the Lord guide him, and he’ll be fine. Academically, he’ll be fine if he put God first, and job, family comes next after that, then a job. (Parent No. 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Four parents also discussed regular church and Bible study attendance, as well as time set aside at home for them and their children to read the Bible. Parents believed these activities had a positive effect on students’ academic performance, behavior, and morals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0042085912437794">
<title>Village keepers</title>
<p>Fifteen participants (60%) discussed their role as surrogate parents who care for or provide for others’ children. These participants described feeding their children’s friends, allowing other students to live with them, being a listening ear to students whose parents have addictions, raising their grandchildren, and offering emotional and academic support to students in the absence of parental involvement. Participants acknowledged that resources were sometimes not available to all students. As a result, it was necessary for them to extend themselves and their resources to students who have less. For example, two participants talked about attending to the needs of children that were not their own,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Even though I don’t have a child in this school, every kid in this building is considered a child of mine and I have a vested interest in every child in this building. I want them to have the same rights and opportunities as other children do. I treat them if like they were my own child. (School Personnel No. 7, 24 years at EPH)</p>
<p>I took him and a couple of his friends and they all got their license. So they can drive. They will always remember that. And one of the kids told me that. “You know what Ms. [Parent], I will always remember you took me to get my license.” So that’s some of the things that I get involved in and sometimes the parent can’t do. I take up some of the slack. Like they say “it takes a village to raise a child.” (Parent No. 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Participants cited two primary reasons to helping other children besides their own: (1) parents and school personnel wanted the teens to have a better high school experience than what was offered at their homes and (2) parents were comforted in knowing and helping the people with whom their children associates.</p>
<p>In addition to parenting, participants discussed the role of keeping students safe. All of the school personnel and most of the parents who discussed safety on and around school property noted that fights on school property or near school property were a normal occurrence. Hence, it was necessary for parents and school personnel to commit themselves to walking the halls and preventing disputes to ensure that students were not harmed. Two parents discussed the school’s security measures designed to ensure that fights and other forms of violence were limited. These measures included metal detectors, security guards, and cameras throughout the building.</p>

<sec id="section19-0042085912437794">
<title>Descriptions of Uninvolved Parents</title>
<p>Parents and school personnel provided similar descriptions of what parental uninvolvement meant, which often led to person-centered descriptions about uninvolved parents. Three themes emerged to describe uninvolved parents: <italic>unconcerned parents, busy parents</italic>, and <italic>previously involved parents</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085912437794">Table 2</xref> lists the frequency in which participants discussed each theme. Each theme is discussed in detailed below.</p>
<sec id="section20-0042085912437794">
<title>Unconcerned parents</title>
<p>The general depiction of an unconcerned parent was a mother who did not care and was unconcerned about her child’s attendance or performance at school. Unconcerned parents were also characterized as having low expectations for their children and being indifferent toward the overall well-being of their child.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We haven’t seen you [parents] since you put the kid in the building, but now you want to raise a hundred dollar worth chaos about why your kid is not graduating. We’ve had all types of report card pick-ups that you could have attended, meetings that we’ve sent out notices for you to attend, and we’ve never seen you. Even during the course of the child’s high school years, they’ve been in a little, some of them may have been in a little trouble, never seen you. They sent for you, never seen you. (School Personnel No. 7, 24 years at EPH)</p>
<p>An uninvolved parent, you try to reach the parent, and the parent is not coming to report card pick up. Not even trying, you’ve made several calls, and trying to get in touch with them, no connection whatsoever. (Parent No. 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Half of the school personnel and one third of parents also believed that this type of uninvolved parent used the school as a babysitting service, had a substance abuse problem, or were unemployed.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like the parents are all on public aid and come in with attitudes. “I’m sitting at home watching my soap operas.” You sitting home taking my taxpaying money and you’re not doing nothing! You don’t have an hour that you can donate to watch the children play at school or partake or help. They don’t even partake in their own child’s education! (Parent No. 12)</p>
<p>The whole thing with the parents, it’s cumbersome not knowing and using the school system as a babysitting service . . . A lot of [parents] need a break and that break they get is when the child is at school. So that is when we become the babysitting service. They had to stop what they were doing whatever it may be to discipline. (School Personnel No. 10, 4 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One parent who participated in this study would be considered an <italic>unconcerned parent</italic> according to the above descriptions. She reported that she rarely attended school events (e.g., less than once a year). She did not work and had less than a high school education. Her child failed every class and was absent nearly every day of the current marking period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0042085912437794">
<title>Busy parents</title>
<p>Interview data revealed that some parents may have wanted to participate in their child’s education, but often there were activities at home or away from school that consumed parents’ time. More parents discussed the burden of other parental obligations as a reason for uninvolvement than school personnel. Of the participants who discussed this theme, most stated that employment was the primary task that consumed parent’s time and prevented them from being more involved in their child’s education.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of them [parents], they work. And they don’t get off until 6:30 p.m. They start at 6 or 7 and they don’t come home til 6 or 7. It’s like real difficult to come up to the school. (Parent No. 3)</p>
<p>When they have their teacher’s meeting or when parents can come up to the school, it’s always during the day. Well I work in the daytime so it’s not like I don’t want to partake. I just can’t miss work. I’m their sole support. (Parent No. 12)</p>
<p>Parents are busy. Parents sometimes have two jobs or three jobs sometimes they don’t see their kid because they go to their second job before the kid gets home . . . They are trying. They can’t miss work or they get fired. If they get fired then who’s gonna pay the bills? (School Personnel No. 15, 5 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents who work may have difficulty not only participating in their child’s education at school, but also participating in their child’s education at home because their work schedules do not allow them to be at home when their children are also home.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>For a parent that has six kids, depending on their age, they have babies to get together, they have kids to drop off at the elementary school, drop kids off at the high school, they are preparing themselves for work. They may not be able to have as much parental involvement as a parent with two children. (School Personnel No. 11, 7 years at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although both parent and school personnel participants acknowledged that many parents spent considerable time working, they also discussed other activities that limited parents’ participation in their child’s education. These activities included substance abuse problems, additional child care responsibilities, and partner/spousal preoccupation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0042085912437794">
<title>Previously involved parents</title>
<p>Participants also described the types of parents who were once involved, but who eventually became uninvolved parents because the situations with their child and the school were consistently negative. Three school personnel believed that some parents tried very hard and were diligent in trying to help their children, but their efforts seemed to go nowhere; their children continued to perform and behave poorly and in some cases became worse over time. A school employee who has worked at EPH for a year related this story regarding this type of parent,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The parent says “Baby I am tired. You do what you want to do. Send him over to 100 S. Homan [location of district police office] or 26th and California [location of county jail].” They say that. That doesn’t mean at some point in their child’s life, they weren’t involved. It just means at this point I am exhausted and I can’t be involved because my feeling, my physical, emotional, whatever . . . I can’t deal with it because I’m drained . . . So the ones that never see and they have history and they have baggage as to why you don’t see them. (School Personnel No. 19, 1 year at EPH)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a result of some parents’ exhaustion and frustration, their involvement in their child’s education halted as neither their child’s behavior nor their grades improved. One parent, who participated in this study, might be representative of this form of uninvolved parent. She reported that she did not participate in her child’s education because her presence did not seem to help his behavior or performance. Her child was suspended several times and also performed poorly academically.</p>
<p>Furthermore, parents also seemed to decrease their involvement in their child’s education at school when they viewed the school as unhelpful or unorganized. Rather than having direct and clear procedures, three parents (20%) and two school personnel (20%) said that parents were misguided and often sent from one person to the next with no resolution. The parents who endorsed this theme reported spending several hours, in person or on the phone, attempting to express their concerns with no eventual conclusion. They also noted that often parents were asked to wait or they were sent to another person who may have more information regarding the parent’s issue or the authority to respond to the parent’s request. A mother discussed her efforts in trying to have her child’s schedule changed and the frustration it caused her,</p>

<p>Each person that I talk to, “oh well we can take care of that, we can do this. All you need to do is go see so and so.” And then when I do that, “oh yeah we can take that and you just need to see so and so.” And I’m just going around, and nothing is being done. So that’s kind of aggravating. (Parent No. 16)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these types of interactions led some parents to feel confused and frustrated and eventually become uninvolved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The majority of prior research on parents’ perceptions of parental involvement in their children’s education has been conducted with pre–high school students and not exclusively inner-city samples. The present study explored these similarities as well as differences in perspectives of parental involvement and uninvolvement between parents and school personnel within the context of an inner-city high school. By interviewing participants, this study incorporated an often overlooked and understudied perspective into the existing literature.</p>
<p>Study results revealed that although existing models of parental involvement are useful in understanding parental involvement at a predominantly African American high school, no single model encompasses the meaning of parental involvement for those within this setting. More specifically, the findings of the current study provide support for four of the six categories outlined by Epstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912437794">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912437794">2001</xref>), namely Parenting (Being There Outside of School Theme), Communicating (Communication Theme), Volunteering (Participation at School Theme), and Learning at Home (Being There Outside of School and Achieve and Believe Themes). While not covered by Epstein’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912437794">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912437794">2001</xref>) model, the theme of Village Keepers is observable in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437794">Eccles and Harold’s (1993)</xref> broader framework of parental involvement that includes neighborhood factors such as social support, and cohesion in its attempt to explain parental involvement. Furthermore, results on the types of uninvolved parents provide additional understanding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437794">Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler’s (1995)</xref> assertion that parents’ choices to be involved in their child’s education is influenced by time, energy, and skill demands (Level 2 of model).</p>
<p>According to study results, parents and school personnel all agreed parental participation at school and outside of schools were definitive markers of parental involvement. However, parents and school personnel differed on their endorsement of other forms of parental involvement as well as their descriptions of uninvolved parents. On one hand, a larger percentage of parents endorsed safety precautions as forms of parental involvement than school personnel. On the other hand, school personnel more frequently discussed the importance of communication between the home and school than parents. This finding is consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912437794">DeMoss and Vaughn (2000)</xref> who found that although parents with young school-age children agreed that parental presence at school is considered parental involvement, they also acknowledged other ways that parents are involved that are rarely discussed by researchers and school personnel.</p>
<p>Another relative value difference between parents and school personnel emerged around the theme <italic>Achieve and Believe</italic>. More than school personnel, parents believed that parental aspirations and spirituality played an important role in the decision to be actively involved in a child’s education. Consistently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085912437794">Smith (2009)</xref> found that low-income African American parents often used narratives of struggle to motivate their children and used maps that charted the course to high school completion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912437794">Jacobs and Harvey (2005)</xref> also found that parental expectations of their child’s educational attainment made the strongest unique prediction of academic achievement.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ways in which school personnel interacted and communicated with parents also played a role in the level in which parents participated in their child’s high school education. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912437794">Schecter and Sherri (2009)</xref> noted that both teachers and parents acknowledge benefits to opening lines of communication between and building a community among school personnel and families, the relative value placed on these efforts continue to differ. Findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912437794">Overstreet, Devine, Bevans, and Efreom (2005)</xref> suggest that school receptivity was the strongest predictor of parental school involvement within a sample of economically disadvantaged African American parents. Therefore, parents who believe that the school does not want them to be involved are likely to be less involved. Clearly, the findings of this study contribute to the growing body of literature that documents the subtle differences in the importance of different activities associated with parental involvement by incorporating evidence from an inner-city high school.</p>
<p>In defining parental involvement, participants also described parental uninvolvement. Consistent with previous literature accusing poor, single mothers of being bad mothers, lazy, and long-term abusers of welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912437794">Berrick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912437794">Roberts, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085912437794">Solinger, 1999</xref>), participants provided a similar description of uninvolved parents who were unconcerned. Participants also suggested some parents want to be involved but do not have the time. Furthermore, both parents and school personnel recognized that some parents were uninvolved only after their initial involvement efforts had not produced the desired results. Perhaps providing additional home involvement by school personnel that addresses basic family needs, create cultures that believe parents care, and builds trust might shed light on the contributions of seemingly uninvolved parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912437794">Archer-Banks &amp; Behar-Horenstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912437794">López, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although characteristics of the uninvolved parent were discussed by nearly all participants, it is likely that participants were not fully aware of the circumstances that influenced these uninvolved parents. For example, some parents may be incarcerated or disabled. In their absence at school, uninvolved parents cannot defend themselves, their voices remain unheard, and their efforts continue to be unsupported. More deliberate approaches that give these parents meaningful roles, educate them on how to comprehend school information, keep them informed, and develop collaborative structures and inviting parents to participate as decision makers might increase participation among these seemingly uninvolved parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437794">Abrams &amp; Gibbs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437794">Eccles &amp; Harold, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912437794">Jeynes, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several strengths to note. This is one of few studies to address the conceptualizations of parental involvement within the context of an exclusively inner-city predominantly African American high school sample. In addition to highlighting this unique context, this study also included multiple perspectives about the phenomenon of parental involvement. Whereas previous studies typically included responses solely from teachers, principals, or parents, this study included the perspectives from a variety of adults who play a role in the home–school relationship. Still, this study was not without limitations. Given that all of the participants were recruited from parents who had interactions with the school, the perspectives of the least involved parents were not represented. Future researchers should consider including a broader range of perspectives, such as those of students and parents who rarely are present at school, and using other methodologies to study the meanings of parental involvement and uninvolvement at the high school level as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912437794">Gregory (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>Study findings imply that designing interventions that aim to synchronize parents’ and school personnel’s value judgments on certain activities related to high school students’ education may be worthwhile. Not only do parents and school personnel need to have similar meanings of parental involvement, but it is also important that they value each belief to the same extent. This would ensure that both the message and magnitude of the message are consistent across the home and school settings, which, in turn, might yield greater student success. Schools aiming to be effective in working with its parents might also consider offering classes on poverty and privilege to faculty and staff. Having a clear understanding of the needs and strengths of the community may help school personnel view their students and their students’ parents in the context of other issues (e.g., safety and provision of basic needs) that might be prioritized before education.</p>
