<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the common omission and/or obfuscation of men in accounts of crime and particularly accounts of violence, despite the overwhelming presence of men in violent activities and, indeed, crime per se. In doing so it identifies key themes that frame masculine identities. Using the case of Raoul Moat, the piece analyses the discourses available in British newspapers to account for male violence. Raoul Moat killed one man, injured his ex-partner and a police officer and finally shot himself dead in the Northumbrian wilderness. Whereas most accounts of male violence blame ‘bad’ women, race, youth, terror, gangs and madness, here news stories evoked different tales of domestic, institutional and elemental masculinity. The themes of those tales, we argue, constitute broad contexts for constructing masculine identities and our analysis offers new insights into how masculine identity is constructed through discourse and why violence is a significantly male-dominated activity; insights which address some of the lacks in current theoretical work on both masculinity and violence.</p>

<title>Introducing Raoul Moat</title>
<p>In July 2010 Raoul Moat shot and seriously injured his ex-partner and murdered her new boyfriend, whom he mistakenly thought was in the police force. On the following day he shot and blinded a police officer. Moat then went on the run ‘dressed for war’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010c</xref>) armed with shotguns and living rough in the countryside around Rothbury in Northumbria in the north-east of England. In response, police drafted in ‘160 firearms officers… reinforced by 38 specialists from the Metropolitan police CO19 unit’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010b</xref>). This force were armed with high velocity rifles, pistols, carbines, and, stun guns and equipped with 20 armoured 4x4 vehicles. On 10 July the 37-year-old nightclub doorman, body builder, steroid user, ex-prisoner, ‘self-styled commando’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010b</xref>), ‘husband’, father and son was surrounded by the police whom he loathed and blamed for ruining his life. He shot himself dead. Within hours a Facebook tribute page to him with 33,000 members was describing Moat as a legend and hero. For that week in July, Moat dominated journalism as his violence, passion, power and elusiveness satisfied every constituent of news values: it was the perfect crime story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741659012454124">Rowe, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>How such crime is reported to audiences matters because, for most people, most of the time, news is our only experience of, and means of constructing an opinion about, crime. The <italic>British Crime Survey</italic> recorded violent crime at just 872 acts per 100,000 of the population of England and Wales in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012454124">2009</xref>–10. Thus very few people actually experience violent crimes directly as victims, though some will of course bear witness to violence or have to deal with victim distress or harm. Moreover, violent crime is crime nearly always perpetrated by men; so news about violent crime necessarily invokes gendered discourses. For criminologists, like ourselves, involved in teaching and researching gender, crime and criminal justice, the Moat case was not just a crime news story; it was also an exemplar of the truism that men commit virtually all violent crime.</p>
<p>Criminologist David Wilson, writing in the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>, described Moat as a ‘violent narcissist’ obsessed with power and control, ‘who thought he was Rambo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741659012454124">Wilson, 2010</xref>). Indeed, Moat was an extremely violent man; the parallels with Rambo and some of the other ‘heroic’ Hollywood action men who occupy this film genre are uncanny and we address them in our analysis. The violence was horrific, brutal and utterly deplorable; he was rightly denounced and vilified. However, such press commentaries do not offer anything new to our attempts to understand the broader relationship between men, masculinity and violence. Despite the facade of novelty in Wilson’s explanation, he essentially drew on established discourses of individual psychopathology that some academic, media and political commentators make recourse to when trying to account for violence perpetrated by seemingly marginalised, ‘troubled’ men – commentaries that have been criticised in the relatively small body of work that looks at accounts of masculinity and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454124">Collier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741659012454124">Howe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454124">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). Such established commentaries tell us nothing about the processes that were undertaken by a powerful media which sought to locate Moat within publicly available discourses of masculinity that would render his subjectivity somewhat intelligible. We must peel away these recycled discursive layers of individual pathology, moral outrage and indignation at the abhorrent actions of a malevolent monster, ‘disentangle ourselves from the fascinating lure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741659012454124">Zizek, 2008</xref>: 1) of the horrifying violence, to access what lies behind the majority of crimes involving gratuitous violence: a heterosexual male body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454124">Collier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454124">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). It may be that as an individual this man had ‘a fear of not being loved, of being insignificant, of being disconnected’ (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012454124">Grahame, 2010</xref>), but that fear catapulted him into identity struggles that reveal much about what masculinity can mean today in the West.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the Moat case is interpretive readings of newspaper coverage during the period of July 2010, which covered the events as they were happening and their immediate aftermath. Like Greer and McLaughlin, our ‘intention is not to present an in-depth discourse analysis or content analysis of the full corpus… Rather we examine the dominant themes and patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012454124">Greer and McLaughlin, 2010</xref>: 1046) as identified in, brought to and elicited from readings of our sample. Clearly there are other texts we might have considered, such as the inquest transcript, but news about crime remains the means by which most of us know about crime, so our core sample is three very popular British daily newspapers, <italic>The Times, Daily Mail</italic> and <italic>Sun</italic>, and their Sunday equivalents. News as popular and pervasive has been explored by criminologists since the 1970s as actively constructive of crime. Here we retain that notion of construction but in relation to masculinity which, not inconsequentially, is overwhelmingly represented in criminality. We are primarily concerned with the presentation of the case in British newspapers through: journalists’ accounts, various opinion pieces and Moat’s self-narrative as it appeared and was presented to audiences. Consequently, our analysis occasionally slips between a focus on journalistic interpretations of Moat, including his psychology, biography and violence, and Moat’s own self-narration through his letters to the police. Our intention is not to attempt to psychoanalyse Raoul Moat but rather to use him and the events surrounding the case as a motif for revealing and assessing the masculinities discourses invoked, implicitly and explicitly, by the news stories: discourses which can only make sense to news readers because they resonate with broader cultural currencies and representational frameworks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012454124">Foucault (1979)</xref> argued that such discourses have implications for the constitution and government of subjects because they penetrate and permeate culture and consciousness. In Howe’s terms, by analysing news about Moat, we provide ‘a Gramscian and Foucauldian inflected critique of how men’s violence is spoken about in Western culture today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741659012454124">Howe, 2008</xref>: 16); which looks at discourse as both powerfully hegemonic and actively engaged with by the subject. In this way we can bridge the gap evident in much masculinity theory which, even recently, though acknowledging both ideology and lived experience as important to identity, either prefers the social structuration of identity in for example class relations, however mythic now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012454124">Winlow and Hall, 2009</xref>), or focuses on individual experience and psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741659012454124">Gadd and Jefferson, 2007</xref>). Moreover, we broaden the variables normally seen as key constructors of male identity in the literature such as age, race and class by identifying in the stories about Moat domestic, institutional and elemental narratives of masculinity. Analysing these narrative themes offers fresh insights into cultural models of masculinity in the West in the 21st century; into male violence; and into contemporary journalism.</p>

<title>Criminology and News</title>
<p>Moat’s story allows us access to contemporary motifs of masculinities because news anchors narrative in familiar conventions to enable audiences to make sense of events they do not personally witness. Such conventions are evident in many discourses but particularly clear in crime news which allows for playing out of familiar cultural myths of good versus evil, with resolutions normally including the victory of the hero and the vanquishing of the villain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741659012454124">Propp, 1968</xref>). Represented crime is popular. It thrills because it threatens – but only symbolically. By inducing imagined fear, it reassures the vast majority of any mass audience (the majority of whom will never be the victim of serious crime and especially not of serious interpersonal violence) of the rectitude and legitimacy of their safe and secure reality. Indeed, arguably, crime is news because its treatment <italic>evokes threats to but also re-affirms the consensual morality of the society</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741659012454124">Hall et al., 1978</xref>: 66). Crime has a particular salience for the media and a long history of academic research, whether fictional in film or soap opera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741659012454124">Osborne and Kidd-Hewitt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741659012454124">Gunter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741659012454124">Rafter and Brown, 2011</xref>) or factual as in the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454124">Chibnall, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741659012454124">Wykes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454124">Greer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012454124">Jewkes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741659012454124">Jones and Wardle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012454124">Greer and McLaughlin, 2010</xref>). Thus since the early 1970s criminologists have increasingly seen the news as salient to understanding ‘crime’ and even actively constructive of crime and attitudes to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741659012454124">Cohen, 1972</xref>). Less discussed is that most crime is committed by men and less theorised is that such crime news might also therefore be salient to understanding men and male behaviours.</p>
<p>Criminologists should also be interested in news because it is embedded in power. Whether commercially owned and/or state licensed and informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741659012454124">Franklin, 1997</xref>), it supplies audiences with everyday commentaries about crime. In addition, as most crime is committed by men it inevitably also supplies everyday commentary about men. Nonetheless, such crime often only becomes ‘hard’ news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741659012454124">Van Zoonen, 1998</xref>) when it involves unusual violence, sometimes gaining so much coverage that it makes the rare event of homicide or stranger rape appear frequent, normal and therefore ‘ordinary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741659012454124">Carter, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, real ‘ordinary’ gendered violence such as domestic abuse or sexual harassment barely feature as news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741659012454124">Stanko, 1990</xref>). Yet even in cases of violence, where perpetrators are virtually always male (91%, <italic>British Crime Survey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012454124">2009</xref>–10), masculinity per se is rarely foregrounded in discussions of the perpetrator while, if a woman is involved as perpetrator or victim, feminine motifs become a key trope of the discussion and object of blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454124">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). Instead, the maleness of crime generally gets systematically diffused by discussions of youth, race, urban, gang, sexual deviance or individual pathology in both popular and academic accounts. As an example, a major social research institution shows no panic or even curiosity or indeed recognition of maleness: in April 2004 there were ‘2,800 young people in custody. Of these only 138 were female’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741659012454124">ESRC, 2007</xref>). The masculinity of the offenders is not commented on at all.</p>
<p>In the Moat case, in a rural part of northeast England a mature, white, heterosexual Englishman had murdered one man and had attempted to kill another and a woman. But this denied journalists many of the usual explanatory frameworks for men’s violence – race, youth, gangs, terrorism. Faced with a crime news story <italic>par excellence</italic>, journalists first tried to focus on the one explanation left to them: ‘blaming women’. But journalists found it very difficult to make a convincing case for this. As a result, they invoked other narratives, overtly, to describe the unfolding crime story that, covertly, seem to us to describe masculine identity not as consistently determined by either biological traits or the roles and norms associated with them culturally, but rather as contextually invoked identity strategies. Those contextualities invoked in the news and in Moat’s life – most obviously <italic>domestic</italic>, but also <italic>institutional</italic> and <italic>elemental</italic> – offer some insights into the concept of masculinity; a concept that has been a site of debate in academia for decades. Yet it has only been barely or partially addressed within much of the discipline of criminology, despite the affiliation of men to crime.</p>

<title>Masculinities and Methods</title>
<p>Perhaps the most significant conceptualisation to emerge in the post-feminist period of the later 1980s was that of hegemonic masculinity. This developed as a challenge to the idea that men were uniformly powerful by applying a Gramscian critique to masculinity as intersected by race, class and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741659012454124">Connell, 1987</xref>) as well as relating to gender. Masculinity thus became ‘masculinities’ differently oriented to power at different stages of life, or according to sexuality, or race or age or economic power or myriad other variables. As social, emotional and symbolic practices evolve and change, so hegemonic masculinity must redo the ideological work necessary to reproduce and legitimate its power. Connell’s concept of hegemonic masculinity was arguably first applied to crime by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012454124">Messerschmidt (1993)</xref>. But it isolates certain traits of masculine identities – size, age, wealth, sexuality, race – as potentially both powerful and problematic for ‘others’ rather better than it helps explain crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454124">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). In 2005, Connell and Messerschmidt reworked the concept of hegemonic masculinity to argue: ‘“Masculinity” represents not a certain type of man but, rather, a way that men position themselves through discursive practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741659012454124">Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>: 840). Indeed, for Butler, ‘there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; … identity is performatively constituted by the very “expressions” that are said to be its results’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741659012454124">Butler, 1990</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>In the Moat case, such performances were dramatised in the theatre of the news to offer audiences familiar themes through which to interpret, overtly, the story of Moat as a crime of violence and, covertly, also telling stories of gender, rather differently than is usual in the news. Our goal for this article was therefore to try and identify and interrogate those popular discourses about male violence; not to critique newspapers’ crime reporting per se, which has been done copiously and thoroughly in recent years both quantitatively and qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741659012454124">Wykes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454124">Greer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012454124">Jewkes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741659012454124">Moore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012454124">Greer and McLaughlin, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741659012454124">2011</xref>), but to use newspapers as a literal medium to try and better understand the close affinity between masculinity and violence against both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012454124"><italic>British Crime Survey</italic>, 2009</xref>–10).</p>
<p>The case began on 3 July 2010 and Moat killed himself in the middle of the night of 10 July 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659012454124">BBC, 2011</xref>). As lecturers and researchers in the area of gender and crime, the authors agreed to collect news coverage contemporaneously and across the media but to make sure we also had a systematic collection of some of the newspaper titles. So <italic>The Times, Daily Mail</italic> and <italic>Sun</italic> and corresponding Sunday papers became our core data covering from 4 July until 12 July. Although this was just 24 newspapers, we found, like Greer and McLaughlin, ‘it [is] easier to theorise the 24/7 media sphere than to research it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012454124">2010</xref>: 1045). Our core sample contained vast quantities of column inches on Moat; in addition there were blogged comments via Facebook, all the other newspapers (on and offline local, national and global,) television, radio, letters, even e-mail discussions alongside of course face-to-face, texted, filmed and uploaded chat and opinion. Our plan was to pay homage to ‘research-led teaching’ by using students as first-strike analysts in a two-hour classroom setting in the first session of a Gender, Crime and Criminal Justice undergraduate module to try and identify and interpret terms, images, phrases, value judgements and stories that related to gender in these accounts of male violence. To do this we used the core sample newspaper articles distributed among 82 students. This sample gave some system to the primary analysis: each is the most popular newspaper of its type (quality, middlebrow and tabloid, respectively), each has a different audience demographic and they each fit ideologically into the centre conservatism that underwrites the current political climate in Britain (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741659012454124">Jones and Wardle, 2008</xref>: 61). The amount of coverage of extreme crime has been very well researched and theorised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741659012454124">Franklin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454124">Greer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741659012454124">Jones and Wardle, 2008</xref>) and our goal was not to replicate that kind of work on the press but to elicit the stories being told about men and violence via our student researchers’ interpretations and then further and deeper developed by ourselves. Our students’ analysis highlighted (literally on the original papers with coloured pens) terms, phrases, visuals, juxtapositions and narrative sections that indicated gendered interpretations and these were depicted at first randomly on the full lecture theatre width blackboard and then gradually connected together as recognisable thematic clusters. For example, <italic>children, home, mother, girlfriend, family</italic> were deemed related as ‘domestic’ labels and led us to explore the way in which masculinity was being framed domestically in these stories, allowing us to address the <italic>men</italic> so often missing from accounts of violence, wherever encountered, despite men’s dominance of actual violence.</p>
<p>The ontological power of such discourse is significant. In 1977, Barthes related language, story and subjective identity in a constitutive process. He saw the relationship between language, knowledge and subjectivity as operating ‘at a higher level than the language of the linguists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659012454124">Barthes, 1977</xref>: 83), as myth, metaphor, genre and narrative, which repeated in the daily news in its many different modern formats, provide a cognitive/cultural framework for interpreting the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741659012454124">Lévi-Strauss, 1958/1972</xref>). The news uses systematic narratives, like folk tales, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741659012454124">Propp (1968)</xref> demonstrated draw from a pool of essential items (villain-hero-lack-search-struggle-resolution-happiness). These are organised into a logical story and readily identifiable in the press, which often leads with the resolution as a headline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741659012454124">Wykes and Gunter, 2005</xref>). Narrative and myth work as <italic>naturally predictive</italic> devices for interpretation. The media buys into these discourses because they are familiar; they are our cultural capital. Such discourses are often intertextual; news, for example, relates to other arenas such as fairy stories, popular film or television fiction to offer sense-making paradigms for reality. The effect is powerful not least because a text may appear to be liberal, empathic, resistant and critical at the denoted or overt level but be working against those very positions connotatively. Thus, frequently, stories about male violence manage simultaneously to castigate the criminal while ignoring the ‘man’ and often blaming women, youth or race through very familiar myths of <italic>femme fatales</italic>, drugs or illegal immigrants. This crude alignment of problematic masculinity outside the mainstream (or indeed not addressed at all) not only continues stereotyping, prejudice and injustice but has distorted the very conceptualisation of masculinities.</p>
<p>Moat was a criminal but also a mainstream man, even an example of mostly ‘hegemonic’ masculinity: mature, white, working, heterosexual, fertile and physically fit. Moreover two of his three victims were male, so some of the usual accounting frames such as <italic>blame the woman</italic> for ‘disguising’ or ‘diverting’ men’s violence were difficult to make fit. Finally he committed suicide, an act of self-violation little analysed by media academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741659012454124">Wykes, 2010</xref>). The authors returned to the marked-up text and the retained mobile phone images of the blackboards in search of further themes that might supplement the domestic and reveal more motifs of explanation for male violence and identity. Curiously, the stories journalists told about Moat and his crime did reveal different motifs of masculinity from the usual ‘othering’ or ‘woman blaming’ accounts in crime news; motifs which offer insights into two other contexts constitutive of masculinity – institutions and nature (the <italic>elemental</italic>). With these three themes identified we clustered stories, and explored beyond our core newspapers into other newspapers and other media, to arrive at an empirically informed account of how discourse might both explain something of the subjectivity that informed Moat’s violence and also work constitutively culturally to reproduce gendered ideologies, that is, discourse constructs both the psycho and social of psycho-social theory. The three themes follow on from each other, broadly chronologically, but not always so, and some accounts continued all three threads. Here we try to analyse the significance of each sequentially: first the <italic>domestic</italic> assumptions common in male violence dominated; from about 6 July a close focus on what we call <italic>institutional</italic> stories emerges and finally, as Moat evades police in the Northumbrian countryside, we identify <italic>elemental</italic> man. Even though journalism explicitly about his ex-girlfriend could not find much to <italic>blame</italic> her for, she figures in the first discursive trope explored in this article and perhaps the most documented site of gender constitution: the domestic or familial.</p>
<sec id="section4-1741659012454124">
<title>Domestic masculinity</title>
<p>Normally our everyday notion of domestic life, and perhaps more crucially the role of heterosexual, paternal masculinity within the family, is seen, over and over and inter-factual/fictional-textually, as unproblematic, even when the evidence is to the contrary. Male violence is secure in the family, in the home, behind closed doors, because it is invisible and so symbolically and physically protected and kept secret. But in the Moat case his violence spilled over, from a history of violence against his ex-partner to the murder of her new partner, onto the streets, blinding a police officer, and then into the wilderness of Northumbria where he seemed prepared to take on an entire army of police. Nonetheless there is some evidence in the news accounts of the usual explanatory discourses for male abuse that attribute blame to the women in their familial lives, usually partners or mothers, showing what a powerful discursive resource, a first port of call, these are for representing gender. The most overt example is Moat’s own letter to the <italic>Sun</italic> newspaper that openly blames his ex-partner Samantha for his violence: ‘I never cheated on her, I wish she hadn’t on me. She pulled the trigger by doing so just as much as me’ (<italic>Guardian</italic>, 7 July <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741659012454124">2010</xref>). Yet even he struggles to adhere to this view, focusing much more attention on blaming the entire police force for his imprisonment for assaulting a child, rather than his own failings as a man. It is nowhere clear whether this was one of his own children but Moat implies it was, in the letter:<disp-quote>
<p>‘I guess I’ve finally lost it. I’m not on the run, I will keep killing police until I am dead. They took it all from me, kids, freedom, house, then Sam and Chanel. Where could I go from there? Obviously I have issues but I was pushed. I never beat my kids. They’ve hunted me for years, now it’s my turn.’ (<italic>Guardian</italic>, 7 July <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741659012454124">2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moat admitted in the same letter he had ‘a history of violence over an ex-partner’s bits on the side’ (<italic>Sun</italic>, 6 July 2010) and told a friend he wanted to scar Samantha Stobbart’s body to ensure she never wore a bikini, indicating the possessiveness and jealousy typical of a domestic abuser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741659012454124">Harne and Radford, 2008</xref>: 154). These representations of Moat’s own words indicate how discourses of domestic masculinity are both part of his subjectivity and fit the socio-cultural repertoire of news making.</p>
<p>Moat had met Stobbart when she was just 16 and he was 31, and the relationship was allegedly actually abusive. Moat had recognised his own problematic temper months previously and asked for psychiatric support: ‘Taped recordings Moat made with social workers and the police from July 2009 until about April of this year suggest he was becoming increasingly paranoid’ (<italic>BBC News</italic>, 15 July 2010). Indeed, Moat guarded his home with 26 CCTV cameras and frequently dressed in army-style clothing, suggesting a dangerous paranoia about protecting <italic>his</italic> home and family as well as identification with a very macho institution, the army. Moat was also facing custody battles with a previous partner, suggesting two relationships in serious trouble prior to the prison term. Despite this biography, and though Durham prison warned police three days before the killings that Moat was threatening to harm Stobbart, police failed to act. In Moat’s case his transgression of the domestic context to public and then rural space, and his victimisation of not just Stobbart but her partner (whom Moat believed was a policeman) and a further police officer, plus his threat to all police and the general public, shifted the boundaries of possible discursive paradigms. The usual blame attribution that constructs male violence as caused by women’s promiscuity, feminism, foreignness or failure as housewife or mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741659012454124">Wykes, 2001</xref>) does not work when, as well as domestic abuse, there are two shootings of men, the wholesale threat to kill all police officers and the terrorising of a whole rural community while living wild.</p>
<p>Looking for better interpretive frameworks to offer, but staying within the domestic/family narrative, journalists also focused on his childhood and his relationship with his mother. Again this entails blaming a woman for male crime but now the explanation is that male violence results from psychological damage due to poor mothering. Moat is described as estranged from his mother completely as a teenager, then turning up in 2007 and threatening to kill her. Her comment on his crimes, reported across the press, was that ‘he would be better dead’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010b</xref>). The press made much of Moat not knowing his real father, compliant with a frequent focus on single parents (women) as causal of male offending. His last comment was ‘I have no Dad and nobody cares for me’ (<italic>Sunday Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741659012454124">Swinford and Green, 2010</xref>). Like many children, he grew up with a stepfather he disliked but there seems little else in the actions of his mother to justify blame attribution by journalists.</p>
<p>The usual motif of making the maleness of offending invisible by blaming associated women is too weak here to be a convincing reason for Moat’s violences; but the very weakness of these domestic discourses is in itself revealing because it leaves interpretive space: if women (or youth, race, terrorists, gangs) can’t be blamed, who can? Moreover, if Moat himself struggled to blame his ex-partner(s) or mother it suggests a certain self-reflection or sensibility to his failure domestically, heterosexually, paternally and familially. The news stories reveal motifs of masculine identity that are very culturally familiar but have eluded him; he seems not to have been able to occupy meaningful masculine roles as a father, son or husband. The 26 CCTV cameras are indicative of how powerful those domestic discourses of masculinity are for male subjectivity, as audiences are shown his struggle to protect the home that is so symbolic of those roles. Moat is depicted as a man who did not fit <italic>domestically</italic>, however desperately he wanted to, and a man who knew he did not fit. These stories cannot identify Moat with <italic>normal</italic> domestic masculinity, the <italic>habitus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741659012454124">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>) of heterosexual masculinity; they represent a man who could not perform that gender role. Moat is depicted as alienated from it and angered by his exile. The news accounts not only reproduce very particular models of masculinity; there is evidence too that Moat subjectively struggled with heterosexual norms. There are clues in his rejection of his mother, his fathering of six children by at least three different women (<italic>Independent</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012454124">Brown, 2010</xref>), his abuse of partners, his obsession with his body and a recent claim from a man that he ‘had a four-year affair with the “butch” bouncer, who kept their liaisons quiet because he wanted to maintain his reputation as a “hardman”’ (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, 21 February <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741659012454124">2011</xref>). Moat was not a man who could be depicted as comfortably performing domestic masculinity.</p>
<p>So the domestic accounts of Moat in relation to his childhood, fathering and his adult relationships, although evident in the news, struggle to employ the common accounting paradigm of explaining male violence by blaming the women in his life. Yet the efforts of journalists to try to use them as accounting paradigms indicates how powerful narratives of family and domesticity are to the inscription of masculinity. Successful masculinity is often measured by the evidence of good, respectable, faithful femininity, while masculine failure is attributed to feminine failings; in both instances women are normally seen as responsible for male behaviours. Yet in Moat’s case, invoking these discourses describes a man humiliated by failure and rejection in family relationships, largely isolated from the norms of domestic masculinity, who seeks instead to gain respect through alternative motifs of masculinity. No longer able to access traditional, local, working-class male work such as mining and shipbuilding with its structures, institutions and cultures, Moat is reported as having sought to occupy himself in other areas supporting a strong masculine identity; areas all on the edge of legitimacy. He is described as building his body<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741659012454124">1</xref></sup> and working as a pseudo police officer on the doors of nightclubs. The news depicts efforts at criminal masculine credibility with drug sales and regular arrests, but no prosecutions, leading to suggestions he worked as a ’police informer’ (<italic>Independent</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012454124">Brown, 2010</xref>). Strong <italic>macho</italic> imagery of the SAS and survivalists, such as Bear Grylls, are invoked by allusions to him hunting and camping in the wild countryside of Northumbria. Thus we find in the news two further explanatory masculinity paradigms that both supplement the lacks in ‘domestic’ explanations to account for Moat and add interestingly to the suite of discourses inscribing masculinity in accounts of his relationship to very male institutions, and ultimately by aligning him to the elemental.</p>

<sec id="section5-1741659012454124">
<title>Institutional masculinity</title>
<p>Many major institutions are male dominated, particularly at more senior levels. In the police, prison service and judiciary, positions of power are most often occupied by male figures: and within the military and private security firms, there is often a specific working culture that reflects the qualities required to fulfil such roles. Courtenay even contends that institutional structures cultivate ‘stereotypical forms of gender enactments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741659012454124">Courtenay, 2000</xref>: 1394): gender both shapes and is shaped by the institutions it surrounds, to the extent that Connell recognises, ‘<italic>masculinity is an aspect of institutions</italic>, and is produced in institutional life, <italic>as much as it is an aspect of personality</italic> or produced in interpersonal transactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741659012454124">Connell, 1993</xref>: 602; original emphasis) and that there are three key institutions that are particularly important in organising gender – ‘the state, the workplace/labour market, and the family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741659012454124">1993</xref>: 602).</p>
<p>The existence of police cultures and their links to aspects of masculinity has long been recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741659012454124">Fielding, 1994</xref>) as have the masculine elements of the prison officer culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741659012454124">Crawley, 2004</xref>) and the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741659012454124">Hockey, 1986</xref>). The factor that connects these cultures, and differentiates them from other masculine cultures such as the prisoner culture, is that these institutions have legitimacy ascribed to their actions – men are able to enter these institutions and use their working identities as a means to ‘do gender’ legitimately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012454124">Messerschmidt, 1993</xref>). Various labelling means are used in order to differentiate these groups from other men who are not afforded this legitimacy, such as uniforms, badges, equipment, titles, respect and even weapons. Gendered legitimacy is afforded to these institutions through the means of cultural power, indeed <italic>‘</italic>the hegemonic definition of manhood is a man <italic>in</italic> power, a man <italic>with</italic> power, and a man <italic>of</italic> power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741659012454124">Kimmel, 1994</xref>: 125; original emphasis). Institutional identities and their associated masculinities, powers and legitimacies therefore have an aspirational quality to them – men are able to prove their masculinity by virtue of their location within this group affiliation. As in Remy’s discussion of the <italic>men’s hut</italic>, these are spaces where those males who have earned the right to call themselves <italic>men</italic>, or are in the process of attaining this emblem of privilege, gather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741659012454124">Remy, 1990</xref>: 46; original emphasis).</p>
<p>In addition, these groups are often permitted, by their very nature, to undertake acts of violence, which are deemed legitimate due to their state-sanctioned nature. Men who act violently without such state sanction are criminalised and policed by these very institutions. Messerschmidt recognises this as a result of the quest for masculine status where, without access to authoritative legitimate masculinity: ‘Particular types of crime can provide an alternative resource for accomplishing gender and, therefore, affirming a particular type of masculinity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012454124">1993</xref>: 84). In spite of this, however, the masculinity that such men achieve through illegitimate means is limited, in that institutionalised masculinity is often also valorised in social discourse. The police, armed forces, prison service and other such institutions of security and control are established for the protection of our democratic social values and norms, and provide safety and security, often at serious personal risk. Such institutional masculine identity is ascribed with images of legitimate manliness, toughness, bravery and heroism: images that resonate so strongly with masculine ideals that men unable to access them legitimately may emulate as closely as possible <italic>deviantly</italic>. Moat’s attempted alignment with valorised institutional masculinity – pseudo policing and pseudo special forces – can be seen both as indicative of the culturally available models of masculinity and the means through which he tries to offset his actual inadequate masculine identity: failed son, husband and father, ex-prisoner and illegitimately violent. The role of bouncer is afforded masculine status both legitimately in terms of being licensed to protect others in a group that, as Winlow describes, act as ‘gatekeepers to a thriving night-time economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741659012454124">2001</xref>: 100), and illegitimately through such individuals’ enhanced access to the mechanisms of criminality and violence. Yet even here the story of Moat is of failure to achieve even illegitimate status as his one crime is shown to be child abuse.</p>
<p>Reports of Moat and the army offered another model of masculinity and a further example of him trying to fit into the <italic>men’s hut.</italic> Even here, journalists report that Moat failed to make an impression due to his illegitimate status and lack of official membership, with one commentator – a former SAS member – stating with reference to Moat’s commando-like efforts that:<disp-quote>
<p>Moat, a steroid-abusing, violent thug, has no concept of that sort of lifestyle, however much he might fantasise about himself as a macho hard-man. And with special forces closing in, Moat will soon find himself a long, long way out of his depth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012454124">Ryan, 2010</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the final days of his life, motifs associated with Moat confirmed Connell’s observation that ‘it is common for different groups of men, each pursuing a project of hegemonic masculinity, to come into conflict with each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741659012454124">Connell, 1995</xref>: 215). Many accounts of Moat in the media referred to him in a militarist fashion: symbols of war were used throughout the manhunt, and Moat can clearly be seen to be aligning himself with military institutions through dress, indicating the role of discourse in relating the social to subjective identity. At one point, he is described, dressed in khakis, as looking as if he was in preparation for war (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454124">Jenkins and McIntosh, 2010</xref>), and his reported ability to evade police detection (who were out in large numbers, occupying both the ground and the skies through the use of helicopters) and his capacity to survive off the land with few provisions does indeed conform to the image of Moat as a ‘self-styled commando’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741659012454124">Jenkins, 2010</xref>). However, when juxtaposed against the police’s new technologies, his sawn-off shotgun may well have carried too many associations with the criminal realm to be successful in acting as a legitimate symbol of the war Moat is reported as openly threatening against police officers.</p>
<p>Such threats (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010d</xref>) are used in international conflicts to legitimate the use of lethal force. Moat was positioning himself as a combatant, not a criminal, showing a conflict of legitimacy between his sense of masculinity and the discursive frameworks of masculinity used to account for him. This conflict evokes myths of the antihero who loathes the authority that he emulates but is excluded from. Moat seems to have seen himself as the antithesis of the legitimate institutionalised heroic male and a <italic>true legend</italic> for taking a stand against the forces of law and order. Rather than address his own failings, Moat is shown blaming the police for undermining his identity rather than admitting him to their <italic>hut</italic>. He is also shown blaming Northumbria Police for his problems over access to his two daughters from a previous relationship, for his latest prison term, and mistakenly for the end of his relationship with Stobbart (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010c</xref>). The stories told about him show access to sources of masculine perfomativity finally closed off entirely, not only domestically but institutionally. Moat is shown isolated, literally outside like a wild animal.</p>
<p>The account in the news is of an ultimate conflict that leaves no place for such a man. Whereas domestic frameworks tend to blame women for men’s violence, the institutional account in the Moat narratives shows very clearly how masculinity is about men’s relationship to men. Such constructions show the importance of the state, the embodiment of socially legitimate male authority, in affording legitimacy to others’ masculine identities, most directly via law and policing. The ‘moatifs’ in the news support Kimmel’s contention that ‘masculinity is a homosocial enactment. We test ourselves, perform heroic feats, take enormous risks, all because we want other men to grant us our manhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741659012454124">Kimmel, 1994</xref>: 129). Subjective masculinity is thus predicated on the perceived actual power or potential power of other men. The close relationship between institutionalisation and state-granted legitimacy may be problematic for some men, whereby they are allowed and expected to act in a violent and dominant manner towards others within their working spheres, but are criminalised if they do so in the wrong context where their institutional label does not afford them protection. This illustrates the constructive subjective role of such discursive contexts which sees actors overstepping the (invisible) boundary into illegitimate displays of violence. Many accounts reinforced principles of legitimate masculine power as protective of us all but also illustrated the dangers of offering desirable models that are deeply destructive when inverted. Moat was effectively the ‘other’ side of the coin; the dark side of the mirror. As such, the pairing of the heroic male and institutional masculinity ultimately shapes masculine identity development per se.</p>
<p>The close relationship between institutions and the legitimate masculine performance makes any other form of acquiring an equally legitimate identity particularly difficult for those, like Moat, for whom access to non-physical spheres of masculine hierarchy are unavailable due to class, education or economic restrictions; in other words, those who would, a generation ago in North-East England, have been working-class men: miners, steelworkers and shipbuilders. Making sense of Moat in the news shifted between the domestic and institutional until stories of his emulation, exclusion and alienation from both tropes of legitimacy saw a further framework emerge, much less tangential to the ordinary masculinity of domesticity and work but nonetheless a place where even a man who has failed ordinarily can still strive for manliness and be accounted for in ways which progress masculine ideals, demonstrating that ‘though they may not always be handsome, men doomed to evil possess the manly virtues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741659012454124">Genet, 1965</xref>: 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1741659012454124">
<title>Elemental masculinity</title>
<p>In news about Moat we identified a third evocative narrative of such ideal virtues: what we refer to as elemental masculinity – a celebrated and idealised form of male identity that is culturally valorised and considered a genuine authentic representation of manliness. Elemental masculinity is closely aligned with nature and represented through images of the male as hunter, warrior and survivor, accomplished through heroic transcendence and triumph over adversity. Its embodiment is in brute physicality, prowess and muscular bodily forms, which display stoicism, fortitude, toughness, resilience and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>In a discussion of masculine subjectivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741659012454124">Jefferson (1994)</xref> uses the metaphor of ascending great heights to experience transcendence over extraordinarily difficult circumstances as the ultimate value of masculinity. Jefferson argues that, at the level of individual experience, few men ever fully engage with or achieve this model of masculinity. Experiencing transcendence and overcoming impossible odds and circumstances is embodied and eternalised in the male hero and displays of heroism which are replete in Western popular culture. Such displays are often manifested in a process of ‘morphology’ in which the hero undergoes tests, overcomes obstacles, emerging triumphant at the end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741659012454124">Sparks, 1996</xref>: 351). The achievement of heroic transcendence characterises the ‘<italic>Ideal Masculine Self’</italic> (author emphasis) internalised by men as an identity to be strived for, yet which is actually unachievable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741659012454124">Whitehead, 2005</xref>: 414). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741659012454124">Kimmel (1994)</xref> argues that masculinity is about fear – fear of being identified and exposed as feminine or unmanly by other men. Men feel powerless as their performance as a man is constantly subjected to scrutiny. One mode of attaining and demonstrating achieved manliness is through physical strength, the visible evidence of the <italic>alpha male;</italic> and this was, in many ways, all that was left for Moat in his final days and a central prop of the final discursive paradigm evident in the news.</p>
<p>Elemental masculinity is discursively closely tied to muscular bodily forms, particular physical qualities and challenging environments. The location of masculinity at the level of the body through its physical exertion and toils is discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659012454124">Carrington and Scott (2008)</xref>. They describe the ways in which the rural order and the masculine coalesce to produce idealised constructions of rural masculinity that valorise notions of the warrior, survivor and violence. Engaged in physically demanding manual work in which male bodies are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, rural masculinity displays brute physical strength, resilience and the ability to survive and master nature’s harsh conditions. Carrington and Scott argue that this form of masculinity is rapidly becoming a consumer product desired by other men who engage in outdoor survival pursuits to harness this constructed notion of manhood which is deemed authentic.</p>
<p>In industrial Britain, similar visceral cultures instilled in working-class men a durable habitus, characterised by ‘hardness’, mental and physical toughness, resilience, stoicism and fortitude. This is a set of qualities and dispositions deemed necessary to work in and survive the harsh conditions of heavy industrial production and extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741659012454124">Hall, 1997b</xref>). The un-reflexive and durable visceral habitus continues to be internalised by generations of working-class men firmly committed to its desired qualities of brute physicality, strength, toughness and idealised masculine performance and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741659012454124">Hall, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741659012454124">Hall and Winlow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012454124">Winlow and Hall, 2009</xref>). Yet in post-millennial Britain, men are often excluded from the institutions that ‘stage’ such performance: industry and allied trades unions which have all but disappeared in the de-industrialisation that epitomised the Conservative governments of 1979–97. Instead, men like Moat hover on the edges of remaining masculinising institutions like the police (bouncer/informer) and the army (camouflage/hiking/guns) and/or dabble with the illegitimate masculine identity offered by crime. When legitimate masculinity removed these from Moat through imprisonment, and could also be blamed by him for the collapse of his domestic life, aspiration turned rapidly to aversion and Moat turned to the skills of survival, strength, stalking, hunting and hiding. He made himself appear an <italic>elemental</italic> subject dressing himself literally in the clothes of the hunter. His look and his acts allowed journalists to draw on a whole further narrative of masculinity that is evident in factual and fictional popular culture, with characters such as survival experts Ray Mears and Bear Grylls, and perhaps the epitome of elemental man, Hollywood action hero Rambo.</p>
<p>After featuring in several films, the Rambo character has developed a long history and broad popular appeal, which makes him an ideal interpretive schema for news audiences. Like much of the action hero film genre, <italic>First Blood</italic>, the first instalment in the Rambo film series, contains a strong anti-establishment rhetoric, exploring themes of alienation, abandonment, individuality and vigilantism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741659012454124">Sparks, 1996</xref>). John Rambo, a highly trained soldier and Vietnam War hero, finds himself alone and a vagrant in a small US town after being abandoned by the state and removed from the institutional structure and regimes of the US army. The character’s brooding intensity, the scars on his body, his rough demeanour and muscular frame all serve as drastic contrasts to the quaint, small-town community backdrop of the piece. He soon attracts the attention of local police. After being subjected to unjustified police harassment and wrongful arrest, Rambo manages to escape custody and disappears into the nearby wilderness. Unsurprisingly the press readily drew on the Rambo myth to offer an explanatory framework for Moat.</p>
<p>Discarded by the civilising institutions that provided a role for him, Rambo, like Moat, returns to nature, becoming, essentially, a displaced ‘wild’ man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741659012454124">Sparks, 1996</xref>). With nature’s materials at his disposal combined with his survival training, he is in his <italic>element</italic>, blending seamlessly into the mountainous woodland environment. Despite being outnumbered, against seemingly impossible odds, Rambo continues to evade capture. Finally finding himself cornered at the end of the film, Rambo surrenders at the behest and under the protection of his former army mentor, emerging heroically to an audience of police officers and soldiers with his ‘masculinity undeniably reconfirmed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012454124">Brown, 2002</xref>: 135); a typically happy ending reaffirming masculine ideals on both sides of the legitimacy coin, a fairytale ending that was unavailable in Moat’s story.</p>
<p>Aspects of the elemental as a particular trope of masculinity are present in the case of Moat. Depictions of his extreme violence, of his declaration of war against the police force and his subsequent disappearance into the Northumbrian countryside to evade capture, chillingly mirror aspects of the film’s plot and are permutations of the elemental masculinity present in the film and within broader culture. It is not uncommon for the media, when reporting on particularly horrific events, to draw on existing popular cultural sources to provide interpretive frames of reference that render these events intelligible and somewhat comprehensible for their audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454124">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). The obvious similarities between the character Rambo and Moat, as well as the film’s plot and the events of the case, were noted by the media in several articles: ‘to many online communities he was a “Geordie Rambo”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741659012454124">Reynolds, 2010</xref>, <italic>Scotsman</italic>). The <italic>First Post</italic> ran with the headline ‘Moat says he’s like the Hulk – but he’s more like Rambo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741659012454124">Edwards, 2010</xref>), focusing on Moat’s knowledge of outdoor survival techniques, the military connotations in his declaration of war, and his perceived unjust treatment at the hands of the police.</p>
<p>Other aspects of Moat’s elemental masculinity were discussed in the media coverage – his potential for violence, and again his skills as an outdoorsman. Reports in the national media, some drawn from the testimonies of Moat’s acquaintances, depict a man of considerable local repute, particularly due to his reported capacity for violence, his reported association with members of Newcastle’s crime community, and his employment as a nightclub doorman/bouncer: ‘Mrs Hornsby said: “He has got a violent temper. Once he loses his temper he lashes out”’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454124">Jenkins and McIntosh, 2010</xref>). Bouncers ooze cultural capital in the form of violent potential, garnered through their experiences of socialisation within a durable working-class habitus, where violence and the threat of violence are encountered regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741659012454124">Hobbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741659012454124">Winlow, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Moat evidently had a capacity for extreme violence and his actions, as described by Samantha Stobbart (his former partner), attest to this: ‘Raoul was waiting for us, hiding outside with a sawn-off shotgun… Raoul just jumped out and without a word shot Chris at point blank range in the legs’ (<italic>Sunday Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741659012454124">Foggo and Hind, 2010</xref>). Stobbart’s description of the events suggests that Moat deliberately incapacitated Chris Brown, leaving him temporarily immobile while he turned his attention to Stobbart. As Stobbart fled back into the house, Moat returned to Brown and shot him twice before approaching the house and shooting Stobbart through a window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741659012454124">Foggo and Hind, 2010</xref>). The shooting of PC David Rathband by Moat appears to have followed a similar pattern, with Moat approaching PC Rathband’s parked vehicle and shooting him through the passenger window (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010b</xref>). Moat’s actions, as described in Stobbart’s testimony and the media coverage of the shooting of PC Rathband, do not indicate that the violence in either incident was frenzied or committed spontaneously. In neither account does there appear to have been an initial confrontation, issue of threats, and then a subsequent escalation to lethal violence, as has been found in some research on homicides committed by men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741659012454124">Polk, 1994</xref>). Rather, the deployment of his violence, although brutal, appears to have been executed with a degree of calculation and planning, and, in many ways, appears to replicate the encounter between hunter and prey – with Moat appearing to be stalking the three victims. Coverage of the case confirmed this choice of identity. <italic>The Times</italic> ran with the headline ‘Gunman can survive in the wild for days on end, says ex-girlfriend’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741659012454124">McIntosh et al., 2010a</xref>). CCTV images of Moat in a DIY shop show him looking muscular and dressed in camouflage-type attire. ‘He worked hard to build a body that stood out – even among the doormen of the city’s pubs and clubs’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454124">Jenkins and McIntosh, 2010</xref>). The presentation of ‘toughness’ of this kind is saturated in symbolic meaning that communicates to observers ‘that unusual physical risks have been suffered and transcended’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741659012454124">Katz, 1988</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>In working-class communities, characterised by deprivation and economic marginality, men’s reputations are often founded on their ability to deploy violence effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012454124">Winlow and Hall, 2009</xref>). The evidence suggests that Moat emerged from such a context where violence, realised, threatened or symbolic, was a mode of appropriate masculine comportment. He, and we, are also situated within a broader culture ‘pervaded by images of hyper-masculine toughness, which valorises, in multifarious ways, the male body acting on space in conjunction with the skilled use and technical knowledge of weapons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454124">Collier, 1998</xref>: 119). This is a culture in which – in particular contexts and at specific moments – the heterosexual male body and its destructive capabilities are celebrated and paraded in various popular cultural and media outlets for enjoyment and consumption. Unlike the majority of men who are likely to be drawn to the image of the heroic hard man, yet are incapable of performing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741659012454124">Jefferson, 1998</xref>) as they become enmeshed within the seductions of conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741659012454124">Sparks, 1996</xref>), Moat was clearly a man who was willing to invest, copiously, in this particular aspect of his identity not least because his efforts at conformity had yielded little status. It is easy to see ‘how images of masculine bodies, bulging muscles and empowered actors might be enticing and seductive for men and boys who lack… any commanding status and presence in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454124">Collier, 1998</xref>: 119). Moat’s body was entangled in a particular discourse of masculinity with its associated qualities and dispositions exalted in Western popular culture and one that we recognise, consume and are all too familiar with. In that discursive context, he is both depicted in the news, interpreted from the news as, and seems to have constructed a sense of himself as, a man connected with nature, resourceful, tough, and stoical in the face of adversity, with a powerful muscular physique; a warrior, a hunter and a survivor, a force to be reckoned with and a return to a form of manliness stripped of the vestiges of civilisation: he is the Elemental Man and ultimately he becomes only element through the alchemy of death by suicide.</p>

<title>Discussion: Discourse and Male Agency</title>
<p>In the Moat case other stories about men’s violence were evoked from the usual, with that difference disturbing hegemonic structures and revealing other layers of ideology at work, layers which reveal more about the meanings of masculinity than is common in accounts of crime. This matters because news is, in Foucault’s terms, an institution of authority and one that depends on language as the <italic>technology</italic> of power. Audiences bring to news a whole repertoire of pre-emptive cognitive strategies that interpret stories within familiar sense-making frameworks, frameworks that are prompted by the motifs employed by journalism. The whole offers a narrative cultural cycle. Audiences resonate with the cycle because it is complicit with their subjective experience which gives the narration verisimilitude.</p>
<p>Crime news has been explored by criminologists systematically, and also erratically, to analyse crime and violence in relation to many social structures, and by feminist criminologists to explore the representation of women as both criminals and victims. The former focus barely recognises the masculinity at the core of offending and victimhood reported, while the latter feminist work focus was, quite rightly, to address the barely previously acknowledged place of women in crime and criminal justice, particularly as victims, as a political and epistemological quest. As a result, masculinity at the heart of crime and at the heart of criminology remains only tangentially acknowledged or is discursively disguised by a focus on other variables or victims<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741659012454124">2</xref></sup> and so invested with power. We choose to return to masculinity in this paper, rather than masculinities, because it is too simple to hide the problem of male sexed bodies acting violently in the obfuscation of race, age, sexual orientation, ‘class’ and so forth, and also too simple to see these variables as determining of crime which leaves men’s agency in violence unaddressed.</p>
<p>The ‘moatifs’ identified here are revealing. They show a man interpellated into habitus, whether as rational actor or subconsciously we cannot know, but there was certainly agency on Moat’s part. They also reveal habitus as social and discursive places which comprise both legitimate and deviant aspects whether, as identified here, domestic, institutional or elemental. What is perhaps significant is that Moat appears in the news and is described in all three motifs of masculinity as an isolated individual whose anger is directed at the contexts where he has failed and been rejected as a ‘man’. There is no happy family role for him depicted, no institutional support from a legitimate work identity evident, no illegitimate identity as a ‘successful’ <italic>newsworthy</italic> criminal, as he was just described as an abuser of women and a child until his final violences, and there is no place for him, shown in any reports, in the civilised, commoditised world. For Moat all his potential meaning and identity habitus have been eroded and so his ‘sense of order and control over the life course has diminished defending personal space and refusing to submit to the authority of external agents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012454124">Winlow and Hall, 2009</xref>: 288) becomes a means of establishing himself, of being a man. But that simultaneously extricates him from all the functional cultural trappings of manliness until there is no place for him in life and he chooses death.</p>
<p>The misfit of Moat within most accounting frames for male violence – women’s <italic>badness</italic>, race, youth, fundamentalism, <italic>‘</italic>class’ – is illuminating because it forces explanations away from these mainstream explanatory frameworks, which are so taken for granted in the news. This discursive slippage reveals other socio-cultural contexts for the constitution of masculinity and also exposes acts of violence as associated with lack or loss of power and identity. Moat’s occupation of these tropes – domestic, institutional, elemental – both reveals subjective agency as he struggled to find a habitus he fitted, but also reveals the socio-cultural provision of contexts of identity available to him as a man. As such, analysing news about Moat has served a psycho-social approach to masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741659012454124">Gadd and Jefferson, 2007</xref>) rather better than the tendency to pathologise individually, that can characterise the psychosocial, because it clarifies the opportune socio-cultural habitus, as discursively described. Such discourses in turn constitute the identity and agency choices available for the man and delineate others’ expectations and perceptions of him, so the social informs the subjective and the resulting psychology informs social action. In other words, discourse analysis puts the social properly into psycho-social and also clarifies the relation between social habitus, subjectivity and agency that is lost in some work on masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659012454124">Carrington and Scott, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysing Moat’s story in the news illuminates the repertoire of discourses available culturally that makes maleness meaningful. It also shows how journalists, rather than objectively reporting, reach out for already current explanatory frameworks, which reproduce conservative and traditional models of masculinity. The repertoire used by Moat and about Moat is disseminated widely to men to make sense of themselves and other men, whether they are also criminals, journalists or academics of whatever colour, creed, age or class. That repertoire is also offered to women as not <italic>feminine</italic>, with implications for both their sense of themselves and their expectations of masculinity. The repertoire offers audiences models of masculinity that, whether legitimate or illegitimate, maintain and systematically reproduce gendered roles and relations. These are ‘masculinist modes of thought, accepted as normal and everyday’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741659012454124">Howe, 2008</xref>: 218) that continue and circumscribe attitudes and behaviours steeped in power inequity at best and violence at worst.</p>
