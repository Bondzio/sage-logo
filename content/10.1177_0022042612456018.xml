<abstract>
<p>Drug selling and violence are intimately connected. However, despite the importance of systemic violence as a source of drug-related violence, there is surprisingly little research that examines these conflicts specifically as forms of dispute resolution. To partially address this concern, drug business disputes are explored from a situational perspective, specifically by viewing them as series of influence tactics. In addition, a comparative analysis assesses how two specific influence tactics—compliance and resolution efforts—operate differently in violent versus nonviolent disputes. By looking at the dynamics of drug business disputes that end in varied outcomes, the result is an enhanced understanding of the nature and process of conflict in drug market settings. The findings from this and similar research studies can help improve attempts by law enforcement and other entities to reduce violence linked to drug selling, chiefly by pinpointing areas of flexibility available to guide control and prevention efforts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Violence and drug selling share a strong connection. The connection is implicit in arguments for drug legalization which cite, among other potential benefits, reduced violence from the elimination of illegal trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456018">Cussen &amp; Block, 2000</xref>). It is also implicit in arguments linking changes in the nature of the crack market as one of various reasons for New York City’s decline in crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456018">Blumstein &amp; Wallman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456018">Johnson, Golub, &amp; Dunlap, 2000</xref>). Research has examined various proposed casual pathways to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456018">Goldstein (1985)</xref> has called systemic violence—violence linked to the use and distribution of drugs. Drug sellers are often part of a broader social environment featuring widespread proviolence norms, which lessen the restraints against violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456018">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456018">Bourgois, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612456018">Ousey &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). Drug sellers themselves have an increased propensity to engage in violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456018">Chaiken &amp; Chaiken, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456018">Fagan &amp; Chin, 1990</xref>). Substance use, an endemic feature of drug settings, may also serve to heighten violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612456018">White &amp; Gorman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456018">Kuhns, 2005</xref>). Drug sellers are often armed with guns, which makes homicide a likely occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456018">Blumstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612456018">Zimring &amp; Hawkins, 1997</xref>). Finally, the potential for violent disputes is heightened by various contextual features of the selling environment, including type of selling organization; position of individuals in drug hierarchy, level of market activity; market stability; and location of drug sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456018">Curtis &amp; Wendel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456018">Korf, Brochu, Benschop, Harrison, &amp; Erickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612456018">Ousey &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612456018">Reuter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612456018">Taylor &amp; Brownstein, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some argue that, given the illicit nature of drug selling, violence is a necessary aspect. Drug selling is a complex economic activity that lies outside of the law. When conflicts occur, they obviously cannot be resolved through legal means. As a result, violence is used to resolve disputes and impose social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456018">Goldstein, 1985</xref>). Types of disputes that might lead to violence in drug-selling settings include struggles over territory, punishment of errant workers, and conflicts with customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456018">Goldstein, 1989</xref>). An especially important source of conflict in drug settings is the robbery of drug sellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456018">Jacobs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456018">Topalli, Wright, &amp; Fornango, 2002</xref>). These can often result in violent retaliation, and thus amplify the level of violence present.</p>
<p>Given the importance of systemic violence as a source of drug-related violence, it is surprising that there has been little research which examines these conflicts specifically as a form of social control, that is, as dispute resolution. Moreover, although much attention is paid to extraordinary forms of violence that can occur, there is relatively less information about the ordinary everyday assaults that are perhaps more typical of selling environments. Finally, until recently, there has been almost no direct research focus on the phenomenon of nonviolent outcomes of drug business disputes (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456018">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>, for an elegant theoretical treatment of the issue). This is surprising as such outcomes are likely more common than media stereotypes of drug selling would allow researchers to presume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456018">Coomber &amp; Maher, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretical and empirical examination of nonviolent drug-related dispute outcomes is an important part of assessing the role of systematic drug violence in contributing to general levels of community violence. Uncovering the dynamics of violent and nonviolent drug business disputes can improve our understanding of the nature of conflict in drug market settings. The results of this work may also help improve the abilities of law enforcement and other entities to control these events, specifically by pinpointing the degree of flexibility available to guide efforts at control and prevention. Applying situation-based perspectives to the study of such events is a potentially useful approach for completing this task.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022042612456018">
<title>Exploring the Violent Situation</title>
<p>Situational theories or perspectives are focused on understanding and explaining crime situations or events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456018">Birkbeck &amp; LaFree, 1993</xref>). Here, the focus is on violent events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612456018">Toch (1969)</xref> defines a violent event as “an interaction which begins when one person approaches another with some purpose in mind and ends in an act of aggression” (p. 35). Situation-based theories regard violence as an interpersonal process where the outcome is determined by elements within the interaction itself as well as those that exist alongside it, including weapons, and the actions of the parties to the conflict as well as the actions and thoughts of the individuals.</p>
<p>These theories serve as a distinct contrast to traditional theoretical approaches to violence. Most research on violence is directed either toward explaining variations in its prevalence among social entities (gender, racial/ethnic, economic groups; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456018">Kruttschnitt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456018">Luckenbill &amp; Doyle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456018">Sampson, 1987</xref>) or elucidating the relationship between violent behavior and antecedent factors, whether personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456018">Megargee, 1982</xref>), or external circumstances, such as childhood exposure to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612456018">Widom, 1989</xref>). Although this research has generated important findings, it runs up against a key puzzle: People with a high propensity to engage in violence are not violent under all circumstances. A person who is violent in one condition may, in another situation, refrain from violence. Thus, the situation is an important factor in generating a particular outcome. Theories of violence that limit attention to antecedent personal factors are less useful in accounting for the emergence of violence in particular instances. This inability to account for varying outcomes given a common set of conditions is likely because dispositional theories of violence mainly address factors that are quite distant from the actual act, and thus do little to illuminate the processes leading to the production of the act itself.</p>
<p>Situational approaches direct our attention to the generation of specific violent acts, thus improving our understanding of violent behavior overall. In addition, they also provide a closer fit with some of the information that we know about violence, such as the fact that it is not randomly distributed in time or place, even in locations that have a high potential for violence.</p>
<p>Initial empirical work in the application of situational theories to violent situations has looked at how these events unfold. The germinal work here is an article done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456018">Luckenbill (1977)</xref> which posited violence as a “situated transaction,” defined as “the chain of interaction between two or more individuals that lasts the time they are in each other’s physical presence” (p. 177). He analyzed written criminal justice records of criminal homicides as staged character contests where there is mutual consent by both parties to use violence as a means of defending positive social identities. Research involving situational theories has expanded to address a wide variety of topics: the role played by accounts in event escalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456018">Felson, 1984</xref>), retaliatory factors in assault events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456018">Felson &amp; Steadman, 1983</xref>), impression management concerns in violent incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456018">Felson, 1982</xref>), gun conflicts among adolescent males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612456018">Wilkinson, 2003</xref>), and violent confrontations by Black males in bar settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612456018">Oliver, 1994</xref>), among others.</p>
<p>Although research done from the situational perspective has provided us with useful information on violence, there are a few areas where an expanded focus is needed. Much of the event-based research focuses on conflicts that are characterized by identity concerns. That is, one person takes personal offense at the actions or comments of another and it evolves (or devolves) into violence. There is less attention given to studying other types of violent interaction, for instance, assaults that are not strictly over identity concerns. As a result, there is less knowledge about such events, and about whether they proceed in a manner similar to that found in Luckenbill’s character contests.</p>
<p>Second, there is comparatively little empirical attention paid to situations that could end in violence but do not. This is surprising, as it is likely that nonviolent outcomes to conflict are a common result. It strains credulity to assume that every dispute faced by a male, minority, lower class, inner-city dweller, say, a drug seller for instance, is doomed to end in aggression. It can be challenging for researchers to conceptualize a nonviolent outcome given that the focus is necessarily on something that is absent (specifically, an aggressive act). Nevertheless, failure to examine situations that result in nonviolent outcomes is an unnecessary hindrance to the goal of establishing robust causal links between situational features and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456018">Sampson &amp; Lauritsen, 1994</xref>). Specifically, a more complete assessment of the influence of various situational features on violence requires the comparison of such features between violent and nonviolent event outcomes.</p>
<p>Turning to the empirical literature, one finds few studies that even elicit accounts of nonviolent events, much less conduct detailed analyses of such events. In one early study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456018">Felson (1984)</xref> compared verbal aggression events with physical aggressive ones in exploring the role played by accounts in violent conflict. An account is defined as an excuse/justification for a deviant or untoward act (e.g., “I’m sorry about bumping into you”). His chief finding was that accounts were less likely to be present in instances of physical violence. This led him to conclude that when an account is given, a dispute is less likely to come to physical violence. Other research has proceeded by comparing events similar to violent ones that might have been violent but did not end up that way.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456018">Athens (1997)</xref> explored the role of restraining judgments in the avoidance of violence. He asked violent prisoners to describe a situation in which they almost, but did not, attack another person. He found that in those instances, the prisoners formed restraining judgments which kept them from violent action. These judgments were fear of failure, fear of damaging a relationship, consideration of others’ desires, change in actions of the opponent, fear of law enforcement. An issue not addressed in this work is whether and how specific attributes of the situation influenced the formation of these restraining judgments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456018">Phillips (2003)</xref> used a case-control method to compare violent conflicts (termed <italic>violent vengeance</italic>) with similar conflicts that did not end violently. Testing a model of Black’s theory of self-help, Phillips found that two concepts—Relational distance and functional independence were significantly associated with whether an event became violent. Specifically, when there was a personal connection tie between the disputants, a nonviolent result was likely. This was also the case when the parties depended on each other for support. However, being of equal status and being confined in the same space, and coming from different cultures did not distinguish between violent and nonviolent events. Other factors that were associated with violent outcomes/nonviolent outcomes were presence of a gun, size difference, and the use of drugs/alcohol.</p>
<p>Third parties, outside persons linked to one or both of the main disputants, also play a role in how an event unfolds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456018">Phillips and Cooney (2005)</xref> examined the nature and influence of third parties on the ability to distinguish violent from violent outcomes. They looked at both personal and institutional third-party parties, and whether they were linked to one side in the conflict (partisan ties), both sides (crosscutting ties), or neither side (distant ties). Partisan ties were more associated with violent conflicts, whereas distant ties (those third parties that were not connected to either side) were associated with nonviolent outcomes. The presence of crosscutting ties was associated with acts of mediation during a dispute.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456018">Jacques and Wright’s (2008)</xref> <italic>resource exchange-social control</italic> typology is an attempt to apply a general conceptual framework to encompass all activities in drug settings, both violent and nonviolent. Actions taken in the drug market can be viewed as either resource exchange or social control. Resource exchange describes how goods and services are traded. The process can take one of three forms: predatory (i.e., one side takes), altruistic (i.e., one side gives), or mutual (i.e., give and take). Social control is about imposing order among interactions, and includes addressing claims of wrongdoing. Actions here can take violent forms (retaliation) or nonviolent ones (fraud, deception, or mediation). As the goal of the authors is to construct and apply a theoretical framework, there is less focus on exploring how specific elements of disputes lead to a particular outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612456018">Wilkinson’s (2003)</xref> research on the construction of violent events among adolescent males provides a basis for conceptualizing nonviolent event outcomes that is useful for the present study. In one type, conflict is settled before violence occurs. Such interactions featured a mutual agreement to end hostilities. The wish not to jeopardize the relationship is a prime reason given for ending the event. Another type of nonviolent outcome is compliance before violence; simply, one party gives into the demands of the other, and the event ends. Violence does not occur because it is not needed. Finally, there are times when a conflict is forced to end. Called “forced endings” or “disrupted violence,” an outside force acts to interfere with the continuation of the conflict interaction. Maybe the police are on their way, or someone interrupts the scene, causing parties to stop. These cases are more likely than any other to be restarted at a later date. In addition, Wilkinson found that certain reasons for disputes, such as robbery or self-defense, are more likely to be linked to a violent outcome.</p>
<p>Research findings on nonviolent event outcomes point to a leading role for certain situational attributes. Nonviolent events are likely to occur among individuals who have a social bond, such as friends or relatives. Third parties can thwart events, by serving as mediators, by presenting a deterrent show of force, or by directly intervening before violence occurs. An explanatory account by the offending party lessens the potential for violence, as does compliance with the original demand. Fears about negative consequences, such as criminal justice involvement or injuring the other party, can also lead to nonviolent outcomes. Finally, at least according to Wilkinson’s work, disputes are more likely to end nonviolently if the conflict does not involve self-defense or robbery.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for understanding drug business disputes and their aftermath. Specifically, what drives a nonviolent outcome to a drug business dispute? Is it the nature of the offense? The actions of the individuals involved? The operation of intervening factors? Some combination of these? It is possible that certain conflicts are inherently resistant to a nonviolent resolution, at least not without some external intervention. Thus, for a nonviolent result to emerge (e.g., via mutual agreement), some degree of flexibility is needed to allow the individual to make choices to forego aggression. If this is the case, what is the basis for that flexibility? What types of conflict conditions allow individuals to refrain from violence by their own efforts, and which ones make this option impossible?</p>
<p>One way to attempt to answer these questions is to deconstruct these conflicts, that is, to break them apart and explore their progression, step-by-step, from start to finish. Examining disputes in this way allows one to distinguish the effects of factors present at the start of a conflict with those that operate during the interaction. As a result, we can observe whether and how the configuration of elements in a dispute leads to the development of a particular dispute outcome, either violent or nonviolent.</p>
<p>Using this analytical approach, the present study analyzes dispute accounts provided by a sample of New York City drug sellers. These conflicts are analyzed as sequences of influence tactics performed by the participants. A concept drawn from impression management theory, an influence tactic is a behavior designed to get some party to act or to refrain from acting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456018">Felson, 1984</xref>). Behaviors typically displayed in conflict, such as requests for compliance, threats, and physical attacks can be viewed as influence tactics, as they are often used to influence individuals to act.</p>
<p>For the sequence analysis, actions reported during drug business disputes were mapped in their order of occurrence. This allowed comparison of the nature and pattern of dispute actions for both violent and nonviolent conflicts. Along with the sequence analysis, there was a qualitative comparative examination of how two types of influence tactics, compliance and resolution efforts, operated within the broader context of both violent and nonviolent disputes.</p>
<p>The sequence analysis combined with the comparative examination was used to address the following research questions: What types of influence tactics are present in drug business disputes? What are the steps taken by the main dispute participants, from the initial confrontation to the final result? Does this process look different in violent versus nonviolent events? Finally, what additional contextual elements help distinguish between drug business disputes that are violent and those that are nonviolent?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data used in this study were drawn from a 1998 exploratory study on drug markets and violence funded by the National Consortium of Violence Research and conducted at the National Development and Research Institutes, Inc. Recruitment and interviewing of respondents began in February 1998 and was completed in May 1998. Participants were recruited via targeted sampling. Potential respondents were screened for then-active involvement in drug selling and for involvement in violence within the past year. Respondents were paid US$45.00 for their participation. A total of 28 male sellers were interviewed for the study; however, 1 person failed to complete the interview, leading to a final interview sample of 27 African American and Hispanic males. They were adults between the ages of 19 and 55 years, involved in drug and nondrug crime, the latter mainly small-time property offending (e.g., shoplifting). As drug sellers, these men mostly sold crack cocaine, and tended to be either employees connected to a drug organization (12 men), or freelancers who brought drugs on their own and sold them on an ad hoc basis (15 men).</p>
<p>Tape-recorded interviews were conducted with the men, using a semistructured questionnaire. The first part of the instrument queried the sellers about their families, jobs, involvement in drug selling, and involvement in other crimes. In the second portion of the questionnaire, a timeline was constructed using as anchors key dates of personal interest to the respondent (birthday, holidays). Using the timeline as a memory guide, each man was asked to recall any violent events experienced, as either a target or a perpetrator, during the 2 years prior to the interview. A 2-year time period was chosen to maximize the number of violent events obtained. Respondents were encouraged to recall up to 10 events occurring inside and outside the drug market setting. They were also asked whether they had encountered any near violent incidents, that is, conflict situations that could have become violent, but did not. The decision was made to let the respondent self-define what constituted a near violent event. If he asked for guidance, he was prompted with examples from the list of violent events that he provided. For instance, if he mentioned a territorial conflict that was violent, he was asked whether there was a similar situation that ended without violence.</p>
<p>Out of the initial list of events, a subsample of three events was chosen for deeper examination: one drug business violent, one nondrug business violent, and one nonviolent, which could be drug business or not. The sellers provided a narrative for each incident, containing information such as the reason for the dispute, the nature of the opponent, the presence of fellow combatants on each side, the existence and actions of third parties, and other key features. The objective here was to obtain a detailed, step-by-step picture of each dispute, from beginning to end. Fifty-three detailed descriptions of drug business conflicts were obtained.</p>
<p>It is possible that respondents could have described events that happened before or after the reference period (i.e., telescoping). The likelihood of this was reduced by using the timeline containing significant personal events to help target the respondent’s memory of conflicts. This makes it more likely that events happened during the time frame discussed. To obtain the most accurate information possible, the respondents were questioned closely to assess whether their accounts had internal consistency. Contradictory or unclear responses were pointed out to and resolved with the respondent to obtain the most accurate recollection possible.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it was impossible to obtain independent verification of the conflicts that the men discussed. This is difficult to avoid problem in criminological research on topics like violence. Because of the near impossibility of observing violent events or of obtaining accounts of violence from multiple sources, researchers are left to rely on self-reports of individuals to obtain information about this behavior. Furthermore, self-reports are the only way to uncover how individuals perceive their actions and those of others during conflict. An examination of those perceptions is an important component of the present study.</p>
<sec id="section4-0022042612456018">
<title>Sequence Analysis</title>
<p>Drug business disputes were analyzed by looking at the sequence of actions, or influence tactics that occurred during the event. A concept drawn from impression management theory, an influence tactic is a behavior designed to get some party to act or to refrain from acting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456018">Felson, 1984</xref>). They can range from relatively benign interactions (requests, minor complaints) to more serious engagement (threats, insults) to violence. The current analysis partially replicates research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456018">Felson and Steadman (1983)</xref>, which examined the role of influence tactics in robbery and assaults.</p>
<p>The original codes were altered for use in this study (the codes for influence tactics are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612456018">Table 1</xref>). This research addresses nonviolent dispute outcomes, an issue not explored in the 1983 article; thus, new codes were needed to capture actions occurring in those types of events. These new actions include attempts by the main protagonists to resolve the conflict, as well as indicators of compliance in response to specific demands.</p>

<p>The sequences were created as follows. Each dispute narrative was divided into a series of steps (Step 1, Step 2, etc.), numbered from first to last (e.g., a dealer asking a customer for money owed would be Step 1). Each step was assigned two codes. The first code marked the type of influence tactic that occurred, whether it was an influence attempt, noncompliance, explicit identity attack, and so on. This code was assigned according to the most prominent interpretation of the action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612456018">1</xref></sup> The second code identified the person(s) who performed the activity—see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612456018">Table 2</xref> for the five categories used.</p>

<p>The code “I” was assigned to the person who either initiated the complaint or began the interaction (initiator). The person who is asked to respond to the complaint was given a code of “R,” for responder. Third-party participants were assigned a code indicating a connection to the initiator, the responder or to neither side. An influence tactic could be assigned to more than one person. For instance, if there was a fight involving a responder and his friends, it would be coded as “HRZ” (H = <italic>physical attack</italic>, R = <italic>respondent makes the attack</italic>, and Z = <italic>respondent’s friends joined in the attack</italic>).</p>
<p>Each dispute event was coded from the first interaction between the parties involved up to the point where interaction ended. Note this allows an action type to be recorded more than once. When there was an argument, with no additional information on turn taking by the participants, the event was coded as a single exchange of identity attacks. Most of the dispute interactions occurred in a single setting, and had a limited time span, mostly minutes or (rarely) hours. However, there were two disputes that spanned multiple days. In those instances, each separate interaction was coded, and then all interactions combined to create a grand sequence of the entire dispute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612456018">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the next step, the order of influence tactics was established separately for the violent and nonviolent disputes. This was done by calculating the mean position of each influence tactic among all sequences examined, and then ordering the tactics based on their mean values. For this process, all sequences, which varied in the total number of steps present, were standardized by assigning the value of “1” for the completed sequence. Next, each step was given a positional value as a proportion of 1, calculated based on the total number of steps in the sequence. For instance, if a sequence has five steps, Step 1 would receive a value of .200; Step 2, .400; Step 3, .600; Step 4, .800; and Step 5, 1.00. The mean positional value for each influence tactic was determined by grouping all steps featuring a particular influence tactic (e.g., all “threats” occurring among the violent disputes), summing the individual positional values and then dividing by the total. Finally, the influence tactics were listed in order of their mean positional values. The end result was two lists portraying the typical ordering of influence tactics used within violent and nonviolent events.</p>
<p>Once the sequences were derived, they were first used to determine whether violent and nonviolent disputes differed in the nature and order of influence tactics present. Then, after comparing the order of influence tactics, a qualitative comparative analysis was performed to examine the role of two influence tactics, compliance and resolution efforts, in both violent versus nonviolent disputes.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Out of the 53 drug business conflicts, 18 were nonviolent and 35 were violent. Disputes fell into the following categories, derived according to the primary theme of the conflict:</p>
<sec id="section6-0022042612456018">
<title>Territory</title>
<p>The disputes here involve situations where someone is either defending a drug-selling area, or seeking to redefine its boundaries. There were eight events in this category: In five, there was violence, whereas three ended nonviolently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022042612456018">
<title>Debt</title>
<p>The second category of reasons involves conflicts over debts. Simply, one party owed either money or drugs and had not provided repayment. The money was owed chiefly to a dealer or supplier. Of the 16 events in this category, 12 had violent outcomes and 4 had nonviolent ones.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022042612456018">
<title>Theft and deceit</title>
<p>This group of concerned deceptive practices where one party attempts (or is perceived to be attempting) to acquire undeserved goods through stealth and or deceit. There are 14 events in this category, all ending in violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612456018">
<title>Insult</title>
<p>Here, the conflict was due to one party insulting the other, with the insult having some relationship to involvement in drugs. There are three events in this category, all ending in nonviolent outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022042612456018">
<title>Other</title>
<p>This category contains events with motives that are unique relative to the remainder of this sample (e.g., threats to snitch, disagreement over nature of drug partnership). Of the 12 events in this category, 8 ended nonviolently and 4 were violent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612456018">
<title>Comparing Violent and Nonviolent Dispute Sequences</title>
<p>The average number of steps in the violent dispute sequences was about 5 (4.52).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612456018">3</xref></sup> This is slightly shorter than the number of steps present in nonviolent events. The difference may be due to the presence of a few incidents where violence occurred rather quickly in the interaction. The number of steps present in violent events ranged from 1 (where violence was the initial step) to 8 (a few disputes that spanned a few days). The violent events exhibit the following general pattern<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022042612456018">4</xref></sup>: They start with influence attempts, move through threats, noncompliance and explicit identity attacks, then onto evasive actions and finally physical attack. Described in another way, these conflicts start out with a request for something (e.g., money owed), and then move through verbal threats and rejections of the initial claim. These then lead to the use of insults, by either one or both sides, followed by attempts by either or both parties to leave the interaction, with physical violence occurring at the end.</p>
<p>Within the general pattern, there is much variation in the sequences of these conflicts. For a few events, violence happens very early, usually after a brief exchange consisting of an influence attempt coupled with a rejection/noncompliance. In several instances, violence followed within one or two steps of rejection by the other side. An exchange of insults ended in violence in a few other cases. Finally, with the multiday disputes, the initial interaction ended, with violence occurring almost immediately upon the next meeting.</p>
<p>The average number of sequence steps for nonviolent disputes was 5.8. These disputes had as few as 2 and as many as 10 steps. The events with the longest steps included two disputes that were mediated close to the point of violence, and one where a respondent was asked by multiple parties to leave a selling area, which he did after some initial reluctance. The general pattern of influence tactics for nonviolent disputes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612456018">Table 3</xref>) starts with influence attempts and identity attacks, move through noncompliance and threats, and end with compliance and resolution efforts. To summarize, the nonviolent disputes start out with a request. From there, the situation advances to verbal insults, rejection of claims, and threats. As the dispute moves into the end stages, tactics shift toward compliance (responding positively to the initial claim), and/or resolution efforts (where the conflict or the issues surrounding the conflict are resolved).</p>

<p>The order of influence tactics for nonviolent and violent disputes reflects the stage model of disputes as posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456018">Luckenbill (1977)</xref> and the order of influence tactics found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456018">Felson and Steadman (1983)</xref>. However, apart from the general patterns outlined above, both violent and nonviolent dispute sequences showed much diversity in the configuration of individual event sequences, indicating the varied processes by which disputes evolve. For both types of outcomes, however, compliance, resolution, and mediation all occur later in the dispute. This highlights an important point: The main distinction between violent and nonviolent events is the presence of successful avoidance tactics, consisting of either giving into the initial demand or resolving a problematic issue. This point is explored in greater depth below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022042612456018">
<title>Making Room for Compliance</title>
<p>Compliance efforts are defined by the giving into a request or the promise to do so. A few nonviolent outcomes occurred when a request by one person is acceded to by another. Simply, if you do what people ask, there is no violence. For instance, there were territorial disputes where one dealer agreed to leave another’s selling territory when asked to do so. In one case, Rick agrees to leave, even in the face of insults by the other party:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rick:</speaker>
<p>I came to an agreement that he was there first and the customers all know him. And, you know, he’s been there like 20 something years. And I just, I came out there. So I gave him respect. I told him so where you would like me to go, you know? Or where can I, where can I so that it doesn’t bother you? And, you know, tell me on the other side, whatever. So I did it like that. That’s all.</p>
</speech>
<p>Mike is faced with repeated requests to leave, which he finally does.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>. . . Even though I had to step and go down the block, which was okay. He didn’t put me completely out, but still got some of his customers, you know.</p>
</speech>
<p>In another example, Bob challenges a person who lied about giving him money to tell the truth about it. Once the other party did so, this restored Bob’s good name, thus lessening his desire to do violence. In fact, according to Bob, it was likely the only way to avoid violence. As he said, if the person had lied, he would have been hurt.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bob:</speaker>
<p>Then again even if he woulda said that he did give it to me and I know he didn’t, then I woulda whupped his ass and they would did whatever . . .</p>
</speech>
<p>One example of promised compliance occurred during a debt dispute. Briefly, James confronted someone who owed him a couple hundred dollars for past credit given to purchase drugs. After some back and forth, the man promised to repay the money (although it is not clear that this will happen).</p>
<p>Agreeing to comply with a demand is linked to concerns about the risk of noncompliance. As Rick said,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rick:</speaker>
<p>Because, um, I was in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong place at the wrong time. I mean, I was in his neighborhood. So I didn’t have no wins.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>You didn’t have any . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rick:</speaker>
<p>I didn’t have no wins in this neighborhood.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Wins?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rick:</speaker>
<p>’Cause, you know, I couldn’t win in this neighborhood. ’Cause he has the whole block. He has like 20 guys working for him. And they were all out there. So I, I figured the best way to handle this is without, just verbally. Just talking.</p>
</speech>
<p>Being outnumbered (and out-powered) made it a good idea for him to leave the selling spot. These situations are also less highly charged, so that compliance, or the promise to do so, is easily given and accepted. However, disputes may vary in the level of flexibility available for the offender to respond with an ameliorative gesture. Conflicts that are highly serious or which have certain types of constraints make compliance difficult. This can set the stage for violence.</p>
<p>This dynamic is present for some of the disputes that ended in violence. Among these were a few examples of attempts at compliance, or actions that could potentially be interpreted in that manner. Lucky approaches an individual who owes him money and promises to repay it. When Lucky goes to collect the money, the person does not have it, and Lucky breaks his arm in response. This incident starkly demonstrates the risks of noncompliance. There are other, similar violent events where the promise to comply is more likely an evasive tactic, designed to put off a presumed inevitable attack. In this example, a man who owes money to a group of dealers insisted that he had to wait for the bank to deposit the money later on that day. Fred talks about his frustration that this tactic caused:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Fred:</speaker>
<p>I guess the things that he was saying, you know, when the addict was lying and the guy, you know that had been calling his bank account and he was you know, talking to him and making sense and the addict was constantly still lying, yeah, it was making my temper change, you know, I was getting more upset. And I was thinking about picking up something and beating him with it. You know, ’cause I was just getting more upset because the addict was lying, you know, I was like, well, “this is what got you in this situation now, you lying, you playing games and you still doing it, what’s wrong with you,” this is what I’m thinking in my mind. Yeah, so I was getting more upset.</p>
</speech>
<p>How do these disputes differ from those where violence did not occur? Simply, promises to comply that are not backed by behavior or that are undermined by additional facts are disbelieved and rejected. This rejection allows the offended party to use violence, as either an additional influence tactic or as payback; that is, punishment.</p>
<p>Promised compliance to avoid punishment is especially likely when the dispute centers on suspicions of theft or snitching. In one case, Joe was confronted by a dealer whose money he stole. During the confrontation, he said that he would pay the man back. The dealer disregarded this and went on to stab Joe. In another event, a man who originally said he would snitch to the police about a group of rival dealers tries to take it back, but is beaten up anyway:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>James Kirk:</speaker>
<p>And when we pulled him in, like, one of them threatened him. I think it was Cabeza, one of them threatened him, like, to kill him, if he would snitch.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>And what did he say?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>James Kirk:</speaker>
<p>Who?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>The snitch?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>James Kirk:</speaker>
<p>The snitch? He said he wasn’t gonna snitch, but you can’t trust that. You can’t trust nobody like that, nobody.</p>
</speech>
<p>In these two instances, the gravity of the offense (theft, snitching) combined with the high level of emotion in the situation militated against acceptance of these offers at compliance. As a result, an attack occurs, one which is likely as much about punishing an offender as it is about getting money (protection) restored. The point is this: If I cannot get relief, I can at least get payback. In this way, what might be deemed false compliance has the same effect as noncompliance, which, as we have seen, can be linked to violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022042612456018">
<title>Resolution Efforts</title>
<p><italic>Resolution efforts</italic> refers to situations where individuals take active steps to resolve a disagreement that has escalated, or otherwise act to restore positive relations between those in conflict. Resolution efforts mostly occur in incidents where there are misunderstandings or insults, although in one instance the original conflict was over a physical attack.</p>
<p>In some cases, the parties in conflict themselves took steps to reduce the chances that the dispute would evolve into something more severe. In one example, an insult between subordinates was deemed not important enough for a dealer to jeopardize his relationship with a good friend, a rival dealer.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>It was just gonna be a talk, it was a lot of shit talking ’cause we all grew up together and we know each other, so it’s like, you can’t tell me nothin’, I can’t tell you nothin’, but down the line we squashed it.</p>
</speech>
<p>In another dispute, an argument that threatened to get out of hand ended when one party said he was being misunderstood, and the other individual, his friend, decided to accept the account.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>John Brown:</speaker>
<p>Then he started saying “it’s not nothing about that, it’s not nothing about that.” So what you saying is, fuck it, forget you ah, forget, forget. We both stress—let’s go get a bag of smoke. Alright, come on.</p>
</speech>
<p>In other instances, a resolution effort can simply be solving the issue at the heart of a conflict. A dispute over the amount of crack proceeds was resolved by simply recounting. Although the challenged dealer was still angry, he had no reason to act on it as the main issue had been settled.</p>
<p>In two cases, resolution efforts are preceded by mediation; that is, there was third-party intervention into an escalating conflict. In each situation, the third parties helped individuals to redefine the situation as to make violence unnecessary or undesirable. Mediation worked in part because the participants were open to the reinterpretation. In one instance, the reminder of close relationships among friends of the main combatants helped the respondent to establish empathy with his opponent.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bob:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, they . . . yeah they told me . . . I don’t know what you thinkin’ about but don’t, don’t do nothin’ to him man ’cause his family, he loved his family and his mother you know what I’m sayin’? They like, you know, somethin’ happen to him they know we friends. They wouldn’t understand it, so the best thing for me to do is just forget about it.</p>
</speech>
<p>In Bob’s newfound understanding, he saw violence as an act to be avoided.</p>
<p>In the other instance, it appears that mediation worked due to an underlying unwillingness to engage in violence. Here, Fred and his friends were asked to fight on behalf of someone who was an addict, and also had a negative reputation, in this case for disrupting selling spots.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Fred:</speaker>
<p>. . . And also the brother that got jumped is a crack addict. He’s also an addict.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>And do you think that had anything to do with this situation?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Fred:</speaker>
<p>Maybe it did, because maybe he was standing around there harassing customers, or begging, or whatever, they don’t know, you know, as far as why did they jump him, you know what I mean.</p>
</speech>
<p>This, combined with the disputed ownership of the selling spot, perhaps weakened the desire to engage in violence. Thus, the impulse to commit or avoid violence is affected by the specific issues of the dispute. Simply put, if the stakes are not important, the need to fight lessens.</p>
<p>Among the events that ended violently, there were few attempts at mediation prior to physical attack. In the one case, mediation efforts were disregarded by the main combatant, who was highly angered at the time of the incident:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>No, my people was trying to break it up.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Okay, and what types of things were they saying?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>You don’t need this, you just got home, yo, let it, let it ride, you know how to take care of the business, just leave it alone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>And what were, did that influence you in any way?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>No, just made me madder.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What did you think about that, why did that make you madder?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>They were trying to make me don’t do something I wanted to do right then and there at that time.</p>
</speech>
<p>The respondent, Malik, earlier admitted to wanting to challenge his opponent.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>They say he was a violent person, so at that time, been going to him for a long time, I was making a reputation for myself.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>For what?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Malik:</speaker>
<p>Drug game, I was moving up in the drug games, I was a dealer, I was a . . . how you say, a manager, like somewhat enforcer, so I was just moving up, making a name for myself on the streets in the drug game, so they told me about him. I knew him from school, but I couldn’t see him as that type of person, so I just challenged him, like gonna take it to him, see how tough he is. I was known for shooting my gun, and hitting and just taking care of my business, so I like . . . ’cause I knew I was gonna take him, too, so I wanted to take his reputation.</p>
</speech>
<p>This reinforces the point that he was on a path, at the start of the interaction, to engage in violence whatever else happened. This demonstrates that for some disputes, the impulse to do violence can override earnest attempts at de-escalation.</p>
<p>This example brings into sharp relief the point that the ability to avoid violence via resolution efforts depends partly on the inclinations of the participants involved. Social relationships have an important influence on the desire to use violence. The hesitation by two people to disrupt a valued relationship leads them to grab onto ways of resolving any disagreements they may have. Alternately, a positive relationship can make mediation attempts more successful. Apart from any social connections, resolution attempts also work when the desirability for violence is not high in the first place. In these circumstances, individuals are more easily dissuaded from violence. Both tendencies are likely to be stronger where the seriousness of the original offense is low. However, once seriousness exceeds a certain level, resolution efforts may not work to prevent violence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An analysis examining drug business disputes as sequences of influence tactics produced findings on the progression of conflict, and it can vary for events of different outcomes. Both violent and nonviolent drug business disputes show patterns similar to Luckenbill’s stage model. Generally, these events show a progression of influence tactics, starting from minor ones (influence attempts/requests) and, based on the responses to the initial claim, proceeding to those of increased intensity (threats). The event concludes with either violence or some nonviolent alternative. However, the main difference between the two event outcomes is the presence and operation of violence-avoiding tactics, such as compliance and resolution efforts. The specific elements of this distinction are revealed in a comparative examination of compliance and resolution efforts occurring within nonviolent and violent disputes. Compliance associated with nonviolent outcomes is offered when there is a risk of continued noncompliance, and is accepted when there is enough flexibility for it to be seen as credible. Repeated or serious instances of inadequate or false compliance make it difficult for the offended party to accept last-ditch attempts at placation, and thus are linked to violence. Resolution efforts work when parties have a vested interest in not fighting, generally due to a valued social relationship. Resolution can also occur when mediation by trusted others leads participants to reinterpret an event so that violence becomes unnecessary, or when the main problem at the heart of the dispute is solved. Thus, looking at the progression of events helps to show that the overall context of a dispute influences whether certain actions occur, and how, as a result, particular outcomes emerge.</p>
<sec id="section15-0022042612456018">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The conflicts discussed here reflect the experiences of a small number of drug sellers from an urban setting. The sellers themselves were not chosen at random but were targeted based on their selling activity and involvement in violence. Furthermore, the conflicts that they described, and the ones that were analyzed in this study, were not a random sample of their dispute experiences. Thus, it would be hazardous to generalize these findings to other drug business disputes. Furthermore, drug sellers who operate in different locations (suburban or rural areas, for instance) or situational contexts (where guns are less prevalent) may experience different types of events than those provided by the men in this sample. Thus, their disputes could be driven by different factors from those found in this study.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the use of an all-male sample. The gendered nature of drug selling is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612456018">Dunlap, Johnson, &amp; Manwar, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456018">Fagan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456018">Hutton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456018">Maher &amp; Hudson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612456018">Sommers, Baskin, &amp; Fagan, 1996</xref>). Thus, gender cannot be discounted as an important element of drug business disputes. Specifically, expressions of masculinity specific to inner-city environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612456018">Mullins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612456018">Wilkinson, 2003</xref>) may have played a role in the type and nature of the influence tactics used by the men in this study. Men who sell drugs in non-inner-city settings may experience pressures to display different types of masculine images. Accordingly, the processes by which their business disputes unfold and conclude may differ from those seen here. The same may be said for female drug sellers. Given the precarious position of women in drug environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456018">Hutton, 2005</xref>), a sequence examination of their disputes may reveal different configurations of influence tactics (in particular, compliance and resolution efforts).</p>

<title>Research Implications</title>
<p>These findings have empirical and theoretical implications for research on violent situations in general, and situations in drug business environments in particular. Regarding empirical implications, the study results provide distinctive contributions to the larger research literature on drug selling and violence. Few studies have focused on assaults in research on drug selling and violence. Previous studies have largely focused on homicide or robbery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456018">Jacobs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456018">Riley, 1998</xref>). The violent events in this sample consisted almost exclusively of assaults. In addition, the sample includes drug conflicts with nonviolent outcomes, a little-studied research topic. Attention to processes underlying drug business assaults (and avoided assaults) is beneficial, as it provides a picture of behavior that is more common than is robbery or homicide. Thus, it better reflects the garden-variety experience of violence in drug selling. This is an important corrective to the general tendency in criminology to focus on activity that is at the serious end of the crime spectrum.</p>
<p>On a theoretical note, the findings echo those from past research on situations and violence. Elements of the situation, such as the reasons for conflict, the actions taken by the parties during the conflict, and the involvement of third parties all play an important role in leading a dispute toward or away from a violent end. Clearly, a comprehensive examination of violence (and its absence) requires attention not only to the dispositions of persons but also to the settings and contexts within which they act.</p>
<p>This work fits into a small but growing body of research that focuses on drug business violence as disputes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456018">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456018">2011</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456018">Jacques, 2010</xref>, for work in a similar vein). Violence in drug-selling environments can be viewed as one pole in a continuum of social control efforts, with nonviolent outcomes sitting at the opposite end. Exploring conflicts and the myriad ways they can be resolved without violence fits with an emerging effort to fully use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456018">Black’s (1998)</xref> theory of social control to explain aspects of drug market activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456018">Jacques, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456018">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). For example, Black’s hypothesis on the influence of relational distance on violence is supported by the findings of this study. A violent end to a drug dispute was less likely when the two parties were friends on otherwise on good terms. Alternatively, when the parties lacked a social bond, violence was more often the result. Dispute resolution was also linked to the social location of third parties, another important idea from Black. Echoing findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456018">Phillips and Cooney (2005)</xref>, successful third-party mediation in this sample is associated with crosscutting ties, where the third parties were linked to both sides. Partisan third parties, those linked to one side of the dispute, was a strong feature of the violent conflicts. Finally, the violent attacks linked to failure to compliance may be viewed as a form of discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456018">Black, 1998</xref>), although this idea requires more development.</p>
<p>The sample examined in this study is small, and does not permit detailed examination of the full range of conflict resolution strategies suggested by Black’s model. For instance, there is evidence that toleration (one do-nothing approach) is a common option that dealers use when faced with conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456018">Topalli et al. (2002)</xref> have found that victims of robbery in drug settings decide to forgo violent vengeance, either for fear of physical harm or because it would be, as one put it, “bad for business” (p. 348). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456018">Jacques and Wright (2011)</xref> have explored the business-related consequences of specific types of dispute resolution in greater depth. They theorize that the type of strategy chosen to address conflict affects the level of drug market activity. Violent retaliation (in the form of physical attack) can have costs in terms of reduced business (scaring away customers, for instance); negotiation, alternately, can preserve business (after a short-term falloff) by maintaining ties between the disputing parties. Other nonviolent strategies, avoidance and toleration, can dampen or heighten market activity, respectively. Future work should continue examination of the impact of these informal controls, in conjunction with other situational elements, on how drug sellers manage their business activities and the resulting consequences of those efforts.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>The policy implications of these findings are a little more complicated. One task of this research was to look at contextual factors in conflicts. How can this knowledge be helpful in policy making? One way would be to direct attention to factors that can be usefully addressed in reducing violence in drug market settings. It can also expand thinking about what should be the appropriate target of crime prevention. For instance, it may be worthwhile for law enforcement to attend to crimes occurring to drug sellers that, left unaddressed, can generate violence as retaliation. This follows the suggestions made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456018">Topalli et al. (2002)</xref> in their work on dealers and robbery. They assert that the failure to see criminals as crime victims sets up the potential for violent retaliation by pushing victims to engage in self-help. One could argue that if there were legal options to handle victimization, this would provide less of a reason to resolve the problem on the street. Of course, this is a more potent argument when the issue is violent crimes, such as robbery or rape, which have the potential for more serious consequences. However, it must be noted that even nonviolent offenses (e.g., theft) have the potential to lead to violent retaliation.</p>
<p>The study findings can be useful in other criminal justice-based prevention efforts. For instance, law enforcement can take actions to manipulate the environment to avoid some types of intractable conflict. As mentioned above, there are strong links between forms of drug-selling organizations and violence. Following suggestions made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456018">Curtis and Wendel (2007)</xref>, antidrug efforts by police can be geared toward shifting the configuration of drug markets from forms linked to conflict (such as street-based selling) to those that are comparably peaceful (such as delivery services). Such a shift may decrease the number and type of disputes, thus reducing the level of violence. This is not an unrealistic idea. Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612456018">Mazarolle, Soole, &amp; Rombouts, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612456018">Rengert, Ratcliffe, &amp; Chakravorty, 2006</xref>) has shown that problem-oriented policing strategies are more effective than traditional arrest-based enforcement for addressing drug markets and associated crime. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that such efforts may be able to reduce dispute-related violence associated with those environments. At the very least, the findings from this study help to make drug business disputes more comprehensible by reinforcing two points: They follow predictable patterns, and nonviolent outcomes are not an entirely unexpected result.</p>

<p>This was done for simplicity. Acts can obviously have multiple goals (e.g., hitting someone can also be viewed as an attack on a person’s identity), but it seemed prudent to choose the one that was most salient given the overall context of the incident.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0022042612456018">
<label>2.</label>
<p>For example, take an event where two people got into an argument, only to have it broken up by a mediator, with the two people departing the scene. The first interaction, say, a request for money owed, would be coded as “Step 1, influence attempt, initiator (AI).” If the response was a denial of having money, the code would be “Step 2, noncompliance, by the responder (BR).” An exchange of insults would be coded as “Step 3, identity attack by the initiator (CI)” and “Step 4, identity attack by the responder (CI).” If at this point, a bystander intervened in the argument, it would be coded as “Step 5, bystander mediation (FOTH).” If after the intervention, the responder walked away, this would be coded as the “Step 6, departure by the responder (ER).”</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0022042612456018">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Because a key focus is on factors affecting whether a first blow is drawn, for the violent disputes, the current discussion addresses only those steps occurring up to the point of the first attack. For the nonviolent disputes, all steps until the end of the interaction were included. This means that for some of the violent events, influence tactics were coded, but not used directly in the analyses described below. This also creates a bit of an imbalance, as in some situations, it was impossible to say that that the dispute itself truly ended in nonviolence. However, this does not detract from the primary objective, which is to examine whether the interaction proceeded and concluded without violence occurring, and identify the factors contributing to the variation in outcome.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0022042612456018">

<p>The general sequences were obtained by narrowing the focus to those cases where a tactics occurred for more than one event.</p></fn>
