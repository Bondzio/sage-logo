Tell them what DEC means to you. Send them a link to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dec-sped.org">www.dec-sped.org</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</title>
<p>What are Special Interest Groups? About a year ago, DEC launched an important initiative to engage our members in dialogue on key areas in early intervention and early childhood special education. SIGs provide an opportunity to meet other members who share your professional interests, share resources, and collaborate on projects. If you would like to join or find out more about these DEC SIGs, send an email to <email>dec@dec-sped.org</email>.</p>
