<abstract>
<p>The use of secondary task performance to assess mental workload in a primary task is appealing because the method clearly reflects a central goal of workload assessment – to determine what other functions an operator can undertake while satisfactorily performing the ongoing (primary) technical challenges of a job. For example, does a surgeon performing a suturing task have the cognitive reserves to maintain situation awareness, deal with unanticipated events, or coordinate the efforts of other team members? Unfortunately, secondary task measures have a reputation for being intrusive, artificial, and difficult to use. In the current article, we describe procedures to minimize these concerns, specifically when using an interval production secondary task. Although our suggestions for implementing interval production are based on experience in surgical training environments, the method is grounded in workload assessment research from a variety of other contexts over the past two decades. The methodology appears to be highly adaptable.</p>

<body>
<p>Interval production shows promise for evaluating the cognitive load on surgeons – or other operators – without the intrusiveness of typical secondary tasks.</p>
<p>The secondary task technique is an intuitively appealing approach to the measurement of mental workload. It assumes that if a person is simultaneously performing two tasks of different priorities, a reduction in the workload of the more important (or primary) task will make possible an increase in performance of the remaining (or secondary) task. Thus, changes in secondary task performance can, in principle, be used to infer changes in primary task workload.</p>
<p>To be clear, the purpose of this article is not to review the extensive human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) literature comparing performance-based measures of workload with physiological and subjective measurement strategies. Nor is our goal to introduce a totally unique secondary task. Instead, we aim to describe the issues we encountered when trying to use one seemingly simple secondary task to measure workload in one work domain: surgery. We hope that the methodical considerations we addressed in adapting a well-known secondary task to a new environment will help others who may want to use this same secondary task in their own projects or adapt other secondary tasks to new work domains.</p>
<p>For those still wanting a primer on the pros and cons of the major approaches to workload assessment, secondary tasks included, the sidebar on the next page lists several accessible resources.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804612466068">
<title>Mental Workload in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS)</title>
<p>We began our search for a suitable secondary task workload assessment method several years ago when we were asked to evaluate new display systems for MIS. At the time, usability tests of new surgical technologies focused mostly on the speed, accuracy, and economy with which surgeons could perform such fundamental skills as knot tying, suturing, and cutting. However, we felt that new technologies should also reduce the cognitive load imposed by these primary tasks.</p>
<p>In aviation, tremendous attention has been devoted to ensuring that pilots have the capacity to cope with a variety of secondary tasks while maintaining primary flight control. Likewise, in MIS, it was clear that surgeons needed the cognitive reserves to perform a variety of additional tasks. For example, while executing the delicate movements needed to partition a tumor from healthy tissue, surgeons also should be able to maintain situation awareness, anticipate problems, generate plans, coordinate the surgical team, and cope with a variety of stressors.</p>
<p>Although the rationale for measuring surgeons’ cognitive reserves seemed compelling, few surgical HF/E evaluations had actually used a secondary task criterion. After excluding our own studies, we found 28 surgical studies that assessed mental workload between 1994 and 2009. Of these studies, 86% employed subjective assessment techniques, but only 21% employed a secondary task. Although we cannot know for sure why secondary tasks were relatively rare, we suspect that it had something to do with their reputation as intrusive, artificial, and difficult to design and administer. We clearly needed to find a secondary task that would minimize these concerns.</p>
<p>We decided to focus our efforts on a secondary task – interval production – with a relatively long history of successful use in a variety of work settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804612466068">Baldauf, Burgard, &amp; Wittmann, 2009</xref>, for driving; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612466068">Liu &amp; Wickens, 1994</xref>, for monitoring). Research participants are simply asked to make a response each time they believe a target interval has elapsed. They continue to make the response – that is, to produce the interval – until the experimenter tells them to stop or until the trial ends. In general, as primary task workload increases, the intervals generated by participants become less accurate and more variable. Although our goal was to standardize the application of interval production to the surgical domain, we believe that our administration protocol, nicknamed “Vis Tempo,” may increase the method’s applicability to other settings as well.</p>

<title>Why Interval Production?</title>
<p>Anyone who has seriously considered assessing mental workload by measuring secondary task performance will have quickly learned that there are many secondary tasks to choose from, including auditory, visual, and vibrotactile detection; simple and complex classifications; mental arithmetic; memory search; manual control; and a variety of time estimation tasks. Given these options, why did we pursue interval production?</p>
<p>Interval production fared well when we considered the criteria by which workload measures are often judged (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1064804612466068">Wierwille &amp; Eggemeier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1064804612466068">Wickens &amp; Hollands, 1999</xref>). Most obviously, we needed a task that was likely to be sensitive to primary task demands. Interval production was a good bet because it engages a variety of mental resources, including those involved in goal maintenance, phonological processing (e.g., subvocal counts), and response execution. This property may explain why interval production has been used to assess workload successfully in so many primary tasks, whether piloting an aircraft or monitoring a process.</p>
<p>We knew that acceptability to surgeons would be especially critical, because the effectiveness of secondary tasks strongly depends on the motivation of research participants. Participants must be motivated to maximize joint performance on primary and secondary tasks and adhere to instructions about task priority. We consulted available MIS task analyses for possible secondary tasks that would have face validity for both surgeons and surgical trainees and found a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804612466068">Cynthia Dominguez (2001)</xref> that provided inspiration. Surgeons described the importance of their internal time keeping – their “mental clocks” – for assessing the progress of surgical procedures and deciding when to change strategies. Given the time pressures that characterize many other workplaces, the choice of a temporal secondary task would probably make sense to workers in other jobs as well.</p>
<p>Finally, we needed a secondary task that could be easily implemented and was unlikely to alter typical primary task strategies. A characteristic of interval production, unusual among secondary tasks, is that it is discretionary. That is, it involves no ongoing presentation of stimuli that may intrude on normal primary task performance, even when the participant wants or needs to ignore the secondary task. Another benefit of having a task that requires no external stimuli is that the need for specialized displays and presentation software is eliminated. Finally, the task can be easily modified to require pedal, manual, or vocal responses, further reducing unnecessary disruptions of the primary task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1064804612466068">
<title>Putting Interval Production into Practice</title>
<p>To understand how we actually used interval production in our research, consider the following instructions we gave to participants. Note that participants received these instructions after already having learned to perform their primary task, which involved manipulating small objects with surgical graspers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the next trial, you will perform both the surgical task and a time-keeping task. To mark the passing of time, you should say the word <italic>time</italic> each time you think that 21 seconds have elapsed. Keep doing this until I tell you to stop. You should start both your surgical task and your time keeping when I say, “Go.” Try to complete your surgical task as quickly and accurately as possible, and try to make your intervals in the time-keeping task as accurate and consistent as possible. Although you should try to do both tasks well, keep in mind that it is more important for you to maintain good performance in the surgical task.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although these sample instructions are sufficient for describing the task to research participants, they will probably leave researchers interested in actually using interval production with many questions. Some of the most important questions are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804612466068">Figure 1</xref>, where the general steps in a typical experimental trial are presented in a vertical flowchart on the left and associated methodological questions are presented, in parallel, on the right.</p>

</fig>
<p>When we first adopted the interval production task, we could find little practical advice about how to answer many of these questions; for example, how to select a target interval, instruct participants, or summarize time-keeping performance. Now, after having used the technique in a number of validation studies, our file drawers include both successes and failures, with the successes eventually coming to dominate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612466068">Grant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612466068">Grant, Carswell, Lio, Seales, &amp; Clark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804612466068">Lio et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612466068">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>After a critical review of the sometimes minor changes in procedures that characterized our experiments, we offer the following suggestions for implementing an interval production secondary task, with an eye toward “keeping it simple.”</p>
<sec id="section4-1064804612466068">
<title>Vocal versus manual responses</title>
<p>Most studies involving interval production ask participants to mark intervals by pressing a key or pedal. Because surgical primary tasks require the use of both hands, and sometimes foot controls as well, vocal responses were more appropriate for our application. Although we have not conducted a head-to-head comparison, both vocal and manual interval productions have been employed successfully as secondary tasks. The choice should be driven by the constraints imposed by the primary task of interest to the researcher.</p>
<p>If primary task demands permit the use of multiple response modalities, vocal responses have the advantage of lending themselves to very “low-tech” data collection solutions. In the simplest case, a researcher needs nothing more than a good stopwatch. With a little more time and money, an audio recorder and editing application can be used to measure produced intervals. Another option that fully automates the collection of vocal responses is a voice key and supporting software; however, in practice, it may be difficult to achieve acceptable response detection accuracy amid the noise of the training environment and participants’ irrelevant vocalizations.</p>
<p>A hybrid (semiautomated) solution for collecting data from vocal responses is to have an experimenter press a key after each of the participant’s responses, allowing close-to-real-time data entry and analysis. Although this procedure inevitably adds noise to the measurement process, we have found that correlations between intervals recorded in this way and those based on visual analysis of the individual vocal waveforms range from <italic>r</italic> = .96 to <italic>r</italic> = .99.</p>
<p>Those interested in automating their data collection and analysis can download “Vis Tools: Tempo,” a free application for use on iPhones and iPads, from the Apple app store. The application collects manual responses (generated either directly by the participant or indirectly by the researcher tracking the participant’s responses) by using the entire face of the mobile device as a single response key. Alternatively, a variety of time-keeping applications are available for downloading to other mobile devices for less than $5. We have found rowing timers to be particularly easy to repurpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1064804612466068">
<title>Performance metrics</title>
<p>Three types of measures were used to summarize interval production performance: measures of bias, absolute error, and consistency. Bias metrics describe the direction of interval production errors, revealing whether a participant is under- or overestimating elapsed time. Although bias metrics sometimes provide useful insights about the cognitive processes involved in subjective time keeping, they are not particularly sensitive to primary task workload. Instead, we would suggest using the percentage absolute error (PAE) to describe a participant’s overall accuracy and the coefficient of variation (CV) to describe the stability of his or her responses. (See the concluding summary for formal definitions.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1064804612466068">
<title>Target intervals</title>
<p>Intervals from a few seconds to a minute have been successfully used to detect shifts in concurrent task workload. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804612466068">Hart (1975)</xref> recommended using target intervals less than 30 seconds, and practically speaking, shorter intervals permit the collection of more data per experimental trial. However, it is possible to make target intervals too short. Psychophysical studies suggest that very short intervals cross a “breakpoint” at which interval production is reduced to a sensory memory task with little cognitive demand (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612466068">Madison, 2001</xref>). However, in practice, we have achieved acceptable sensitivity with target intervals as short as 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Although it appears that a variety of target intervals can be used, we caution researchers to avoid using intervals that are close to the duration of a salient performance outcome in the primary task, such as the time it takes to make a single suture in a suturing task. Participants sometimes report using the completion of such milestones as a response cue for the interval production task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1064804612466068">
<title>Number of produced intervals</title>
<p>To establish such basic experimental parameters as target interval and trial length, we must know how many produced intervals are necessary per trial to obtain stable estimates of interval production performance. Across a range of target intervals, we found that the effect sizes associated with manipulations of primary task demand approach their maximum when five to eight intervals contribute to summary performance measures. Our rule of thumb is to select a combination of target interval and trial length that will make it likely that at least five intervals will be produced by research participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1064804612466068">
<title>Strategy instructions</title>
<p>When we began using interval production, we told participants to avoid counting. We reasoned that counting was so overlearned that its use as a time-keeping strategy would make interval production performance relatively impervious to even drastic changes in primary task demand. But we were wrong. We found smooth trade-offs in performance between the primary surgical task and interval production performance as a function of task emphasis instructions even when participants reported counting. In fact, insistence that participants avoid counting actually reduced the sensitivity of interval production to changes in primary task workload.</p>
<p>Participants adopted so many different strategies (with some admitting to counting despite our instructions) that performance variability led our statistical tests to suffer under the weight of bloated error terms. We currently give participants no strategy instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1064804612466068">
<title>Practice and feedback</title>
<p>We usually give participants no more than three 90-second practice trials to produce the target interval. After each trial, we provide them with feedback about the mean duration of their produced intervals and the duration of their longest and shortest intervals. We also allow participants to perform interval production concurrently with the primary task for at least one trial before beginning data collection.</p>
<p>One advantage of using the CV to summarize interval production performance is that it makes it largely unnecessary to calibrate participants’ duration estimates through practice. Because CV uses the participant’s mean produced intervals rather than the actual target interval as a baseline, it is relatively unaffected by idiosyncratic tendencies to over- or underestimate interval lengths.</p>

<sec id="section10-1064804612466068">
<title>Summary of Suggested Procedures</title>
<p>As with any workload assessment procedure, the exact administration technique will depend on the nature of the primary task and work environment. The following procedural summary, therefore, is offered as a starting point for those wanting to adopt interval production and modify it for their own evaluation projects.</p>

<p>We hope that the low cost, flexibility, and relative ease of use of interval production will encourage human factors/ergonomics practitioners to take another look at secondary task performance as a measure of mental workload − or, more specifically, as a measure of operators’ cognitive reserves. With the availability of free or low-cost mobile apps to support data collection, the method is also freed from the constraints of the lab and can be used in a variety of field settings where traditional secondary tasks would be difficult to implement.</p>
