<abstract>
<p>The records of 377 men civilly committed under Illinois’ Sexually Violent Persons Act were compared with similar published samples from seven other states. Civilly committed sexual offenders in Illinois were more likely to be diagnosed with any personality disorder and more likely to exceed the cutoff score for psychopathy than similar offenders in other states. The authors then present a national composite of demographic, victim, and diagnostic information on men referred or pursued for civil commitment in eight states to better understand how these individuals differ from sex offender populations in correctional settings. Results suggest that there may be less victim specificity in sexually violent person (SVP) populations, as although nearly 50% of SVPs are diagnosed with pedophilia, 80% had committed at least one sexual offense against a child or adolescent victim. Across all samples, 72.7% of SVPs were diagnosed with a personality disorder, with antisocial personality disorder the most prevalent.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past two decades, sexual offending has become an increasing focus of negative media attention and public fear. In response, states have pursued a variety of legal strategies to protect American communities from the potential threat of sex offenders being released from incarceration or confinement. One controversial approach has been the passage of civil commitment laws for sexually violent predators. To date, 20 states and the Federal government have enacted laws that allow for the involuntary civil commitment of sex offenders who are considered to be at a high level of risk for reoffending. Although sexual predator laws have been in use in a few states since the 1930s, a second generation of sexual predator laws began appearing in the early 1990s, with 75% of these statutes being enacted in the past 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11415509">Jumper, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals who meet the legal criteria for civil commitment are commonly designated as sexually violent predators or sexually violent persons (SVPs). Although the specific language used in the laws varies slightly across jurisdictions, there is a relatively consistent process under which a sexual offender can be indefinitely confined following the completion of his (or her) prison sentence or in a few cases, after forensic confinement as an insanity acquittee.</p>
<p>Typically, three criteria must be met to qualify as an SVP: (a) conviction for a sexually violent offense committed against an adult or child victim (or found to be “delinquent” or “not guilty by reason of insanity,” etc.); (b) presence of a mental disorder or mental condition, which predisposes the individual to sexually offend; and (c) the mental disorder creates a high probability that the person will commit new sexual offenses in the future due to serious difficulty controlling behavior. Applying these three criteria to offenders facing release from prison produces extremely small samples of individuals who end up civilly committed as SVPs. For example, in Illinois, less than 2% of sexual offenders released from prison each year are referred. The third criterion related to risk for future offending accounts for the most noticeable differences between the different state SVP laws, and has been the source of debate regarding the level of probability associated with future risk when evaluating eligibility for civil commitment. SVP laws remain controversial, in part due to disagreement over the meaning of the key constructs of mental disorder, predisposition, prediction, and serious difficulty controlling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11415509">Elwood, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Two challenges have emerged for clinical professionals seeking to manage this new category of sexual offenders. One is determining how SVPs differ from other sexual offenders and to what degree they comprise a homogeneous group for programmatic treatment. The other challenge is determining the most effective methods to manage and treat these high-risk offenders given the intricate constraints of the laws governing their civil commitment. The recent and rapid implementation of SVP laws has forced state authorities to begin treating and managing SVPs before these challenges could be fully addressed.</p>
<p>There is a small but growing literature related to the SVP commitment process and demographic, diagnostic, and risk profiles for individuals committed or considered for civil commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415509">Vess, Murphy, and Arkowitz (2004)</xref> compared SVPs in California to a group of sex offenders who were forensic psychiatric patients with mental disorders, mentally ill prisoners, and people found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity. They found that 10.1% of the SVPs had a severe mental illness and that the prevalence of psychopathy among the SVPs was not significantly different from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11415509">Hare’s 1991</xref> male inmate samples. In examining psychopathy scores more closely, they observed that the mean scores on the Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R) for rapists and offenders with both child and adult victims (“mixed offenders”) were significantly higher than those of child molesters.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415509">Elwood, Doren, and Thornton (2008)</xref> compared the diagnostic and risk profiles of 331 SVPs in Wisconsin held under that state’s sexual offender statute with committed and referred sexual offender SVP samples from Washington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11415509">Jackson &amp; Richards, 2007</xref>), Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11415509">Becker, Stinson, Tromp, &amp; Messer, 2003</xref>), and Florida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415509">Levenson, 2004</xref>). This study found notable differences between the sexual offenders held in Wisconsin and those held in other states, including the frequency of pedophilia and paraphilia “not otherwise specified” (NOS) diagnoses and psychopathy scores. In addition, antisocial personality disorder (APD) and personality disorder NOS were diagnosed less often in Wisconsin than in the other state samples. Mean scores on actuarial risk measures in Wisconsin also differed from those found in Washington and Florida. These authors suggested that either the diagnostic and risk rates for SVPs vary naturally across states or that states differ in how they assess risk levels for convicted sexual offenders and/or apply criteria that identify candidates as sexually violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415509">Elwood et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study examining evaluator trends in scoring the PCL-R, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11415509">Boccaccini, Turner, and Murrie (2008)</xref> reviewed the records of 321 sexual offenders referred for possible civil commitment in Texas, the only state that exclusively uses an outpatient model to manage its SVPs. Similar to published data from other state SVP programs, pedophilia was the most common Axis I diagnosis in the Texas sample. APD was the most frequent Axis II condition, with 54.8% carrying this diagnosis. The average PCL-R score for the whole sample, 23.01 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.61), was significantly lower compared with 24.43 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.82) for the 71 pursued for civil commitment.</p>
<p>The present study contributes to the growing body of national demographic and diagnostic data about SVPs for an improved understanding of how civilly committed sexually violent predators may (or may not) be distinguished from other sex offender populations. The study describes sexual offenders who have been detained or committed under Illinois’ SVP law since its inception in 1998 in terms of demographics, diagnoses, level of psychopathy, intellectual functioning, and victim information. Results are compared with published reports from seven other states on available variables.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11415509">Schneider (2008)</xref> suggested that documentation of SVP program components and offender characteristics is also important for the continuing development of best practices in the treatment and management of SVPs. As a step toward this goal, this study presents a conceptual composite profile for a national sample of SVPs based on published data from eight jurisdictions with civilly committed sexual offenders to help clarify the most salient factors that may distinguish SVPs from other sexual offender populations. This profile information may be useful in advancing programmatic and policy development and best practices in the field, including ways to promote increased community safety, evaluate the effectiveness of civil commitment laws and programs, and better identify treatment needs, management approaches, and other relevant factors unique to this population.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0306624X11415509">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The offenders included 377 men detained or committed under Illinois’ Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (725 ILCS 207) between January 1998 and August 2008. One female sexual offender committed under the act was excluded from the sample. All individuals in the sample had been convicted of at least one qualifying felony sexual offense and were involved at various stages of the civil commitment process. Available clinical and legal files were reviewed and coded for the variables examined in the study. Of the final sample of 377 sexual offenders for whom records were available, 229 (60.7%) had been committed under the act and 148 (39.3%) were detained following a finding of probable cause and either awaiting trial for final commitment proceedings or released prior to commitment. Both detained and committed offenders were included in the sample because in Illinois, the vast majority of detained offenders eventually become committed as SVPs. The Department of Human Services Forensic Institutional Review Board approved the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X11415509">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Demographic information was collected from the offenders’ clinical and Department of Corrections (DOC) files and maintained in a Microsoft Access database. Diagnoses were collected from two sources depending on the status of offenders’ consent for treatment. For those who had agreed to participate in treatment, diagnoses were obtained from comprehensive pretreatment psychological evaluations that were completed by facility psychologists involved in the treatment of the offenders, as treatment evaluations included psychological testing and offender interviews, thus generating a more thorough diagnostic profile. For those offenders refusing treatment, diagnoses were transcribed from their most recent psychological evaluation prepared for the court by independent state psychologists not affiliated with the treatment program.</p>
<p>Data regarding number of sexual convictions and victim age and gender were collected from available records and collateral self-reports documented during the course of treatment. Intelligence scores were also collected from the pretreatment psychological evaluations, consisting of either Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised (WAIS-R) or WAIS-III scores, depending on the date of the test administration. PCL-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11415509">Hare, 2003</xref>) scores, when available, had been completed by DOC psychologists conducting an initial SVP evaluation for the courts prior to a finding of probable cause.</p>
<p>We then compared the Illinois SVP sample with available published data from seven other state civil commitment programs on available variables using appropriate statistical procedures (two sample <italic>t</italic> tests, π<sup>2</sup>, etc.). These studies included samples of individuals evaluated and referred for consideration in Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11415509">Boccaccini et al., 2008</xref>) and Florida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415509">Levenson, 2004</xref>) or pursued for civil commitment in Wisconsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415509">Elwood et al., 2008</xref>), Washington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11415509">Jackson &amp; Richards, 2007</xref>), California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415509">Vess et al., 2004</xref>), Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11415509">Becker et al., 2003</xref>), and Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11415509">Janus &amp; Walbeck, 2000</xref>). For discussion purposes, we present a composite data set on available variables by averaging the findings from all eight states included in the study.</p>

The mean age of the Arizona sample was 44.8 years, and the Minnesota sample mean age was 38.3 years. Offenders in the full national sample ranged in age from 21 to 78 years, with a mean age of 45.7 years (<italic>SD =</italic> 11.4).</p>
<p>The majority of the Illinois sample was White (66.1%), followed by African American (28.8%), Hispanic (3.4%), and Other/Unknown (1.3%). For comparison purposes, SVPs were categorized as either White or all other racial minority groups. Using this approach, the Illinois sample was found to have a comparable percentage of racial minorities to that observed in Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11415509">Becker et al., 2003</xref>), California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415509">Vess et al., 2004</xref>), and Wisconsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415509">Elwood et al., 2008</xref>) but fewer racial minorities than Florida and Texas, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 927) = 13.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, as well as significantly more racial minorities than Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11415509">Janus &amp; Walbeck, 2000</xref>), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 493) = 10.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>IQ scores were available for 261 offenders (69%) in the Illinois sample. The mean Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) score was 91.1, with a standard deviation of 15.6 and a range of 55 to 134. The mean Verbal IQ score was 89.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 16.1) and the mean performance IQ was 94.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.7). There was no significant difference in intellectual functioning between child molesters, rapists, or mixed offenders in the Illinois sample. The mean FSIQ was in the average/low average range similar to that of the Wisconsin (FSIQ = 89.3) and Arizona (FSIQ = 95) samples. In the Illinois sample, 26.9% showed intellectual functioning at the borderline level, similar to that in Wisconsin (28.5%) but more than twice that of the Washington sample (12.6%). However, the percentage of individuals functioning at the mildly mentally retarded level in Illinois (7.7%) more closely resembled the Washington sample (4.7%) and was about half the rate of that found in Wisconsin (14.2%).</p>

<p>Illinois, California, and Washington reported PCL-R data separately for SVPs with victims in different age groups. Pedophilic offenders in Illinois tended to be notably more psychopathic than similar offenders in California, <italic>t</italic>(195) = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and Washington, <italic>t</italic>(151) = 4.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Similarly, the percentage of SVPs with child victims only whose PCL-R scores exceeded 30 was significantly higher in Illinois (32.7%) than in California (10.9%) or Washington (7.1%), χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 252) = 24.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Illinois, California, and Washington were found to be comparable on PCL-R mean scores and percentage of SVPs with PCL-R scores exceeding 30 among SVPs with adult victims only and SVPs with both child and adult victims. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the relatively small number of SVPs with both child and adult victims might have limited statistical power to detect significant differences. For example, the percentage of SVPs with both child and adult victims with PCL-R scores above 30 was found to be 52.4% in Illinois, 30.5% in Washington, and 26.0% in California, but these differences were not found to differ significantly as the samples contained only 20 to 40 offenders each.</p>
<p>We also examined PCL-R scores in Illinois for different offender types by treatment participation status. For those who participated in treatment, there were no significant differences in psychopathy between SVPs with child victims only or mixed offenders. However, treatment participants who victimized only adults were significantly less psychopathic than similar offenders who elected not to participate in treatment (<italic>t</italic> = −2.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Overall, 65.5% of the 85 SVPs in the Illinois sample with PCL-R scores above 30 chose to participate in treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that SVPs in Illinois were more likely to be diagnosed with any personality disorder (93.9%), especially APD (53.3%), and showed higher levels of psychopathy than other state SVP programs with published diagnostic data. The Illinois sample had both higher mean PCL-R scores and a higher percentage meeting the threshold for psychopathy, especially among pedophilic offenders. Although 37.8% of Illinois’ sample of 229 SVPs exceeded the more rigorous definitional threshold of 30 or higher on the PCL-R, 64.8% exceeded the more common threshold for sexual offenders of equal to or greater than 25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11415509">Doren &amp; Yates, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11415509">Langton, Barbaree, Harkins, &amp; Peacock, 2006</xref>). No similar data were reported in any of the other samples for comparison.</p>
<p>There was some Axis I and Axis II diagnostic variance between states, which may be partly attributed to sampling differences. The Florida and Texas samples included those referred for possible commitment, many of which were later not pursued for commitment. This could in part account for lower rates of Axis I and Axis II disorders in these samples. The remaining samples included individuals who were detained after a finding of probable cause pending civil commitment and/or those actually civilly committed. The Minnesota sample included individuals committed across two different generations of civil commitment laws. Although samples from eight states were included in the analyses, the variables reported were driven by the focus of each study. Our comparisons were limited to the number of states reporting particular variables. For example, six of the eight states present psychopathy data from their samples. Four of those six samples break down psychopathy scores by victim type, and three report percentages of SVPs exceeding the cutoff score of 30 by victim type. Other differences between state SVP populations may reflect different diagnostic practices, issues of diagnostic reliability, and/or different statutory language in sex offender civil commitment laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415509">Elwood et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize the common features among the published SVP samples, we created a national composite profile of diagnostic and demographic information. The composite profile was calculated by averaging the number of SVPs from each sample measuring the variable being assessed. Across all jurisdictions with published data, victim information was the most similar category describing SVPs. This is not surprising because the same victim information is strongly emphasized in the actuarial risk assessment measures commonly used in SVP cases across the country. The national composite SVP sample was diagnosed with pedophilia and paraphilia NOS with roughly equal frequency. This suggests a high rate of victim crossover or less victim specificity among SVPs when examining both convictions and uncharged or unreported victims.</p>
<p>The occurrence of noncontact paraphililas in the national composite sample is likely to underestimate the prevalence of these conditions as noncontact paraphilias are not typically considered to be qualifying mental conditions for civil commitment. Sexual sadism is also likely to be underrepresented because it requires a detailed understanding of the offender’s arousal pattern, including the requisite fantasies and urges. This information must either be inferred from the offender’s behavior, overtly admitted, or documented through the use of a physiological measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11415509">Richards &amp; Jackson, 2010</xref>). Such data are not usually available at the time the diagnoses in the samples examined here were made. When present in an offender’s history, sexual sadism and noncontact paraphilias are often discovered later during the course of treatment.</p>
<p>Although SVPs are a unique population of offenders, several other countries, including Canada, Scotland, Australia, Norway, and Germany, have similar legislation that confines dangerous offenders (both sexual and nonsexual) for indefinite periods of time. Commonly referred to as “preventive detention,” this confinement process is, with the exception of Australia, invoked at the time of sentencing for the most recent offense. Although descriptive reports are available from these countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11415509">Wormith &amp; Ruhl, 1986</xref>), only one published study of 57 sexual offenders in preventive detention in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11415509">Habermeyer, Passow, Puhlmann, Vohs, &amp; Herpertz, 2009</xref>) measured diagnostic information on sexual offenders. These authors report that 32% of their sample of 57 sexual offenders in preventive detention were child molesters; however, only four individuals were diagnosed with a paraphilia and two were diagnosed with a substance addiction. A total of 14 (25%) offenders were diagnosed with APD.</p>
<p>The percentage of the national SVP sample diagnosed with Axis I mood disorders is lower than the 31.1% found to be mood disordered in a sample of 45 outpatient and residential pedophilic offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11415509">Raymond, Coleman, Ohlerking, Christenson, &amp; Miner, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11415509">Carlstedt et al. (2009)</xref> reported that 28% of their sample of 162 incarcerated child sexual offenders in Sweden were diagnosed with a mood disorder. For psychotic disorders, the national SVP composite rate was slightly higher than the 2.2% reported in the outpatient/residential sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11415509">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>) but much lower than the 11% reported in the Swedish sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11415509">Carlstedt et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415509">Vess et al. (2004)</xref> reported that 10.1% of their sample suffered from either a psychosis or a severe mood disorder.</p>
<p>Approximately one half of the national composite SVP sample carried a diagnosis of any substance-use disorder. This is consistent with substance abuse and diagnoses rates in incarcerated sexual offenders as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11415509">Gutierrez-Lobos et al. (2001)</xref>. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11415509">Raymond et al. (1999)</xref> sample, only 4.4% had a current psychoactive substance disorder diagnosis, but 60% had a substance-abuse diagnosis at some point in their lives. In a sample of 120 sex offenders in a prison psychiatric treatment program, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11415509">Young, Justice, and Edberg (2010)</xref> reported drug and/or alcohol abuse at 88%, with 78% of those abusing multiple substances.</p>
<p>Personality disorders are present in approximately 70% of the national composite sample with APD occurring most frequently. The Minnesota and Wisconsin samples showed a much lower frequency of personality disorders, and with these states removed, the average personality disorder in the other four states reporting this information exceeds 84%. Most state SVP programs report extensive use of the descriptor “with antisocial features” in conjunction with the diagnosis of personality disorder NOS. This diagnosis is often tendered in the absence of historical information that allows for verification of the behavioral history required for a full APD diagnosis. In Illinois, for example, 75% of the sample is diagnosed as either APD or personality disorder NOS with antisocial features. In a mostly outpatient sample of pedophilic offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11415509">Raymond et al. (1999)</xref> found that 60% were diagnosed with an Axis II personality disorder, with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder appearing most frequently (25%), followed by APD (22.5%).</p>
<p>In a sample of 241 paroled sexual offenders in London, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11415509">Craissati, Webb, and Keen (2008)</xref> found that 37% showed personality dysfunction sufficient to warrant possible diagnoses of personality disorders, with 24% displaying antisocial features. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11415509">Dudek, Spitzer, Stopsack, Freyberger, and Barnow (2007)</xref>, in a small sample of sexual offenders treated at two maximum security forensic hospitals in Germany, found narcissistic personality disorder to be the most common Axis II diagnosis (36.8%), followed by APD (26.3%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11415509">Carlstedt et al. (2009)</xref> found that 59% of their sample of incarcerated child sexual offenders in Sweden was diagnosed with a personality disorder.</p>
<p>The national SVP composite PCL-R score of 24.2 was virtually equivalent to samples of sexual offenders reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11415509">Hare (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11415509">Porter et al. (2000)</xref>, and slightly higher than the mean score of 22.1 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11415509">Looman, Abracen, Serin, and Marquis (2005)</xref>. The composite score was much higher than mean scores reported on incarcerated or community samples of sexual offenders, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11415509">Langton et al. (2006)</xref> having reported a mean score of 15.6 in their sample of released offenders and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11415509">Serin, Malcolm, Khanna, and Barbaree’s (1994)</xref> having reported a mean score of 15.3 among incarcerated sexual offenders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11415509">Craissati, Webb, and Keen (2008)</xref> found a mean score of 11 in their sample of sexual offenders on probation.</p>
<p>Illinois had significantly more SVPs whose PCL-R scores met or exceeded the more rigorous cutoff of 30 than the other two samples reporting this information. The national SVP composite shows 30% exceeding the 30-point psychopathy threshold score, which is similar to a sample of sexual offenders in prison psychiatric treatment (28%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11415509">Young et al., 2010</xref>). The level of psychopathy among pedophilic offenders in Illinois is notably different than the national composite SVP data. Research has consistently shown that sexual offenders who victimize adults (rapists and mixed offenders) have higher psychopathy scores than those who offend exclusively against children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11415509">Olver &amp; Wong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11415509">Porter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11415509">Prentky &amp; Knight, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415509">Vess et al., 2004</xref>). This, in fact, holds true in the national SVP composite as well as in California, Washington, and Wisconsin. However, in Illinois, the mean scores by victim type did not differ significantly from each other, and a much higher percentage of pedophilic offenders had PCL-R scores exceeding the 30-point criterion for psychopathy. Similar to results found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11415509">Porter et al. (2000)</xref>, mixed offenders in the Illinois SVP sample included a higher percentage of psychopaths than did the rapists.</p>
<p>Examiner difference on the PCL-R may account for some of the significant variation between the Illinois total sample mean scores and those reported by other states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11415509">Boccaccini et al. (2008)</xref> found that 30% of the variance in the Texas SVP scores was accounted for by examiner difference. Other factors may also contribute to this finding. PCL-R scores on 40% of the Illinois sample of 377 SVPs were not available, and file reviews suggested that PCL-Rs were not completed at the time of initial referral for civil commitment. Although the PCL-R is now routinely administered as part of an SVP initial precommitment evaluation in Illinois, this was not always the case. It is possible that earlier decisions to complete PCL-Rs were based on factors that have impacted the overall distribution of scores for the Illinois SVP population. In the early years of this civil commitment program, evaluators may have only administered the PCL-R after a file review suggesting psychopathy as a likely risk factor, thereby inflating the mean by limiting the number of offenders with potentially low scores from the available data set.</p>
<p>Of the 20 states, 8 with sex offender civil commitment laws have published at least some data describing various clinical features of their SVPs. Comparing and combining this information allows professionals working with civilly committed sexual offenders to compare their own states’ population with those across the country and promote a better understanding of the unique characteristics that can inform both administrative policy and clinical practice in the identification, assessment, treatment, and management of these sexually violent predators. Diagnostic and demographic information from other states with SVP laws and more detailed information expanding beyond that already published in articles included in the present study will allow a more systematic and detailed analysis of SVPs receiving treatment in the United States. The reporting differences in the studies included in the national SVP composite suggest that a centralized process to uniformly collect such data would increase the utility of available information. The Sex Offender Civil Commitment Programs Network, an organization of professionals working with SVPs established to facilitate collaboration and data collection, is in the early stages of developing such a system.</p>
<p>Comparison between SVPs and other sex offender samples was limited by the small size and the heterogeneity of the samples available, and few American studies reported diagnostic information on sex offenders. Therefore, larger scale comprehensive descriptive studies on offenders from homogeneous prison and community samples in the United States would allow for a more relevant comparison between SVPs and other sex offender populations.</p>
