<abstract>
<p>This article makes an argument about chiasmatic knowledge production that seeks to cut across the entrenched division between the subject and object of inquiry, on the one hand, and the narrative and normative authority of the scholar, on the other, that is inherent in most writing in international relations. We revisit our own research encounter in the field of European security to explore the premises and implications of fieldwork relationships between researchers and practitioners and show their potentially transformative effects. Classifying such engagements as acts of professional transgression by both sets of parties overlooks their promise to facilitate the understanding of security practice ‘from within’ and to provide for tangible scholarly and political criticality. It is argued that, in the restricted realm of security, extensive interaction with practitioners could be a proxy for participant observation. Yet, we look further than that. We develop a concept of ‘chiasmatic crossings’ that reflects and helps theorize the ideational give-and-take and conceptual ruptures in the process of co-authorship that are indicative of distinct trajectories in European security research. This challenges the knowledge claims and static positions of both ‘problem-solving’ and ‘critical’ scholars in the field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has long since become banal to acknowledge that we are not single authors of our knowledge claims. However, international relations scholars have yet to adequately consider the significance of the mutually constitutive relationship of experience, interpretation and representation in fieldwork encounters in the framing of narratives of security and insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470295">Jacoby, 2006</xref>: 173). Although we are trained to frame the input of scholarly literatures on the shape of our argument, the role of those met in the course of fieldwork remains as obscure as ever. The concealment of security policies from the public view strengthens this effect, as it is often believed that where ‘access’ is hampered by a lack of security clearance, the researcher needs to engage context-specific cunning. And, while ‘policy advice’ (problem-solving) type researchers are criticized for simply reproducing hegemonic discourse or acting as a second-level securitizing actor, ‘critical’ researchers too often seem to perceive a need to outwit their interlocutors. It is either about getting to what ‘really happened’ or about getting beyond false constructions of security discourses to better address the ‘real’ security problems. The false barriers that are constructed between the researcher and the object of inquiry bolster the illusion of discovery and the investigative thrill of being someone in the know, as was well captured in Cohn’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612470295">1987</xref>: 704) initiation into the world of defence intellectuals. The result for both ‘mainstream’ and ‘critical’ research is further entrenchment of the normative and narrative authority of the researcher: a lonely but centrally positioned wise (wo)man with a penetrating view and a talent for abstraction, exercising scientific practices upon the object of inquiry or choosing not to reproduce existing power relations by refusing to work within their framework.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612470295">1</xref></sup> Our research suggests that there is another way, one that avoids these pitfalls as it tiptoes and stumbles through the real encounters between practitioners and researchers of security.</p>
<p>In the milieu of powerful elites, scholarly authority may not seem politically harmful. It should even appear as a rightful and corrective countervailing force. And yet it results in what Vrasti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612470295">2008</xref>: 287), in her criticism of Cohn, identifies as the inability to come to terms with the fact that the social world is not a laboratory one can report on without becoming a part of it. To keep her narrative (and normative) authority intact, Cohn’s interlocutors are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures uttering researcher-selected theses. What the resulting account secures is the researcher’s grip on truth claims, in a well-cultivated international relations tradition of scholarly authorship. Even self-proclaimed critical schools of thought perpetuate the pattern. The manifesto of critical approaches to security in Europe, collectively written with the intention of assembling different forms of knowledge, features only scholars among its authors. Their reflexivity centres on locating the self in a broader heterogeneous context through abstraction and thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612470295">c.a.s.e. collective, 2006</xref>: 34–5). This type of writing, which focuses on the process of understanding how security orders are constituted, conceals the making of the self by the author and smuggles in an omnipotent view on social reality. It disavows the relational quality of research in which interlocutors are <italic>de facto</italic> co-authors. In other words, the c.a.s.e. collective’s approach reflects international relations’ lagging behind the reflexive turn in anthropology of the 1980s, which brought to the fore the process of knowledge production as source of claim-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612470295">Vrasti, 2008</xref>) and the questioning of the arbitrary authority of the scholar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470295">Clifford, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we – a former practitioner and an academic in European security studies – revisit our original encounter in European security research to better articulate the situated and interrelational character of knowledge production in this area and to highlight its specificity. Initiated in fieldwork, the encounter between the practitioner and the researcher brought together different sensibilities and modes of sense-making, which evolved into a mutual writing project, published as a journal article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470295">Kurowska and Tallis, 2009</xref>). The revisit brings out the transformative effects we experienced in the process: of relinquishing sovereignty and monopolistic authority on the part of the researcher, and engaging different ways of knowing and understanding on the part of the practitioner. In this twofold problematization, the position of the researcher is decentred. Concomitantly, the deterministic or doom-laden image of the ‘professional managers of unease’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612470295">Bigo, 2002</xref>) – the way in which European security practitioners are depicted in the ‘critical’ literature, where they appear as the automaton executors of neoliberal discourse and creators of ever-more-fearsome institutional practice – is also questioned. To address the condition of knowledge production where interaction leads to transformation in those involved in the inquiry, we develop the concept of ‘chiasmatic crossings’ and explore the normative dilemmas and potentialities that they trigger in security research. The performativity of chiasmatic crossings excludes what the definition may suggest at first – that is, simultaneous exchange on equal grounds. Rather than perfect switching of equals, the fragmentary character of chiasmus reveals contextually specific and unstable power relations.</p>

<sec id="section2-0967010612470295">
<title>Reflexivity revisited in chiasmus</title>
<p>The revisit we perform draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470295">Burawoy (2003)</xref>, who conceptualizes an ethnographic revisit as a return to the site of a previous study. The revisit foregrounds a discrepancy between earlier and later accounts, explained by (1) the changes in the positions and the relations between the observer and the participant, (2) theory brought to the field by the ethnographer, (3) internal processes in the field itself, and (4) forces external to the field site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612470295">Burawoy, 2003</xref>). Our vector cuts across the first three dimensions as we build an explanation from data generated interactively during our field interaction and joint writing. It is based on field notes of various kinds, email exchanges, roughly ten drafts of the 2009 article, and reflections on past and ongoing communication. These are both the site and the fodder of our analysis. Unlike Burawoy, but similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612470295">Vaughan (2004)</xref> who returns not to the <italic>site</italic> of her historical ethnographic research but to her research <italic>experience</italic> to think reflexively about her interpretive practices, we re-engage our encounter and thus develop the ‘experience as site’ approach. This is to better grasp the dynamics of our respective <italic>habitus</italic> in the construction of security claims and how the process affected our research sensibilities and later trajectories in the field of European security. ‘Understanding from where, with what kind of dispositions and with what kind of strategies [we as] observers are selecting from and interpreting the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470295">Leander, 2002</xref>: 602) reveals significant research choices – and, in our case, significant interpretations and co-adaptation of each other’s contributions. It also allows for a critical evaluation of the participants’ interested actions as cultural producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470295">Eagleton-Pierce, 2011</xref>) and constructors of frameworks of meaning.</p>
<p>Such inquiry demands reflexivity, which is not exclusively the researcher’s ability to cultivate a critical approach to his or her own understanding and research practice, or in general to his or her way of being and acting in the world. Rather, such reflexivity also calls for reflexive methodology, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612470295">Jackson (2011)</xref> as a dialectical interplay between social conditions and explicit attempts to delineate them, theorizing one’s own location to expose the ways in which knowledge is implicated in the social order and foregrounding unresolved tensions with situated knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612470295">Jackson, 2011</xref>: 200). In order to make such a reflexive move, we develop the concept of ‘chiasmatic crossings’. In rhetoric, chiasmus (from the Greek for ‘to shape like the letter X’) is the figure of speech in which two or more clauses are related to each other through a reversal of structures in order to make a larger point. In genetics, a chiasma is a point of contact between chromosomes during meiosis where two chromatids interchange corresponding segments. This exchange of genes between chromosomes results in a mixture of parental characteristics in offspring. In human anatomy, the optic chiasma is the point at which the optic nerves cross in order to facilitate the transfer of images to the appropriate side of the brain, thus facilitating clear vision. Crucially, the clinical meaning of chiasmus alludes to the possibility of depth perception. Out of two images, the brain creates a three-dimensional representation, not merely another view from a different angle. In chiasmus, 1 + 1 = 3(D).</p>
<p>The multi-metaphor of a chiasma or chiasmus brings into sharper relief two defining features of many fieldwork encounters in European security research: belonging to a common space of overlapping interests and the nature of knowledge production, which nuances the coherent authorship of the scholarly narrator. The concept of chiasmatic crossings thus allows us to turn the critical logic of inquiry upon ourselves at two levels: as participants of the European security research field (broadly conceived) and, more specifically, via a clinical analysis of our joint writing. Experientially, the concept reflects the evolution of our fieldwork<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612470295">2</xref></sup> from a quasi-philosophical elaboration of what is already, if obscurely, known, to ‘a post-philosophical exploration of the adequacy, even the very relevance, of what one has learned, or at least come to suspect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470295">Faubion, 2009</xref>: 156). In such inquiry, the ontological categories that secured the analytical plausibility of ‘the great divide between Self and Other from Malinowski through Bourdieu are effectively vacuous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470295">Faubion, 2009</xref>: 150). In contrast to ‘participant objectivation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470295">Bourdieu, 2003</xref>: 282), the concept of chiasmatic crossings introduces an alternative imaginary of contextual reflexivity and criticality. Inevitably ambiguous and fraught with tension, as our work illustrates, it seeks to clear the path for discussing co-production of knowledge in European security without the stigma or heresy of political, institutional or methodological transgression.</p>
<p>In what follows, we first ground our research aims by introducing our <italic>mise-en-scène</italic>, making the case for the relevance of the perspective that we take before moving on to discuss the article we co-authored. The discussion showcases a chiasmatic scenario that emphasizes the openness and vulnerability of both the researcher and the practitioner. The empirical vignettes explore the chiasmatic space of our research encounter by looking at how we forged, construed and affected each other’s reading of several key metaphors that structured the research site. This method borrows from the strategy of multi-sited ethnography developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612470295">Marcus (1995)</xref>, in which a particular metaphor is re-engaged in different locations, but seeks to decentre the narrative authority of the researcher that such a strategy may end up reinforcing (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470295">Cohn, 2006</xref>). Our discussion and reflection on the three constitutive metaphors (‘Potemkin Europeanization’, ‘constructive ambiguity’, and the ‘EUBAM family’) bring out the different meanings that both parties attached to them and highlight facets of the chiasmatic crossing between the researcher and the practitioner. Although our inquiry has geographical gravity, the readings of the metaphors take place at the junctures between the field as constructed by the researcher and how our ‘connectivity’ reconstructed it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612470295">3</xref></sup> The notion of the ‘field’ that we thus espouse is not autonomous from the ‘fieldwork’ through which it is ‘discovered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612470295">Amit, 2000</xref>). It is constructed amid other possibilities of contextualization, through constitutive relationships of which the researcher is part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612470295">Amit, 2000</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Despite clear divergences between the researcher and the practitioner, many of the insights that materialized in the final article prove impossible to attribute to one party or the other. In this co-constitutive and transformative mode of data generation, the researcher often finds him- or herself in doubt as to whether he or she is not guilty of some sort of intellectual dishonesty or appropriation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612470295">4</xref></sup> Bringing out dispositions, our material is necessarily social in the sense of what contemporary social theory after Bourdieu calls <italic>habitus.</italic> But, in acknowledging the openness to becoming part of the other’s professional <italic>habitus</italic>, the critical reflexivity of this form of research embraces rather than estranges the intertwinement of the subject and object of study, enmeshed in the backgrounds, situations, self-images and desires of the parties involved.</p>

<title>A landscape</title>
<p>The landscape of European security research demonstrates a dynamic interaction between academic researchers, think-tank analysts, and various EU and national security practitioners. A growing number of academic consortia comprising variable geometries of participants cooperate on a range of different projects that often include ‘fieldwork with practitioners’, a feature equally pertinent for many doctoral theses in the field. The feedback loops from EU Framework Programmes have brought about additional interaction between researchers and practitioners in the security field. Many of the actors recognize each other’s language, and some may operate with a different vocabulary or tone of voice depending on the particular hat they are wearing at the time. Conversing in Brussels has often become a strange experience of having concepts ‘taken out of one’s mouth’, with interviewees framing their experience with the help of academic theories. Although perhaps less conspicuous or explicit outside of Brussels, in the ‘theatres of operation’ of European security policies, the overlap between the practices studied and the intellectual apparatus of the observing researcher makes traditional research strategies inadequate. Quantitative techniques could supply large amounts of aggregated data on the characteristics of the actors involved, but they apply exogenous categories that hardly reflect the specifics of the field. A double hermeneutic wherein scholars interpret the interpretations of their objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470295">Giddens, 1976</xref>) does not capture the dynamic politics of the research encounter in which different parties negotiate their positions. From another perspective, warnings about the dangers of ‘going native’ seem ill-defined and inadequate when many trajectories have been intertwined even before the research encounter.</p>
<p>Current default positions among researchers in the security field tend to be demonstrations either of expertise in a particular subject by more policy-oriented researchers or of critical authority among scholars invested in exposing the dominant structures of meaning and their consequences. Policy actors and security professionals are framed accordingly as either impotent, when they fail to implement policies properly, or omnipotent, when the researcher is invested in unmasking the dangerous effects of the dominant discourse they reproduce. These two modes converge in a transcendental positionality of relatively independent observers. Yet, in the context of their ‘cultural intimacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612470295">Herzfeld, 1997</xref>), the representation of the researcher as independent of his or her interlocutors, with his or her subjectivity autonomous of the research process, is untenable. With data being neither objective nor subjective, but rather generated socially in complex dynamics between the researcher and the researched, the enmeshment itself becomes researchable material. The failure to embrace it hitherto constitutes a distinct hiatus in European security research. The co-dependence of actors – in relation to, among other things, the ways and means of knowledge generation, their ensuing embeddedness, and the ultimate breakdown of the subject/object distinction – is little explored and any such exploration is potentially unwelcome as a political and/or methodological transgression. The first aim of this article, then, is to question this constitutive assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0967010612470295">
<title>An article</title>
<p>The second aim is to better articulate our experience of knowledge co-production by turning the critical logic of inquiry upon ourselves. Several years ago, we wrote an empirical article in the field of European security studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470295">Kurowska and Tallis, 2009</xref>). It described the origins and some of the practices of the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Ukraine and Moldova (EUBAM), launched to encourage management of the Ukrainian–Moldovan border in line with EU practices and standards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612470295">5</xref></sup> Though the authors first encountered each other as part of the researcher’s reconnaissance, by the time of writing the researcher was working as an intern in the European Commission Delegation to Ukraine and Belarus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612470295">6</xref></sup> in Kyiv for her postdoctoral fieldwork, while the practitioner had recently resigned from his position as a strategic analyst in EUBAM headquarters in Odesa.</p>
<p>We received an award for the article,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612470295">7</xref></sup> which was something of a Pyrrhic victory as, in a certain sense, the article was a hoax, although the hoax was internal to our research relationship rather than a deception played upon an external audience. The problematization of a particular fragment of social reality that we attempted seemed to have been a platform, or indeed an excuse, for a different kind of research encounter. The researcher sought a way into a particular part of the European security field, and the writing engagement was a way of getting at the logics and practices of that field. The practitioner, struggling with the ‘surplus of meaning’ that working in the field produced and seeking a sabbatical to make sense of the work and its wider implications, saw the writing engagement as a productive way forward. The negotiation between these trajectories and yearnings proved transformative. Yet, revisiting the process confronts us with the ‘zero degree writing’ that, in retrospect, it seems we authored. A term borrowed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612470295">Doty (2004)</xref> from Roland Barthes to describe the international relations convention of voiceless writing of the concealed yet regulated self, this conveys well the form that we imposed on the 2009 article. It might have won us the prize, but it also exposed the ‘maladies of our souls’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0967010612470295">8</xref></sup> stemming from our respective dispositions while obscuring the charged and political process that brought the article into being.</p>
<p>Yet, the form did not entirely determine the content, labelled as it was a ‘Eurocentric genealogy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470295">Levy, 2011</xref>: 155). Ironically, the label captures well the chiasmatic scenario and the ambivalence we continue to grapple with. Taken in the negative way intended, ‘Eurocentric’ implies bias towards the reproduction of the existing order,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0967010612470295">9</xref></sup> while ‘genealogy’ relies on the idea of imploding that order by showing how it came about and revealing the normal to be contingent. The label oscillates between classifying the article as exemplary of a problem-solving approach and suggesting that it is able to identify the effects of EU hegemonic discourse on the practices of Eastern European border guards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470295">Levy, 2011</xref>: 154–5). Our account thus appears to be dangerously close to policy and, at the same time, to be able to ‘see through it’. Clearly, in the 2009 article, we lacked the vocabulary to explicate this double bind. The present revisit is part of our search for adequate grammar and lexis to articulate it as enabling rather than paralysing and to show how it may serve to theorize quotidian political criticality in engagement with, rather than estrangement from, security practitioners.</p>
<p>This appreciation does not erase recognition that ours may have been a ‘dangerous liason’, reflecting commonly held notions of ‘living dangerously’ on the verge of transgression that would risk scholarly authority and adherence to professional codes of conduct. It is not lost on us that we instrumentalized each another: in the research pursuit, in the search to perhaps unconsciously co-opt to a way of sense-making, but also in the intellectual and emotional self-interrogation to which the other may have served as a midwife. Much of this interaction occurred and remains in the ‘shadows of fieldwork’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470295">McNean and Leibing, 2007</xref>), in situations where the borders of personal reflection and professional (field)work begin to blur and the research field loses its boundedness. Much of what we generated may thus qualify as ‘unuseable data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612470295">Hamilton, 2009</xref>), impossible to use explicitly as concrete articulations of broader analytical problems precisely because of the conditions under which they were generated. Yet, such data form a central part of the ethnographic endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612470295">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 74). They are ways of problematizing the inquiry and conceptualizing its objects within an emergent research design.</p>
<p>In our case, part of this problematization concerns the confronting of constitutive tensions: the possible self-indulgence and the dilemma of second-order securitization that any researcher-operative in the security field activates by his or her mere presence in a social constellation. To the extent that the present article reflects on our research encounter and the associated ‘maladies of our souls’, it is admittedly therapeutic for us. It is, however, hardly self-indulgent in the sense of the standard criticisms levelled at any approach that takes the self as an important tool of inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0967010612470295">10</xref></sup> It explores instead the experience of the researcher for insights into the sociopolitical and the inherently relational character of knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612470295">Brigg and Bleiker, 2010</xref>). But, as we foreground ourselves, we also experience throughout what, referring to auto-ethnography in international relations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612470295">Inayatullah (2011)</xref> aptly captures as striking a precarious balance between a triumphant self and a defeated self. The revisit of the 2009 article’s Pyrrhic victory is about the recognition of what kind of rules of the disciplinary game we instantiated. As such, it is also less of a classical auto-ethnography. It approximates instead an account that cracks ‘open the culture and the fieldworker’s way of knowing it so that both can be jointly examined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470295">Van Mannen, 1988</xref>: 102). Such a research encounter symbolizes the relational knowledge production whose exploration has been neglected in the field of European security. It is thus therapeutic in the Wittgensteinian sense of an inquiry as learning to ‘see connections’ previously overlooked rather than operating with an empty construct of abstract criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470295">Wittgenstein, 1958</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0967010612470295">
<title>Crossing our hearts: Chiasmus and connectivity</title>
<p>The shift to a relational knowledge production does not erase affect. We both got our ‘hearts broken’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470295">Behar, 1996</xref>) in the personal and professional struggles that coincided with the site of research and crystallized in a chiasmatic form, as we each had to surrender dearly held ideas and positions. The most crucial axis of these struggles concerned ‘the normative dilemmas of writing security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612470295">Huysmans, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The researcher was well versed in critical writings on security, a believer in the constitutive role of language and yet increasingly invested in the practical activities in the field as an intern dealing with the EU’s border-management issues. She had feared throughout her fieldwork becoming too much like her interlocutors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0967010612470295">11</xref></sup> but she sought engagement to understand the internal logic of the field. Picking up its language was not a revelation as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470295">Cohn (2006)</xref>. It was contingently appropriate, if often chilling: an eligibility criterion for ‘getting it’, strategically in terms of being taken seriously by practitioner colleagues and substantively for ‘learning by doing’ to ‘get the feel of the game’. In such engagement, there was no circumventing of the dilemma of co-writing security. The practitioner took a different route, retreating from the professional practice of writing (and doing) security when, in the specific context of the mission, it was no longer bearable. He was keen to understand his dissatisfaction conceptually and to find ways in which to address it practically. Enchanted by a first encounter with ‘critical’ theory, he sought refuge in academia, where he had to struggle to prove that he was more than a ‘mere’ practitioner. But, this respite in the safe port of academe did not last long, and in summer 2012 the practitioner-turned-researcher returned to EUBAM headquarters in Odesa to conduct fieldwork as part of his own doctoral project. Upon this distinctly sub-Macarthurian return, he was confronted with the jointly authored 2009 article more often than with the project-specific information he had provided to potential participants. The article had almost become ‘required reading’ on the mission and had been circulated in advance of his generally warmly welcomed visit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0967010612470295">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Is our 2009 article a case of a (‘successful’) second-order securitization as we operated with dominant security understandings? If it is, then it is necessary to ask whether the search for a new vocabulary to articulate specific conditions of chiasmatic knowledge production is a justification for performing such an act. As we reflect on this question throughout the revisit, we rest on the premise learned through fieldwork that although withdrawal is a temporary option, transcendence is an illusion. In a security constellation, it is the ‘working through’ of dilemmas that is often the primary form of a research argument. The pursuit of transcendence, in the form either of expertise or of the monopolistic claim to a penetrating critical view, is an obstacle to understanding that obscures the implication of the researcher. This does not mean that chiasmatic crossings are about surrendering to political co-option. Close interrogation of the researcher’s subjectivity and positionality actually creates the space for immanent critique. This position develops the traditional perspective of Copenhagen securitization theory, which sees a contradiction between seeing threats as socially constructed and failing to acknowledge the researcher’s role in constructing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612470295">Wæver, 1999</xref>). If we take social construction seriously, we must include ourselves in the reckoning. The subject position and subjectivity of the knower needs to be worked through if a scholar is to adequately grapple with the ambiguous placement of humans as both the subject and object of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612470295">Brigg and Bleiker, 2010</xref>: 784). Constructivist scholars have a duty to analyse their own positionality and how ‘all assumptions embody ethical ideas and judgements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612470295">Lynch, 2008</xref>: 712). Attending to this ‘ethics of connectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470295">Faubion, 2009</xref>) within the space of a fieldwork relationship adds a significant vector to such analysis. These vectors are our chiasmatic crossings that, while distinct, are not separable, reflecting the constitutive tension of this kind of knowledge production.</p>

<title>Border crossings? Chiasmatic encounters in the field</title>
<p>The formation of field relationships, formed from repeated research encounters, goes beyond gaining access to otherwise security-shielded information and should not be seen as a mere proxy for what the security-uncleared researcher is barred from seeing. Rather, such relationships constitute the processes and pressures through which the social order of the research field reveals itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612470295">Burawoy, 1998</xref>: 17). In Jacoby’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470295">2006</xref>: 171) words, ‘the research encounter is an intersubjective process through which subject positions are negotiated and politics of the broader context are played out in microform. The negotiation of the fieldwork encounter is itself a basis for creating knowledge’. Analytically, three interrelated dimensions shed light on these effects: (1) the mutual exposure and research interaction as the source of knowledge production; (2) the contingent co-generation of the research account with fieldwork interlocutors; and (3) the issue of vulnerability understood as the porousness of subjectivity.</p>
<p>Exposure encourages the investigation of meanings in action, as well as the identification of how they are communicated and variously interpreted. It provokes the acceptance of the possibility of multiple and incommensurable meanings, the role of tacit knowledge in the communication of values and feelings, and the expressive as well as instrumental character of practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612470295">Yanow, 1996</xref>: 224). In ‘the field’, contingent social interaction is the means of generating such understandings. As the researcher leaves the comfort of the office, the compilation of a ‘finding’ ceases to follow a blueprint and the argument is likely to take sharp unexpected twists. When data collection and analysis, traditionally separated, become symbiotic and concurrent activities, however, the urge to conceptually pacify the ‘surplus of meaning’ magnifies and needs to be guarded against. The researcher has classificatory tools, but he or she is vulnerable to different guises of co-option and probably oblivious to the indigenous logic and the changing map of contingent, institutional and political alliances at work. The notion of vulnerability signifies something even more fundamental for research practice – that is, that the research report and the researcher’s subjectivity come jointly into being within the research process. The researcher transforms in the process of research, potentially also having a transformative effect on his or her interlocutors. The latter are affected as they must first learn to explicate their own cultures and become self-conscious about doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470295">Rabinow, 1977</xref>: 152). More than an anxiety-driven term, such vulnerability acknowledges that the knowing self is partial in all its guises, never simply there and original, and therefore able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612470295">Haraway, 1988</xref>: 596). It rejects the fallacy of the immaculate, preformed individual and allows for interrelational identity formation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470295">Butler, 2005</xref>) while we each still retain a particularity as we forge our unique paths of attendance and association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612470295">Ley, 2002</xref>: 73).</p>
<p>In the practice of fieldwork, this may take the shape of generative but not necessarily clearcut ‘transmutation[s] of sensibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612470295">Csordas, 2007</xref>). Different from flashes of insight, apt translation, feeling at home, attaining fluency, relaxed comfort or true friendship with one’s interlocutors, such moments are about the experience of being struck by a modality typical of the setting in which one is working, in terms of both the form this experience takes and its relevance for the setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612470295">Csordas, 2007</xref>: 106). Such moments are not about ‘going native’, although they are about dropping the knowing or unknowing pretence of being an absolute stranger. Showing the mutual implication and unstable delineation of the object and subject, such moments do not signify the erasure of difference either. There remains an element of incommensurability that underlines any researcher–researched relationship in fieldwork, particularly when there are incompatible or discordant worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470295">Jacoby, 2006</xref>: 155). In our case, such discordance manifested itself as dissent from each other’s ways of knowing as we engaged in negotiating and asserting our credentials, dispositions and desires. It invoked the terrifying and thrilling feel of ‘trans’: the bordering moment of being in between two worlds, as in any transformative encounter with the Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470295">Naficy, 2009</xref>: 126). Yet, we never became one another. This also points to another sense of trans – perhaps that of the transvestite – as we dared to try on each other’s clothes, with the researcher seeking acceptance in the community of practitioners and the practitioner keen to walk the halls of academe.</p>
<p>Research experience of this kind affects further trajectories – to an extent as shadows that crowd one another’s discourse with uncomfortable accents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470295">Bakhtin, 1982</xref>), but more as coming to terms with different mechanisms of sense-making without crushing them in a swift and dismissive classificatory move. It is in this sense that the potentially productive and transgressive trajectories of the chiasmatic crossing become clearest. Underpinned by the vulnerability created by openness and combined with a restraint born of fear of irrevocable transformation, the desire to see from the other’s point of view offers a three-dimensional representation.</p>

<title>Marking the spot: Tracing the chiasmus</title>
<p>Odesa in Ukraine marks the geographical centre of gravity in our research relationship, although this is not where we spent most time together, or even most of our respective research time. It is where the EUBAM mission is headquartered, where the practitioner worked, and where we initially met as the researcher passed through on the lookout for a new project. This is where she decided her site was, although she would never return for an extended period. Instead, for ‘security reasons’ and on the insistence of one of the many security gatekeepers, she ended up as an intern at the European Commission Delegation in Kyiv, which supervises the Odesa mission, from where she later travelled to EUBAM in the course of her new function. This (imagined) Odesa is a formative yet imperfectly bounded site of encounter and entwining, which also encompasses Prague and Kyiv, where the decision to write together – for reasons of catharsis and creation – was taken. Yet, the unquiet ghost of this imagined Odesa returned to haunt the practitioner’s visit, as a researcher, to EUBAM in 2012.</p>
<p>More than through geographical bounding, however, a researcher’s dynamic positionality crystallizes through a different interplay: between the dispositions, the impression management with field interlocutors, and the tension between the desire to define the situation through theoretical classification and the reality of dealing with the often fragmented or multivalent surplus of meaning that escapes such easy classification. Here the meticulous mapping of the study site and subsequent choice of angle seem unrealistic, or potentially arbitrary. Fieldwork of this kind should rather be viewed as purposeful, yet not pre-instrumentalized, thus explicitly recognizing that no one party holds the cognitive monopoly. To the contrary, the security field and those who work this milieu are tied together by their ways of knowing and deceiving, their seeing and their blindness, their visions and delusions. As will be seen below, these are not fixed. They are neither institutionally nor academically mandated. Those who constitute the field and do the fieldwork need not be, respectively, the automaton executors imagined in some of the critical literature nor the detached dreamers of caricatured problem-solving imaginaries.</p>
<sec id="section9-0967010612470295">
<title>‘Seriously, who told you that?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0967010612470295">13</xref></sup> – Delusions</title>
<p>The strongest thread that seems to have conditioned the encounter is the illusion of dealing with a ‘reality’ that can be concretely apprehended and represented, even if our ‘realities’ diverged substantially. The researcher believed in the need to do some detective-type profiling work, and the reconstruction of the story of a particular EU security mission was supposed to reveal an underlying logic of European security-making beyond the context of that mission. The overwhelming contingency of the mission’s practice, the multitude of actors and their often clashing interpretations quickly disabused her of this illusion. It would have been tempting to resolve such chaos by retreating into a disciplining theoretical or ‘critical’ abstraction, but the close engagement with practitioners and the nature of highly proximate theorizing excluded this option as a fraud.</p>
<p>The practitioner was initially keen to give the researcher a better grasp of the reality on the ground beyond the reporting available in the public domain in order to expose what he perceived as the ‘deeper’ reality beneath the mission’s highly controlled public communication and tightly managed image. However, his professional integrity demanded that this be done without betraying confidences or relationships within the mission. But, he too was presenting an equally controlled and purposive ‘reality’. Both were incriminated in pursuing their respective sets of appearances, which is not to say that these appearances were devoid of either importance or impact.</p>
<p>Over time, the encounter cracked open our respective conceptual limitations. This fractured opening occurred around several metaphors that proved meaningful at the intersection of the academic discourse and the local lexis. ‘Potemkin Europeanization’, a term coined and used ‘in mission’ by the practitioner to express his disenchantment with the progress of ‘reform’ and the lack of what he perceived to be genuine engagement across the board, also had important effects for the researcher’s claim-making. At face value, it concerned a straightforward argument about externally assisted statebuilding, where every party engages in making positive appearances for the sake of boosting their own image and justifying the spending or requesting more funding. Yet, at the level of inquiry, it laid bare and left wanting the assumption of both mainstream and critical scholars about the homogenous and moulding effects of the EU norm transfer. The researcher entered the field equipped with the ‘empire in denial’ thesis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0967010612470295">14</xref></sup> and stubbornly clung to it through much of the fieldwork. However, in situ, she faced the glaring overestimation of the impact and competence of the EU security policy missions by academics. She recoiled from the empirical and conceptual impoverishment the thesis enforces on the political situation on the ground, to the extent that it ceased to justify the beauty of parsimonious abstraction. For the practitioner, the death of an illusion took a different form. He lost faith in soft-power Europe and became persuaded by elements of the ‘empire in denial’ argument, reflecting his dissatisfaction with the disparity between stated purpose and actual practice on the mission. A point in a draft of the 2009 piece about the EU providing ‘a front for Potemkin Europeanization’ reflects this shift. It introduces a concern that the presence of a mission such as EUBAM, allied to EU rhetoric, may be instrumentalized in reverse by the partner countries and used to create a façade of progress to the detriment of people living in those countries. Eventually, the term served as a way to start making sense of the multifaceted politics on the ground.</p>
<p>Another theme under the rubric of illusion crystallized in lengthy discussion over how to square in the article our contrasting views on the measurement of the mission’s impact, otherwise quite a typical preoccupation in policy writing on European security. Here, the reverse of the conceptual shift mentioned above occurred. The researcher entered the field with a strong conviction of the arbitrariness and dangerous character of measurement as a disciplining practice, which she regarded as concealing political and epistemological violence under allegedly neutral, standardized technical benchmarking. She was thus radically suspicious of typical activities of project implementation that focus on designing impact-measurement schemes. She also dismissed the conventional problematique of the gap between policy design and implementation. When coherence is seen as a political assumption and implementation as a performative enterprise, the claim to erase the gap is suspect. The vision of policymaking as inherently non-transparent and contingent made the ‘constructive ambiguity’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0967010612470295">15</xref></sup> that surrounded the mission hardly remarkable for the researcher. Yet, such framing met with resistance of the managerially experienced practitioner who worked daily with figuring out how to conceive of, measure and manage the influence of the mission, and how to use this knowledge to make it do better. Over time, the practitioner came to better understand the possibilities that such technification has for shrouding highly political activities in the depoliticized managerialism of project implementation, although he never saw himself as a passive implementer and repeatedly emphasized the possibilities for the exercise of latitude in professional decisionmaking, to the sometimes unbelieving researcher.</p>
<p>With the researcher’s internship and her own incorporation into writing terms of reference for project management, her steadfast opposition to impact measurement changed. This was not, however, in the way described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470295">Cohn (2006)</xref>, who caught herself using the vocabulary she had previously baulked at – a revelation that inspired a reflection on socialization into a particular speak and thus ideational framework. In this case, the researcher feels that it may have had more to do with adopting an attitude of ‘contingent appropriateness’ in a situation where learning the vernacular and the local rules of the game are ways towards insight from within. More pressingly, vis-à-vis the urge to contribute to the well-being of local communities that may benefit from concrete projects, unreflexive dissent remains ultimately unsatisfactory.</p>

<title>‘You always try to impress one another’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0967010612470295">16</xref></sup> – Salvaging split identities</title>
<p>Succumbing to political message is a taboo for scholarly ethos. All too often, the assertion of this ethos comes at the cost of intellectual violence through detached appraisal based on secondary sources. The researcher was overly wary about being seen as having been co-opted into a particular political and managerial project that would merely reproduce the given order. This would be a clear mark of losing critical approach. She hence put extra effort to edit indications of such a possibility. The need to salvage scholarly identity meets the corresponding urge on the part of the practitioner, whose professional integrity existed in (partial) separation from the state of his belief in the particular mission. It involved a justification of why he did what he did in the context of EU discourses on the mutual benefit of bringing the EU’s neighbours into alignment with the Union’s values and promoting ‘peace and prosperity’ through the transfer of best practices in good governance, security and border management.</p>
<p>The balancing of professional belonging and self-worth with a desire to distance oneself from particularities perceived as contra to such values surfaced in another metaphor we adopted from the mission discourse, ‘the EUBAM family’, which became a foil for a broader reflection within a chiasmatic encounter. Employed to breed a sense of corporate loyalty, jokingly it also alluded to a patriarchal culture and the tendency to both guard the mission from external criticism and soothe grievances within its own ranks. The practitioner grappled with how it feels to function within a dysfunctional professional family while being also required to salvage its image and retain a belief in his own professionalism and the ‘contribution’ that he (and the mission) both were making. He expressly sought refuge in the attitude of ‘private ironist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612470295">Rorty, 1989</xref>), a position often held by practitioners. Caught in a discourse particular to a site, they make sense of their position therein and make deals with themselves about how to construe it. Their cognitive precariousness translates into an in-between in relation to an internalizing of specific grammar and its ideational structures. It also reveals, appropriately for a family analogy, the numerous yet obscure local games, rifts, alliances and shifting fortunes of corporate constituencies, which unsettle any oversimplifying way of understanding an institution such as a mission.</p>
<p>The researcher engaged the metaphor of the ‘EUBAM family’ to explore the inside/outside between the academia and the field, and more specifically to negotiate her attempt to be adopted within the extended family in her quest to understand the EU’s security practice. The crossing of the boundary by an academic bystander seeking access to understand more, as she tended to frame her position, was not awaited with baited breath. Eventually, the attempted crossing into practice clashed with the researcher’s need to preserve her self-image as an intellectualizing outsider, a possibility this article rejects. The illusion of access into an institution, particularly a security-related establishment, is a rite of passage in any fieldwork. Yet, the realization that the researcher deprives herself of the ability to better grasp the logic of the field by sticking with the entrenched vocabulary of a trained European security scholar came only later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, both parties engaged in a particular form of impression management in order to argue their cases in a self-convinced manner. At face value, professional identities seem strong, stable and relatively transparent. However, they can crumble or liquefy under close examination of the conflicting drives that often underpin them. Our research encounter exposes the illusory nature of self-containment of professional identities. To be sure, each party has powerful tools to potentially bring in closure – conventionally by theoretical classification and judgement or by political dismissal of the irrelevant ivory tower, although ultimately making recourse to these tools constitutes an act of defensiveness. In coming to terms with the interactional generation of knowledge claims, the notion of the researcher as his/her own major tool of inquiry should not be conflated with the researcher’s manipulation of the practitioner to extract information, or the practitioner using the researcher to sell a political message. Such deliberate or unwitting conflation keeps obscure the contingent co-construction of knowledge claims and purposeful, but not really controlling, character of interaction. Likewise, such processes should not be understood mechanistically to conjure up an image of well-delineated if occasionally neatly restructured subjectivities, a reifying move amounting to an intellectual counterfeit. Rather, the effects are dynamically constitutive, processual and not easily demarcated.</p>

<title>‘Can we please stop capitalizing the Mission?’ – Each other’s dissenters</title>
<p>The final language we arrived at in the article bears the scars of our struggles. Peppered with the academic jargon of the theories espoused by the researcher at the time, overall the article adopts a communication style that resembles that of the EU’s internal reporting, a feature that we see as partly responsible for the article’s ‘success’. Language obviously does much more than describe what we provided a narrative of. It does identity work and becomes part of social action. It is as inherent in the reproduction and change of this social reality as it is integral to subjectivication. The negotiation over academic and EU speak engaged deeper-rooted modes of representation and mobilized our respective scholarly and practitioner’s dispositions, triggered by the urge to salvage our respective self-images. However, as subsequent drafts of the article revealed, the trajectories of our chiasmatic crossings to ‘the other side’ increased room for negotiation and saw us follow the uncannily comprehensible language of the ever more familiar other.</p>
<p>Our protracted argument about whether to capitalize the word ‘Mission’ is symptomatic of the challenge over how to deal with the mission’s framings in the scholarly text. One would capitalize in the EU’s reporting style, but it is awkward in a scholarly text that seeks to deconstruct such a style both analytically and politically. Obvious as it is, the role of language as subjectivity marker needs problematizing. The use of language becomes analogous to making moves in a game.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0967010612470295">17</xref></sup> The acts of dissent from the academic community and the EU’s reporting style that we performed were possible because of the belonging to the common if divided space of European security research. The contentiousness required translations and interpretations, but our positions were not incommensurate. The possibility of communication had much to do with our respective – to an extent, haphazard – trajectories within the field.</p>
<p>As the practitioner later remarked to the researcher-turned-intern: ‘I’m sure you capitalized the Mission while putting together project summaries’. She had. In the process, she learned not to equate practitioners who did the same with simple throughputs of any ideational structure. A categorical analytical distinction between the internalization of discursive frameworks and instrumental rationality proved a blind alley for a contextual explanation. Starting from a position of bewildered and exasperated ignorance as to, for example, why anyone interested in improving the outcomes of EU security policy would waste time speculating about the souls of Ukrainian B(b)order G(g)uards, the practitioner grew to describe much of his experience in Foucauldian terms. In a conversation, we know what each other means, but recognize the contingent appropriateness of these understandings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The enmeshment of diverse participants in European security research constitutes a condition in which the researcher becomes a participant observer, or even observer participant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612470295">Kurki (2011)</xref> sees interaction with the practitioner as a potentially rewarding research experience. But, in many segments of European security research, it is a co-constitutive rather than a supplementary gaze into a different world. To designate this condition as mere co-option or ‘going-native’ is, fundamentally, to miss the chiasmatic nature of knowledge production in the field and keep obscure the construction of its arguments. It strengthens the conservative academic perspective, present also in critical approaches to European security, wherein the researcher’s way of knowing is seen as utterly superior to other ways of knowing. The centrally located knowing subject continues to exercise his or her knowing practices upon the reproducers of the dominant EU discourse on security.</p>
<p>By redescribing the conditions of knowledge production in the field of European security, the notion of chiasmatic crossings addresses its inherent dilemmas and brings up the question of subjectivity formation as a result of interaction. The concept makes it possible to better align ontology and methodology to avoid contradictory moves where intersubjective ontology is compromised by a positivist model of inquiry premised on a ‘view from nowhere’. If the analyst is no more capable of transcending his or her embeddedness than any of his or her interlocutors, collaborators, epistemic partners, critics, rivals or doubles are themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612470295">Brelia, 2009</xref>: 152), then the notion of chiasmus articulates and confronts this constitutive tension. The façade of estrangement of the researcher from his or her interlocutors is shattered, exposing his or her conceptual paternalism and the need to re-examine the classificatory urge. The utopian fantasy of a tidy account is likewise exposed, encouraging the examination of social practice from within. The dynamics of interaction sensitizes the practitioner to different ways of seeing security practices and breaks the institutionalized power of monolithic framings in which he or she is embedded. In the context of European security research, symbiotic knowledge production is more likely, and our encounter proved particularly transformative, enabling the articulation of the concept of chiasmatic crossings. Such conditions may not extend automatically to other social landscapes, yet, with its tangible rejection of ‘the view from nowhere’, the concept speaks to other fields dealing with social facts.</p>
<p>Chiasmatic crossings are both thrilling and inherently dangerous. They contain a terror of intimate transformations. Things are messy, awkward, transient and suspect. If, however, the ethical dilemma lies at the feet of the analyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612470295">Wæver, 1999</xref>), abstract criticality is not sufficient. Cartesian radical doubt, or the empty self-reflection of an abstract self, may quite perversely distort the view, as it applies too strong a shield, a <italic>cordon sanitaire</italic> that cleanses meaning. There is no way out of the ‘normative dilemma of writing security’ in the world where actors are simultaneously interlocutors and investigators, beneficiaries and benefactors. Instead, closely monitored engagement, exposure and tangible dealing with vulnerability is a way towards more profound quotidian political criticality. Yet, as Brigg and Bleiker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612470295">2010</xref>: 785) argue, such inquiry requires a self-aware willingness to draw upon a full range of faculties. Among these, being vulnerable and susceptible, arguably the least desirable qualities in fieldwork on security, may mobilize intuition and emotion that help cure the ‘maladies of our souls’.</p>

<p>Refers to the title of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612470295">Doty (2004)</xref> and her own reference to the writings of Julia Kristeva.</p>

<p>On a different note, use of the adjective ‘Eurocentric’ to describe an article on European affairs by European authors for a European journal specializing in European studies seems both obvious and redundant.</p>

<p>See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612470295">Naficy (2009)</xref>, from which this expression was taken, for a discussion of the fear of ‘fraternising with the enemy’ (practitioners) with whom one has much in common.</p>

<p>The practitioner-turned-researcher was also surprisingly confronted with the article when checking into his Odesa accommodation – the owner of the hostel had also read it!</p>

<label>13.</label>
<p>This was the incredulous response of the practitioner to the researcher’s argument about the extent to which the practices of local officers were being reshaped, specifically to a Foucauldian focus on their ‘souls’. The reverse arrow could be (and was) easily drawn as well, where the researcher could not help challenging implicit ideational frameworks within which the practitioner operated.</p>

<p>To simplify, it describes a process wherein the EU exercises neocolonial power but plays the game of avoidance because it does not want to take accountable responsibility or carry the financial burden; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612470295">Chandler (2006)</xref>.</p>

<p>The term, originally borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612470295">Heisbourg (2000)</xref>, was repeatedly invoked by Brussels entrepreneurs to describe the context of the mission and their own political skills. Although Heisbourg’s article actually argued for limiting this studied imprecision if European defence is to consolidate, constructive ambiguity purportedly made it possible for the mission to happen. While we can reconstruct from drafts our respective readings of the term, we cannot at present agree who brought it into the conversation.</p>

<p>A comment by another member of the mission, witnessing our interaction. In our encounter, the performative staking of claims to legitimacy and belonging in the field extended into claims to be competent in each other’s area.</p>

<p>This analogy refers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470295">Wittgenstein’s (1958)</xref> notion of language games, where the meaning of a term is not to be known <italic>a priori</italic> but crystallizes in use and where seemingly contradictory or unrelated terms may belong to the same game depending on this dynamic usage. On the use of language in international relations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612470295">Fierke (2002)</xref>.</p>
