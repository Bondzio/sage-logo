<title>Background:</title>
<p>Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction is frequently performed in throwing athletes, but outcomes of UCL reconstruction requiring excision of bone, either within the substance of or replacing the UCL, have not been studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512446927">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Clinical outcome for throwing athletes after UCL reconstruction with gracilis tendon will be less favorable for patients requiring concurrent excision of bone from within the substance of the UCL than for patients with no bone excision within, or replacing, the ligamentous anatomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512446927">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort Study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512446927">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>One hundred twenty pitchers of competitive levels between high school and major league who underwent UCL reconstruction using contralateral gracilis autografts completed a phone survey, and their medical charts were reviewed. Follow-up was a minimum of 2 years. Among the 120 patients, 42 (35%) had bone within, or replacing, the substance of the native UCL (bony group), and 78 (65%) had no bony abnormalities (nonbony group). The latter group of 78 underwent UCL reconstruction using gracilis tendon graft due to the absence of a palmaris longus tendon. Clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 study groups using <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512446927">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were no statistical differences regarding time to return to throwing, time to return to competition, postoperative complications, or need for additional surgeries. The percentage of patients who returned to the same or higher level was higher in the nonbony group (91%) than in the bony group (81%), but this trend was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .083), likely due to a relatively small sample size. Changes in self-reported pitch control were different (<italic>P</italic> = .029) between the 2 groups, with a greater percentage of pitchers experiencing decreased control in the bony group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512446927">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The presence of bone concomitant with UCL damage can lead to pitch control problems after UCL reconstruction and may also decrease the chance of return to play.</p>

<p>The arm-cocking and arm acceleration phases of baseball pitching can generate more than 80 N·m of varus torque on the medial side of the elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512446927">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512446927">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446927">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512446927">30</xref></sup> The anterior oblique bundle of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a primary contributor for resisting this torque.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512446927">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512446927">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512446927">27</xref></sup> Repeated stress on the UCL can lead to deterioration and ultimate failure of the ligament, which decreases or prevents the ability to pitch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512446927">¶</xref></sup> Although a UCL tear was once a career-ending injury, the reconstruction technique first performed by Jobe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446927">14</xref></sup> in 1974 has become a career-saving procedure for hundreds of pitchers in the past 3½ decades, beginning with Tommy John, who went on to win 164 Major League games in 13 seasons after the first-ever UCL reconstruction. Return to pitching at a level greater than or equal to preinjury level has been measured to be between 80% and 92% after UCL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512446927">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446927">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446927">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512446927">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512446927">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The surgical technique for reconstructing the UCL typically involves harvesting the palmaris longus tendon, which is then used as an autograft for the damaged ulnar collateral ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446927">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446927">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446927">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512446927">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512446927">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512446927">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512446927">28</xref></sup> The UCL has a medial epicondyle origin and a long insertion on the ulna.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446927">8</xref></sup> In some throwers, bony overgrowth is noted to extend proximally into the substance of the UCL from its distal insertion at the sublime tubercle of the ulna. Also, sizable ossicles of bone may be noted just distal to the origin of the UCL within the substance of the ligament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512446927">Figure 1</xref>). Both of these types of bony abnormalities are likely due to injuries sustained in early adolescence, as such osseous changes may be induced by the repetitive trauma inherent in young throwers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446927">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446927">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512446927">19</xref></sup> Given the deficiency of native ligamentous tissue encountered in patients undergoing UCL reconstruction with these types of injury, the larger gracilis tendon graft has been used by these authors for such cases, rather than the smaller palmaris longus. There is also significant experience with the gracilis tendon graft in patients who are palmaris longus deficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446927">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512446927">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512446927">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>Past studies have examined the outcomes of typical UCL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512446927">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446927">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446927">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512446927">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512446927">28</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, no studies have looked at the relative effectiveness of reconstructions involving excision of bony abnormalities. The excision of bony tissue from within the substance of the native UCL leaves the patient with a tissue deficiency at the location of the excised bone. Therefore, we hypothesize that excision of bony pathologic abnormalities within the UCL during ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction with the gracilis tendon leads to less favorable outcomes for injured baseball pitchers compared with UCL reconstruction with the gracilis tendon in throwers with no intraligamentous bony pathologic abnormalities.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>The study design was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of St Vincent’s Birmingham. The records of 846 baseball pitchers who underwent UCL reconstruction performed by the senior authors (J.R.A., J.R.D., E.L.C.) between June 1998 and November 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) baseball pitcher at any level from high school to professional, (2) clinically apparent UCL injury, (3) underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstructive surgery with gracilis autograft, (4) reason for gracilis autograft could be readily distinguished as either having bony abnormality or simply lacking a palmaris longus, and (5) follow-up data were obtained. On the basis of imaging and postoperative reports, the patients were divided into 2 groups: those with gracilis autograft due only to the absence of a palmaris longus (nonbony group) and those with gracilis autograft due to intraligamentous bony abnormalities (bony group) regardless of the presence of a palmaris longus.</p>
<p>One hundred twenty patients were identified who met all inclusion criteria. Forty-two (35%) patients were assigned to the bony group and 78 (65%) to the nonbony group. No demographic differences in patient background were found between groups, including age (mean [SD], 22.0 [4.2] years for the bony group, 21.6 [4.6] years for the nonbony group; <italic>P</italic> = .648), distribution of arm dominance, preinjury level of competition, injury chronicity, and history of UCL reconstruction, elbow arthroscopy, or shoulder surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512446927">Table 1</xref>). For the whole study group, the mean (SD) time between the onset of symptoms and surgery was 6.0 (7.4) months. Of the 120 injuries, 93 (78%) were chronic (&gt;6 weeks), 21 (18%) were subacute (2-6 weeks), and 6 (5%) were acute (&lt;2 weeks). Twelve of the pitchers had previous elbow surgery in the dominant limb, including 5 previous UCL reconstructions and 7 arthroscopic debridements. Eight patients had previous shoulder surgery in the dominant limb. Preoperative neurological symptoms (ulnar nerve paresthesias with throwing) were noted in 31 (26%) patients. The mean (SD) age at the time of surgery was 21.7 (4.5) years. Before surgery, 23 (19%) were high school pitchers, 63 (53%) were collegiate, 22 (18%) were minor leaguers, and 12 (10%) were major leaguers. All patients were pitchers with the dominant limb affected, with 94 (78%) being right-sided and 26 (22%) being left-sided procedures.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Standard preoperative assessments in the clinic, including radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were performed for each patient as described by Azar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446927">3</xref></sup> The surgical technique used to reconstruct the UCL was the same for all patients. The technique differed from the original Jobe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446927">14</xref></sup> description in 2 ways: the flexor pronator mass was preserved, and the ulnar nerve transposition was subcutaneous rather than submuscular.</p>
<p>After the patient was anesthetized, the elbow was examined for range of motion and valgus instability. A tourniquet was then applied to the affected arm and contralateral thigh. A medial exposure of the elbow was performed. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was protected when present in the surgical field. The ulnar nerve was mobilized and the intermuscular septum was excised. The sublime tubercle was identified and the muscle layer over the UCL carefully reflected, which exposed the ulnar collateral ligament. A longitudinal split down the midportion of the anterior bundle of the ligament was created, allowing visualization of the joint line, exposing the anatomic insertion point for drilling of the humeral tunnels, and allowing removal of bony elements from within the substance of the ligament, either proximally or distally. When present, bony ossicles were sharply dissected from the surrounding ligament, preserving as much native ligament as possible. When a proximally projecting spur of the sublime tubercle was present, it was excised using a small osteotome and a high-speed bur. Abnormal bony structures were removed to the extent necessary to re-create normal bony anatomy.</p>
<p>Tunnels were drilled in the ulna and humerus in the standard fashion using a slightly larger drill bit (5/32 inch) than is used for the typical palmaris longus tendon graft (9/64 inch). Two curettes (No. 1 and No. 2) were then used to slightly enlarge each tunnel and to ensure connectivity. The native ligament was then repaired by sewing the previously made longitudinal split together with permanent suture (0 Ticron). If the native ligament was completely detached from either the medial epicondyle or the sublime tubercle, sutures were placed in the ligament ends and later passed through the bone tunnels and tied to themselves, reattaching the remaining native ligament to bone if possible.</p>
<p>The gracilis tendon was harvested from the contralateral thigh. Harvesting was performed in standard fashion under tourniquet using a small incision directly over the pes anserinus. The sartorius fascia was then incised in line with its fibers. The gracilis tendon was identified and removed from the thigh with a tendon stripper. The tendon was cut off at its insertion on the tibia, and whip stitches were placed in both ends for graft passage. The thigh tourniquet was released, hemostasis achieved, and the wound closed in layers.</p>
<p>The graft was passed through the bone tunnels in a figure-of-8 manner while the elbow was flexed to 20° to 30° and a varus stress was applied. Because of the larger size of the graft, mineral oil was used to aid in graft passage in some cases. The graft was tensioned by suturing the graft limbs together over the medial epicondyle bone bridge and then sewing the graft limbs to each other and the native ligament below the medial epicondyle. Permanent suture was used for all graft sewing. No attempt was made to pass the limbs of the graft back down through the medial epicondyle due to the larger size of the graft, because of concern for “overstuffing” the tunnels and increasing the risk of fracturing the bony bridge. The ulnar nerve was transposed using 1 fascial sling of the flexor pronator fascia, and the fascial defect was closed with an absorbable suture. A drain was placed and the wound was closed in layers after releasing the tourniquet and obtaining hemostasis. Dressings and a posterior splint were applied with the elbow flexed at 90°. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512446927">Figure 2</xref> shows the completed reconstruction prior to skin closure.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Follow-up data were collected after a minimum of 2 years for all 120 patients through a phone survey. The survey consisted of questions regarding the pitcher’s postoperative complications and pain with throwing, need for additional surgeries, seasons played since surgery, time needed to return to competition, competitive level of return, and pitch velocity and control compared with preinjury levels. The mean (SD) time between surgery and follow-up was 33.4 (10.2) months. Additional information regarding pre- and postoperative assessment was collected by reviewing patient charts and confirmed by accessing available baseball databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512446927">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512446927">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512446927">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). Independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests were run to identify any differences in the means for return to throwing time and return to competition time. In addition, χ<sup>2</sup> tests were completed to identify any relationship between the bony and nonbony groups and additional surgery, pain, complications, and pitching abilities. Clinical result was determined using the Conway-Jobe method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446927">6</xref></sup> With this method, an outcome was labeled as “excellent” if the pitcher was able to compete at a level greater than or equal to his preinjured level for at least 12 months, “good” if the pitcher returned to a lower level of competitive baseball for at least 12 months, “fair” if the pitcher could compete only at a recreational level, and “poor” if the player was unable to return to baseball. A <italic>P</italic> value of .05 was considered the cutoff for significant findings.</p>

<p>Using the Conway-Jobe method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446927">6</xref></sup> of rating UCL reconstruction recovery, there was a trend for more nonbony pitchers with “excellent” results when compared with the bony group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512446927">Table 2</xref>). However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .083).</p>
<p>Of those pitchers who returned to baseball, the reported return-to-play data were similar between bony and non-bony groups.

<p>Postoperative complications were reported during the phone survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512446927">Table 4</xref>). In the bony group, 2 (5%) pitchers reported having a second UCL reconstruction, and 2 (5%) pitchers had other additional procedures. No additional UCL reconstructions were reported by the nonbony group, but 4 (5%) pitchers did report other additional surgeries. Additional elbow surgeries included ulnar nerve releases and bony debridements within the cubital tunnel. No significant difference was found to exist between the number of additional surgeries required for each group. Postrehabilitation pain with throwing and neural complications were also reported by both groups, but neither variable showed a significant difference.</p>

<p>At the time of follow-up, pitchers reported any changes in pitch velocity, control, and overall quality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0363546512446927">Table 5</xref>). These reports were purely subjective and not necessarily based on actual measurements. Three (7%) pitchers in the bony group and 2 (3%) in the nonbony group did not report these data. The <italic>P</italic> values for these data were all near .05, but χ<sup>2</sup> tests showed that only pitch control had a significant difference. Specifically, a decrease in pitch control was more common for the bony group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Past studies have found that clinical assessments cannot generate repetitive forces comparable with those in a game situation for pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446927">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512446927">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512446927">29</xref></sup> Because of this, the precedent manner to assess the success of UCL reconstruction is to evaluate the patient’s ability to return to a previous competitive level. The overall return rate of 89% in the current study is consistent with results from the larger sample of patients previously published by our group. That is, Cain et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446927">4</xref></sup> reported that 88% (154 of 175) of patients who had UCL reconstructions with the gracilis tendon returned to play.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of UCL reconstruction with the gracilis tendon involving excision of bony tissue within the substance of the native ligament. It was hypothesized that patients with bony abnormalities would have less favorable outcomes than those without bony abnormalities. The study found that the percentage of patients who returned to their preinjury level or higher was less in the bony group (81%) than in the nonbony group (91%), but this difference was not statistically significant (.083). Future research with a larger sample of patients may prove the difference to be statistically significant. Furthermore, we believe that the difference between 81% and 91% of pitchers returning to the same level is clinically significant. Also, the percentage of pitchers who self-reported decreased pitch control was greater in the bony group than in the nonbony group. It is possible that the loss of the native ligamentous tissue and the proprioceptive feedback provided by the native ligament and underlying capsule may have contributed to decreased pitch control, although proof of this was well beyond the current study. Future research comparing both proprioception and pitch control between pitchers with and without a history of UCL and bony pathology would be needed to verify this theory.</p>
