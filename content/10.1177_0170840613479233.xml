<abstract>
<p>Scholars of politics have studied deliberative events as political processes aimed at empowering citizens, a perspective that frames organizational subsidies of public deliberation as civil society sponsorship. Based on multi-method fieldwork, this article investigates deliberation as a strategic tool marketed by an emerging industry of professional consultants to contemporary organizations facing resistance to retrenchment, redevelopment, and reorganization. This field-level organizational perspective reveals that deliberative solutions are sold to public, private, and third-sector managers in terms of their potential to cultivate stakeholder empathy for decision-makers, downsize public expectations for administrative problem-solving, and produce behavioral alignment and positive attitudes toward austerity measures. The simultaneous framing of deliberation as civic renewal and as a preemptive strategy for reducing contention demonstrates how sponsors have leveraged the ambiguities enabled by the reconfiguration of civic activity and authority described in this special issue. As such, we argue that understanding the political implications of the expanding market for sponsored deliberation requires a comparative historical approach to organizational strategy.</p>

<title>A Comparative Historical Approach to Organizational Strategy</title>
<p>Why do contemporary organizations use public deliberation, a term typically understood to reference reason-giving discussions in which evidence is weighed, beliefs are shared, and preferences are changed? How has the use of public deliberation by these organizations reshaped authority, even as the very term deliberation implies dialogue among putative equals? Scholarship thus far has studied public deliberation events as remarkable civic processes of co-creation. We argue that studying deliberation as an organizational intervention intended to produce particular strategic results enables analysis of how and why public deliberation has exploded in popularity as an organizational strategy in the current era. Deliberation is part of a panoply of strategic options for organizations of all sectors trying to manage political and economic challenges in a landscape of limited resources and demanding stakeholders. To the extent that deliberation has become an appealing option for channeling social change in organizationally productive ways, scholars need to understand deliberation as a tool used to manage shifting power dynamics in contemporary politics. As such, we call for situating field-level studies of organizational strategy in the context of trends in the larger political economy.</p>
<p>Such a study can provide critical historical perspective on trends in organizational scholarship. The articles in this volume contribute to a turn in organizational theory in which the “dynamic and contested processes of institutionalization and institutional change” are increasingly investigated in terms that recognize hybridity, complexity, and indeterminacy in organizational strategy and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840613479233">Schneiberg &amp; Clemens, 2006</xref>, p. 195). Fields of challengers and state and market actors are also populated by foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840613479233">Bartley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840613479233">Rojas, 2007</xref>) and experts and their professional associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840613479233">Greenwood, Suddaby, &amp; Hinings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840613479233">Zald &amp; Lounsbury, 2010</xref>), all contending “for strategic advantage in and through interaction with other groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613479233">Fligstein &amp; McAdam, 2011</xref>, p. 2). Amid this complexity, the diverse interests of movements and corporate actors reveal deeper structural similarities in their approaches to change, especially in an era in which both organizations and movements appropriate strategies from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840613479233">Walker, 2007</xref>). States have embraced private-sector strategies, movements have increasingly targeted and even collaborated with the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840613479233">Soule, 2009</xref>), and corporations have invested in mobilizing stakeholders and adopted responsibilities of social provision and regulation formerly provided by states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840613479233">Scherer &amp; Palazzo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Movements and organizations are increasingly viewed as “ships riding the same waves” or “twins separated at birth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840613479233">Davis, Morrill, Rao, &amp; Soule, 2008</xref>, pp. 389–90), engaging in “the same underlying phenomenon: collective strategic action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613479233">Fligstein &amp; McAdam, 2011</xref>, p. 2). These approaches tend to shift focus from oppositional politics in a particular arena to interactive processes of collaboration among contenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840613479233">O’Mahony &amp; Bechky, 2008</xref>) and “external contexts on multiple levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613479233">Duffy, Binder, &amp; Skrentny, 2010</xref>, p. 52). Some scholars have suggested that the expanding scope of social change and declining relevance of traditional sectoral distinctions demonstrates the need for a “multi-institutional” approach to politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613479233">Armstrong &amp; Bernstein, 2008</xref>) or a theory of nested and overlapping “strategic action fields” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613479233">Fligstein &amp; McAdam, 2011</xref>)—frameworks that can apply to strategic interactions among organizations of all sectors and across historical periods. Nevertheless, we argue that placing the blending and interactive dynamics of particular organizational strategies in sociohistorical context allows for a more nuanced understanding of where and how distinctions among organizations, sectors, and types of strategies matter. This is particularly important for understanding the ways in which the apparent blurring of motives and sharing of responsibility occurring in the current era may be strategically useful for preserving hierarchical relations, legitimating authority, and obscuring structural sources of inequality.</p>
<p>This project employs a field-level analysis of the uses of public deliberation in the contemporary era in order to support such an argument. Public deliberation is a way of facilitating civil society engagement with government organizations, corporations and non-profits that has received less scholarly attention than the uses of social movement tactics by corporations, the targeting of market actors by challengers, and other forms of mobilization studied in this issue. Public deliberation is different from these activities specifically because it appears to be a neutral, open-ended vehicle of political engagement in which stakeholders convene as democratic equals and “co-creators” of change. It is growing in importance, as it has become a popular option for organizations of all sectors seeking to engage stakeholders in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840613479233">Lee, 2011</xref>). Research on public deliberation typically assumes that its emergence and growth is functional—that it is a useful way of actually facilitating less hierarchical, more responsive and flexible decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840613479233">Jacobs, Cook, &amp; Delli Carpini, 2009</xref>). Work on the politics of corporate social responsibility suggests alternatives to this instrumental account of organizational investments in civil society promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840613479233">Scherer &amp; Palazzo, 2011</xref>). In fact, when scrutinized in more depth, deliberation processes are loosely coupled with decision-making, or even irrelevant to it altogether. Why, then, do organizations pursue deliberation at all, and why is it an effective remedy now?</p>
<p>This paper will argue that organizations use public deliberation to influence communities of stakeholders that might otherwise pressure them to change their practices or policies. Public deliberation works in part because it preempts more contentious action by civil society members, and it does so by generating alignment of organizational and stakeholder goals. By channeling participation in ways that engender sympathy for the struggles of decision-makers and frame individual action as more viable than collective or organizational action, deliberation subtly reshapes contemporary authority, an outcome that has not been recognized by scholars focused on the empowerment of stakeholders within or the social responsibility demonstrated by organizational sponsors.</p>
<p>In order to explain how and why it makes sense to examine facilitated deliberation as an organizational strategy with functions beyond democratizing governance, the following section presents a close ethnographic account from Lee’s participant observation of a sponsored deliberation event. In this case, some of the very poorest are treated as “queens for a day” and worthy recipients of social services in an atmosphere of pervasive administrative failure and fiscal austerity. Without viewing deliberation as a technique to manage stakeholder disillusionment and unrest, it is impossible to understand why facilitated deliberation as practiced today manages a unique blend of technocracy, education, therapy, social criticism, and artistic performance that is as scrupulously engineered as it is cacophonous. We follow the case description by contrasting typical scholarly approaches to our own approach, which uses organizational theory to study deliberation as a strategy employed by organizations to reshape authority in a particular sociohistorical context.</p>

<title>Pomp and Circumstance after a Disaster</title>
<p>January 20, 2007: The Dallas Renaissance Hotel, a pink, lipstick-shaped luxury tower. As 8:30 a.m. nears, the final stages of preparation for a very important meeting are under way, coordinated with the precision timing and attention to detail of the corporate team-building events and grand wedding receptions the Renaissance usually hosts. In a massive ballroom hung with crystal chandeliers, headsetted staffers hustle around dozens of round tables outfitted with laptops. At 9:30, buses and cars from all over Dallas-Fort Worth begin depositing nearly 140 honored guests for the six-hour meeting that is about to begin. Participants are greeted warmly at the welcome area and assigned randomly to 10-seat rounds outfitted with keypads, or “clickers,” linked wirelessly to the audience response system. As the ballroom warms up, similar preparations are taking place in Atlanta, Houston, and New Orleans. Smaller groups in other cities are gathering at public libraries and other venues to participate by webcast. All four main sites will shortly be connected by satellite video feeds, allowing the assembled guests to cheer and wave at each other. As the event gets under way, the group will be greeted by local dignitaries, treated to an invocation by a gospel choir, asked to vote with their clickers to blasting arena rock classics, and invited to break bread together over free lunches. The group hushes and closes their eyes, imagining themselves as eagles flying over the city they would like to see. Needless to say, this is not your parents’ or grandparents’ public meeting.</p>
<p>The honored guests today in Dallas are former residents of New Orleans, here for “Community Congress III,” “the public’s collective opportunity to review and give final input on the draft Unified New Orleans Plan (UNOP) before it is sent to city leaders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840613479233">UNOP, 2007</xref>, p. 1). At Community Congress II, current and former New Orleanians could give input on what they wanted to see in draft recommendations for rebuilding the city; this meeting seeks to gain feedback on how those recommendations have been incorporated. A Who’s Who of philanthropy— the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, DaimlerChrysler, and the Carnegie, Case, Ford, Kellogg, and Rockefeller Foundations, among others—has footed the bill for the first-class events today and a month earlier that are a far cry from spartan public hearings. The philanthropic support has made a difference—these meetings could not be more of a sea change from the many disconnected, fragmented, and competing planning processes over the past 15 months that only further frustrated New Orleanians infuriated about the catastrophic mismanagement of the disaster response and the lack of progress in rebuilding. In fact, since public approval is so important, the design of this meeting and the phrasing of options for discussion have been piloted in practice run-throughs by AmericaSpeaks, so there are unlikely to be many surprises in terms of what this particular subset of “the people” have to say regarding the Plan. “Every detail matters” in an event that manages a nuanced blend of the old-fashioned civic commitment of New England town halls and the evidence-driven decision-making of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840613479233">Lukensmeyer, 2007</xref>, p. 13).</p>
<p>AmericaSpeaks has been tracking the demographics of registrants for weeks and has been involved up to the last minute in recruiting a group that represents the racial, housing status, income, and age makeup of the city before the storm. The non-New Orleanian staffers and observers are primarily white and the survivors attending here in Dallas are nearly exclusively black and low income, as most displaced white and upper-income homeowners have already returned to the city over a year later. A mini social service department has been assembled on site, where a village of childcare, counselors, translators, and emergency service personnel stand at the ready with hugs, candy, defibrillators, and tissues. Facilitators used to leading meetings in other communities that tend to attract high-income, involved citizens will note to each other at the debrief after the event the unusual level of poverty and illiteracy present among participants. In a report following the meeting, Carolyn Lukensmeyer, the head of AmericaSpeaks, celebrated that in this “‘hardest case’ environment” where “the majority of the target audience was living in a postdisaster crisis mode,” the organization “succeeded in giving equal voice to the most disenfranchised,” both the poor, black citizens most affected and those in the diaspora who could not attend public meetings in New Orleans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840613479233">Lukensmeyer, 2007</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>I am here doing participant observation as a volunteer table facilitator, and each of the survivors assigned to my own table in Dallas is black. In a whirl of smiling energy, caseworker Susan is the last to arrive at our table and immediately focuses the group’s attention, snapping pictures, shaking hands, and handing out her business card. She works with Katrina survivors in Dallas, and when the call goes out for “captains” to volunteer to keep in touch with the group after the meeting, she will take responsibility for maintaining contact and encouraging action after the event, collecting emails and sending us scores of messages with information on upcoming programs and services. Everyone quiets down as the meeting begins. The pain of the prior processes and the disaster are acknowledged, while speakers at the same time strike hopeful, positive notes and emphasize that the focus today is not on public figures but on the participants, who should give themselves a hand for coming and contributing.</p>
<p>The first task of the day is to ask my table to think quietly and write down their “experience of inspiration” in the recovery and rebuilding of New Orleans. The video monitor shows reports from the different sites, where area coordinators have plucked representatives to talk about their inspirations. General consensus seems to be that events like this are an inspiration. Next, we begin a round of demographic polling, where participants get a chance to try out the keypads and see “who’s here today.” The women at my table have fun with the voting, but are nonplussed by the “pomp and circumstance” and by the city officials whom they think have failed those in the diaspora. Despite some boredom and cynicism at my table, Susan keeps our spirits high and I try to keep things moving. The room is beset with alternating currents of emotion, as participants listen to public officials and community organizers, hear compelling stories from other participants, debate policy incentives for rebuilding, stretch, eat box lunches, listen to slam poetry, grouse about the lack of bathroom and smoke breaks, clap and laugh, and vote for policy options.</p>
<p>As the day concludes, participants are asked to take responsibility for “action” on the plan. Participants are asked “What personal commitment can you make to stay involved in the rebuilding of New Orleans?” and the process ends with a final round of voting on four evaluation questions. When participants are asked to rate how satisfied they are with their own participation, Jessie, a young working mom at my table, cries out, “Why do they have to put it on us?” When the results are tallied, 93 percent of participants commit to remaining engaged. As participants exit, they receive a handout still hot off the copier reporting the votes of the day, so they can show others what happened and remember the options they recommended. From start to finish, Community Congress III focused its participants on their direct influence on redevelopment policy and the actions they could take to continue and even deepen their involvement in urban planning. With its patriotic and artistic celebration of the power of community engagement, it also served as an inspiring example of citizens, non-profit organizations, foundations, and corporations coming together in service of social goals—an outcome so reaffirming that one mayor’s aide described it as “motherhood and apple pie” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840613479233">Williamson, 2007</xref>, p. 24).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the impressive, overwhelming spectacles of both “21<sup>st</sup> Century Town Meetings” were intended to achieve other goals as well. How do we understand why these particular Cadillacs—or more appropriately, Mercedes Benzes—of civic festivals of inclusion, equality, and democracy, seemingly so hard to achieve in other contexts, are being rolled out for the poorest of the poor, in a time of widespread retrenchment? Before CCIII, a foundation-sponsored study found that “Community Congress II engendered ‘buy-in’ from both the public and their community leaders” critical to the future approval of the Unified New Orleans Plan, but that “community leaders appeared far more interested in the event as a means to earn ‘buy-in,’ than as a way to improve the actual plan”: “substance was almost irrelevant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840613479233">Williamson, 2007</xref>, pp. 23–4). None of the leaders interviewed thought of the CCII process “primarily as a way to improve the substance of UNOP” and some had not even looked at the preliminary report on citizens’ recommendations. According to Lukensmeyer, “the Community Congresses were a vehicle for restoring community and therefore hope” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840613479233">2007</xref>: 9). The $14.5 billion UNOP was approved by the necessary stakeholders, and rebuilding could continue in a more effective way. CCII and CCIII may not have solved long-term structural problems, but they harnessed impressive citizen participation and demonstrated the potential of a different way of civic life for New Orleans.</p>
<p>Many scholars have been captivated by the no-detail-too-small professionalism and gargantuan scale of spectacular multi-sited events like Community Congress III, and by the claims of community capacity-building and democracy deepening that they promote. Such events are so complex, involve such detailed, place-based policy histories, and the sustained collaboration of so many organizations that they are quite difficult to capture analytically, as the extended description above, which only reveals the perspective from one table in one site, implies. Deliberative events provide fodder for whole volumes of academic research unpacking the politics of their emergence and long-term effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840613479233">Marcuse, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Community Congresses, and other successful deliberative initiatives, such as participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre and the British Columbia Citizens’ Assembly in Canada, have been analyzed almost exclusively in terms of political theory and social movement scholarship: as participatory processes that have succeeded in reforming governance despite the resistance of elites invested in ordinary politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840613479233">Baiocchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840613479233">Lang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840613479233">Warren &amp; Pearse, 2008</xref>). Scholars have scrutinized the stakeholder power dynamics and the micropolitics of reason-giving going on in these discussions without paying much attention to the larger institutional landscape in which deliberation transpires. The role of facilitation organizations such as AmericaSpeaks and of process sponsors like the foundations and DaimlerChrysler are practically invisible in many accounts. Why are organizations investing energy and resources in these elaborate events, especially if the substantive input they produce is widely held to be “irrelevant”? Political scholars often take the same perspective as Lukensmeyer, arguing that such processes have significance far beyond their immediate effects on decision-making and policy as “schools for democracy,” inasmuch as they encourage capacity-building and help citizens see how meaningful and worthwhile participatory processes are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840613479233">Fung &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that understanding the enthusiasm of organizational sponsors for the kinds of social change produced in deliberation instead requires the insights of organizational scholarship on the shifting and unstable relationship of movements, corporations, and civil society in the current era. Organizational activity that is explicitly framed as socially valuable and empowering has economic and political value in reinforcing organizational authority as well, in part because it is so effective in producing individual-level social change. In fact, we argue that the very difficulty of categorizing messy, multi-sited, multi-organizational deliberations like Community Congress III benefits sponsors, who seek out deliberative remedies not only for the positive press to be gained by sponsoring civic interventions, but also for the strategic management outcomes that deliberation consultants like AmericaSpeaks sell. By studying field-level marketing discourse, we can see similar promises made about deliberation across sponsor categories and for very different types of events. In doing so, this article finds that deliberation is sold to organizational sponsors as a strategy for disciplining stakeholders by demobilizing dissent and reorienting action on contentious issues.</p>
<p>Empirical study of deliberation as a strategy can illuminate the role of deliberation in larger efforts to reframe organizational authority as consistent with social movement activity in the current era. Our focus on discourse between organizational sponsors and deliberation experts about social control outcomes responds to Zald and Lounsbury’s call for “a systematic re-engagement with how the dynamics of economy and society are fundamentally shaped by various elites, new forms of expertise, and their command posts—centers of societal power that regulate, oversee, and aim to maintain social order” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840613479233">Zald &amp; Lounsbury, 2010</xref>, p. 963). If we view deliberation as a co-created social process rather than as an organizational strategy, we minimize the commanding roles of deliberation experts and their clients in bringing deliberation about—exactly the sleight of hand that this article argues is sought by many organizations seeking to use deliberation. In the following section, we locate our methodological approach in the context of other organizational scholarship on the evolving relationship between discourses of empowerment and techniques of social control.</p>

<p>People think that they are doing one thing when they engage in civic life, but others use their participation to do other things. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840613479233">Pacewicz, 2011</xref>, p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ways in which social interventions serve economic and political goals may be hard to discern in individual cases, but there are readily available templates for comparative historical study of organizational strategy in the critical literature on increasingly sublimated forms of social control in organizations. Vallas describes the “remaking of managerial authority” in “new forms of work organization” emphasizing empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840613479233">Vallas, 2006</xref>, p. 1678). Sewell identifies “a hybrid or ‘chimerical’ mode of workplace control” through peer surveillance in teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840613479233">Sewell, 1998</xref>, p. 397). Jermier notes that “contemporary mechanisms of control are often unobtrusive” in an era “especially uncomfortable with the exercise of blatant hierarchical control”:<disp-quote>
<p>We have entered a new age in which the forms of control being used are more insidious and widely misunderstood… Recent technological changes, managerial innovations, and organizational experiments— many of which have been hailed as revolutionary or paradigm-breaking in both the academic and popular press… have received great fanfare largely because they disguise control in the rhetoric of emancipation and, therefore, seem more humanistic. But their substance lies in the unstated promise of providing more thorough control for elites. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840613479233">Jermier, 1998</xref>, p. 235)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the difficulties of empirically identifying these “unstated promises,” Zald and Lounsbury call for researchers to “look behind the metaphorical curtain in the Emerald City to demystify the wizardry of experts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840613479233">2010</xref>, p. 964). Similarly, Pacewicz argues that a “curtain of sophisticated practices separates front-stage aspects of democratic participation from the back-stage effects of such practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840613479233">Pacewicz, 2011</xref>, p. 34). Going behind the curtain requires investigating “the actors who channel civic energies,” because “economic-civic links are only obvious to those actors who structure broader patterns of community engagement, frequently not to ‘regular people’ who participate in civic initiatives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840613479233">Pacewicz, 2011</xref>, p. 33). We take these scholars seriously in their urging to investigate social change strategies involving all types of state and non-state actors in terms of the role of experts in their production—in this case, in producing and marketing civic products that promise to help sponsors manage conflict and criticism more effectively.</p>
<p>Further, we assert that the “unstated promises” of these experts are not so much unstated, as stated in different venues than those typically investigated in deliberation. Rather than looking at deliberative talk among participants, we look at the specific promises made to clients seeking deliberation for a set of typical uses in order to anatomize the exact circumstances in which deliberation is used and the outcomes it is said to effect. As will be revealed, the collective strategic interests of professional deliberation consultants and organizations are constructed in these settings in terms of competitive advantages over the increasingly noisy, confusing, and expansive landscapes of contention documented in this special issue.</p>
<p>As described above, going “behind the curtain” involves a change in focus from deliberation as a democratic process to deliberation as a social change management strategy produced by professionals and experts and marketed and sold to client organizations. Strang and Soule argue for “attention to cultural work and forms of agency” through the study of professional communities and consultants: the authors claim that “the impact of vibrant diffusion industries on the political and the business scene has hardly begun to be tapped” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840613479233">Strang &amp; Soule, 1998</xref>, p. 286). Similarly, Davis and colleagues argue that the dynamic nature of social change in movements and organizations requires an approach that attends to larger contexts: “Given the increasingly permeable and blurry boundaries among organizations and social movements, it may become difficult to study a single ‘movement’ or ‘organization’…We may increasingly need to study fields, networks, or narratives that cut across multiple sites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840613479233">Davis et al., 2008</xref>, p. 393). The authors argue that techniques like multi-sited ethnography may be more appropriate for studying the production of social change. This study takes on such a challenge through a multi-sited field study in the vein of organizational ethnographies like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840613479233">Eliasoph (2011)</xref>, which documents the shared discourses in “empowerment projects” across contexts and among complex landscapes of funders, experts, and state and non-state actors. In line with the recommendations of these scholars, our project uses a multi-method, multi-sited ethnographic approach, including fieldwork, archival research and surveys, to study deliberation as an organizational strategy produced by experts working within the emerging field of public deliberation consulting.</p>
<p>The fieldwork was conducted by Lee in the United States and Canada from 2006 through 2010. In order to get a closer perspective on the field of public deliberation consulting, she has conducted extensive participant observation in various training and certification venues and professional conferences: a week-long public participation facilitation certification course, three more specialized training sessions, two national and two international professional association conferences, a deliberation methods conference, and monthly webinars and teleconferences. Lee also conducted informal interviews with more than 50 individuals representing all aspects of the field over the course of the fieldwork.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840613479233">1</xref></sup> These field experiences provide an ideal perspective on the concerns of deliberation professionals regarding marketing of firms and projects, public, client, and volunteer relations, project management, professional development, and field advancement.</p>
<p>In addition, Lee sought to understand stakeholder, volunteer, and client perspectives on professional deliberation facilitation through the lens of major (1,000+ participants) public and non-profit sector deliberation projects. Having been certified in deliberation facilitation, she served as a volunteer and as a table facilitator at two national deliberative meetings, including the one on New Orleans redevelopment described above. As part of a research collaborative, she had full access to one national five-day meeting with four separate deliberative events sponsored by professional associations in the performing arts. This project included pre- and post-surveys of a random sample of conference participants and interviews with the clients and the chief process facilitator regarding strategic outcomes (for a detailed study of this meeting, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840613479233">Lee &amp; Long Lingo, 2011</xref>). When referencing data from observations, the specific fieldwork setting (a training course, conference, etc.) is described in the text and cited parenthetically as “field notes.”</p>
<p>Analysis of deliberation practitioners’ listservs, organization and event websites, blogs, social networking sites, field handbooks, and unique data sources collected by Lee supplements the information gathered through participant observation. Listserv postings were collected, coded by source, and stored in a full-text, searchable database containing over 8,400 documents representing four years of electronic conversation in the field. Content analyses using inductive coding of text files, major guidebooks in the field, and unique data sources were conducted by both authors, who developed separate coding schemes for each document type. According to standard practices in content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840613479233">Roberts, 1997</xref>), we refined codes over the course of the coding process, and then continued to test codes by applying them independently on texts used in the analysis. Intercoder reliability was above 85 percent in all cases and typically above 90 percent. We reconciled all coding differences prior to analysis. Archival data are described in the text by source and cited parenthetically as “database files,” rather than cited in the bibliography, in order to protect the identities of informants.</p>
<p>As a supplement to the fieldwork, informal interviews, and archival research, a non-random online survey of dialogue and deliberation practitioners, distributed through more than 20 online listservs and web-based community networks in the field, was conducted in September and October 2009 in collaboration with Francesca Polletta of University of California, Irvine, in order to solicit a broader perspective on the findings surfacing in the qualitative research. The survey, whose target population was volunteer and professional deliberation practitioners in the United States, yielded 345 completed responses from US practitioners. While the survey sample was non-random and therefore cannot be generalized to all deliberation practitioners in the USA, we believe this is an important first step in understanding qualitative variation within the field, and a valuable supplement to the other methods described above. An extensive discussion of design and results can be found at the survey website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sites.lafayette.edu/ddps/">http://sites.lafayette.edu/ddps/</ext-link>).

<title>“Tight Times, Tough Choices”: The Market for Public Deliberation</title>
<p>The use of professionals who offer expertise in public deliberation has expanded dramatically since the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613479233">Barnes, Newman, &amp; Sullivan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840613479233">Hendriks &amp; Carson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840613479233">Lee, 2007</xref>). In order to understand why organizations turn to deliberation as an organizational strategy, we first need to understand which organizations are selling and buying deliberation and under what conditions. This section of the analysis focuses on these questions, which have largely been absent from political scholarship because process-oriented studies emphasize goals identified in event materials—for instance, CCIII as a “collective opportunity” for citizens to affect planning. As Logan and Molotch note with respect to the economic benefits for urban organizations of “community ‘we feeling’” around growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840613479233">Molotch, 1976</xref>, p. 314; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840613479233">Logan &amp; Molotch, 1987</xref>), public claims that deliberative events seek community empowerment deserve deeper analysis because a spirit of collective benefit may be strategically valuable for organizational interests.</p>
<p>The field of professional public engagement facilitation developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Professional associations include the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2, founded in 1990) and the National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation (NCDD, founded in 2002), together claiming over 1,000 US members. The 2009 survey found that practitioners arrived at their public deliberation work from a variety of different pathways, including community organizing, organizational psychology, public relations, conflict resolution, and therapy. According to Leighninger, “You don’t need a particular academic degree, professional license, or training certificate to be a practitioner or consultant on deliberative democracy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840613479233">Leighninger, 2009</xref>, p. 9). Some practitioners work from within large firms or government agencies, some work independently, and others work for non-profits promoting a particular method. Of the US professionals in the practitioner survey, 122 were independent consultants or sole practitioners. Deliberation consultants coordinate all aspects of event design and implementation, including production of informational materials, selection of methods and topic framings, recruitment of participants and small group facilitators, training of volunteers, master of ceremonies duties, continued communication with participants through newsletters and stakeholder management software, presentation to the client and participants of process outcomes, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Deliberation practitioners provide their services to organizations seeking to engage citizens, employees, customers, community groups, and other stakeholders. We use the terms “clients” and “sponsors” to describe the public agencies and governments, corporations, and non-profit sector organizations that pay deliberation consultants for their services. “Client” typically refers to the administrative entity in which stakeholders have a “stake,” and with which facilitators work to define the goals and scope of deliberation. “Sponsor” refers to clients paying for facilitation, but also to third parties who may underwrite or donate some portion of either the costs of facilitation to clients, such as publicity or venue fees, or the costs of participation to stakeholders, such as participant stipends, child care and translation services. Sponsors’ role in providing direct and indirect support of stakeholder participation is termed a “subsidy,” inasmuch as it reduces the costs in time, resources, and capacity for participants to engage in deliberative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613479233">Briggs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840613479233">Jacobs et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of CCIII, AmericaSpeaks was the deliberation consultant, the administrative entities involved in producing and approving the Unified New Orleans Plan were the clients, and the foundations and DaimlerChrysler were sponsors.</p>
<p>Jacobs and colleagues argue that public deliberation is sponsored “by third parties (government entities, foundations, and individuals)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840613479233">Jacobs et al., 2009</xref>, p. 147); however, non-public sponsors are not limited to foundations or individual civic boosters. In the survey, 195 US professionals reported work with non-public (private or non-profit) clients. Many include organizations sharing growth interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840613479233">Molotch, 1976</xref>), such as local media, banks and mortgage lenders, utilities, health systems, universities, and residential and commercial developers (database files). The involvement of such actors suggests that deliberation may play an important strategic role in legitimating urban growth goals—as when the Community Congresses were seen as a method of gaining public “buy-in” for New Orleans redevelopment. While one observer pilloried CCII as “feel-good bullshit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840613479233">Williamson, 2007</xref>, p. 26), it is important to note that if sponsors’ strategic interest in deliberation were solely in producing positive attitudes toward growth, then routine tactics in these organizations’ toolboxes, such as advertising campaigns, are readily accessible and involve far less effort than deliberation.</p>
<p>Not least, sponsors include many organizations that do not fit the profile of either local development interests or civil society champions. In addition to community and non-profit groups, large corporations, industry trade associations, federal agencies, and transnational organizations are advertised as clients on deliberation consultants’ websites. Industry sectors represented are broad, and include consumer products and high-tech manufacturers such as 3M, Cisco, the Consumer Electronics Association, and Sun Microsystems. Corporations in the FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industry such as Allstate, State Farm, and American Express are also represented. Food, tobacco, and drug industry actors and regulators include the Food and Drug Administration, Altria Group, Astra Zeneca, Coca Cola, GlaxoSmith Klein, and Kraft. Extractive industries and their regulators include the Environmental Protection Agency, Exxon, Georgia Pacific, and Shell Chemical. Transnational organizations including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum are also featured on client lists. Deliberation consultants welcome sponsorship by deep-pocketed multinationals like Allianz. Such investments signal the thriving market for corporate-sponsored deliberation; of US practitioners surveyed, 319 believe “the expanded use of deliberative methods in the corporate sector (with employees or customers)” is “good for the field” (<italic>N</italic> = 329).</p>
<p>While most scholarship has focused on public-sector clients like those in CCIII, British Columbia, or Porto Alegre, under what conditions do clients and sponsors of all sectors seek to use deliberation as an organizational strategy? While many of the companies and organizations listed above have been successfully targeted by activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840613479233">McCann, Haltom, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>), deliberation is one strategic choice among other outreach and public relations strategies employed by these firms, including subsidizing the mobilization of targeted segments of the public, typically an efficient option when some enthusiastic constituency exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840613479233">Walker, 2009</xref>). So when do organizations choose to use deliberation as opposed to or in addition to alternative public engagement strategies? Through an analysis of the three most common topics of deliberative processes in our survey, we argue that clients and sponsors typically seek deliberation as a strategy for management problems they face when existing or potential resistance to austerity policies arises from corporate reorganization, state retrenchment, and urban redevelopment.</p>
<p>In our survey, the three most common topics on which US practitioners surveyed had facilitated in the last two years were “education and youth” (167 practitioners), “comprehensive community planning and visioning” (147 practitioners), and “organizational development and human resources” (135 practitioners). Organizationally sponsored deliberations on these topics focus on the difficulty of confronting social problems (phrased as making “tough choices”) in a challenging economic landscape of “tight times.” In the case of all three topics, contentious framings emphasizing systemic failure and inequality are available as possible resources for challengers like community organizers, unions, and activists.</p>
<p>“Education and youth” is a broad category with a rich history of participatory governance and collective action, as in the National Youth Administration, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, and the movements of the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840613479233">Klatch 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840613479233">McAdam 1990</xref>). According to Briggs, “an earlier era might have classified this work simply as redistributive social policy…and public goods provision,” but the current economic landscape makes addressing social problems associated with youth an issue of “economic competitiveness and ‘quality of life’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613479233">Briggs, 2008</xref>, p. 221). In a study of 100 local youth organizations, Eliasoph notes that youth “empowerment projects” emphasize prevention of liabilities like addiction and incarceration; teen participants became “accustomed to being treated as ‘problems’” in cross-sector “empowerment” settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840613479233">Eliasoph, 2009</xref>, p. 299). Deliberative processes about youth similarly involve corporate and foundation underwriting of local efforts to curb at-risk youth’s socially and economically destructive behavior, especially in cases where corporations have been targeted by activists and regulators, as in the case of childhood obesity.</p>
<p>A high-profile deliberative effort on behalf of youth in the USA is AmericaSpeaks’ town hall meetings on “Shaping America’s Youth,” part of an anti-obesity campaign sponsored by Cadbury Schweppes, Campbell Soup Company, FedEx, McNeil Nutritionals, NIKE, CIGNA, and ConAgra Foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840613479233">SAY, 2007</xref>). The goals of sponsors as stated in one participant guide are “lowering the cost of care” by “getting children and youth more physically active and eating a healthier diet.” Altering poor children’s behavior was an explicit focus of statistics cited in public flyers for the event: “More than 30% of low income 2-5 year olds are at-risk for overweight or overweight” (database files). The participant guide notes that obesity disproportionately affects the poor and people of color and that “obesity-associated annual hospital costs” for youth have tripled: “To avoid the personal, societal, and medical costs of excess weight in the future, we must confront the adverse social norms and environments that our children face today” (database files). Descriptions of poor children’s obesity as an economic issue critical to cutting healthcare costs do not include alternative justice framings, such as poor children’s food security and access to medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0170840613479233">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>While topics like youth are linked to cost-cutting initiatives aimed at destructive behaviors rather than systemic inequalities, deliberation is also used to address the hardships that macro-economic restructuring and competition for growth impose on communities. When topics were combined thematically, urban planning, development, and budgeting was the most common category, covered 535 times in the last two years by practitioners surveyed. The specific topic of comprehensive community planning covers forums like the CCIII where growth management, local economic development, and community quality of life are on the table. Consultants note that shrinking finances have compelled public clients to seek out deliberation in order to manage protests over cuts. On a practitioner listserv, one director of a deliberation training organization in California marks the influence of budget pressures: “For the municipalities we work with in California, we are finding a desperation on the part of many to involve the public quickly and cheaply in policy discussions from budgets to land use. We take this as an encouraging sign (though one forced by considerable pressures) of the need by governing institutions to engage their publics in new ways” (database files).</p>
<p>Desperation on the part of administrators is reflected in the emotionally fraught framing of deliberations over which programs and services must be axed. “Pracademic” James Fishkin describes to a listserv his statewide deliberative poll called “Hard Times, Hard Choices” in Michigan: “The whole state in one room faced up to the state’s difficult choices” (database files). A series of dialogue workshops in Philadelphia in 2009 entitled “The City Budget: Tight Times, Tough Choices” asked participants to work through 30 choices for closing a $200 million budget gap, distinguishing between “low hanging fruit,” “no way, no how,” “shared pain,” and “gut wrenchers.” Over 440 individual statements were collected on a “wailing wall” (database files). As in the case of CCIII, deliberation is often sought as a crisis management tactic or option of last resort when earlier strategies have produced blowback or when stakeholder populations are already resistant to public relations efforts. The public report on the “Tight Times, Tough Choices” dialogues described public “distrust: of numbers, of workshop process, of how the input would be used” (database files).</p>
<p>Similar pressures drive corporations to seek out deliberation for use with employees and organizational stakeholders in order to handle contention and dysfunction related to mergers and downsizing. Obviously, managers have a number of tactics readily available for anticipated problems following corporate reorganization, but deliberation is generally employed in “tough” cases where prior remedies have failed. In certification training and in a conference session on dealing with “problem clients,” practitioners noted that they were usually called in after attempts at internal employee engagement or with non-deliberative consultants went awry (field notes). Like community-based processes on local fiscal crises, privately sponsored deliberation on organizational development focuses on friction from cost-cutting.</p>
<p>Listservs feature discussions about facilitating on behalf of companies looking to manage the disruptions of layoffs and benefit reductions. One post seeks input on how to design an event that will reduce errors in a struggling housing-related industry where employees are “too tired, worried or disgusted to do a good job” (database files). Facilitation firms have developed specialized deliberative products for managers facing labor unrest or demoralization of this sort. Viewpoint Learning in San Diego facilitates “ChoiceDialogues for Health Viewpoints,” in which employees discuss preferences for health plan reductions, for example. These deliberative belt-tightening exercises to allocate scarce healthcare dollars in the corporate sector are virtually identical to those used by state governments and insurance company foundations with citizens in public settings, such as “Tough Choices in Health Care” (Maine) and “California Speaks: Working Together for Better Health Care.”</p>
<p>While deliberation consultants cover a wide range of topics and serve a diverse client base in terms of sector and industry, the conditions under which organizations seek out deliberation have a number of similarities across contexts. Based on analysis of common topics for clients from different sectors, deliberation is typically used in cases where social unrest is likely or has already occurred, and where alternative management remedies are impractical or have already failed. As is evident from the shared language of these strategic interventions, deliberation is particularly useful in “tight times” and for “tough choices”—when organizations have to manage widespread dissatisfaction from various constituencies over management decisions related to fiscal austerity.</p>
<p>One could argue that the use of deliberation in these conditions is simply a coincidence of field development in the USA occurring during a period of economic turbulence; however, Martin argues that time-series regression models reveal strapped governments responding to escalating demand for participation with “new deliberative assemblies”: “democratic states are likely to grant citizens rights of binding consultation at times of fiscal stress, when intensive state extraction of resources provokes citizen resistance that results in procedural concessions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840613479233">Martin, 2010</xref>, p. 1). This finding complements reports from practitioners that demand for deliberative “choicework” has surged during the financial crisis. While the data used here are predominantly from the continental USA and Canada, scholars in Europe and Australasia have also found deliberation used in contexts of public hostility and conflicts over decision-making on economic development and private-sector growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840613479233">Atkinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613479233">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840613479233">Head, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840613479233">Talpin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840613479233">Williams, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>“The Perfect Tool to Generate Alignment”: Public Deliberation as a Strategy to Preempt Mobilization</title>
<p>What are organizations hoping to accomplish by employing deliberation across similar settings of fiscal austerity and social unrest? In the political literature on deliberation, interest in deliberation from organizational sponsors is typically seen in terms of sponsors’ desire to improve decision-making and participate in the renewal of the public sphere. Jacobs and colleagues argue that sponsors support deliberation because they are “committed to the public-interest contributions of these forums and to reducing the costs to individuals of engaging in public talking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840613479233">Jacobs et al., 2009</xref>, p. 147). Organizations using deliberation certainly seek to advertise such interests, which may positively benefit their public image. On a conference call for practitioners on “the business case for participation,” participants were told to market “reputational capital” as a benefit of deliberation, and one not limited to sponsors: “Hopefully at the end, you look as good as they do” (field notes). Nevertheless, as the description of Community Congress III reveals, deliberation tends to be used in settings in which client reputation is already compromised. Not least, as suggested in Pacewicz’s description of a “curtain” in community engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840613479233">Pacewicz, 2011</xref>), sponsor and client investments are not consistently publicized; because of the focus in deliberation on multi-organizational collaboration and individual participation, it is often difficult to decipher organizations’ differing roles and levels of involvement in events. Our research has determined that along with “social profit” goals like civic renewal, deliberation consultants regularly advertise other benefits of deliberation to their clients, including improved relations and conflict reduction with resistant populations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0170840613479233">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deliberation is used by organizations facing social conflict, as described in the first section of the analysis, because it is seen as an effective tool for managing restive publics. Deliberation facilitators advertise predictable stakeholder management outcomes with difficult or dissatisfied groups regardless of client sector. Positive outcomes promoted in one deliberation methods manual highlighted explicitly disciplinary goals such as reducing absenteeism or preventing unionization in 13 percent of the case studies (<italic>N</italic> = 60); half of these involved public or non-profit sector sponsors. One facilitation firm with a major ongoing contract from the federal government offers on its website: “If your organization needs to gain community input, we have specific techniques for making the session dynamic and interactive, while maintaining control and yielding positive results. Let us show you how” (database files). How do deliberation facilitators promise to increase organizational control over stakeholder mobilization? This analysis focuses on three different outcomes promised by facilitators: first, that deliberation can cultivate empathy for managers; relatedly, that it can downsize public expectations; and finally, that it can channel oppositional collective action into positive individual behaviors aligned with organizational goals.</p>
<p>Practitioners promise that deliberation will force participants to realize that satisfying all of the different stakeholder demands made on organizations is untenable or unreasonable. As in the case of the “wailing wall,” “tough” processes structure opportunities for venting of public anger alongside dialogues that shift the practical responsibilities of project design and budget management, at least hypothetically, to the public. Practitioners argue that by standing in the shoes of decision-makers, participants will develop empathy for their challenges. One project report describes this sort of outcome: “72% of participants agreed that doing the Choicebook helped them understand the tough choices [the Health Agency] has to make about health care” (database files). Participants may also change their perspectives on the level of taxation they are willing to accept in order to have continued access to valued services. The “Tight Times, Tough Choices” report related participants’ conclusion that “We can’t declare a bunch of services off limits [to cuts] without agreeing to tax ourselves to raise money for those services” (database files). Improvements in “tax morale” are regularly advertised as reasons for using deliberation (database files; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840613479233">Lee, McNulty, &amp; Shaffer, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Deliberative marketing materials also highlight support for organizational goals through an emphasis on mutual collaboration and co-creation. Powerful organizational actors are typically referred to as “stakeholders” with roles equal to those of ordinary citizens. Literature for the Iowa Citizens’ Summit on Childhood Obesity suggests that corporations and government officials can play a primary role as change agents, but not as powerful economic and regulatory actors—as “stakeholders” and “partners” with “clout” among consumers and communities observing “adverse social norms” (database files). The participant guide specifies that corporations can help communities solve their own problems by investment in social marketing efforts “to advocate products and activities that encourage healthy lifestyles…Employers and advertisers can distribute media messages that continually reinforce the basic principles of movement, exercise, and good nutrition, and offer role models for children” (database files). As in CCIII, where participants were told to applaud themselves for participating, shared that the process itself was an inspiration, and finally recommended more Community Congresses, deliberations like the Summit are advertised within processes as examples of successful social marketing campaigns that demonstrate the potential of multi-stakeholder collaboration as a solution to “shared” challenges.</p>
<p>Likewise, practitioners emphasize that employees should be asked to shoulder the burden as equal stakeholders in the co-creation of change; employee performance is tied to their concern for others. One listserv contributor describes this as follows: “AI [Appreciative Inquiry] is the perfect tool to generate alignment within an organization because alignment stems from compassion” (database files). Indeed, deliberative participants may abandon self-interested perspectives and develop empathy for the resistance to taxation of business “stakeholders.” Fishkin reports proudly on the outcome of the Michigan deliberation where the “whole state” faced up to “tough choices”: “It is very striking that when the people grappled with the state’s economic problems, they moved to raise the taxes whose pain they directly feel (the sales tax and the income tax) and they moved to lower the taxes they feel only indirectly (business taxes, presumably to stimulate jobs)” (database files). Practitioners often reported that they could count on processes to produce solutions that were politically moderate and not dominated by “grandstanders”; in a conference session, one leading practitioner “guaranteed,” based on her own experience observing healthcare deliberations over a decade, that no deliberative dialogue on healthcare in the USA would end up endorsing a single-payer model (field notes).</p>
<p>This confidence is in part inspired by the fact that deliberation may enhance organizational reputations and foster a spirit of shared sacrifice in participants, while at the same time reducing expectations for what organizations themselves can contribute in co-creative processes. While emphasizing the decision-making capabilities of participants, such framings not only often assert the virtues of devolution and local empowerment, but make claims that bureaucratic administrations are simply inadequate to the task of governing now that “crowdsourcing” is possible. Beth Simone Noveck of the Obama administration describes these diminished public expectations for administrative problem-solving in terms of the superiority of individual expertise and shared governance: “a shift in how we conceive of government itself…that we’re involved in the co-creation of public decision-making where we make decisions together, solve problems together, and work on issues together that we hold in common.” Noveck goes on to argue that federal administration is incompetent and out of touch compared with individuals at the community level: “The notion that central management sitting in Washington is going to know best how to solve a problem that’s occurring out across the country in dealing with people on a day-to-day basis is just ludicrous. It’s the people who are actually in the front lines of dealing with those problems who will know” (database files). Repeated invocations in deliberation of personal responsibility for problem-solving, even in cases in which the scale of the problem is far beyond participants’ individual capacity to effect change, in part account for the frustration expressed by Jessie, the working mother who balked at the “put it on us” feel of CCIII.</p>
<p>The use of the term “alignment” above is not unusual in online discussions among practitioners, with some version of “align” occurring in 11 percent of all files in the listserv database (<italic>N</italic> = 8,473). Stakeholder management software used to track the ongoing engagement of deliberation participants is advertised as a tool to “keep the project and its key stakeholders aligned” (database files). The discussion of alignment is not limited to participants’ empathic attitudes toward organizations’ limitations, but also to participant actions, which deliberative marketing describes in terms of “cooperative” individual behavior. Of course, the discussions that occur in deliberation could provide fertile contexts for mobilization around shared grievances, and practitioners regularly describe how to soothe client fears about this risk (field notes). But deliberation consultants are confident about deliberation as a method for channeling individual action in productive ways when it is managed well, largely because participants are actually encouraged to mobilize in process marketing and discussion materials for goals identified by organizers as feasible and empowering.</p>
<p>For example, literature for the Iowa Citizens’ Summit on Childhood Obesity notes that “prevention in childhood is the one viable approach” and the process will “emphasize health-promoting steps that can be taken immediately” (database files). The emphasis on individual behavior and focus on powerful actors as constructive collaborators in positive marketing efforts conveys an explicitly narrow message about the viability of social action: youth must literally be “shaped,” and “the basis of the plan <italic>needs to be</italic> actionable steps that <italic>each of us</italic> can take and <italic>promote</italic> today and tomorrow” (participant guide, emphasis ours). Deliberative marketing attempts to channel individual action toward cultural change, not collective action toward social justice. A listserv reader responded to the call for help with the housing-related industry employees “too tired, worried or disgusted to do a good job” by warning that the employees had to learn compassion for customers and that the event should not focus on the economic crisis: “Survival as a functioning business capable of a strong comeback requires compassion and a ‘together’ approach.” Coming “together” meant caring for customers instead of sharing concerns about the industry downturn: “They all need to put themselves in their customer’s shoes. What does the error or omission mean to the customer? What would it mean to them if they were the customer? <italic>It’s easy to point the finger at the economic crisis</italic> but in good times and bad the only source of income for any business is its customers” (database files, emphasis ours).</p>
<p>Despite the dire framings of the choices administrators have to make, when it comes to participant actions, deliberative marketing emphasizes positivity. Methods adapting principles from positive psychology are seen as ideal for producing alignment in behavior since they emphasize the power of individual action in overwhelming circumstances. As in the CCIII eagle visioning and sharing of “inspiration” from the recovery of New Orleans, the “Appreciative Inquiry” method is used to frame social problems and organizational failures as wellsprings of creative generativity. One handbook encourages those marginalized in a downbeat economy to see hardship as an opportunity and turn lemons into lemonade, through the examples of a microbrewery that sells “Bailout Bitter” and a Utah woman’s successful “home tending” business “as the home foreclosure crisis leaves whole neighborhoods almost abandoned” (database files). In deliberation on organizational development and community planning projects, communities and employees in crisis are celebrated for putting a brave, happy face on their losses, competing with similarly depleted peers in other organizations and communities to decipher the best way to turn “social issues” into “new sources of value” (database files).</p>
<p>Certainly, such framings may fall flat, or are challenged as they were at the tables in CCIII. Indeed, many facilitators may deliberately introduce unappreciative social justice frames on particularly contentious topics, usually where these are anticipated or have arisen in pilot run-throughs prior to the event. When deliberation is successful, these justice concerns and participant anger are respectfully acknowledged and defused by organizers, as in a new IAP2 training on “emotion, outrage, and public participation,” in which practitioners learn “strategies for assessing and addressing outrage and how to plan for it in your public participation program” (database files). While studies have documented cases of increased engagement following process participation, survey research in Lee and Long Lingo’s case study of deliberation on the performing arts found that, even when the subject of deliberation was development of a collective action agenda, participants were actually less interested in participating in collective action following the intensive four-day deliberations than they were before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840613479233">Lee &amp; Long Lingo, 2011</xref>). Consensus emerged over the course of the meeting that national change was needed, but the local scale was the most likely to yield effective action. In line with the argument made here, a social marketing campaign was participants’ top priority for national-level action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840613479233">Lee &amp; Long Lingo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Routinely employed deliberation framings emphasize individual-level action as the sole “viable” approach to social change on issues related to macro and meso-level economic restructuring. While deliberation might significantly increase the scale and depth of public voice in decision-making, its topical range as proposed in event marketing is relatively restricted to the challenges facing managers—no surprise as managers are the ones commissioning its use in most cases—and the scope of solutions it claims to deliver are typically limited to behavioral and attitudinal adjustments for individuals, and social marketing campaigns by organizations to support these changes.</p>
<p>As described above, deliberation is often employed for topics that reflect a “tight times” landscape in which managers face fallout from redevelopment, reorganization, and retrenchment. The shared “tough choices” framings of topics on youth, organizational development, and urban planning in terms of concern for others, appreciative attitudes, and behavioral adjustment indicate that organizations seek deliberation as a strategy in order to foreclose “negative,” “self-interested” critiques of managerial authority in tight times. We see in this section that deliberation facilitators make promises to sponsors about the outcomes of their empowerment interventions in terms that emphasize disciplinary alignment and quieting of angry publics, small-scale actions in support of administrative goals, and greater tax morale. While these outcomes are advertised as public-spirited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840613479233">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore as serving the civic goals scholars emphasize as intentional outcomes of deliberation, they also serve as clear strategic goals for organizations facing extreme budgetary challenges and increased contention.</p>

<title>Connecting Civil Society Subsidies to Social Control in an Era of Crisis</title>
<p>By investigating deliberation as an organizational strategy, this study has found that practitioners facilitate for organizations across sectors on similar issue framings of social problems in communities and organizations facing dramatically straitened circumstances. Consultants promise to deliver predictable outcomes to their clients by emphasizing positivity rather than grievance construction, encouraging empathy for organizational sponsors and other stakeholders, and foregrounding decision-makers in all three sectors as collaborators in community-level change. Typically more substantive and engaging than other forms of subsidized participation such as grassroots lobbying, deliberation may prompt activation and shift perspectives as practitioners claim. Nevertheless, if those promises are true, attitudes are likely to be positive toward organizations even as strapped participants find it difficult to effect change on an individual level. Even the most engaged deliberators may assess such processes as dynamo Susan did when I checked in with her by email a year after the CCIII event, following a difficult move home to New Orleans. Susan still has faith in the plan and carries good feelings about the meetings, despite her daily struggles: “Yes, I am glad I participated and wish I could be more involved. My health is failing and I am in a busy demanding job that does not pay much. Also I haven’t been in touch with anyone concerning the UNOP. The planning of the meeting and getting so many people involved was done well” (database files). The political awareness developed in scrupulously crafted, well-resourced deliberative processes may include subtle but far-reaching effects, restricting the structural issues considered viable targets for civic problem-solving and reshaping lay perceptions of powerful decision-makers as supportive stakeholders in citizen-initiated social change.</p>
<p>It is important to note that neither the reorientation of large-scale political mobilization to small-scale cultural change, nor the flattening of corporations and governments to stakeholding collaborators, are unique to deliberation; these trends have been documented by scholars as part of a broader shift in political contention strategies in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613479233">Armstrong &amp; Bernstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840613479233">Lee, McQuarrie, &amp; Walker, 2010</xref>). Indeed, these findings echo those of researchers of alternative organizational strategies to engage publics, who have found that empowerment may be enhanced, and political consciousness changed, in specifically delimited ways that do not challenge the power of their administrative sponsors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840613479233">Kreiss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840613479233">Levitsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840613479233">Walker, 2009</xref>). In this case, we see organizations from all sectors using deliberation as a strategy, supporting the arguments of organizational theorists who emphasize structural similarities across organization types. But the empowerment on offer to would-be challengers in deliberative settings is contingent and very much a product of its time; citizens are invited to act as if individuals are co-equal to powerful organizations in their ability to effect social change—a hopeful prospectancy that does not reflect, but may reinforce, currently existing relations of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840613479233">Eliasoph, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the blurring of strategies associated with defenders and challengers in contemporary organizational life, comparing movements and organizations in terms of theories that can apply across organization types and to less overtly conflict-oriented contexts is understandable; however, it risks losing sight of the larger sociohistorical context in which such blurring and its resultant abstraction of interests and interactions actually is a strategic outcome sought with particular energy and for particular reasons in the current moment. When corporations adopt social movement strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840613479233">Walker, 2009</xref>), or when social movements “join the cocktail circuit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840613479233">Lahusen, 2004</xref>, p. 55), scholars have generally had relatively little trouble assessing the stakes of the strategic tradeoffs and power inequalities within—in part because debates among the relevant contenders over “astroturfing” or cooptation accompany those shifts. Hernes and Mikalsen claim, for example, that the transformation from protest to participation in corporate social responsibility entails a “stronger emphasis on cooperation and participation—at the expense of direct and disruptive action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840613479233">Hernes &amp; Mikalsen, 2002</xref>, p. 15). We argue that investigating how contemporary change strategies like deliberation remake authority requires asking whether strategies that look substantially the same on their surface may subtly reframe the meaning of empowerment and social change when used in different contexts. Such reframings may be strategically useful specifically because they are not as susceptible to accusations of disingenuous intent. As corporate social responsibility efforts are themselves challenged, deliberation may become more powerful as an organizational strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840613479233">Scherer &amp; Palazzo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To be sure, despite its potential for demobilizing dissent, deliberation can and does serve diverse strategic agendas beyond conflict reduction. For instance, it may be used to develop a collective action agenda for membership organizations, or for assemblies of activist groups. Nevertheless, the outcomes that those seeking to use deliberation in service of social justice discover may be far more disappointing than promised by political researchers, in part because their targets have already adopted deliberation as a strategy for demobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840613479233">Doerr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840613479233">Lee &amp; Long Lingo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As research on social movements and organizations converges, it is worth remembering that there are reasons for distinguishing the two areas of study, not least because the reframing of organizations as co-equals with movement actors may be an organizational strategy itself. In order to understand the political implications of the new discipline of deliberative democracy unfolding in the current era, the best tools for the job may come from comparative historical approaches to organizations. Much work remains to be done on the organizational projects which deliberation supports, and the complicated relationship of deliberation to the defining down of social responsibility and reduced public expectations of market and state authorities. Comparative historical analysis of its strategic contexts should contribute to a better understanding of deliberation’s small but critical role in reshaping traditional distinctions between labor relations, civic action, and organizational power in public life.</p>

<p>Given the permanent and preventable effects of malnutrition, the problem of childhood hunger is arguably more pressing than that of poor toddlers at risk of being overweight.
