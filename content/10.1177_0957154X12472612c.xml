<p>Jane Austen, Samuel Richardson, Hannah More, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin are among the authors whose writing examined nerves and nervous disease. They were a part of the widespread discussion of mental states in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century which constitutes the focus of Heather Beatty’s study. The book seeks to place nervous disease, its symptoms and its treatment in social, cultural and historical contexts in order to understand the experience of nervous disease and the relationship between its lived reality and popular perception. The author asserts that ‘nerve theory infiltrated and influenced society, providing the public with a medical lens through which to view, or magnify, social problems’ (p. 143).</p>
<p>After a chapter defining nervous disease in the eighteenth century, the author surveys the medical profession and catalogues the varieties of specialists on nervous disease, including those she calls ‘quacks, social climbers, social critics, and gentlemen physicians’ (chapter 2). Chapter 3 combines a qualitative and quantitative approach to disease, detailing the variety of symptoms suffered by patients, while chapter 4 examines the range of therapies prescribed. The final chapter charts the medical and social debates about what nervous disease represented, and demonstrates how attitudes towards the disease changed over the course of the century.</p>
<p>Contemporaries attributed the spread of the symptoms of nervous disease and their increasing discussion to Britain’s ascendant civilization. Those diagnosed with the disease were considered more sensitive to the world around them. Beatty shows that this was generally considered an admirable quality reflecting a heightened civility and sophistication. By the end of the century, however, many were sceptical of this interpretation, instead seeing nervous disease as a weakness brought on by luxury that signalled individual and, more menacingly, national degeneracy. Beatty points to the irony that as the disease was taken more seriously by the medical community, its social cachet declined. Patients were more often blamed for their symptoms and, as heredity became better understood in the 1780s, the concern about the spread and permanence of the disease added to its stigma.</p>
<p>Drawing on a wide range of sources, including hospital registers, medical society records, medical school lectures and dissertations, letters written by patients, private writings, and the case notes of medical practitioners, the book allows the reader an intimate view of those who suffered and the physicians who tried to help them. Some of the most instructive material draws on the extensive correspondence of William Cullen (1710–90), the Edinburgh physician and nerve specialist. The analysis of nervous disease as depicted in contemporary novels is equally fascinating. However, the discussion of these literary sources could have been expanded to strengthen the author’s argument about the historical insights to be gained from the study of nervous disease and to emphasize the importance of the book’s historiographical intervention.</p>
<p>Beatty returns throughout the book to the authenticity of the disease and the sincerity of those who experienced its symptoms, and repeatedly asserts that their suffering was real, not imagined. As she states, ‘the fact that so many patients were diagnosed with nervous disease even amidst this flurry of medical and social negativity towards nervous sufferers late in the century, proves that the diagnosis of nervous disease was not dependent on fashion’. At the same time ‘it was a genuine medical diagnosis that was … often instigated by social causes and laden with cultural implications’ (p. 172). Is this insistence on the genuine and objective nature of the disease misplaced? Without a clearer explanation of the significance of this claim as it relates to other scholarship on this question, these statements give credence to nineteenth- and twentieth-century medical theories that dismissed real suffering among patients as hysteria and undermine the book’s careful reconstruction of nervous disease. This problem may be exacerbated by the author’s acceptance of contemporary medical opinion, and the credence she gives to the ‘gentlemen physicians’ over those contemporaries designated as ‘quacks, social climbers, and social critics’.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the book compellingly brings together the sources on nervous disease in the eighteenth century. By including the experiences of patients from the middling and working classes, it demonstrates that nervous disease was not in fact limited to the wealthy elites and opens many areas for future research on questions relating to the wider range of people who suffered from psychological distress.</p>
