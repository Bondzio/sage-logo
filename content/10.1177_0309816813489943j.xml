<p>This book is a comprehensive introduction to Marx’s life and thought. It starts off by sketching his personal, intellectual and political trajectories, drawing out connections between them and situating them in the broader political struggles in Europe at the time. The chapters that follow further contextualise Marx. Drawing on Lenin’s famous three-sources-of-Marxism argument, Callinicos positions Marx’s work in relation to French socialism, English political economy and German philosophy. The storyline inevitably involves theoretical perspective-taking on contested issues within Marxism, such as the class nature of absolutism in continental Europe or the periodisation of capitalist expansion in Western Europe. The book’s main chapters cover ‘Marx’s Method’, ‘History and the Class Struggle’, ‘Capitalism’, and ‘Workers’ Power’. It ends with chapters on ‘Marx Today’ and ‘Further Readings’. Written by one of the leading contemporary Marxists, the book presents Marx’s thought system in a wonderfully clear manner, which manages to make even complicated things seem simple. Both newcomers to Marx and those who want to get a handle on some of his more arcane constructions, such as the method of abstraction, will find the book a great resource. Callinicos’ introduction to the intricacies of the labour theory of value is one of the best on the market today. The Marxism that emerges from the book is attractive, because it stands for a (Trotskyist) socialism from below: the self-emancipation of the popular classes. What may be less attractive to some readers is the book’s conservatism. It presents an unapologetically classical Marxist tradition. Perry Anderson, writing about Trotskyism in post-1945 Western Europe, explained the priority given to the ‘preservation of classical doctrines … over their development’ by the absence of revolutionary mass movements in the concerned countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">Anderson 1987</xref>: 101). The argument, it seems, still holds.</p>
<p>While many contemporary Marxists do not adhere to classical Marxism, the approach is not yet analytically exhausted, as Callinicos’s own prolific work on contemporary politics demonstrates. Moreover, classical Marxism is often the point of departure for post-classical reformulations and extensions of Marxism. On both these counts, classical Marxism resembles structural realism, the once dominant theory of international politics formulated by Kenneth Waltz, which, too, refuses to go away. Callinicos’s classical Marxism, then, is not the problem. But problems arise from the way he presents classical Marxism. First, the book contains a tension between its two main purposes. Callinicos wishes to introduce readers to the conceptual vocabulary of Marx, and to convince at least ‘one person of the necessity of working to bring about the self-emancipation of the working class’ (p. xxiv). Yet as the ‘h’ in historical materialism underscores, capitalism is not a transhistorical phenomenon. Its social forms have undergone considerable metamorphoses since the 19th century. While Callinicos makes the point that classical Marxism is a crucial resource for anyone who wants to arrive at a deeper understanding of capitalist reality, which is often concealed beneath the misleading way reality presents itself to us and is re-presented to us, he does not offer any contemporary illustrations of the theory’s explanatory power. Yet, as he observes himself in the foreword to the book’s 1995 edition, which is included in the current edition, the ‘world is a very different place today’ (p. xiii). Since this sentence was written, the political economy, politics and culture of capitalism have undergone major transformations. Today it is ‘common sense’ to argue that Marx is hopelessly out of time when it comes to understanding and changing capitalist societies. Against this backdrop of socially embedded scepticism, an introductory book would do well not to leave it up to readers, many of whom are likely to be newcomers to Marx, to discover how the apparently antiquated vocabulary of classical Marxism may help them to decipher, tame and ultimately get rid of neoliberal capitalism. Writing such a book for our times requires, for didactic reasons, ample use of contemporary examples to illustrate the analytical power of Marxism. The lack of such examples is a textual shortcoming with practical consequences, as it is likely to limit the discursive power of the book to convince readers to take up the anti-capitalist struggle. The source of this problem is the book’s publication history. It was first published in 1983, with a second edition following in 1995. It left the text virtually unchanged, as have the four reprints since. In the 2010 Bookmarks Publications edition, the newest entry in the <italic>Further Reading</italic> chapter seems to date from 1996. The 2011 Haymarket Books edition has more up-to-date references, but remains otherwise unrevised. This is particularly bothersome in the chapter on ‘Marx Today’, in which ‘today’ refers to the bygone era of really existing socialism and nationalised British industries.</p>
<p>So far, this has been an immanent critique. What follows, even though it is closely related to the point just made, is a critique that falls partly outside the terms constitutive of the storyline of Callinicos’ book.</p>
<p>Callinicos presents his classical reading of Marx as the only authentic version: ‘the real Marxist tradition’ (p. xvi). He constructs for himself the enunciating position of authoritative interpreter of Marx who reconstructs the development of the master’s thought system in terms of unifying authorial intent; that is, ‘What Marx really meant to say’ (p. xxiii). This is problematic not only because it subordinates a complex, multi-layered and ‘multiply voiced’ oeuvre such as the one produced by Marx to a single reading strategy. Callinicos’s framing of classical Marxism as the only authentic version inadvertently reinforces the anti-Marxist common sense mentioned above, by making it easier for organic intellectuals of (embedded) neoliberal capitalism, including self-styled critical social theorists from Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck to Manuel Castel, to consign Marxism to the dustbin of history. This is so because classical Marxism is, comparatively speaking, one of the weakest strands of contemporary Marxist analysis, at least when judged by the gap between some of its key theses and the empirical record. By reducing the diversity of contemporary Marxism to a homogenous, orthodox version, the intellectual mainstream is able to declare Marxism, <italic>tout court</italic>, to be obsolete and disconfirmed by facts.</p>
<p>Two politically salient examples illustrate this point. Mainstream academics, analysts and journalists praise the maturity (political and intellectual) of the popular classes in the current Euro-crisis, which emerged in the wake of what most Marxists (classical and otherwise) consider to be a deep structural crisis of the global finance-led accumulation regime. Notwithstanding mass demonstrations in Southern European countries hit hardest by the crisis, there has been only very limited class-based resistance by popular classes, either at the point of production or elsewhere, against their brutalisation by austerity policies which force much of the costs of getting accumulation going again upon them. The mainstream commentariat sees this quietism as a reconfirmation, if any was needed, that classical Marxist arguments about class formation and class struggle drawn from the times of Marx and Engels, Kautsky, Luxemburg and Lenin are out of sync with today’s postmodern world, in which the politics of class antagonism has been superseded by widespread indifference to traditional modes of politics centred on (party political) representation, the fragmentation of social identities, and the rise of lifestyle consciousness. A second example illustrating the empirical difficulties faced by classical Marxism – difficulties that reinforce the common sense about the obsolescence of Marxism – is the issue of humanitarian interventions, most recently brought to the top of the international agenda by the Arab Spring. Since the end of the Cold War, the USA and its allies have engaged in historically unprecedented military, diplomatic and economic cooperation to carry out interventions by direct and indirect means in non-capitalist or crony capitalist countries that do not play by the rulebook of the Western powers. Moreover, these interventions are often supported and even loudly demanded by what seems to be a majority of the popular classes in the target countries. On the face of it, the new interventionism constitutes a world politics that is very different from the one depicted by classical Marxist theories of intra-imperialist conflict and war and anti-imperialist struggle in the Global South. Self-styled critical world politics scholars have certainly made much of this difference when they depict the new interventionism as being about ‘saving strangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309816813489943">Wheeler 2000</xref>). Arguably, an unreconstructed Lenin-Bukharin theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309816813489943">Callinicos 2010</xref>) is ill-equipped to challenge this folksy and self-congratulatory assessment.</p>
<p>The point here is that critics of Marxism, just like Callinicos in his book, fail to give due consideration to the richness of Marxism. They present the theory without taking account of post-classical Marxism such as political Marxism or Gramscian world order studies, and mid-level theories of politics beyond the state. Post-classical Marxism has started to do fresh conceptual work to tackle empirical anomalies such as those mentioned in the previous paragraph, while retaining valuable insights from classical Marxism (cf. various contributions to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">Anievas 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309816813489943">Fleetwood 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309816813489943">Kiely 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309816813489943">Madra and Özselçuk 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309816813489943">Wood 2005</xref>). In so doing, post-classical Marxism has succeeded in reinvigorating Marxism as an active academic culture. Contemporary post-classical Marxism has pushed the envelope of theorising about capitalist civilisation well beyond the boundaries established by Marx, Engels and the first few generations of Marxist thinkers following in their footsteps. While Callinicos’s book is devoted to Marx, he could have – indeed should have – referred, however briefly, to these intellectual developments, and to the novel insights into neoliberal capitalism they have generated. This could have been done in a completely revised chapter on ‘Marx Today’. Not only does Callinicos not do so, but his book amounts to a denial of the need for any creative extension, besides the most cautious one, of classical Marxism. The conservatism of Callinicos’s book limits the argumentative ammunition and strategies available to people who are eager to find a language to criticise, and guide their efforts to change, the status quo. This in turn may well make it less likely that they espouse Marxism, classical or otherwise.</p>
<p>To conclude, Callinicos wrote an excellent, even if deliberately single-minded introduction to the thought system of ‘the greatest theorist of capital’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309816813489943">James O’Connor (1998</xref>: 281) fittingly described Marx. While the book does not capture the richness of either Marx’s own work or that of his contemporary followers, it is an outstanding example of a classical reading of Marxism. Its one-sidedness can be easily rectified by reading the book alongside either alternative interpretations of Marx or current post-classical Marxist works. Callinicos is right in insisting that Marx’s analysis and critique of capitalist society is more than a chapter in the history of ideas. Marx remains topical. At a minimum, he is a crucial resource for any radical or revolutionary critic of the world we live in. At a maximum, and this is Callinicos’s perhaps somewhat implausible bet, classical Marxism is pretty much all that is needed to come to grips with, and guide change of, the essential relations beneath the constantly changing appearances of the social totality that is capitalism.</p>
