<p>We appreciate the attention of Dr Van Elburg and Dr Neu to our clinical guideline. Their contributions to this area of research are considerable. We agree completely that further research into other outcomes of glutamine supplementation, such as growth and neurodevelopment, are desirable.</p>
<p>We conducted our literature search using the following search strategy:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the current Clinical Guideline, the search term <italic>necrotizing enterocolitis</italic> was used in PubMed with inclusion criteria including infants (birth to 23 months); humans; clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; case reports; clinical trial: phase I, phase II, phase III, and phase IV; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; guideline; journal article; multicenter study; English language; and published within the past 10 years. The search was conducted on April 21, 2011. For questions 2, 4 (glutamine), and 5, pertinent literature within the past 10 years, without restriction to evidence type, was included. A total of 1335 abstracts were reviewed, of which 24 papers met the inclusion criteria of the Clinical Guidelines and were included.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The further references that you have brought to our attention, by and large, did not meet our inclusion criteria in terms of time (published before our search window: Neu 1997; Becker 2000; published after our search date: Sevastiadou 2011; Li 2012; Moe-Byrne 2012) or exclusion criteria of reviews (van Zwol 2011; Neu 2007; Moe-Byrne 2012) or mechanistic studies (van der Schoor 2010).</p>
<p>The Van den Berg 2005 article did not appear in our search in error. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports on necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell’s stage III only) incidence as a secondary outcome to assess feeding intolerance and shows no difference with glutamine supplementation. Including this small RCT in our evidence review would not change the recommendation grade. While we do not include systematic reviews as references in our clinical guidelines, we note that 2 Cochrane reviews (one in 2008 and an update in 2012) concluded that the data do not support the use of glutamine for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis. Thus, our overall confidence in our strong recommendation against the use of glutamine here remains.</p>
<p>A further consideration for nutrition support clinicians in the United States is the limited availability and the relatively large volume required to deliver intravenous glutamine, in contrast to our European colleagues who have more concentrated dipeptide-based products. These issues raise concerns about the risk of fluid delivery in neonates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we agree with Drs Van Elburg and Neu that glutamine has not been shown to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, the subject of our clinical guideline. We also agree with them that further research may yield data in support of other beneficial outcomes for neonates.</p>
