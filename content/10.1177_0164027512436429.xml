<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of afterlife beliefs and ego integrity as two mediators of the negative relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety in later life. One hundred forty-three older adult British Christians responded to both initial and follow-up postal surveys containing questions on their religious and death attitudes. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that intrinsic religiosity predicted lower personal death anxiety via fostering more benign afterlife beliefs and ego integrity. This study demonstrated that intrinsic religiosity had a negative indirect effect on personal death anxiety through the joint agency of more benign afterlife beliefs and greater ego integrity. It also provided empirical evidence in support of the role of intrinsic religiosity in promoting psychosocial well-being in later life.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>Personal death anxiety</italic> refers to a negative emotion arising from the awareness of one’s prospective total nonexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027512436429">Cicirelli, 2006</xref>). The human encounter with death is a source of terror, because death ends life and threatens the meaning of existence. Personal death anxiety is expected to increase with advanced age because of age-related loss and decline. Yet existing evidence generally reveals a prevalent low level of personal death anxiety in late adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027512436429">Fortner, Neimeyer, &amp; Rybarczyk, 2000</xref>). Intrinsic religiosity is proposed to account for the relatively low personal death anxiety found among older adults by fostering more benign afterlife beliefs and ego integrity. Terror management theory and Erikson’s psychosocial theory have been used to describe these two religious pathways to coping with personal death anxiety in later life.</p>
<p>Aging promotes many life-threatening and disabling illnesses, which remind older adults of their own mortal limit. One of the typical strategies older people have been found to use as a defense against personal death anxiety is religious faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027512436429">Cicirelli, 2003</xref>). This is because religion is an important source of support in the midst of suffering, loss, and death for many older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027512436429">McFadden, 1996</xref>). However, the ameliorating influence of religious orientation on personal death anxiety remains inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027512436429">Ardelt &amp; Koenig, 2006</xref>). Although religiosity has been found to be negatively related to death anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027512436429">Cicirelli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027512436429">Falkenhain &amp; Handal, 2003</xref>), other investigators have found no relationship between religiosity and death anxiety among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027512436429">Thorson &amp; Powell, 1989</xref>). The use of differing measures to assess religiosity might have contributed to the existing inconsistent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027512436429">Fortner &amp; Neimeyer, 1999</xref>). For example, when measures of religious beliefs were distinguished from that of religious behaviors, they predicted “larger correlations between religiosity and death anxiety” than measures that did not make such distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027512436429">Fortner &amp; Neimeyer, 1999</xref>, p. 404). Such finding is further supported by the broader literature that generally indicates a negative association between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027512436429">Ardelt, 2008</xref>). Intrinsic religiosity describes people’s commitment to strive for meaning through their religion and to live out their religious faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027512436429">Allport &amp; Ross, 1967</xref>). For this reason, this study focuses on afterlife beliefs and ego integrity as two potential mediators in understanding the negative relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety in later life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0164027512436429">
<title>Afterlife Beliefs and Terror Management Theory</title>
<p>According to terror management theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027512436429">Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pysczynski, 1991</xref>), the religious concept of an afterlife serves as one effective defense against personal death anxiety. This is because it reassures its believers of possible immortality, which fulfills the human instinctual drive for continued existence. When death is seen as a transition to a rewarding afterlife, death becomes less threatening resulting in a reduced level of personal death anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027512436429">Wong, Reker, &amp; Gesser, 1994</xref>). In contrast, the prospect of punishment for sins after death might heighten believers’ personal death anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027512436429">Kastenbaum, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Religious faith is usually what underlies belief in an afterlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027512436429">Chaplin, 2000</xref>). It follows that the extent to which a person considers his or her religion to be a salient aspect of his or her understanding of the world will influence the strength of his or her religious afterlife beliefs. This argument is supported by several findings that greater intrinsic religiosity is related to a stronger acceptance of death as a gateway to a better afterlife among older adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027512436429">Ardelt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027512436429">Ardelt &amp; Koenig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027512436429">Daaleman &amp; Dobbs, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Ego Integrity and Erikson’s Psychosocial Theory</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512436429">Erikson (1950)</xref>, older adults who have attained ego integrity are believed to approach death without fear. This is because ego integrity is grounded in the ability to accept the unchangeability of the past and the certitude of mortality’s enforced leave-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027512436429">Erikson, Erikson, &amp; Kivnick, 1986</xref>). In contrast, failure to achieve ego integrity engenders fear that time is too short to start a new life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512436429">Erikson, 1950</xref>). Such a state of despair makes confrontation with one’s eventual death overwhelming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512436429">Erikson, 1950</xref>). Erikson’s proposed negative association between ego integrity and personal death anxiety has been substantiated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027512436429">Fortner et al.’s (2000</xref>, p. 100) finding in their comprehensive review of “a reliable, negative correlation between measures of ego integrity and death anxiety” among older adults.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512436429">Erikson (1950)</xref> recognized the relevance of religion for psychosocial development. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027512436429">Melia’s (1999)</xref> finding that faith, prayer, and love of God were important sources of identity formation and meaning in later life. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027512436429">Fishman (1992)</xref> found that religiously observant elderly people tended to score higher in ego integrity than those who were not. One possible explanation for the link between religion and ego integrity is that religion offers more benign or acceptable causal attributions to illuminate the positive consequences of stressful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027512436429">Park, 2005</xref>) to facilitate the meaning-making process about life and its vicissitudes. Because religion penetrates deeply into the lives of intrinsically religious people, these older adults are expected to achieve higher levels of ego integrity.</p>

<sec id="section3-0164027512436429">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Because the significance of religion is poorly represented in British social gerontological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027512436429">Coleman, McKiernan, Mills, &amp; Speck, 2007</xref>), in the present study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of afterlife beliefs and ego integrity as two mediators of the negative relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety among older adult British Christians. It is also hoped that this study will shed some light on the significance of the dual role played by intrinsic religiosity in later life in defending against personal death anxiety and in enhancing ego integrity. On the basis of the aforementioned literature review, intrinsic religiosity is hypothesized to lower personal death anxiety through fostering more benign afterlife beliefs as well as ego integrity in later life.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section5-0164027512436429">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The present study is based on a subset of data from a larger postal survey study that was conducted in two waves (January to February and June to July 2008). To ensure sufficient recruitment of participants, the survey data were collected from a combined sample of (a) 440 older adult subscribers to <italic>Saga</italic> magazine, which is the United Kingdom’s bestselling monthly magazine especially directed at adults aged 50 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027512436429"><italic>Saga</italic>, 2011</xref>), and who had taken part in a previous study of perceived spiritual needs in 2003; (b) 166 volunteers of an older participant pool in our School of Psychology; and (c) two local Protestant churchgoers who were unavailable to be pilot interviewed in the study design phase but wished to take part in the postal survey study. Older adults are defined as people aged 60 years and older. Sufficient orthodoxy of Christian belief is indicated by accepting the divinity of Jesus and at least receptiveness to belief in a personal God.</p>
<p>One hundred fifty-eight participants met the inclusion criteria and had completed both initial and follow-up postal surveys. Of these, 15 participants were excluded for the following reasons: (a) 1 participant later decided to withdraw from the study; (b) data for 13 participants could not be identified, because of missing participant identity codes; and (c) 1 participant’s initial postal survey was lost in transit. Hence, the present sample consisted of 143 participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027512436429">Table 1</xref> displays the demographics of these 143 participants. The majority were subscribers to <italic>Saga</italic> magazine, older than 70 years of age, female, retired, married, and holding Protestant beliefs. Because the history of the Church of England has been under the influence of three broad traditions, namely, the Evangelical, the Catholic, and the Liberal, since the 18th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027512436429">Church of England, 2011</xref>), it is not surprising to find one fifth of the participants holding both Catholic and Protestant beliefs.</p>

<p>Benign afterlife beliefs were measured by belief in a good afterlife and belief in an unpleasant afterlife, because the dark side of an afterlife has been underexplored. The six-item Death as an Afterlife of Reward subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027512436429">Spilka, Stout, Minton, &amp; Sizemore, 1977</xref>) was used to measure participants’ belief in a rewarding life and personal justification after death. Each item was rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from −2 (<italic>definitely false</italic>) to +2 (<italic>definitely true</italic>). One item was later discarded (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027512436429">Table 2</xref>), and the resultant Cronbach’s α value was .89.</p>
<p>Six items were self-constructed to measure participants’ belief in punishment for sins and suffering after death (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0164027512436429">Appendix</xref>). Each item was rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from −2 (<italic>definitely false</italic>) to +2 (<italic>definitely true</italic>). A scree plot from the exploratory factor analysis revealed a one-factor solution for this self-constructed scale. Cronbach’s α value was .64.</p>
<p>Ego integrity was measured using four constructs, namely, positive attitudes toward aging, life purpose, existential vacuum, and self-acceptance. The five-item short version of the Attitudes Towards Ageing Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027512436429">O’Hanlon &amp; Coleman, 2004</xref>) was used to measure participants’ optimistic orientations and feelings with regard to their personal aging. Each item was rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). There are three reverse items, and each of them was reversely scored. Cronbach’s α value was .83.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027512436429">Reker and Peacock’s (1981)</xref> nine-item Life Purpose subscale was used to measure participants’ perceptions of having life direction and a sense of fulfillment from goal accomplishment.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027512436429">Reker and Peacock’s (1981)</xref> seven-item Existential Vacuum subscale was used to measure participants’ perceptions that life was deprived of any significance and that there was nothing to live for.

One item was discarded (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027512436429">Table 2</xref>), and the resultant Cronbach’s α value was .79.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027512436429">Wong’s (1998a)</xref> six-item Self Acceptance subscale was used to measure the extent to which participants accepted what they could not change as part of their lives and identities.

One item was discarded (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027512436429">Table 2</xref>), and the resultant Cronbach’s α value was .76.</p>
<p>Personal death anxiety was measured by a total of 31 items: (a) the 9-item Repulsion by Death subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027512436429">Orbach et al., 1991</xref>) and (b) 24 items extracted from two multidimensional death anxiety scales developed from theistic samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512436429">Abdel-Khalek, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436429">Florian &amp; Kravetz, 1983</xref>). Each item was rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Two items from the Repulsion by Death subscale were subsequently excluded (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027512436429">Table 2</xref>), and the resultant Cronbach’s α value was .88. The 24 additional items were extracted to encompass four aspects of personal death anxiety that were identified from the participants’ written responses to an open-ended question, which asked if they had any death- and dying-related concerns, but were not tapped by the Repulsion by Death subscale.</p>
<p>The first aspect was participants’ worries over the negative consequences of personal death to their close ones. This aspect was measured by three items from the Parting From Loved Ones subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512436429">Abdel-Khalek, 2002</xref>; α = .67) and two items from the Consequences to Family and Friends subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436429">Florian &amp; Kravetz, 1983</xref>; α = .73).</p>
<p>The second aspect was participants’ concerns of being forgotten and fear of losing contact with earthly activities. This aspect was measured by four items from the Losing Worldly Involvement subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512436429">Abdel-Khalek, 2002</xref>; α = .84), one item from the Loss of Self-Fulfilment subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436429">Florian &amp; Kravetz, 1983</xref>) and three items from the Loss of Social Identities subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436429">Florian &amp; Kravetz, 1983</xref>; α = .71).</p>
<p>The third aspect was participants’ fear of not conforming to the standards of their religious faith before death. This aspect was measured by three items from the Transgressions and Failures subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512436429">Abdel-Khalek, 2002</xref>; α = .64).</p>
<p>The fourth aspect was participants’ fear related to the moment of death and the hereafter. This aspect was measured by three items from the Fear of Pain and Punishment subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512436429">Abdel-Khalek, 2002</xref>; α = .82) and five modified items from the Transcendental Consequences subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436429">Florian &amp; Kravetz, 1983</xref>; α = .85). One original Transcendental Consequences item, “uncertainty of what to expect,” was modified into two statements, namely, “uncertainty of what to expect during the end of my life” and “uncertainty of what to expect after my death,” because of its vague time reference point related to the phrase “what to expect.”</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The first questionnaire containing questions on religious and death attitudes was posted to the participants in January and February and the second in June and July 2008. Participants were given at least 1 month to complete and return their surveys with enclosed stamped return envelopes by post. The School of Psychology Ethics Committee of the University of Southampton reviewed and approved the study before its initiation.</p>

<sec id="section8-0164027512436429">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Bivariate correlations were run to examine the relationship among intrinsic religiosity, benign afterlife beliefs, ego integrity, and personal death anxiety. Because structural equation modeling (SEM) has an advantage of assessing two or more latent mediators simultaneously, the afterlife beliefs and ego integrity joint mediation model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027512436429">Figure 1</xref>) was evaluated using SEM. EQS Version 6.1 for Windows was used to run the SEM analysis. A nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> test, values of .90 or greater for the non-normed fit index and comparative fit index, and a value of .08 or smaller for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indicate a good fit of the hypothesized model to the observed data. Values of skewness and kurtosis within the range of +2 to −2 indicate univariate normality. Mardia’s statistics is a measure of multivariate kurtosis, and a value less than 3 indicates that the data are multivariate normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027512436429">Finney &amp; DiStefano, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0164027512436429">West, Finch, and Curran (1995)</xref> recommended Satorra-Bentler (S-B) scaling for sample sizes smaller than 200 and for distributions with moderate departure from normality (e.g., skewness = 2, kurtosis = 7).</p>

<p>Because of small sample size, parceling was used to reduce the number of indicators to improve the indicator to sample ratio. Parceling is a technique that uses parcels as indicators of constructs in SEM. A parcel is “an aggregate-level indicator comprised of the sum (or average) of two or more items, responses, or behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027512436429">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>). Two parcels were formed for each latent construct. Because of missing data on some subscale items, each parcel was created by averaging subscale items measuring the corresponding latent construct. Participants with 50% or more missing data on the set of subscale items constituting a parcel would be assigned a “missing data” value to represent their score for that parcel. Listwise is preferred to pairwise deletion with regard to SEM because “SEM requires that . . . sample size should be consistent across every element of the covariance matrix” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027512436429">Williams, Gavin, &amp; Hartman, 2004</xref>, p. 340). Only three participants were excluded listwise as a consequence.</p>
<p>Because three latent constructs (benign afterlife beliefs, ego integrity, and personal death anxiety) were measured by multiple subscales, a domain representative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027512436429">Kishton &amp; Widaman, 1994</xref>) was used to form parcels for these constructs. With this method, each parcel was created by averaging approximately equal numbers of items from each of the subscales measuring that latent construct. For example, the first parcel for benign afterlife beliefs was the resulting average of three items assessing belief in a pleasant afterlife and three items assessing belief in an unpleasant afterlife, while the second parcel was the resulting average of two items assessing belief in a pleasant afterlife and three items assessing belief in an unpleasant afterlife. When the negatively worded items are coupled with the positively worded items within the same parcel, Little et al. (1995, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027512436429">Little et al., 2002</xref>) recommend the former to be reverse coded. Hence, reverse coding was done on the negatively worded items assessing belief in an unpleasant afterlife within each benign afterlife beliefs parcel, as well as existential vacuum items within each ego integrity parcel. Because the latent intrinsic religiosity construct was measured by a single scale, instead of using a domain representative approach, the odd-even split method was used to create two parcels for this construct.</p>

<title>Exploring the Relationships Among Variables</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027512436429">Table 3</xref> depicts the descriptive statistics, internal reliabilities, and bivariate correlations among latent variable parcels. Given that the assumption of univariate normality for one of the parcels was violated, Spearman’s ρ was computed to explore the relationship among intrinsic religiosity, benign afterlife beliefs, ego integrity, and personal death anxiety parcels. The hypothesized relationships among these four latent constructs were in the expected directions. It was found that intrinsic religiosity parcels were positively associated with belief in a benign afterlife and ego integrity parcels but negatively associated with personal death anxiety parcels. Belief in a benign afterlife and ego integrity parcels were negatively correlated with personal death anxiety parcels.</p>

<title>Assessing Structural Equation Model Fit</title>
<p>For a specified model to be identified, its number of known values must be equal to or greater than the number of free parameters. In other words, a specified model must have zero or a positive degree of freedom to satisfy the minimum condition of model identification. Because all two-parcel measurement models had negative degrees of freedom, the measurement errors within each of them were constrained to be equal to increase 1 degree of freedom. With the equality constraint, each measurement model became a saturated model, which is a model with zero degrees of freedom, and thus was just identifiable.</p>
<p>Mardia’s coefficient for the afterlife beliefs and ego integrity joint mediation model was greater than 3, so non-normal SEM with S-B scaling was used to assess the model fit. Non-normal SEM results showed that the model fitted the data well, S-B scaled χ<sup>2</sup>(20, listwise <italic>N</italic> = 140) = 32.39, <italic>p</italic> = .03, non-normed fit index = .97, comparative fit index = .98, RMSEA = .06. The 90% confidence interval for the RMSEA was between .01 and .10. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027512436429">Figure 1</xref> shows the standardized coefficients of the relationships among variables in the mediation model involving intrinsic religiosity, afterlife beliefs, ego integrity, and personal death anxiety. For the sake of clarity, the measurement errors and disturbances were omitted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027512436429">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027512436429">Figure 1</xref>, intrinsic religiosity predicted stronger benign afterlife beliefs and greater ego integrity, both of which in turn predicted lower personal death anxiety. The indirect effect of intrinsic religiosity on personal death anxiety (<italic>z</italic> = −0.38) was significant. As a result, the efficacy of afterlife beliefs and ego integrity as two mediators of the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety in later life was supported. The percentage of variance explained for personal death anxiety was 30.4%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that intrinsic religiosity had a negative indirect effect on personal death anxiety through the joint agency of more benign afterlife beliefs and greater ego integrity. This suggests that how well older adults cope with their personal death anxiety depends on their ability to make sense of life and death through their internalized religious faith. In addition, it clarifies the previous inconsistent associations between religiosity and personal death anxiety by showing that when religiosity was measured in terms of religious faith and beliefs, it had an ameliorative effect on personal death anxiety (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027512436429">Fortner &amp; Neimeyer, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Intrinsic religiosity was found to be associated with a stronger belief in a more blissful life after death. Such expectation of immortality was related to lower personal death anxiety. This finding is consistent with the prediction of terror management theory with regard to the death anxiety–buffering function of religious afterlife beliefs. It also highlights the fact that it is the religious belief in an immortal self that continues in bliss, rather than in torment, that insulates older adult British Christians from the upsurges of personal death anxiety. The distinction between belief in a pleasant and an unpleasant afterlife is important because it implies that some afterlife beliefs have little or no bearing on defending against personal death anxiety.</p>
<p>Intrinsic religiosity was also found to be associated with greater personal integration, a sense of meaningfulness in life, as well as positivity toward personal aging. This finding corroborates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436429">Wong’s (1998b)</xref> view that religion or spirituality is beneficial to achieving successful aging. When older adults perceived that they had lived fully and come to terms with their past, they were able to recognize their existential significance and to approach their personal death with a minimum of anxiety. This result is consistent with Erikson’s psychosocial theory with regard to the influence of ego integrity on personal death anxiety. The finding that the ability to embrace life and achieve life meaning was associated with a lessening of personal death anxiety also suggests that personal death anxiety could be a manifestation of a fear of living an incomplete and meaningless life.</p>
<p>Given that spirituality is intimately connected to religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027512436429">Pargament, 1997</xref>) and to existential meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027512436429">Coleman &amp; O’Hanlon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027512436429">Tomer &amp; Eliason, 2008</xref>), the present findings are relevant to understanding the relationship between spirituality and death anxiety. Spirituality usually refers to a highly personalized way of discovering and understanding one’s relationship with a transcendent force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027512436429">Pargament, 1997</xref>). One might expect that highly spiritual people would experience lower personal death anxiety, because of spirituality’s close association with belief in a transcendental power and perceived meaning in life. This speculation is compatible with the dominant finding that “religion and spirituality can counter death anxiety and depression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027512436429">Hood, Hill, &amp; Spilka, 2009</xref>, p. 192).</p>
<sec id="section14-0164027512436429">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Enhanced religious support could help older adult Christians cope with their personal death anxiety by (a) reinforcing their religious belief in a merciful, loving God who promises them a good afterlife, and (b) encouraging them to seek religious guidance to accept and embrace life and its vicissitudes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0164027512436429">
<title>Limitations and Future Studies</title>
<p>Although our afterlife beliefs and ego integrity joint mediation model was consistent with a set of causal mediation hypotheses, causality could not be established by SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027512436429">Hoyle &amp; Panter, 1995</xref>). Thus, future experimental studies should clarify the causal direction of the hypothesized mediation.</p>
<p>The use of religion-based intrinsic religiosity and afterlife beliefs scales that are applicable and pertain to religious participants in the present study could be seen as a limitation. The inclusion of a nonreligious comparison group will provide stronger evidence to support the afterlife beliefs and ego integrity joint mediation. It is recommended that future studies use a scale such as the Post-Critical Belief Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027512436429">Fontaine, Duriez, Luyten, &amp; Hutsebaut, 2003</xref>) to measure religious and nonreligious participants’ approaches to religion. The Post-Critical Belief Scale has two dimensions. The first dimension is known as Exclusion vs. Inclusion of Transcendence. It measures the extent to which people believe in the existence of a transcendent reality such as God, thereby distinguishing religious or spiritual people from those who are not. The second dimension is known as Literal vs. Symbolic. It measures the extent to which people process religious contents in a literal or symbolic way. Hence, the Post-Critical Belief Scale could be a useful tool to explore the influence of two religiosity dimensions on afterlife beliefs, ego integrity, and personal death anxiety among older adults with and without religious faith in future research.</p>
<p>Although participants in the present study were residents from different parts of the United Kingdom, the fact that most of them were subscribers to <italic>Saga</italic> magazine could reduce the generalizability of the present study. One way of obtaining more representative samples of older adult British Christians in the future studies is via recruitment from diverse local older adult communities and charity organizations in the United Kingdom (e.g., Help the Aged).</p>
<p>Future studies can also be directed at replication of the present study in other religious groups holding similar or different types of afterlife beliefs to Christian ones, such as in a Jewish sample. “Traditional Judaism tends to focus on life in this world, rather than in the life to come, so there is comparatively little teaching on the afterlife in Judaism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027512436429">Karesh &amp; Hurvitz, 2006</xref>, . 364). Given the relatively indistinct notion of the afterlife and stronger emphasis on living in this world among Jewish people, it may be hypothesized that ego integrity will have a stronger mediating effect on the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety than Jewish afterlife beliefs.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present findings support the mediating role of afterlife beliefs and ego integrity on the negative relationship between intrinsic religiosity and personal death anxiety in later life. They also support the significance of intrinsic religiosity on mitigating personal death anxiety and promoting psychosocial well-being in later life. Future research should attempt to replicate the findings of the present study in other religious samples.</p>
