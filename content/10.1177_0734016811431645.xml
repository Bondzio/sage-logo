<p>Restorative justice, which emphasizes bringing together of all parties to repair harm and restore communities, is a relatively new topic in criminal justice. In <italic>After the Crime: The Power of Restorative Justice Dialogues Between Victims and Violent Offenders</italic>, Susan Miller examines the Victim’s Voices Heard (VVH) program. Written in a direct, descriptive, and engaging manner, the book sheds light on the impacts restorative justice can have on both victims and offenders. </p>
<p>Miller first discusses violent crime victims’ feelings and attitudes. She examines their views on crime and punishment, interactions between offenders and victims, and the power storytelling can have. Following a brief description of the program, nine chapters present different stories of offenders and victims and their work with the program. Finally, Miller discusses the implications of her findings and potential limitations of the program.</p>
<p>VVH, which began in 2002, is a therapeutic program that brings victims or survivors together with offenders in face-to-face meetings. Kim Book, who faced a tragedy of her own when her 17-year-old daughter was murdered, started the program. Book took it upon herself to meet the young male prisoner who took her daughter’s life. She was able to forgive him and now has a hope and desire for the man to turn his life around. These feelings of forgiveness and emotions drove her to create the program to help facilitate this healing process for others.</p>
<p>The program enables victims to tell offenders how they feel and what consequences have occurred from their act. It can be fruitful for victims to let out their emotions as well as helpful for offenders by allowing them to move on with their lives. Offenders who agree to participate in the strictly voluntary program receive no reward and must accept responsibility for the crime they committed. A victim or survivor may walk away at any time in the preparation process. The extensive process that takes place before a face-to-face meeting occurs includes various meetings with a coordinator, exercises, and even letter exchanges between the victim and the offender.</p>
<p>The nine stories showcased in the book are about crimes such as rape, incest, murder, and drunken-driving accidents. Each chapter reveals the facts of a crime, a victim’s story, the offender’s story, the dialogue they had, and their current situation. For example, in one story, several years before taking part in VVH, Wayne had murdered Judy, an acquaintance he met at the bar. Meeting with Judy’s daughter, Kathleen, provided closure to both survivor and offender. Miller describes the effect of a phenomenon called the ripple effect on Kathleen. Because of the ripple effect, the primary victim is not the only person affected by the crime. This is clearly the case here—it was not until after going through the VVH program that Kathleen was even able to talk to her family about the crime.</p>
<p>Overall, analysis of the nine cases showed the VVH program to be rather successful in providing benefit for the victims and offenders involved. However, limitations do exist within this program and there are questions about its replication. Miller does make note of some of these weaknesses, for instance, up to this point, the program has served a predominantly White population. VVH is a nonprofit program and the entire process of setting up and preparing for victim and offender meetings is extremely tedious and time consuming. It is difficult to keep the program going and expand it without increased financial support. It is even difficult for the program to disseminate information and promote its services to the larger public in order to get more people involved. A final weakness overall is that restorative justice has previously found limited support in the evaluation literature. These limitations do not negate the examples of the program benefits to the participants featured in the case studies. However, Miller’s conclusion about the program strengths is inconsistent with less positive findings about restorative justice. This book suggests the need for more research to evaluate such programs.</p>
<p>This piece provides insight about crime victims, who are often overlooked by the criminal justice system, by highlighting their desires and experiences. The straightforward and compelling presentation is accessible to students as well as scholars. The book also would interest practitioners interested in developing and implementing similar programs.</p>
