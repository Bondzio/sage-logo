<p>Why would a candidate in a mixed-member electoral system willingly forego the chance to be dual listed in the party list tier along with the single-member district tier? Mixed-member systems create a “reverse contamination effect” through which list rankings provide important information to voters and thus influence behavior in the nominal tier. Rankings signal importance of the candidate within the party and also constitute information about the likelihood that the candidate will be elected off the list tier. Mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) and mixed-member proportional (MMP) systems create different incentives for parties and candidates to send voters different signals. Candidates in Japan’s MMM “burned their bridges” successfully and gained more votes. In New Zealand’s MMP system, parties instead built “bridges” between the proportional representation and nominal tiers by sending different signals to voters through list rankings.</p>

<p>Why would a candidate in a mixed-member electoral system willingly forego the chance to be dual listed in the party list tier along with the single-member district (SMD) tier? Dual listing is a form of “insurance” that increases the chances candidates will win election. So it would seem perverse to willfully eschew the comfort of a dual listing to run solely in the SMD. Yet, in practice, this is exactly what a number of candidates do. For example, in Japan, where dual candidacy is allowed, more than a third of district candidates between 1996 and 2005 were not nominated in the list tier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011427881">1</xref></sup> Although the percentage of SMD candidates not nominated in the list keeps decreasing over time from 53.0% in 1996, through 40.6% in 2000 and 38.6% in 2003, to 31.9% in 2005, still a significant number of candidates do not enjoy the benefit of the dual candidacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011427881">2</xref></sup> In contrast to Japan, in New Zealand, where dual candidacy is also allowed, 88.7% of the candidates were dual listed between 1996 and 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414011427881">3</xref></sup> What could explain this difference?</p>
<p>We argue here that mixed-member (MM) electoral systems create significant “reverse contamination effects” through which voters perceive the list rankings as information or a signal that influences how they act in the district tier. Although such information can be conveyed in both mixed-member proportional (MMP) and mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) systems, the strategies by which parties elect to send these signals can differ in these MM variants. Among the strategies we identify, parties and candidates could choose to “burn their bridges” and minimize the likelihood of being elected in the proportional representation (PR) section. A burned-bridge candidate has little or no backup and thus encourages strategic voting for him or her from minor party supporters and discourages strategic voting to his or her detriment by major party supporters. A burned-bridge candidate can also employ the strategy to mobilize a higher turnout from supporters.</p>
<p>The seemingly drastic step of “burning their bridges” is not the only strategy that relies on signals sent from the PR list to influence voters in districts. Candidates and parties might choose instead to “build bridges” by signaling to voters that a candidate is well regarded in the party and likely to be able to exercise influence over legislation. We empirically test whether such strategies exist and whether they are more common in one type of MM system or the other because of the characteristics of each system and voter preferences.</p>
<p>First, we place our arguments at the convergence of two subfields of electoral studies: strategic voting and contamination effects. Then we set forth our arguments as general propositions, before discussing the cases (New Zealand and Japan) and the data sets we use to test our hypotheses. Next, we go over our findings, before finishing by discussing our conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414011427881">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-0010414011427881">
<title>Contamination Effects</title>
<p>Our argument here builds on the contamination effects literature pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011427881">Herron and Nishikawa (2001)</xref>. They advance two main arguments about the effects of one tier on the other in MM systems. First, the SMD tier can “contaminate” the PR tier because a party can raise its profile and thus votes in the PR tier by running a candidate in the district. Second, because of this contamination effect, parties will have incentives to run more district candidates than Duverger’s Law would suggest.</p>
<p>However, the empirical evidence on the two arguments is mixed at best. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011427881">Herron and Nishikawa (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011427881">Cox and Schoppa (2002)</xref> find evidence that some parties in Japan and Russia could increase PR votes where they ran SMD candidates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011427881">Maeda’s (2008)</xref> sophisticated treatment effects model suggests that SMD candidates in Japan do not boost PR votes, as parties simply send candidates to SMDs where the parties are popular and therefore expect many PR votes anyway. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011427881">Karp (2009)</xref> analyzes New Zealand data and finds only a small contamination effect. Voters cast straight-ticket votes simply because they prefer the parties, not their candidates. The argument about higher numbers of parties competing in districts than Duverger’s Law would suggest has also been contested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011427881">Ferrara (2004)</xref> argues that Italian SMDs are marked by two-candidate competition, rather than multiparty competition as suggested by the contamination effects literature. This stems from the 4% threshold in the PR tier, the majoritarian character of the system, and party coordination in SMDs. Using data on 14 MM assemblies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011427881">Ferrara and Herron (2005)</xref> concluded that the number of candidates in SMDs tended to increase when the voter had only one ballot, majority runoffs were used in SMDs, MMP was the system, the proportion of the list tier was larger, the threshold of the list tier was lower, and PR district magnitude was higher.</p>
<p>Despite these innovations, the focus of the contamination effects literature remains where Herron and Nishikawa originally placed it: on the unique institutional features in MM systems to explain the different incentives of parties to send (or not send) candidates to SMDs. Scholars also widely acknowledge the importance of the difference between MMM and MMP variants. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011427881">Ferrara and Herron (2005)</xref> point out that parties in MMM necessarily would lose one seat if they could not win an SMD district, so they would be more likely to coordinate with other parties in sending candidates than in MMP. Thus parties’ endorsement strategies would be very different: Parties, in particular large ones, in MMM would try to help their SMD candidates win as many seats as possible. One way to do so is strategic resource allocation of committee, party, or government posts to legislators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011427881">Pekkanen, Nyblade, &amp; Krauss, 2006</xref>); another way is to persuade the voter to vote for the party simply by nominating quality candidates, but the leadership also tries to make the maximum use of the institutional rule that allows for dual candidacy (in both SMD and PR tiers).</p>
<p>Thus, whatever their differences, most of the contamination literature has focused on the SMD tier and its effects on the PR portion. Here, however, we take a different approach: extending the work on contamination effects by flipping the causal arrow to also consider the potential effects of PR list rankings on the SMD vote. We believe list rankings can provide valuable information to voters and influence behavior in the nominal tier. To see how this would work, we seek insights from the literature on strategic voting.</p>

<sec id="section3-0010414011427881">
<title>Strategic Voting, Ticket Splitting, and the Personal Vote</title>
<p>Strategic voting can be defined as voting for alternatives other than one’s first preference to improve the expected result of an election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011427881">Moser &amp; Scheiner, 2005</xref>). Our discussion of strategic voting here focuses on MM systems, an excellent venue to test ideas about strategic voting because the paired ballots both provide more information and introduce possible asymmetries. To test hypotheses, most analysts of strategic voting in MM systems rely on examinations of ticket splitting—voting for a candidate of one party in the nominal tier and for a different party in the list tier.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011427881">Moser and Scheiner (2009)</xref> find that “strategic voting is a relatively common occurrence” across established democracies, they caution that it “only occurs when certain crucial conditions are met, most notably the availability of sufficient information to distinguish between viable and non-viable candidates” (p. 60). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011427881">Gschwend (2007)</xref> similarly argues for the importance of voter “expectations” about parties and coalitions as a determinant of strategic voting. Thus, voter information may be a crucial intervening variable in contamination effects and strategic voting.</p>
<p>We argue here that list rankings convey important information to the voters, helping them set expectations about who are (non)viable candidates. In the face of substantial information costs, voters act as “cognitive misers” (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991) employing heuristics to streamline their decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011427881">Gschwend, 2007</xref>). List rankings are readily available information with often very clear implications. Perhaps only more sophisticated voters will know where the likely cutoff line in PR will be for even their favored party, but any voter knows that high ranking, both absolutely and relatively, is a signal that the candidate is favored by the party. Voters might want to have such “powerful” candidates in their local SMDs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a low ranking, or even not being dual listed in the PR tier, can also affect voters’ voting decision. Assuming that a voter may prefer more local representation (i.e., he or she may want more than one candidate in his or her local district to have seats in the assembly), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011427881">Hizen’s (2006)</xref> decision theoretic model shows that a voter’s decision to vote for a candidate in an SMD would be conditional on the likelihood that the candidate would win a seat in PR. If an SMD candidate from a certain party is dual listed and highly ranked and therefore likely to win a seat anyhow, a voter might want to cast a vote for another candidate in order not to waste his or her vote.</p>
<p>Scholars agree that the precise nature of the electoral institution is important in strategic voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011427881">Gschwend, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011427881">Moser &amp; Scheiner, 2009</xref>). Joining the widespread consensus, we also argue that institutional variations between MMM and MMP are important; these variations can introduce to voters the information about parties and candidates that they need for strategic voting.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010414011427881">
<title>Argument</title>
<p>The essence of “reverse contamination” is this: List rankings could influence behavior in the nominal tier by providing information to the voters. They can provide these cues to voters in at least two ways. First, they signal the postelection intentions of how important the candidate will be within the party, providing information as to the likely future career and influence of a politician. Second, they constitute information about the likelihood that the candidate will be elected off the list tier.</p>
<p>Before delving into propositions and cases, however, we need an assumption about voters’ preferences for nominal-tier candidates in MM systems.</p>
<list id="list1-0010414011427881" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Assumption: Territorial voters</italic>: Voters prefer to maximize local representation, ceteris paribus.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011427881">Hizen (2006)</xref>, we assume that voters have preferences not only about parties but also about local representation. This is true whenever districts exist, although the importance of local district representation will vary depending on the prevalence of pork, aspects of party and legislative organization such as committee structure and seniority rules, and the link between the two tiers. For a voter, it could be reasonable to vote for a preferred party in the list tier but split his or her ticket by voting in the district for a candidate of a different party. This could be strategic voting deriving from voters’ preferences over local representation, which can have different forms. First, a voter desires to have a “powerful” politician from his or her local district, one who can influence distribution of particularistic goods after the elections. This preference is accentuated when the politician is from the majority or ruling party, or especially when lots of pork could be doled out through the politician.</p>
<p>Second, there might be a desire to have an extra representative in general. Voters with a preference for local representation also may under certain circumstances seek to have two local representatives (i.e., the one who won the district, and a second who lost in the district but won in the list tier) even if that means voting for a candidate of a party other than their preferred party. Because of the nature of MM systems, each district is represented by at least one legislator, but some districts will be “represented” by two or more legislators: the legislator elected in the district in the nominal tier and a legislator (or legislators) who ran in the nominal tier in the district and lost, but who won election in the list tier. Voters may see several benefits to having this “extra” representation. For one thing, there is “extra” constituency service to be had from multiple helpful staffs. It is also possible that extra pork will be served up in the district. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011427881">Pekkanen et al. (2006)</xref> found that legislators from Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party who narrowly lost in the district but won election in the list tier were disproportionately likely to serve on committees associated with the disbursement of particularistic goods.</p>
<sec id="section5-0010414011427881">
<title>Propositions</title>
<p>We have prima facie evidence that parties engage in some kind of reverse contamination because some candidates in MM systems try to minimize the likelihood of their being elected through PR by refusing to get safe seats in the list or even choosing not to run in the list.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011427881">4</xref></sup> Because ranking candidates is typical, the cases where candidates are not ranked call for explanation—and also for a theoretical basis for such behavior. The complicated matters of nomination and ranking strategies as a whole are beyond the scope of this article, although as we describe briefly below, they would be determined by a function of candidates’ long-term service to their parties, as well as probably their electoral prospects. Rather, we are concerned primarily with the linkages between the two tiers. Of course, the linkage between the tiers powerfully affects the information encoded in the ranking, and thus the strategies parties and candidates employ, and how voters read the ranking and strategies: These cues may have different meanings to voters in MMM and MMP systems (and indeed in different variants of these systems). Knowing this, parties and candidates may employ divergent strategies in MMP and MMM. We test hypotheses about such signals to voters by list rakings and strategic voting under both MMM and MMP and expect that the existence or absence of linkages between the two tiers could possibly influence party strategies.</p>
<p>Our first proposition hits at the heart of the curious phenomenon of a candidate not being dual listed in an MM system.</p>
<list id="list2-0010414011427881" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 1: Burning bridges</italic>: Nominal-tier candidates whose electoral prospect are zero (i.e., not dual listed) or are minimal (i.e., low ranked) will increase their votes in the district.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some candidates who run in the nominal tier in districts are not simultaneously running in the list tier or, even if dual listed, have the very limited possibility of being saved by the list tier. Because in all MM systems the list tier is, at least theoretically, a form of “insurance” or a second chance at election for candidates, such a stratagem would seem to reduce the chances for the legislator’s election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011427881">5</xref></sup> Counterintuitively, some candidates and parties adopt the strategy of running only in the nominal tier to increase the chances of the candidate’s election. Or, even if dual listed, others refuse to get safe seats in the list tier. This is because such a strategy may signal to voters that the candidate must win or be excluded from the legislature. This turns out more voters for the candidate. Some voters may not care whether the candidate is elected from the nominal or list tier but may still care whether or not the candidate is elected.</p>
<p>Our second proposition also relies on the information conveyed by the list tier rankings. In this case, the signal also conveys information about what will happen after the election that can affect constituents’ behavior in the voting booth.</p>
<list id="list3-0010414011427881" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 2: Building bridges</italic>: Candidates ranked high on the party list will fare better in their nominal tier district results.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This is because voters read the high ranking as a signal that the candidate is valuable to the party, capable as a politician, and more likely to be effective within the party. Even voters who prefer another party could choose to vote for such a candidate to have a powerful local representative. This is especially true if that candidate’s party is expected to win the election. Information encoded in the list rankings provides the basis for generating a personal vote. Voters might expect to benefit from particularistic goods being distributed in the district, especially when it is more likely that high-ranking party members will have disproportionate influence on the distribution of such goods (whether through privileged influence on policy making, advantageous committee positions such as chairs, etc.). Or, where pork is not an issue, they may prefer a candidate with influence in the party to achieve other policy aims.</p>
<p>In short, we argue that this proposition is generally true across MM systems. However, it may be influenced also by several intervening variables at the national level. Cross-nationally, the varying perceived ability of the party (or the individual politician, because of position) to allocate pork could influence the salience of this variable, as could whether the party in question is likely to become the governing party.</p>

<title>Cases and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section7-0010414011427881">
<title>Cases</title>
<p>We formulate our propositions as testable hypotheses for examination in one MMP system, New Zealand, and one MMM system, Japan. MMM and MMP systems differ in one major respect: In MMP the PR tier determines completely the ultimate number of seats a party will be allocated in the legislature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414011427881">6</xref></sup> whereas in MMM the SMD portion is separate and the party keeps the number of seats it wins in the local districts. Thus, cues provided by list rankings may have different meanings to voters because of the method by which seat outcomes are determined in MMM and MMP systems, and thus the different MM systems shape the hypotheses derived from the propositions above.</p>
<p>New Zealand and Japan are excellent cases on which to test hypotheses derived from our propositions. Both experienced electoral reform at about the same time, the mid-1990s. New Zealand made the transition from a pure SMD system to MMP, with the first election under the new system held in 1996. Japan moved from an Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) system to MMM, with its first election under MMM held the same year as New Zealand’s first election under MMP. And most important for our purpose, dual candidacy is allowed in the two countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414011427881">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>New Zealand’s former SMD system operated similar to that of the United Kingdom with two large parties (Labour and National) dominating and policy making within the parties and government highly centralized under party and prime ministerial leadership. These characteristics have been largely preserved under MMP, except the existence now of the PR tier has increased the number of smaller parties. Japan’s former SNTV system in which there were three to five representatives per district but the voter had only one vote helped to produce a multiple-party, usually five, system with a long-ruling dominant party (1955–1993), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) being a highly decentralized party with a weak central party leadership and prime minister. Although the LDP became a somewhat more centralized party after MMM, it remains quite a bit more decentralized than New Zealand.</p>
<p>Under the New Zealand MMP system, candidates run in local SMD districts, but in addition to ballots for these, voters also receive ballots to vote for a party in the PR tier. As in Germany, the PR tier is closed list, and the final number of seats a party wins in the SMD portion is adjusted to reflect the seats won in the PR tier. SMD candidates may be, and usually are, dual listed, that is, also are ranked on their party’s PR list. Under Japan’s MMM system, there are also SMD and PR portions, and candidates may run in both tiers, and losers in SMD may be “revived” as representatives if they are ranked highly enough on their party’s PR list to win one of the seats their party receives as a result of the proportion of the vote. However, the two tiers are otherwise completely separate—unlike in New Zealand’s MMP, seats a party receives are not adjusted—as the party receives the number of SMD seats its candidates won and also the number of PR seats the party received.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414011427881">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In both countries, party lists are widely circulated in daily newspapers and parties’ campaign ads, so that every voter has access to the lists and information on how their local candidates are ranked. In New Zealand, for example, all voters before each parliamentary election receive a letter from the chief electoral officer letting them know the name of the electoral district in which they are enrolled and providing them with information about the election, including a color leaflet that contains the names of all the registered parties contesting the election and a numbered (i.e., rank ordered) list of the candidates nominated on each party list. The lists are also published and available in polling places, and the news media also give them a lot of coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414011427881">9</xref></sup> In Japan, in addition to extensive media coverage of the lists, burned-bridge candidates usually advertise their refusal to be ranked and in some cases attack the other candidates in the same districts if they are given safe seats. For example, when the party president of Japan’s LDP in 1996 proclaimed, “I’ve got nothing else [but the district],” he implicitly criticized his opponent, who got a safe seat in the list tier as a dual candidate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414011427881">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning here the nature of the list selection process in both countries. In New Zealand it is highly centralized. Regional conferences and party activists can compile and rank regional lists, but usually a central committee with senior party officials makes the all-important final ranking process. Therefore, in the process, party service is an almost required condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011427881">Miller, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, the Japanese list selection process is more decentralized, although the party HQs recently have had increasing influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414011427881">11</xref></sup> The lists for the regional blocs were usually determined through coordination between prefectural branches, whereas the central leadership made final decisions when branches were unable to agree on the lists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011427881">McKean &amp; Scheiner, 2000</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011427881">Reed, 1995</xref>, for detailed descriptions).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414011427881">12</xref></sup> Compared to New Zealand, in Japan a candidate’s ranking is determined by a function of the candidate’s name recognition, public image, and electoral prospects, in addition to long-term party service.</p>
<p>As noted above, most of the literature on contamination effects in Japan has concentrated on effects of the SMD districts, both how they affect the PR vote and the latter’s effect on the number of parties in the SMD districts, with no agreement on either of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011427881">Karp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011427881">Karp, Vowles, Banducci, &amp; Donovan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011427881">Moser &amp; Scheiner, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011427881">2009</xref>). To the contrary, we are suggesting here, as in the above propositions, that the PR list rankings may provide that information to voters. However, the meaning of these cues and voter behavior may vary with MMM and MMP. We test this assertion with specific hypotheses derived from our propositions, using two data sets we developed for Japan and New Zealand. Both data sets include information on all candidates, their parties, constituencies, votes obtained in SMD, PR list rankings, seniority (years in parliament), party, parliamentary and government positions held, and so forth, for all elections from 1996 to 2008. These extensive databases provide us with the data about parties and candidates, constituencies, and so forth in both election tiers in both types of MM electoral systems to test the hypotheses below that we derive from our propositions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0010414011427881">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Recall our first proposition from above. <italic>Proposition 1: Burning bridges: Nominal-tier candidates whose electoral prospects are zero (i.e., not dual listed) or are minimal (i.e., low ranked) will increase their votes in the district</italic>. We expect MMM and MMP will generate opposite outcomes from the burning bridges proposition. High list ranking does not carry much weight under MMM compared to MMP, as under MMM the list tier plays a relatively weaker role in the ultimate allocation of seats to parties. In the case of Japan, for example, it accounts for 37.5% (180 seats) of the entire house (480 seats), and even a party leader could choose not to be dual listed, as shown above. Based on the assumption that voters want to maximize their districts’ local representation ceteris paribus, strategic voters, even if they have candidates from a different favored party, might cast their votes for a burned-bridge candidate, as they receive a signal that the candidate lowly ranked or not dual listed must win an SMD seat or be excluded from the legislature. This turns out more voters for the candidate. In the 2009 election (not covered in our analysis), for example, Shinjiro Koizumi ostentatiously rejected dual listing to turn out supporters in his SMD contest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414011427881">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the contrary, under MMP, candidates’ high list ranking signifies their importance in parties. The flip side of this statement is that candidates unranked or low ranked under MMP are less valuable to parties and therefore local districts. Voters therefore receive a signal that parties are sending only marginal candidates who may not be powerful enough to bring particularistic benefits to their districts after the elections. The result is that voters may even want to desert such candidates, but that in any case little electoral advantage is to be gained in MMP by this strategy. Accordingly, we create two separate hypotheses to test our proposition in Japan’s MMM system and in New Zealand’s MMP system. These hypotheses make opposite predictions.</p>
<list id="list4-0010414011427881" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1M: Burning bridges</italic>: Candidates who are not dual listed or are low ranked in the list tier will increase their votes in Japan’s MMM system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1P: Burning bridges</italic>: Candidates who are not listed or are low ranked in the list tier will not increase their votes in New Zealand’s MMP system.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Let us turn now to another kind of linkage between the two tiers, in which list rankings signal the relative importance of candidates to the party. Recall our second proposition. <italic>Proposition 2: Building bridges: Candidates ranked high on the party list will fare better in their SMD results</italic>. This is because voters read the high ranking as a signal that the candidate is valuable to the party, capable as a politician, and more likely to be effective within the party. We examine this empirically in both MMM (Hypothesis 2M) and MMP (Hypothesis 2P) systems.</p>
<p>The existence or absence of linkages between the two tiers influences party strategies. Under MMP, where the total allocation of seats approximates overall proportionality to each party’s vote share in the list tier, the signal that list ranking conveys to voters can have a very different meaning from that in MMM. Specifically, under New Zealand’s MMP system, votes for the nationwide list tier ultimately determine how to allocate 120 seats to parties. Therefore, voters know that parties tend to rank highly those candidates who are important, popular, and powerful as politicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414011427881">14</xref></sup> On the other hand, the nominal tier is usually more dominant in the MMM variant, so list ranking may not carry special significance compared to MMP.</p>

<title>Data and Variables</title>
<p>Our data set covers all SMD candidates in Japan and New Zealand from “significant” parties under the MM elections (1996–2005 in Japan and 1996–2008 in New Zealand). By “significant” parties, we mean the parties that won <italic>list</italic> seats in the legislature for any two consecutive elections (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011427881">Table 1</xref>). We focus on significant parties for both theoretical and empirical reasons. Theoretically, the fundamental assumption for our theory is that a party uses the possibility of winning some PR seats as a signal to the voter. If a party is so insignificant that it will not win any seats, our theory will not hold. Of course, this is testable, but empirically it is difficult to collect all the variables on those insignificant-party candidates, of whom many simply give up running for seats after only one round of the elections. Note that, as we explain below, we use candidates’ vote shares and parties’ seat shares in the previous elections as controls.</p>

<p>In the same vein, we use two different samples for Japan—with and without the Japan Communist Party, which sent candidates to almost all the SMDs from 1996 to 2005, although it was able to win only two SMD seats in 1996. The JCP’s likelihood of winning a SMD seat was indeed very thin (2 out of 1,174) compared to the other major parties (in particular the LDP and the DPJ), so we suspect the JCP can contaminate our results because almost all the JCP candidates were in fact not endorsed in the list tier.</p>
<p>Note that one of the parties we analyze has a rule that prohibits a candidate from being dual listed under a certain condition. Specifically, the LDP of Japan institutionalized an age limit rule starting from the 2000 elections. An LDP candidate aged 73 or older is not allowed to run in the list tier and therefore be dual listed, so he or she needs to run as a pure SMD candidate. As this is an obligatory rule and neither the party nor a candidate has any choice, SMD candidates from the LDP aged 73 or older need to be excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414011427881">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our observation unit is thus an SMD candidate. We assume the following causal relationship.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to estimate the direct effects of a candidate’s PR ranking on SMD performance (the thick arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427881">Figure 1</xref>). But, of course, it is reasonable to expect there are some factors directly affecting a candidate’s SMD performance, such as a candidate’s electoral results in the past, district characteristics, and personal traits (thin arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427881">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, there are factors that indirectly affect a candidate’s PR ranking as well (dotted arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427881">Figure 1</xref>). Ministers, leaders, and other important party figures for example may be given safe seats in the list tier, whereas these important figures would be expected to perform well in the next elections by leveraging their name recognition in their districts. And it might be also the case that electorally vulnerable candidates get some preferential treatments in the list. We need to control for these factors.</p>

</fig>
<p>Therefore, we recognize that there is a concern about endogeneity between the variables of our interest. Such a concern always arises whenever we fail to control for a possible causality between parties’ list rankings and candidates’ electoral performance. As suggested above, for example in New Zealand, a candidate’s loyalty to the party should be one of the factors that would influence his or her ranking in the list; and we suspect this is increasingly the case with Japan too in the recent elections. We believe that such a variable, if available, would be an ideal instrument estimating list rankings, as it is theoretically fair to say that party loyalty is hard to observe for voters and therefore that it would not affect voters’ voting decisions. Then we could model the process with a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation.</p>
<p>Although recognizing this concern, we chose not to use 2SLS models for a couple of reasons. First of all, there is no good observable measure for party loyalty—or any other measures that are not correlated with voters’ voting decisions but would affect the list ranking process inside parties—in Japan and New Zealand. There are several candidates—roll call voting, party defection, and so on—but all of these have their own problems. For example, it is very rare to see Japanese legislators defect from the party line in roll call voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414011427881">Nemoto, Krauss, &amp; Pekkanen, 2008</xref>), whereas switching between the New Zealand parties was extremely rare in the 1996–2008 period, not to mention zero switching between the two major ones (the Labour and the National). Second, we can confidently say that the most readily available data—a candidate’s seniority and cabinet or party experience in the past—can capture his or her long-term service to the party, which, in turn, should be one of the most important factors party leaders care about in determining list rankings. Our models include all of these. Third, as a robustness check, we take advantage of the panel structure of our data sets to check how a change in the list positions can affect a candidate’s electoral performance, controlling for the individual-specific effects that should include the hard-to-measure party loyalty.</p>
<p>Therefore we assume the following equation,</p>

<p>where <italic>i</italic> is a candidate, <italic>t</italic> the election years (2000, 2003, and 2005 for Japan and 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 for New Zealand), α the parameters to be estimated, and <italic>e</italic> the error term.</p>
<p>Our dependent variable is <italic>vote share</italic>, measured as a candidate’s vote share in the district. This is a straightforward measure gauging a candidate’s electoral performance in his or her SMDs. As the variable is a continuous one technically ranging from 0% to 100%, the equation will be based on ordinary least squares. The lagged <italic>vote share</italic> is also included to control for the potential effects of a candidate’s electoral performance on the current elections as well as his or her list ranking. For those candidates who did not run in SMDs in the preceding elections, the lagged <italic>vote share</italic> has simply the value of 0.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414011427881">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our main independent variable is <italic>list ranking</italic>. Note that we use two different measures for this variable. <italic>Relative list ranking</italic> is a weighted variable to allow for comparisons across different elections and parties: It is coded as a candidate’s ranking in the list, divided by a party’s seats won in the preceding elections. If the value is more than 1, it takes 1: For example, if a candidate’s party won 8 seats in the preceding elections and the candidate’s ranking is the 6th, <italic>list ranking</italic> is 1, meaning that the candidate is given a safe seat. If a candidate’s ranking is the 10th, then <italic>list ranking</italic> is 8/10 = 0.8, meaning that the candidate is not given a safe seat but still there is a good chance to win a seat. Meanwhile, if it gets closer to 0, you are unlikely to win a seat in the list. And if a candidate is not dual listed, then it is coded 0. <italic>Absolute list ranking</italic> is simply one divided by a candidate’s list ranking, and if a candidate is not dual listed, then again it is coded 0.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0010414011427881">17</xref></sup> Our burning bridges hypothesis suggests that <italic>relative</italic> and <italic>absolute list ranking</italic> should be negative for Japan, whereas our building bridges hypothesis leads us to expect that <italic>relative</italic> and <italic>absolute list ranking</italic> should be positive for New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0010414011427881">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We control for district characteristics that might affect candidate <italic>i</italic>’s electoral performance in the district. Namely, we control for a party’s <italic>PR vote share</italic> in an SMD. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011427881">Maeda (2008)</xref> has shown, a party is more likely to send SMD candidates to its strongholds. Therefore, a party’s SMD performance would be highly correlated with the party’s loyal partisan voters residing in SMDs.</p>
<p>To control for a candidate’s personal traits that could affect both a candidate’s electoral performance and list ranking, we include <italic>minister, former minister, party leader, former party leader, SMD incumbent</italic>, and <italic>number of terms</italic>. These variables are meant to control for some advantage that candidates may enjoy in their districts, namely name recognition, constituency services, and access to pork and other types of particularistic benefits (a thin arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427881">Figure 1</xref>), but we should repeat here that these influential politicians may have better access to a high ranking in the list—or they may be leaders themselves who determine parties’ list ranking (a dotted arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427881">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Minister</italic> is coded 1 if a candidate was a cabinet minister when the elections were called. Note that a cabinet minister may enjoy name recognition in his or her district but can have some disadvantage when the party in power is unpopular and therefore he or she needs to face electoral sanction. <italic>Former minister</italic> is coded 1 if a candidate experienced a cabinet minister anytime in the past. <italic>Party leader</italic> and <italic>former party leader</italic> are similarly coded. <italic>SMD incumbent</italic> is coded 1 if a candidate won the same SMD seat in the preceding elections. <italic>Number of terms</italic> is the number of terms served by a candidate in the legislature when the elections were called.</p>
<p><italic>Election year</italic> is a set of periodical dummies for each election. In countries that transition to MM systems, there may be a learning process and the effect of party list rankings may change after the initial MM election as parties, voters, and candidates gain greater experience with the workings of the MM system and greater skill in utilizing it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0010414011427881">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>To explain our controls first, <italic>previous SMD vote share</italic> and <italic>PR vote share</italic> tend to show the positive signs in both countries. This is intuitive, indicating that candidates with good electoral performance in the past, running in districts where there are more loyal partisan voters, tend to have more SMD votes. Personal traits also matter. <italic>Party leader</italic> and <italic>SMD incumbent</italic> tend to show the positive and significant signs, suggesting that leadership and incumbency are significant advantages in attracting local votes. <italic>Minister</italic> tends to have negative effects in New Zealand, but it has positive effects in Japan. This is probably because in New Zealand government turnover was much more frequent than in Japan: In New Zealand, the National and the Labour parties stepped down in 1999 and in 2008, respectively, so cabinet ministers should get electoral punishment, whereas in Japan, the LDP stayed in power during the period (2000–2005), so cabinet ministers could leverage their name recognition and access to policy benefits to appeal to local voters.</p>
<p>To delve into our Hypothesis Set 1, the results look confirmatory. All the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011427881">Table 2</xref> show that both <italic>relative</italic> and <italic>absolute list ranking</italic> have a negative impact on a candidate’s electoral performance in SMDs. All of these mean that being marginally ranked at the list tier or even not dual listed can significantly increase a candidate’s SMD votes in Japan. Compared to a safe-seat candidate, a burning-bridge candidate can improve the vote share by 2% to 7%. In contrast, no confirmatory evidence for the burning bridges hypothesis can be found in the New Zealand models.</p>
<p>Turning to our Hypothesis Set 2, the results look encouraging. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011427881">Table 3</xref>, both <italic>relative</italic> and <italic>absolute list ranking</italic> show positive signs as expected. This means that in New Zealand, where MMP is used, being ranked highly indeed helps SMD candidates boost their votes. The models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011427881">Table 3</xref> show that being given the top ranking in the list tier can improve SMD votes by 1.7% to as many as 13%, compared to a pure SMD candidate. The finding confirms our building bridge hypothesis that voters interpret high ranking in the list as a signal that candidates are valuable to parties, powerful, and capable as politicians who might be able to maximize local goods after the elections.</p>
<p>As a robustness check, we leverage the panel structure of our data sets to examine how electoral outcomes of the same candidates vary as their position on the list varies. Specifically, we now assume the following equation:</p>

<p>Unlike the first equation we showed above, this equation now has the individual-specific effects captured by δ<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. The individual-specific effects captured by this term should include the aforementioned, hard-to-observe loyalty to the party. Controlling for these fixed effects, we are now estimating how a change in the list could affect a candidate’s electoral outcome. Note that quite a few candidates quit running for the subsequent elections when they lost, so the structure of the panels is necessarily unbalanced.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414011427881">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414011427881">5</xref> show the results for Japan and New Zealand, respectively. Although some of the variables now show the inconsistent signs—for example, now the variable <italic>number of terms</italic> shows the negative signs, indicating one more term <italic>decreases</italic> a candidate’s votes in the district by 0.6% to 1.5%—our main variable of interest tends to show the consistent signs. Again, in Japan, being given a safe seat significantly reduces a candidate’s vote by 2.8% to 4.4%, whereas in New Zealand <italic>absolute list ranking</italic> suggests that a candidate can boost his or her votes by more than 10%, although <italic>relative list ranking</italic> now turns out to be very insignificant. Therefore, although evidence for the building bridge hypothesis looks weaker, it is fair to say that the two hypothesis sets are largely confirmed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that reverse contamination exists: Information encoded in the list rankings of candidates affects behavior in the SMD tier. This finding and our arguments here add a new dimension to the contamination effects literature. The idea that list tier rankings can be manipulated to signal to the electorate may be old news to the politicians and parties who engage in such manipulations, but we believe we are the first scholars to make this argument. Our second finding relates to the pair of strategies we tested: burning and building bridges. We found that candidates and parties in Japan’s MMM system “burned their bridges” to spur district voters. The stratagem works. Such candidates appear to have increased their vote totals. In New Zealand’s MMP system, parties and candidates instead built “bridges” between the PR and nominal tiers. They signaled to voters the importance of candidates to the parties, and the signal was received. Both burning and building bridges appear to be strategies that parties adopt, and which are successful.</p>
<p>Our third finding is that MMM and MMP systems create different incentives for parties and candidates. Because the link between the two tiers is different, the type of information sent and desired action from voters also differ. We further expect that variations in the MMM and MMP systems may also lead to different strategies and tactics for parties and candidates. For example, Japan’s MMM variation allows multiple listing of candidates at the same rank, and for reformed systems such as Japan and New Zealand, the nature of the prior electoral system may also have effects (thus, Japan’s prior SNTV system might encourage local campaigns more than New Zealand’s prior SMD system). Beyond the variations in the nature of the MM system, we also anticipate that variations at the national or party level could also influence results. For example, the ability of parties to deliver pork could matter, and the organization of the legislature (powerful Chairs, etc.) may affect how strongly voters desire territorial representation and also influence the signals that parties and candidates seek to send to SMD voters through the list rankings. Testing these speculations should also help to confirm the generalizability of our argument beyond Japan and New Zealand. It requires comprehensive data sets on the countries that allow the dual candidacy, such as Germany, Hungary, and Italy between 1994 and 2001 and among reformed and nonreformed electoral systems of the same type.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0010414011427881">20</xref></sup> This lies beyond the scope of this article but may be a rich field for further analysis.</p>

<p>We calculated these figures from all parties that won seats in the list tier. Specifically, these parties are the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Komeito (CGP), the New Frontier Party (NFP), the Japan Communist Party (JCP), the Liberal Party (LP), the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and the People New Party (PNP). The parties ran 3,783 candidates, and of these 1,367 (36.1%) were not nominated in the list tier (analysis of data collected by the authors from public sources).</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p>We would like to thank the anonymous reviewer on this interesting trend. It is true that the changing nomination strategy over time is a potentially fruitful research topic per se for the future, but that is not the focus of our article. And it is also not surprising to see shifts over time as parties refine their strategies and engage in learning anyhow. In addition, 31.9% in 2005 still looks like a meaningful number that requires an explanation.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0010414011427881">
<label>3.</label>
<p>This is also based on all parties that won seats in the list tier: Labour, National, ACT Party, Alliance, Green, NZF, Progressive, and United. The parties ran 1,962 candidates to single-member districts (SMDs), and 1,741 of them were dual listed.</p>

<p>We elide the distinction between candidates making the choice and parties making the choice. There are two reasons for our not differentiating between party-led bridge burning and candidate-led bridge burning. First, it is impossible to garner reliable information as to who actually initiated the decision. Parties and candidates share incentives to dissemble, and no reliable record exists. Second, we view the final decision as essentially in the hands of the party. However, we recognize that in some cases it may actually be the candidate who expresses the desire to run solely in the nominal district, even perhaps refusing to be dual listed and threatening to run as an independent in the nominal district rather than accept dual listing.</p>

<p>Along similar lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011427881">McKean and Scheiner (2006)</xref> argue that the “dual listing” in Japan’s mixed-member (MM) system reduces the number of effective candidates.</p>

<p>In rare cases, a party can win more SMD seats than entitled by proportional representation (PR) votes. There is no downward adjustment to these “overhung” seats.</p>

<p>Also, although New Zealand’s list is national, Japan employs regional blocs for PR. There are different lists for 11 different regions, with the number of seats per region (ranging from 6 to 29) determined roughly by population of the region.</p>

<p>Some parties—the JCP and the CGP in particular—are much centralized, and therefore their list selection processes look similar to those of the New Zealand parties.</p>

<p>What is unique in this coordination process is that parties may rank multiple candidates running in SMDs at the same rank. Candidates who win in SMDs are removed from the PR list at that rank. If the party is entitled to fewer seats at that rank than the number of remaining candidates at that rank, then the winners and losers are determined by the proportion of their vote in SMDs to the winners in the districts. These particular rules in Japan’s mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) system of course may increase the cues to voters that their local district vote is particularly important since it may also determine who among the equally ranked dual-listed candidates will win a PR seat. And this in turn may reinforce the “burning bridges” strategy of some candidates because their signal to voters may be even more potent: I’m counting on your local vote because it is all I have, whereas a local vote for my competitors is really just a way for them to win a PR seat.</p>

<p>News coverage in New Zealand is attuned to the implications of party rankings. For example, a story in the run-up to the 2008 election noted that “Steven Joyce . . . has parachuted into slot 16 ahead of many in the caucus—and that is a clear signal he will go straight into the Cabinet if National leads the next government” (“Maori and Asians feature in National’s New Line-Up,” <italic>New Zealand Herald</italic>, August 18, 2008). He won a seat and became Minister of Transport right after the election.</p>

<p>There were some exceptions to this rule, including former Prime Ministers Nakasone and Miyazawa in the 2000 elections, but they were pure PR candidates not running in the nominal tier. All the other SMD candidates aged 73 or older from the LDP were pure SMD candidates.</p>

<p>A special note for Japanese dual-listed candidates at the same rank is that we view their rankings as how many copartisans they need to compete with. So if a candidate is ranked as the 3rd and there are 10 candidates at the same third rank, the candidate’s ranking is viewed as the 12th. The results are robust when we use the halfway point, in this case, (3 + 12) / 2 = 7.5.</p>

<p>The results do not significantly change when we use a dichotomous dummy of whether a candidate is dual listed or not: Not-dual-listed candidates are likely to gain more votes under MMM, whereas this is not the case under mixed-member proportional (MMP). Although encouraged by this, we stick to continuous <italic>list ranking</italic> variables because the theoretical core of our argument is candidates’ electoral prospect in the list tier, rather than simply whether they are dual listed or not. In this sense, we do not see a big difference between those not dual listed and those dual listed at a very low rank. Newspapers usually point to the rankings of dual-listed candidates and report to the voters about their possibility of being elected in the list tier when they lose SMDs (e.g., “Kyo Koji: Meibo Jun’i wa Taishoteki,” <italic>Asahi Shimbun</italic>, October 28, 2003, p. 35). Based on these signals, voters make voting decisions. Along the same lines, we see a big difference between high-ranked and low-ranked candidates, and this cannot be captured by a simple dichotomous dummy.</p>

<p>Two of the authors (Krauss and Pekkanen) are currently engaged in a National Science Foundation project (Award No. 0751662, “Collaborative Research: Electoral Systems and Party Personnel: The Consequences of Reform and Non-Reform”) with Mathew Shugart analyzing eight countries, four reformed MMM, MMP countries including Japan and New Zealand and four “steady-state” countries, to test the effect of prior systems and electoral law variation on reform outcomes.</p>
