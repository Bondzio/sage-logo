<abstract>
<p>We suggest here that the analysis, interpretation and representation of qualitative longitudinal (QL) data requires methodological innovation leading to new forms of representation that elude the usual temporality of writing research. To illustrate this argument, we outline a case history method-in-process developed to condense intensive volumes of biographical data generated over 12 years, and deal with the intersection of different timescapes through which individuals move (biographical, generational, historical). We describe changing strategies for managing, analysing and representing data employed by the Inventing Adulthoods team, examining our practice in the light of key methodological issues raised by qualitative longitudinal research (QLR) and making that reflexive and collective research practice explicit.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>Sociology, in particular, has an extraordinary mandate as far as academic disciplines go: to conjure up social life . . . As a mode of apprehension and reformation, conjuring requires the analytical, the procedural, the imaginative, and the effervescent. But we have more to learn about how to conjure in an evocative and compelling way. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426232">Gordon, 2008 [1997]</xref>: 22)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The methods, procedures and ethics for conjuring social life from qualitative data have been a source of considerable debate within sociology. Currently, there is a growing feeling that the ‘old rules and guidelines for writing sociologically no longer work’, but a fresh set of rules has yet to replace them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794111426232">Smart, 2010</xref>: 4). In a recent discussion of writing sociology ‘differently’, Carol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794111426232">Smart (2010)</xref> points to the perseverance of, albeit ill-defined, rules for representing qualitative data. These include the need to situate new research in relation to existing empirical and theoretical work, to weave a sociological argument through the text, and to adopt a particular position or stance. She argues that there is a need to consider quality, style, energy and fluency in ‘the conjuring of social life’ that sociological writing should be – while reminding us that sociologists cannot just walk away with their participants’ stories and write fiction. Responsibility and accountability to our participants, and other interested parties demands a balance between analytic rigour and imaginative effervescence. The inadequacy of the old rules is particularly the case when ‘conjuring’ from <italic>longitudinal</italic> qualitative data, where the multiple temporality of biographical data gathered at intervals over time introduces additional complexities. There is a lack of analytic closure as new ‘waves’ of data are generated; an amplification of ethical questions of confidentiality, privacy and anonymity generated through long-term research relationships; and heightened researcher reflexivity as s/he becomes part of the temporal data and increasingly aware of the research process. Unfortunately, the writing up and representation of qualitative longitudinal research (QLR) is one of the least debated if most important aspects of QLR methodology. While debates in the QL context have tended to focus on ethical issues, particularly in relation to archiving and secondary/re-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794111426232">Mauthner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794111426232">Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794111426232">Parry and Mauthner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468794111426232">Winterton and Irwin, 2011</xref>), significant studies that have attempted the storying of QLR are rare. The strategies employed by those who have include focusing on institutional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111426232">Pollard and Filer, 1999</xref>), conceptual themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468794111426232">Wierenga, 2009</xref>), or attempting to integrate broad discussions of context alongside personal case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426232">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794111426232">McLeod and Yates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468794111426232">Walkderdine et al., 2001</xref>). Versions of these strategies can also be employed in qualitative research more generally, and similarly, while our discussion is based on a QL study, we consider that the methods, procedures and ethics involved in our approach will have broader relevance.</p>
<p>In this article we suggest that the analysis, interpretation and representation of QL data necessarily requires methodological innovation and compels new forms of representation, methods for ‘conjuring evocatively’, that elude the usual temporality of writing research. To illustrate this argument, we outline and discuss a case history method-in-process developed to condense intensive volumes of biographical data (generated over 12 years) and distilling complex QL data that can deal with the intersection of different timescapes through which the individual moves simultaneously (biographical, generational, historical). In recounting this methodological development, we revisit the story of a research project and the (changing) strategies for managing, analysing and representing data employed by a research team working together on a QL study in 1996. In so doing, we not only examine our practice in the light of key methodological issues raised by QLR and its representation – sequence, voice and motif – but also make that reflexive and collective research practice explicit.</p>

<title>Inventing Adulthoods: strategies for analysing and representing a growing QL dataset</title>
<sec id="section3-1468794111426232">
<title>In the beginning</title>
<p>Inventing Adulthoods (IA) has taken different forms in a number of funding contexts but basically followed 121 people growing up in five areas of England and Northern Ireland (NI) as they moved through their teens and 20s during the decade 1996–2006. The study generated a wealth of biographical material in up to six interview rounds. In 2009/10 we revisited participants in NI<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794111426232">1</xref></sup> and hope to re-interview in all sites in 2012. Largely digital transcripts and audio, this expanding dataset provides a unique window on most aspects of growing up through an important period of social change. Being funded by the ESRC in 2005 to archive this data sharpened our interest in the challenge of making the data accessible to different audiences (academic, policy, student, popular) and writing and representing a vast volume of qualitative data imaginatively. Maintaining a core team of five women from different generations, backgrounds, disciplines and career paths throughout the study has also been crucial to the research, not least in providing the continuity essential for developing and maintaining the main principles of our research approach. For us, collective working is a vital part of the creative process; our own subjectivities are explicitly recognized as a resource for the production of knowledge; data analysis is seen as integral to the research process throughout, rather than one discrete part; and research practices are approached as ethically complex, impossible to get ‘right’, but the arenas in which the value of the research is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2007</xref>). As a team we have been fortunate in the personnel involved, and in managing to attract funding in difficult research climates. Not all teams hoping to do QLR can count on maintaining such continuity.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of collective work on IA, attempting to capture patterns in the data, to examine and reflect how biographies are shaped by structural factors such as location, social class, gender, and family formation have been central concerns of the analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426232">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468794111426232">Thomson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468794111426232">2003</xref>). We have also been concerned to merge synchronic and diachronic analysis (analysing the dataset as a whole at a point in time, and examining cases through time, respectively) and to recognize and realize the investment by participants, researchers and funders through archiving the data and reaching a range of audiences. It was also our desire to give the study participants as strong a voice as possible without compromising promised confidentiality. Our strategies for analysis, interpretation and representation have changed over time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468794111426232">Table 1</xref>) as have our research questions. Across the four studies comprising IA, the research questions first related to values, then to adulthood, then to include social capital, and now the impact of social and historical processes on young lives in NI. The theoretical focus moved from critique of postmodern theories of individualization and detraditionalization to development of conceptual and theoretical frameworks and tools from the data.</p>

<p>The initial strategy for analysing and writing our qualitative data (121 interviews of 1–2 hours) in the late 1990s, seemed relatively straightforward: we coded the transcripts according to cross-cutting themes based on our analytical concerns and used NuDist (NViVo) to provide the overview and enable us to identify the illustrative cases that would add depth. In writing, we constructed an argument linking theoretical concerns, research questions and findings for the expected audience, highlighting for example policy issues about young people. The strategy is exemplified in the first book based on the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426232">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>). Chapters were organized around themes with longitudinal cases presented within this framework. The first part of the book speaks largely with the voice of the researchers to a policy agenda that problematizes youth; the second attempts to reflect young people’s own concerns. As the dataset extended and deepened we became increasingly drawn to create case studies that traced how individual lives changed over time, hoping to capture something of the relationship between time, timing, resources and resourcefulness in the young people’s lives.</p>

<sec id="section4-1468794111426232">
<title>From narrative analysis to case profile to case history</title>
<p>In sociology, case study is an approach emanating from different theoretical perspectives – phenomenology, symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111426232">Byrne and Ragin, 2009</xref>). Widely used and variously defined, case study can have as its object of study an individual, a group, an institution, or wider reference, with importance placed on defining the borders of the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426232">Chadderton and Torrance, 2011</xref>). Some have argued that case study is intense study of the particular from which generalizations cannot be made: ‘The purpose of the case study is not to represent the world but to represent the case’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794111426232">Stake, 1994</xref>: 245). Others take the position that it is possible to generalize, and that theoretical and scientific development has often turned on case study evidence and theorizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794111426232">Flyvbjerg, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111426232">Inglis (2010</xref>: 513), for example, contributes to the ongoing debate in sociology about linking ‘the micro world of the individual and everyday life and the macro world of structures, discourses, fields and institutions’ and ‘historical processes’ via the concept of ‘sociological forensics’. For him, each case study contains clues, episodes or events, which when analysed with appropriate theories illuminate micro and macro connections. He argues that the case study is key in developing a diachronic analytic approach, drawing on some classic examples from anthropology and sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111426232">Goffman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794111426232">Thomas and Znaniecki, 1927</xref>). Rachel Thomson argues similarly that individual cases can be worked with in a way that locates subjectivity in a cultural and historical context, where the individual is a key that unlocks the operations of the social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2009</xref>: 20). An example can be found in a paper by Diane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794111426232">Reay (2002)</xref> where she examines the case of Sean, a young man she followed through a series of research studies. The depth and duration of Reay’s engagement enabled her to draw a vivid account of reflexive masculinity with significance for education, welfare and youth justice policy discussions.</p>
<p>The term ‘case history’ has roots within the social sciences, drawing on oral and life history approaches, in which the case history is generally constructed retrospectively from interview and other data. The term was employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111426232">Bertaux and Bertaux-Wiame (1997)</xref> to capture their exploration of social change through the life history of a single family. These researchers also drew on the family systems psychotherapeutic approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111426232">Byng-Hall (1995)</xref>. Here the family is conceptualized as a continuous contractual relationship across time, where unresolved emotional dynamics can be transmitted through the ‘symbolic coinage’ of family stories, within which motifs, patterns and difficulties are repeated and the ‘very phrases echo down the generations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468794111426232">Thompson, 2005 [1993]</xref>: 30). The term case history is used somewhat differently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794111426232">Kuhn (2002)</xref> to capture her reflexive work on auto-biographical visual texts as a way into understanding broader historical processes. While contrasting in terms of theoretical resource and methods employed, both approaches embrace the specific case as a means through which to access the social and historical. A more familiar use of the term ‘case history’ derives from medicine and allied professions, suggesting the recording and collection of information on an individual or a family over a period of time and as a foundation for practice. In psychoanalysis the published case history exploring and interpreting a single case has not only become a literary genre in its own right but has also become the key vehicle for the testing and elaboration of theory.</p>
<p>Our approach to case history has evolved over time, its roots being in our methods for capturing the biographical depth, developmental process and social and historical specificity of the lives we have been ‘walking alongside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794111426232">McLeod and Thomson, 2009</xref>). IA was not designed as a QL study, but, as it evolved and matured, we found ourselves trying to capture something of the process through which the self is made and remade over time, the ‘habitus-in-process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426232">McLeod, 2003</xref>) or ‘continued becomings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794111426232">Stanley, 2007</xref>). We also became increasingly reflexive about the role of the researcher as the mobility of our own as well as the participants’ subjectivities inevitably became an integral part of the research, which we wanted to recognize and make explicit. Similarly, the accumulation of individual and collective team interpretations over time lent an additional concern: to find ways of capturing changes in interpretation and making issues of hindsight and foresight explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794111426232">Thomson and Holland, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The case history development process began with second IA interviews (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468794111426232">Table 1</xref>), when the research took a more biographical turn, as had sociology more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111426232">Chamberlayne et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468794111426232">Miller, 2000</xref>). At this point we developed a form of intermediate analysis, the narrative analysis, completed by the interviewer soon after the interview. This captured the changes in individual narratives over time but also the researchers’ personal reflections and their hopes, fears and predictions for the young person – thus providing a rich source of additional ‘researcher’ data. By the time participants had been interviewed up to three times in 2001 we decided that responding to the intensive nature of the individual archive<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468794111426232">2</xref></sup> that was accumulating for each participant from these research encounters required a different response. We developed a form of metadata/prospective analysis built on the narrative analyses that we called a ‘case profile’. This analysis and representation of the case was cumulative, through time. The profile condensed the case and enabled us to grasp at a glance how circumstances and life events changed over time, as well as summarizing key themes from interviews, the subjective accounts of the researcher and sketching preliminary analyses and interpretations in relation to our research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794111426232">Thomson and Holland, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The case profile (a tool for managing and condensing data) became an important basis for developing the case history (a method through which individual archives are transformed into an analytic narrative). Rachel Thomson developed a model for storying data from the IA study, resulting in a thick description that synthesizes theory and data while bringing together disparate interview accounts into an interpreted narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2009</xref>). Tracing movement within the different biographical fields of four young people’s lives (work, play, education, family), each case history was ‘told’ in a way that drew attention to discrete biographical fields, yet maintained a sense of chronological order, both in the life as lived and in analysis and writing. In each case history these small narratives were brought together as component parts of a narrative whole.</p>
<p>This method was developed further by Rachel and Sue Sharpe in a longitudinal study of the lives of new mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2010</xref>). Working with family groups rather than individuals, they needed to understand lives in relation to each other and over time. Extended fieldnotes were produced for each interview (with mothers, grandmothers and significant others) and drawn together into family case profiles, working documents which formed the basis for family case histories. These case histories were written in the voice of the researcher, based on an intimate engagement with the interview itself and using original fieldnotes and audio recordings. Instead of extensive quotations, they sought to capture something of the voice of the participant by using their phrases whenever possible. In general this was achieved through saturation in the individual archive and a sense that one was living with and through the family. In constructing a case history that condensed a series of successive research encounters with different members of a family, they provided not only a record of the data but a reflexive account of the research process itself, including the accumulated insights of the researcher as they moved between family members. These case histories form a secondary level of data that can be employed in comparative analyses by the research team. They have also been used selectively in publication, providing a sense of the insights that can be generated through QLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2010</xref>). In producing new case histories from the IA data, one aim was to try to move debates about writing and representing QLR data forward, building on our own work and that of others.</p>

<title>Inventing Adulthoods’ QL case histories: a purposive but iterative and developmental strategy</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>Ethically, storying these young lives is like giving something to them. An act of care absorbing their data, holding it and interpreting/telling. (IA Team minutes, July 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By 2007, with up to six interviews for each participant and funded under the Timescapes study to archive and share our dataset, our strategy for analysing and representing a now-mature dataset focused on realizing the significance of our Northern Irish research site in book form (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468794111426232">Table 1</xref>). The role of place in shaping young people’s pathways was a key focus from the start and we wanted to explore how the dramatic changes that had taken place in NI since the beginning of the study could be understood through our dataset. The question of how to do justice to the richness of the stories and long-term commitment of our participants was pressing and central to our discussions of how to proceed, and drove a decision to write this book ‘differently’. Aiming for a more literary, creative style and format for a much broader audience, we adopted an experimental, developmental approach. We resisted the urge to impose a structure at the outset, choosing instead to explore ways of making the reflexive voice of the researcher explicit in our writing and different techniques for giving voice to the participants. Spurred on by Rachel and Sue’s case history work and, later, enlivened by revisiting the Northern Irish group of young people in 2009, we grappled with the themes, trajectories, events and identities that might form the basis (and ethics) of selecting people whose case histories would form key raw material for the book. The availability/contactability of participants was clearly important, as was representing a wide range of experiences and protecting confidentiality. Could we really write about the politics and everyday life of a very particular place without actually naming it? (We had guarded the identity of our sites zealously up to this point). Should we privilege the stories of people who were good raconteurs above those whose ‘tapestry’ did not, on the surface, appear quite so rich?</p>
<p>At the same time, we set about identifying the elements of a ‘thumping good read’ by undertaking a review of popular texts that ‘write’ the individual within the context of wider social policy, historical landscapes and place in an engaging way (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426232">Beattie, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111426232">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111426232">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111426232">Hanley, 2007</xref>). These included: juxtaposing different types of content (rich descriptions of places, scenes, people and events, first and third person accounts from the present and reflecting on the past, social history) and varying the balance of different elements from chapter to chapter; keeping third person threads that weave accounts together brief; juxtaposing different voices (researcher and researched) and tones; and using the present tense when telling personal stories. This exercise was influential in developing our case history writing in that it further extended our awareness of the role of temporal sequence, voice and motif in storytelling. It also heralded a departure from our normal methods for working collectively – since it became obvious that a single narrator was most effective in engaging an audience in this way and that the researcher who is based and grew up in NI and did the majority of interviews there was best placed to write in such a way. While the rest of the team could contribute by writing raw material in the form of case histories, her voice was most suited to achieving the strong sense of place and blend of personal and professional, researcher and participant reflexivity over time that we were seeking to achieve in this literary but non-fictional historical account.</p>
<p>Currently, we have 10 case history documents each of around 25 pages condensed from an individual archive of anything from 175 pages. These case histories serve two key purposes: rich material that can be layered into the NI book, and utilised in a variety of as-yet-unknown contexts by the IA team. But we do not consider our method to be either ‘complete’ or ‘standardized’. The nature of the data and our desire to conjure it imaginatively and responsibly requires a continual openness to further development; and the interpretations and writing of five women from different disciplinary backgrounds and interests will always differ, especially given an experimental context. The following discussion of sequence, voice and motif highlights some of the key methodological issues involved in compiling these documents and our approach to them in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468794111426232">
<title>Sequence</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>The data from which these narrative documents are produced dates back at least 10 years. In that sense they are historical documents. The voices are however alive, and each new interview brings the previous one to life in a powerful and illuminating way. Having recently completed another ‘round’ of interviews with young people from the NI site, after a five year gap or more, the potency of previous interviews becomes all the more intoxicating. (Sheena notes on storying QL after returning to the field, May 2010)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The practicalities of producing QL case history writing presented us with two immediate questions about sequence. The first relates to the tasks involved in the process and the order in which to organize them; the second, more specific to analysis, interpretation and understanding, relates to temporality or the sequence of telling. Practices and processes for compiling and analysing case data are much more complex in the QL context: for the 10 Northern Irish participants in question they include not only seven transcripts and fieldnotes but a case profile and perhaps questionnaire data, memory books, and lifelines, the individual archive based on methods of data generation used in the research. We adopted an experimental approach, pausing after each of us had conducted an analysis to reflect collectively and move the method on. The ensuing method is still in process and consciously unstandardized.</p>
<p>The process began with Sue Sharpe adapting a case history ‘template’ developed on the Making of Modern Mothers project to our purposes. This we continued to refine over time and it now includes a front sheet containing basic information about the young person, themes and motifs emerging from the interviews, a narrative for each individual interview, followed by analytic summaries under headings drawn from our methodological and theoretical concerns. These are biographical time, historical time, generational time, methodological/research time; policy; process (of undertaking the case history); what else we would like to know about the young person; any useful contextual detail not otherwise covered; and a synopsis of the case history. For preparation, the case profile was commonly turned to first, providing a useful way into the biographical story, particularly for those who had not conducted interviews in NI. But in a reverse sequence some began by immersion in all of the participant’s data in order to get a ‘fresh’ view of the life before consulting the original researcher’s data, analysis and interpretation. Sometimes we listened to interviews alongside or as well as reading transcripts. For our work on voice we selected quotes from transcripts, but aspects of the young person’s voice through their own words found other ways into the writing.</p>
<p>Writing a retrospective story of a life as told always presents issues regarding the chronology of writing. However, in a QL context where participants reflect not only what has happened in the past but also on what is happening now and may happen in the future <italic>serially over time</italic>, shifting temporalities are integral to the data, and the present, past and future take on a dynamic, kaleidoscopic nature. At which version of the present does the analyst begin the story, and which pasts and futures should follow? Different timescapes – biographical, historical, generational – coexist. How is this multiply-layered temporal data to be represented? Again we took an individual, experimental approach, collectively discussing our work at key points. Our overall strategy was to write each interview chronologically, situating the story of each interview in the present <italic>for that interview</italic> – thus producing a series of episodes in which the past and future are accessed from that particular present, with the researcher’s voice making explicit the inevitable awareness of prior and later data. However, there were individual variations within this, the most divergent being Sheila who, with the book style in view, attempted a literary device of starting the story from what was then ‘the end’, the last available interview at that point. She found to some degree this conflicted with the main task in hand of capturing each interview:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Writing from the ‘final’ interview backwards in time was an interesting device I wanted to continue, as was the use of key one-liners as a way of organizing the material for each interview. However, by the time I had worked through the ‘final’ interview, then the first and had begun to work in the same way on the second interview, it became increasingly clear that sticking to this formula for each interview and simply arranging the interviews consecutively would make a tedious read. I suggested trying to develop a way of merging the remaining interviews into one at a team meeting and got the go-head. On recommencing, however, it became increasingly obvious that I would need to plod through as before, doing each interview the justice it deserved before attempting a synthesis. This may have diminished the ‘thumping good read’ quality of the case history but hopefully provides Sheena with rich material that gives voice to Donal via the medium of a secondary analyst. Still want to have a go at the synthesis though . . .</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The challenges of analysing and representing temporally complex and voluminous QL data are considerable and, in our experience, demand an organic and flexible approach that will vary according to the analyst and the story to be told but necessarily free both from any simple form of literal temporality. This approach also allows for the participant’s story over time to be viewed through many different sides of the same prism.</p>

<sec id="section7-1468794111426232">
<title>Voice</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>[In my opinion] the level of analysis applied when producing these narratives is necessarily subtle and light. The voice of the young person takes precedence and it is that voice that needs to emerge and speak to the reader . . . for some the voice can become increasingly reflective, questioning, confident, seeking, doubting, critical, or hopeful. Responding to their own voice, whether that be through listening to the audio of earlier interviews or hearing it reflected back to them by the interviewer, was for some an unsettling experience in itself. Their own voice comes back to haunt, to challenge, to motivate or re-focus. Representing these subtle changes in the strength or direction of the voice is another challenge for the researcher writing the case history. (Sheena notes on doing case histories, May 2010)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The concept of the aloof researcher and the authoritative, authorial voice which accompanied ethnographic research until the mid-1980s was abandoned in the textual turn at that time, and the qualitative researcher was recognized as historically positioned, locally situated and a very human observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111426232">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794111426232">Taylor, 2002</xref>). Following feminist principles, at the heart of qualitative writing today is strong reflexivity and recognition of the responsibility of the researcher as a critical part of the research process, and that we write from particular positions at specific times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794111426232">Richardson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794111426232">Spencer, 2001</xref>). Paradoxically, recognizing this deep implication of the researcher in the research, and the impossibility of representation to give access to the ‘real’ or ‘truth’, indeed of their being any one truth, feminists (and others) have still wanted and tried to ‘give voice’ to women, and other groups whose voice has gone unheard in historical and social science narratives. Recent feminist interventions point to the naivety of any simple approach to ‘giving voice’, and urge the recognition of multiple meanings, understandings and interpretations at play in the research interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111426232">McLeod, 2010</xref>) and call for or attempt experimentation in their representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794111426232">Lather and Smithies, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794111426232">Richardson, 1994</xref>: 521). In our case histories, capturing the voice of the young person and changes in this over time was paramount. However, the very nature of our data made us highly aware of <underline>all</underline> the voices to be woven into the accounts – the participant, the interviewer/researcher (in this case Sheena) and the other analysts within the team and their changing reflections and interpretations over time. Aiming for ‘thick descriptions’ that drew directly on the research subjects’ own words and style of speaking, we experimented with ways of making all these voices explicit. The following excerpts from our case histories provide illustrations. In the first, the voice of the secondary analyst/researcher speaks loudest, although the young man’s experience and feelings come through clearly:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s clear that there is no respite for Neville from the effects of his mother dying 10 years ago. He admits he’s still suffering the effects, and that he’s ‘not the person he used to be’. He described rather poignantly how he hasn’t been able to put up his mother’s picture where he lives because he’s unhappy about the current state of the place and thinks that she would be too. He gets sad thinking about her and also if there’s anything sad on the television he’ll start crying, and he’s wondering if he needs some more counselling. There is a significant silence when the researcher asks him whether he feels a connection with his mother, and he finds it very awkward to answer. (Excerpt from Sue Sharpe case history)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Donal’s voice and appearance are ‘brought to life’ more directly through use of the original researcher’s notes and an obvious distance created between the voice of the researcher and the case history writer:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Here’s Donal. He is sitting in Sheena’s office at the university, hair shaved, wearing an olive green pair of combat style trousers, a blue T-shirt with a Celtic design and a cream zip-up Adidas lightweight top. A large leather satchel in tow. Aware that he is approaching 30, he is on a drive to lose weight and give up smoking. He nearly did not show up for this interview because he has recently listened to tapes of his previous four and this unsettled him, making him feel like nothing has changed in the five years since he was first interviewed. All he can hear in the ‘bloody tapes’ is the same old stuff year after year. That said, he does seem to assume he will be back for another interview in the future because he definitely does not want to be telling the same story when he is, say, 32 . . . Funny things research relationships – more like brief encounters on trains in some ways but also very much not . . . (Excerpt from Sheila Henderson case history)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, in experimental writing for the book on NI, Sheena uses her knowledge gleaned over the years from a young person’s interviews to take an imaginative leap into what Sheelagh thinks and feels when she discovers that she is pregnant at the age of 18:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>She knows the first person she has to tell is her mammy. And she knows that even though there will be tears she will support her. So with nothing else to keep them in the town she and Gemma make their way to the bus stop. Gemma has been a steady friend since primary school. Their friendship is strong, they have stuck with each other when a lot of other friendships have come and gone. Gemma is hoping to go to university in October, Sheelagh tries not to think about that now. They make their way out of the shopping centre and down the busy street. Everyone wanders about as if life is just the same as it was an hour or so ago. It is all a bit surreal for Sheelagh. The bus journey takes them out of the city centre [could describe the journey here, would have to do it]. Shoppers, children neighbours sit around them, oblivious to the turmoil and anxiety that Sheelagh is feeling. [can I say this? only imagining] It takes about a half an hour to get home by bus. The estate is a few miles out of town. It looks across to the hills and its relative isolation means that many of those who live here depend on buses and taxis to access services beyond the local shop, church or primary school. There aren’t many cars about, and sleeping policemen are strategically placed to slow down those that are. (Excerpt from Sheena’s experimental writing for the book based on a case history)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The degree to which the data sources (interviews, researcher fieldnotes, case profile) that the writer has drawn on to ‘conjure’ the QL case data ‘evocatively’ are made explicit varies in these examples, as does the relative presence of the different voices involved (interviewee, interviewer, previous team analyst). We are, at this stage, less intent upon deciding which techniques are more effective in storytelling and restricting our approach than continuing to explore. What is certain is that QLR both increases the ethical commitment and responsibility to giving voice to participants while protecting them from unlooked-for exposure and requires a more complex and honest approach to representing all voices involved in the research process.</p>

<title>Motif</title>
<p>‘Conjuring’ young people’s lives holistically over time requires an approach beyond ‘chunking’ their biographical story into broad themes. There is so much to include and acknowledge, so much to condense and leave out. While chronological time, at one level, gives the telling of the narrative a structure, dates and time sequence cannot carry the weight of the story alone. The longitudinal qualitative nature of IA data lends insight into the flux and flow of lives, and how these are mediated by circumstances, critical moments, choices, key people. Nonetheless, it is often the case that specific elements and themes of a person’s story emerge as central, acting as a base colour to the picture that unfolds over the years. Finding a way to represent these ‘biographical motifs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794111426232">Thomson, 2009</xref>: 155) alongside the big themes, the persuasive story lines, the action on the side lines, the dynamics of change and transition, all against a backdrop of social, economic and political change, is difficult. In our view, it involves experimentation with a broader range of writing skills than is the sociological norm. With our method still in process, we offer no prescriptions but merely offer examples of our strategies so far.</p>
<p>An immediately obvious means of capturing motifs sprang from the participants themselves: they were often given an opportunity to reflect back on previous interviews and on their lives in general, as well as to respond to our interpretations in various ways. Some had read their transcripts at various points, and fed back to us their thoughts. And QL interviews invite reflexivity from researchers and participants. Cynthia, for example, had been brought to NI by her parents at 11, uprooted from a (possibly idealized) happy situation in her home country, into the danger and inexplicable practices and behaviour she experienced in NI. In her biographical account over time there were strong motifs that were revisited, reworked and overwritten in different ways during the course of seven interviews. She articulates perhaps the strongest of these in her last interview (late 2009 when she was just 26), having brought a photograph of herself in primary school, aged four. Janet’s ‘light interpretation’ reflects on this:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Yep, that’s just, I mean, I’m, because I’ve been here now what 12, 13 years, since I was 11, so it’s like my different life time . . . that’s how I would see it now. Cos it’s a life that I’m never getting back. You know cos, now you’re over there while I’ve been here, I’ve been here longer than I was ever there. So that’s why I see it as a different life.</p>
<p>The experience of the move has had a major effect on Cynthia throughout the period we have known her. It was a trauma being uprooted from a happy life in her home country and brought to NI and a situation of conflict, danger and the unknown. She reiterates this loss, resentment of her parents for putting her through it, and a deep desire to return throughout this period. But as we can see in this latest comment, she now seems resigned to a life in NI, addressing first the interviewer and then her younger self ‘now you’re over there while I’ve been here’, and recognizing a split between these two parts of her life, perhaps her self.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, Sheila’s case history of Donal picks up the motifs of his story over time by selecting key one-line quotes from each interview that articulate each motif and using them as sub-headings for each interview:</p>
<list id="list1-1468794111426232" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Int 1</italic>: A bit plan-less me</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Int 2</italic>: I would like a wee bit more direction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Int 3</italic>: I just need to go and do this for a while like and see how I get on</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Int 4</italic>: I walked into a whole wee life</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Int 5</italic>: With me it’s quick fixes . . . then I’ll just get really lazy</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1468794111426232">
<title>From motif to metaphor</title>
<p>Employing a metaphor to frame some aspect of the story allows the reader (and writer) to weave these motifs into the life story tapestry across time, as well as embellishing some sections of the picture in more depth within a moment of time. The use of simple metaphors, such as a jigsaw or map for example, has allowed Sheena to conceptualize pictorially the richness, the confusion and the interrelatedness of what is sometimes voiced in the data. The use of these metaphors has provided a way into recurring themes over time, and a more condensed way of reintroducing these themes and their ongoing prominence to the reader. Here a metaphor carries us across a whole sequence of Sheelagh’s interviews:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>And so Sheelagh began to unpack her story and set out for herself, it seemed, as much as for the interviewer and the project, the journey she had thus far taken and the one she hoped to go on. Meeting as we did in school, education was the first natural part of the jigsaw to focus on. The pieces sat in a fairly obvious pile together, and the picture on the box seemed bright and attractive. But once we started to pick up the jigsaw pieces and move them it felt as if they didn’t all come from the same box – they didn’t easily slot together. Over the course of the project interviews the pieces became more misshaped and the picture on the box became scratched and lost focus. (Excerpt from Sheena case history)</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>Our case history method-in-process bears comparison with established practices in diverse traditions in which ‘life history’ and ‘biographical’ methods are employed: it is a method for analysing biographical data concerned with capturing temporal processes in an individual life retrospectively – the individual histories ideally written knowledge of the whole sequence of interviews, as in oral and case history methods more generally. But it differs in some respects. Although it is common practice to conduct repeat interviews with an individual in the biographical method, these are typically concerned with memory, a retrospective reconstruction of the past. Writing such data imaginatively certainly requires close attention to sequence, voice and motif but without the complexities of hindsight, foresight and insight that result from the serial addition of reflections on the present and future that is the case in the QLR. A ‘movie’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794111426232">Neale and Flowerdew, 2003</xref>) makes greater demands on containment and representational processes than the ‘still’ of a one-off research encounter in other ways: the sheer volume of material can be overwhelming, and honouring the ethical concern to do all investors in the research enterprise justice can be challenging indeed. Similarly, although it is now accepted that the qualitative researcher always becomes embedded in and part of the research and the data, her subjectivity part of the research process and understanding, this is more complex in the QLR. Here the ‘cultural habitus’ and understanding of both researcher and researched shifts over time, producing a high level of reflexivity that recognizes change and avoids fixing any actors or aspects of the research process in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426232">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>). Capturing these reflexive processes and incorporating them in writing and representation becomes an essential but demanding part of the task, requiring careful attention to the techniques and devices involved in the telling. The years of collectively or individually reading, listening to and reflecting on the lives as told by the young people in the study, of empathizing with their pleasures and pain, have not only bound the team to each other and to the evolving lives we walk alongside but also make distinctions between primary and secondary analysis difficult to maintain. Revisiting data, collected by whichever team member, is intrinsic to the process as layers of cross sectional and case story analyses are built up and interwoven over time to create complex, multi-dimensional analyses. Meanwhile, a QL design emphasizes the ever-present ethical issues of confidentiality, anonymity and privacy – as the fine details of lives storied over time become clearer markers and identifiers. This is the case in our research design where place has a prominent role, and particularly so in the cumulative stories told within the tight knit communities of NI.</p>
<p>Our case history method and histories were built on case narratives, and case profiles, the earlier prospective data management and analytical tools that were generated cumulatively through time, elaborated with researcher initial interpretations and predictions for the participant. At a basic level, they are simply one way of making QL datasets manageable and facilitating the processes and techniques of writing and representation. As condensed versions of the full QL dataset, they provide an overview and a map to guide more detailed textual analysis. Every researcher anxious not to ‘lose’ too much detail ‘on the cutting room floor’ desires but recognizes as impossible a ‘writing’ process in which very little is left out, and the techniques we have used may bring this closer. The distilling process and the way the case history is constructed enables small incidents and details, descriptions of places and people, historical facts, policy issues, and analytical commentary to be woven into the document surprisingly easily. Additionally, our experimentation with literary devices, in relation to sequence, voice, motif and metaphor, have resulted in rich material for a book on growing up in NI during the peace process, attempting to write sociology ‘differently’ for a popular audience. Sharing these lengthy documents with others presents issues of confidentiality and privacy as, in order to write freely, we decided to abandon such concerns during the writing process, planning to anonymize and archive later. For now they remain data for our own use in a range of writing and as yet unknown contexts. They are also too long to share per se. But we have already found that, in even more condensed and anonymized form, they prove powerful tools for firing the imaginations of policy makers in NI and engaging them in developing policy based on holistic and dynamic accounts of unfolding young lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468794111426232">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We began this article by referring to recent calls for writing sociology ‘differently’ in the face of a perceived decline in the adequacy of the old rules and guidelines to the task of imaginatively conjuring social life from qualitative data. Our changing strategies for analysing and representing our growing QL dataset testify to this need. When we first faced the challenge of analysing and representing an increasingly overwhelming volume of multi-dimensional temporal data, few ‘old rules and guidelines’ were in place – a situation that has changed little. Our account of how we developed techniques for maintaining the temporal structure of our biographical data and historicizing our interpretations is offered not as a set of (new) rules and guidelines but as a contribution to extending the analytical and representational toolbox. It is only by discussing research practices and making them explicit that we can hope to move methods on. Yet, despite increasing discussion of method and methodology in recent years, the detail of everyday research practices remains relatively opaque, particularly in the QL context.</p>
