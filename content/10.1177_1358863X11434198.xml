<p>This textbook, edited by two experts in the field of vascular medicine, surgery, and endovascular intervention is timely. Many professional societies and public advocacy groups have identified venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) as one of the most important preventable disorders facing hospitalized patients today.</p>
<p>This book is divided into four sections: venous thromboembolic disease; thoracic outlet syndrome; central venous disease; and practice management.</p>
<p>In the opening section, the first several chapters have a significant amount of overlap. However, Chapter 1 is a beautifully written summary of the salient issues, including prevention, complications of therapy, a useful algorithm for management of VTE, and specific comments regarding management of VTE and cancer. There is also an excellent discussion of novel therapies and the potential role for thrombolytic therapy and operative venous thrombectomy.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, ‘Diagnostic Approach to Venous Thromboembolism’, would be more appropriate if it was presented before Chapter 3, ‘Deep Venous Thrombosis: Prevention and Treatment’. Chapter 4 is an excellent review of diagnostic algorithms, including discussions regarding emerging and novel methods, and direct thrombus imaging. However, there is limited information on prevention of VTE by mechanical and pharmacologic means in Chapter 3, a shortcoming of the text.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, ‘Anticoagulation Therapy’, is a particularly useful addition for the clinician, providing very basic information for the practicing physician. Subsequent chapters provide an in-depth analysis of thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy for deep venous thrombosis. Chapter 10 is an excellent review of surgical venous thrombectomy. This is not commonly seen in endovascular textbooks, and is a great addition.</p>
<p>The next two chapters nicely review the role of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters and percutaneous management of pulmonary emboli. It would have been helpful if the IVC filter chapter highlighted the importance of prospective follow-up of patients with retrievable filters, so that retrieval is appropriately considered once the need for protection has passed. The section on management of pulmonary emboli does cover surgical thrombectomy; however, there is no substantive discussion of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, one of the serious complications of massive pulmonary emboli.</p>
<p>Section 2 covers the evaluation and management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). The discussion regarding surgical treatment is well done; however, the role of initial endovascular intervention is limited, and may mislead the reader who is developing an algorithm for the management of TOS-provoked venous thrombosis.</p>
<p>In Section 3, Chapters 16 and 17 are excellent, covering some of the less common, but often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated manifestations of VTE. For these two chapters alone it is worth purchasing the entire textbook. Specifically, in Chapter 17, there is an excellent discussion of mesenteric venous thrombosis, including causes, diagnosis, and management.</p>
<p>Section 4 provides a detailed discussion regarding coding and billing for VTE. For physicians who are considering offering these therapeutic alternatives to their complex patients, this chapter will give an appropriate background upon which they can develop the infrastructure to provide such care.</p>
<p>In summary, Davies and Lumsden provide an excellent and practical resource for practicing clinicians who care for patients with VTE. It is an important addition to the bookshelf of all vascular specialists.</p>
