<abstract>
<p>Perceptual deterrence has been an enduring focus of interest in criminology. Although recent research has generated important new insights about how risks, costs, and rewards of offending are perceived and internalized, there remain two specific limitations to advancing theories of deterrence: (a) the lack of panel data to show whether issues of changes in perceptions over age and time are linked to changes in offending and (b) the lack of research on perceptual deterrence of active offenders, arguably the most policy-relevant group for these studies. Using longitudinal data on offending and perceptions of risks and punishment costs for a large sample of serious youthful offenders, the authors identify significant heterogeneity in sanction threat perceptions generally and across different types of offenders. These differences in perception reflect variation among offenders in the amount of prior information on offending on which individuals may be basing their perceptions. There likely exists a potential “ceiling” and “floor” of sanction threat perceptions, indicating that there are deterrence boundaries beyond which some types of offenders may be more amenable to sanction threats whereas others may be undeterred by sanction threats. Directions for future theoretical and empirical research are discussed.</p>

<p>At its core, the deterrence framework espouses three critical components of perceived sanction threats—the certainty, severity, and celerity of punishment—that are associated with criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709345971">Beccaria, 1764</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709345971">Robinson &amp; Darley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011128709345971">Tittle, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011128709345971">Zimring &amp; Hawkins, 1972</xref>). Traditionally, the most important of these three for inhibiting crime, and the one that has received the most theoretical and empirical attention, has been the certainty of punishment. This can be traced back largely to Beccaria’s admonition: “See to it that men fear the laws and only the laws” (1764, p. 75).</p>
<p>Recognizing the limits of the strict, three-part formal sanction framework, theoretical extensions of the classical deterrence perspective have addressed a set of related questions: (a) the limits of rationality, (b) the role of individual differences and influence of perceived benefits in the decision-making process, (c) the importance of informal sanction threat perceptions (e.g., guilt, shame, embarrassment), and (d) the manner in which the delivery of sanctions perceived to be unfair results in negative emotions and continued criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709345971">Clarke &amp; Cornish, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709345971">Nagin &amp; Paternoster, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128709345971">Piquero, Langton, &amp; Gomez-Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128709345971">Sherman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011128709345971">Wikström, Tseloni, &amp; Karlis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011128709345971">Williams &amp; Hawkins, 1986</xref>). Collectively, these modifications and extensions have further elaborated the deterrence framework to include additional factors that are theorized as pivotal components of the (crime) decision-making process.</p>
<p>The long and rich body of empirical research on deterrence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709345971">Nagin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709345971">Paternoster, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128709345971">Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, &amp; Madensen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011128709345971">Wikström, 2007</xref>), largely based on samples of relatively nonserious offenders (i.e., high school, college, and adult samples; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709345971">Grasmick &amp; Bursik, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709345971">Nagin &amp; Paternoster, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709345971">Nagin &amp; Pogarsky, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128709345971">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709345971">Piquero &amp; Tibbetts, 1996</xref>), shows that sanction threat perceptions are weakly related to criminal activity. When these perceptions are related, it is largely due to the effects of perceptions of certainty of punishment. Two specific limitations of this line of empirical work, however, have led to somewhat of a stagnation of further theoretical development of deterrence and extensions of empirical research.</p>
<p>First, few studies have examined the rate and extent of change in perceptions of sanction threat within persons over age and time, especially in response to offending and its associated outcomes (with punishment and punishment experience; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128709345971">Stafford &amp; Warr, 1993</xref>). Recent insights from developmental and life-course criminology suggest that there is significant within-individual change in offending over time and that these changes are linked to a variety of local life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709345971">Farrington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709345971">Horney, Osgood, &amp; Marshall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709345971">Laub, Nagin, &amp; Sampson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709345971">Piquero, Farrington, &amp; Blumstein, 2003</xref>). Although criminologists have tended to focus on the role of changes in life events with respect to changes in crime, psychologists have long studied the role of changes in perceptions or capacities for their influence on a variety of human behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709345971">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709345971">Higgins, 1996</xref>). Although linkages between these two threads of literature have not been explored, especially in criminology, several recent studies suggest that unique insights might be available from such efforts regarding perceived sanction threats.</p>
<p>In the first study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709345971">Pogarsky and Piquero (2003)</xref> examined how sanction threat perceptions were altered as a result of offending and its outcomes. To unpack the counterintuitive finding of a positive punishment effect, that is, the experience of punishment triggering a downward—not upward—revision of expectations about the certainty of punishment, they proposed the idea of a “resetting” effect. Their notion, based on the concept of the “gambler’s fallacy,” suggests that individuals constantly update their sanction threat perceptions in response to the specific outcomes of their offending, a finding that has emerged longitudinally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709345971">Pogarsky, Piquero, &amp; Paternoster, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709345971">Matsueda, Kreager, and Huizinga (2006)</xref> also found positive effects of punishment on offending and identified a process in which sanction threat perceptions were subject to consequent updating following offending experiences. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128709345971">Fagan and Piquero (2007)</xref> found that elements of both risk and reward influenced patterns of offending over time among a group of late adolescent offenders from Philadelphia and Phoenix and that both risk and reward perceptions were part of a process of legal socialization about law that shaped subsequent perceptions of risk and, in turn, offending decisions.</p>
<p>A second limitation on the progression of the deterrence literature concerns the lack of empirical application of the deterrence framework to offender-based samples, the precise group for which studies of deterrence are the most policy relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709345971">Apospori, Alpert, &amp; Paternoster, 1992</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128709345971">1</xref></sup> That is, deterrence research has rarely examined risk perceptions and offending decisions empirically among currently active offenders. Most studies with active offenders use targeted, opportunistic samples and rely on qualitative methods to understand how risks are perceived and internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709345971">Apospori et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011128709345971">Wright &amp; Decker 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011128709345971">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709345971">Decker, Wright, &amp; Logie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709345971">Jacobs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709345971">Piquero &amp; Rengert, 1999</xref>). The omission of active offenders from longitudinal studies on deterrence may occur for a number of reasons, including the following: (a) Offenders have demonstrated that sanction threats are ill effective. After all, they have offended; that is, they have engaged in a process in which perceived sanction costs do not appear to exceed the benefits associated with offending, the salience associated with those costs is not higher than the corresponding benefits, or the benefits associated with crime are viewed simply to be of more import at the time of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709345971">Bouffard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709345971">Pogarsky &amp; Piquero, 2003</xref>). (b) In addition, punishment experiences—including experiences with avoiding punishment—sometimes lead to the opposite pattern, less fear of sanction threats and more and/or continued offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709345971">Paternoster &amp; Piquero, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709345971">Piquero &amp; Paternoster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709345971">Piquero &amp; Pogarsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709345971">Pogarsky &amp; Piquero, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709345971">Pogarsky et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, these findings beg the question as to whether offenders are a group worthy of study with respect to deterrence, as the patterns of deterrence perceptions are still largely unknown.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we believe that there are important assumptions and processes that can be tested only by studying deterrence among active, serious offenders. First, we can contrast evidence of heterogeneity in risk, cost, and benefit perceptions as well as rates and directions of change in these perceptions of active offenders with current knowledge of both offenders and nonoffenders in community samples. Next, we can also assess heterogeneity in the rate and direction of change in these perceptions associated with the rate of offending frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709345971">Pogarsky, 2002</xref>). We also can assess decision-making styles with respect to offending (and the weighing of costs and benefits) and whether these cognitive processes vary with age and through stages of criminal careers (for theoretical and empirical developments on these questions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709345971">Paternoster &amp; Pogarsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709345971">Piquero &amp; Moffitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128709345971">Piquero, Fagan, Mulvey, Steinberg, &amp; Odgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011128709345971">Steinberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011128709345971">Steinberg, Albert, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011128709345971">Steinberg, Graham, et al., 2009</xref>). Research that can generate new knowledge about these processes among serious adolescent offenders as they enter their peak crime years also may inform interventions that can attenuate criminal careers, or hasten their end, and subsequently turn around the lives of wayward adolescents, something that the public believes remains possible even among the most hardened of all juvenile offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709345971">Cullen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128709345971">Nagin, Piquero, Scott, &amp; Steinberg, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Current Focus</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to begin to fill in some of the gaps in the deterrence literature by addressing several issues essential for expanding our understanding of perceptual deterrence. First, we explore perceptions of risk, cost, and rewards of offending and investigate potential perception heterogeneity as a function of accumulated offending experience. In other words, we specifically examine how accumulated offending experience results in variation of perceptions of sanction risk. Second, we assess these relations among serious adolescent offenders, a policy-relevant sample for which little is known regarding whether and how their perception of risk or their calculus of the costs and benefits of offending change over time. Third, we also explore how the aforementioned perception heterogeneity develops over time among these youthful offenders, through both age and maturity transitions, and how these factors affect the development of either perceptual deterrence or the rationality calculus of how they weigh costs and benefits. Fourth, we examine whether the accumulation of (offending) information provides a basis for disaggregating an otherwise homogeneous group of serious offenders in terms of how they perceive different elements of a rational choice calculus.</p>
<p>Finally, these analyses advance the notion of <italic>differential deterrence</italic>, a term meant to recognize the significant amount of heterogeneity that exists across juvenile offenders, both with respect to their decision-making calculus and involvement in criminal activity. Evidence that there may be both a “ceiling” and “floor” of sanction threat perceptions would inform the choice of metrics to estimate the interaction between actual and perceived deterrence and its potential effects on offenders. In other words, evidence of heterogeneity can show that some offenders may be more deterrable than others; that is, they may react and adjust their sanction threat perceptions in heterogeneous ways.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>This article examines data from a subset of the participants enrolled in the Pathways to Desistance study, a longitudinal investigation of the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in serious adolescent offenders. Participants are adolescents who were found guilty of a serious offense (almost entirely felony offenses) in the juvenile or adult court systems in Maricopa County, Arizona, or Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. These youth were ages 14 to 17 at the time of the study index offense. A total of 1,354 adolescents were enrolled, representing approximately 1 in 3 adolescents adjudicated on the enumerated charges in each locale during the recruitment period (November 2000 through January 2003). The current analyses exclude cases in which the offender was transferred to adult court because the adult and juvenile systems function differently and experiences in these systems are qualitatively different. This resulted in a final sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 1,100. The study sample is comprised primarily of minority (44.6% African American, 30.2% Hispanic) males (84.8%).

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Empirical evidence on deterrence suggests that offending has both personal and social rewards and that punishment associated with offending may have distinct social and personal costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709345971">Nagin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011128709345971">Williams &amp; Hawkins, 1986</xref>). Previous investigations with general populations of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709345971">Grasmick &amp; Bursik, 1990</xref>) and college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709345971">Nagin &amp; Paternoster, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709345971">1994</xref>) show that these costs form essential components of a dynamic model of deterrence that includes both the punishment costs of arrest and the social costs of detection and punishment. As a result, the indices of personal and social costs and rewards were adapted for this study to measure the adolescent’s perceived likelihood of detection and punishment for any of several types of offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709345971">Nagin &amp; Paternoster, 1994</xref>).

Response options ranged from 0 (<italic>no chance</italic>) to 10 (<italic>absolutely certain to be caught</italic>). The mean score across each of the seven items was taken at each period, and the scale demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .89 at baseline data collection).</p>

<title>Perceived reward</title>
<p>The personal rewards of crime were measured by asking each individual how much “thrill” or “rush” it is to do any of the following things: fighting, robbery with gun, stabbing someone, breaking into a store or home, stealing clothes from a store, vandalism, and auto theft. If the individuals had reported never doing any of these things, they were asked to give a rating for how much thrill or rush they thought it would be. Response options ranged from 0 (<italic>no fun or kick at all</italic>) to 10 (<italic>a great deal of fun or kick</italic>). The overall scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .88 at baseline).</p>

<sec id="section7-0011128709345971">
<title>Perceived social cost</title>
<p>The social cost of crime was measured by asking each individual if the police catch him or her doing something that breaks the law, how likely it is that he or she would be suspended from school, lose respect from close friends, lose respect from family members, lose respect from neighbors or other adults, lose respect from a girlfriend or boyfriend, or find it harder to get a job. Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>very unlikely</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very likely</italic>), and the scale showed acceptable internal consistency (α = .68 at baseline).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We measure perceptions of risk, cost, and reward at baseline and at 6-month intervals through 36 months after recruitment into the sample. To investigate potential heterogeneity among these offenders, we examine each of the perceptions conditional on the level of previous self-reported offending (SRO) and compare differences both at baseline and across time among individuals with these different offending experience levels.</p>
<sec id="section9-0011128709345971">
<title>Defining Offending Groups</title>
<p>To examine perception heterogeneity, we divide the sample based on equal thirds of the distribution of frequency of SRO at baseline using a revised version of a common delinquency measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709345971">Huizinga, Esbensen, &amp; Weihar, 1991</xref>). For the purposes of the Pathways study, the self-report scale commonly used in much delinquency research was trimmed to include only the most serious offenses listed. Based on a 22-item scale, SRO measures each adolescent’s account of involvement in antisocial and illegal activities, which elicits participant involvement in different types of crime. For each endorsed item, a follow-up question concerning frequency within the past 6 months was asked in order to generate a total SRO frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128709345971">2</xref></sup> The delineation of the sample is based on baseline SRO frequency, that is, accumulated offending experience, thus providing a rudimentary yet practical means with which to define offending “types” (i.e., low, medium, and high) among this comparatively homogeneous group, from which we may begin to explore sample heterogeneity in perceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128709345971">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given that conditional means of each perception outcome over the time period constitutes a de facto trajectory solution, a logical alternative method of estimation would be to estimate a more formal group-based mixture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709345971">Nagin, 2005</xref>). However, we rely on the more informal approach of separating the data based on thirds of the SRO distribution for three reasons. First, a definition of types based on prior offending at baseline is a natural response to the issue of selection, which is one possible explanation for the previously observed “positive placement effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709345971">Pogarsky &amp; Piquero, 2003</xref>), in which selection effects are potentially mitigated by a typology defined by higher crime individuals. Second, given that group definitions derived from formal mixture modeling would be based on the entire longitudinal string of data, any future exploration of how individual beliefs respond to events during that period, such as sanctioning, would confront identification complications. Third, and most important, the definition of types based on baseline SRO constitutes a division based entirely on the concept of prior information with respect to offending, in the sense that those who are in the bottom third of the offending distribution (i.e., the low type), many of whom report committing only one or two offenses at baseline, have less knowledge of offending and punishment with which to provide a basis for forming a perception. Conversely, those individuals in the highest third of the distribution (i.e., the high type) have had many more experiences from which to form their perceptions. That is, if perceptions are formed based on an individual’s prior experiences with offending and sanctions, then those high types have more prior information with which to develop their perceptions. More generally, the comparison of high, medium, and low types in this instance represents a potential comparison of outcomes between individuals with a fundamental information asymmetry with respect to offending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128709345971">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0011128709345971">
<title>Addressing Age and Maturity Confounders</title>
<p>Given that age and maturity are variable for individuals at the time of inclusion into the sample, it is important to rule out such factors as confounders for differences in perceptions between groups, as there may be a natural progression of perceptual development during this adolescence period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709345971">Steinberg, 2005</xref>). If there are preexisting differences between offending types based on either age or maturity, then group differences in perceptions may be attributable to these basic differences as opposed to differences in information. To investigate this, we examine initial differences among the three offending types in both age and maturity. To measure maturity, we consider the Psychosocial Maturity Inventory (PSMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709345971">Greenberger, Josselson, Knerr, &amp; Knerr, 1974</xref>), measured at both the first (i.e., baseline) and last (i.e., 36 months) observational periods.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128709345971">Table 3</xref> reports means for age (in years) and PSMI, at both baseline and 36 months, conditional on offending type. Notice that the high type is, on average, only slightly older (&lt;4 months) than the low type, and this difference is not significant. Furthermore, there is essentially no mean difference at all in terms of PSMI at either baseline or 36 months between any of the groups, suggesting that such a developmental component may not be important in explaining differences in perceptions between the three offending types. We are confident that any differences in perceptions between types that arise over time are likely due to something other than natural maturation.</p>

<p>Notice that the mean risk perception for medium-type individuals is 5.54, which, because this metric is scaled from 0 to 10, may be reasonably divided by 10 and interpreted as a probability of .554. In other words, the average offender in the sample perceives a 55.4% chance of being caught on average for each crime committed during the study interval. The positive and statistically significant coefficient for the low type, .73, suggests that this group has, on average, about 7.3% higher perceived risk, or 62.7% perceived risk, on average. Conversely, the coefficient for the high type is both negative and significant, suggesting that this group has a 13% lower risk perception on average than the medium-type offenders. The difference in the coefficients on risk between the high and low types suggests that on average, there is a spread of about 2.1 units or, more intuitively, a .21 difference in the mean perceived probability of getting caught after committing a crime. This represents a sharp difference in the perceived risk between these two classes of offenders.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are important differences between the three groups in terms of perceived rewards for crime. Specifically, the low offending group has a lower perceived reward, which is both large (−−0.86 on a scale of 1–5) and significant compared to the rating by the medium offending group. The high offending group reports higher rewards of crime compared to the medium offending group. Again, the difference between the high and low types on average is even more dramatic (a mean difference of 1.41; <italic>F</italic> statistic = 35.27).</p>
<p>The differences between the three types in terms of perceived cost are slightly more subtle, yet a crucial difference still emerges. The high type exhibits a significantly lower cost than the medium group (as well as the medium and low groups combined) and a marginally significant difference from the low type.</p>
<p>Although these mean differences are dramatic by themselves, we can also examine the distributions of these perceptions, conditional on offending group, to provide more striking evidence of the existence of heterogeneity in perceptions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128709345971">Figure 1</xref> shows histograms of perceived risk for both the low and high types. Notice that the two histograms are essentially mirror images of each other, with the bulk of the low-offending-type distribution having very high perceived risk, whereas much of the high-offending-type distribution has perceived risk close to zero. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011128709345971">Figure 2</xref> reinforces these differences by displaying histograms of perceived reward. Again, notice the very high density of zeros (or close to zero) in the distribution of reward for low types. Contrast this to the histogram of rewards for high types, where the distribution is more spread out over the entire range and displays considerably fewer individuals with small rewards. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0011128709345971">Figure 3</xref> shows similar histograms for perceived cost between low and high types. Again, the differences in cost are considerably more subtle, yet they do show some movement of the distribution toward lower cost for high-type individuals.</p>

<title>Changes in Perceptions Over 36 Months</title>
<p>Aside from the clear differences in terms of baseline perceptions across the three groups based on their offending frequency, we also examine changes in risk, cost, and reward perceptions over the 36-month follow-up in order to assess whether there is individual change regarding deterrence perceptions. Although there appear to be no type-level differences in age and maturity as confounders, there still may be shifts in perceptions associated with early adulthood that allow these initial baseline differences in perceptions to eventually converge. Accordingly, we next examine plots of type-conditional means every 6 months after baseline through 36 months.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0011128709345971">Figure 4</xref> displays plots of mean risk, cost, and reward by type over the 36-month follow-up period. Notice first that patterns of perceived risk are all either monotonically rising or remaining flat over time, suggesting that perceived risk is, if anything, growing with age. Similarly, patterns of perceived cost are also monotonically rising or remaining flat with age. Conversely, the patterns of perceived reward are all monotonically decreasing or remaining flat with age. These patterns all constitute important policy findings, as it appears that each of the elements of the rational choice calculus is tending in the expected direction of being less likely for crime to appear rational as age increases.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, as far as perceived risk is concerned, although the high offending type shows a significant increase in risk with time, even at 36 months, the mean perceived risk for the high offending type is still lower than the baseline perceived risks among the medium and low offending types. Similarly, the high and medium offending types show decreasing perceived rewards over time, yet by 36 months, neither of these converging groups approaches the low offending type at baseline. Furthermore, at 36 months, the mean perceived risk for the high group is still significantly lower than both the medium group (<italic>t</italic> = 3.32, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and low group (<italic>t</italic> = 4.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), although there is no significant difference between the low and medium groups in terms of mean perceived risk at this point.</p>
<p>Although there is more overlap in the patterns of perceived cost, there are still differences at each time point and a lack of convergence between the three offending types. At 36 months the high group continues to have significantly lower cost perceptions on average than the other two groups (<italic>t</italic> = 2.18, <italic>p</italic> = .014), which by 36 months have nearly converged in terms of cost perceptions. Also, there is a flat pattern of reward over time for the low offending type, to which the medium and high group fail to converge. Although the mean differences between the high and medium groups in terms of perceived reward fail to approach significance at 36 months, each group still continues to display, on average, significantly higher reward perceptions than the low group, which differs from both the medium group (<italic>t</italic> = 2.59, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and the high group (<italic>t</italic> = 2.97, <italic>p</italic> = .007) after 36 months in terms of lower perceived rewards. Given that many individuals in this low type do not reoffend over the 36-month follow-up period, it appears that they have reached a stable floor of perceived benefit during this period. Similarly, the low offending type may have hit a ceiling in perceived risk, as evidenced by their flat risk pattern. Conversely, the high type may essentially constitute a floor of perceived risk, as there is very little change in their patterns of risk over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In an attempt to extend the extant knowledge base on deterrence theory, this article examines heterogeneity and changes in perceptions of risk, cost, and reward among a sample of serious offenders followed for a 3-year period from late adolescence into early adulthood. This work addresses two gaps in the deterrence literature by examining perceptual deterrence over time among a sample of active and serious offenders. We show that by delineating types of high-, medium-, and low-frequency offenders based on accumulated prior offending experience, there exists substantial heterogeneity in perceptions associated with classical risk-reward rational choice calculus. These differences are likely due to the amount of prior information on offending on which these different offender types may be forming and basing their perceptions.</p>
<p>Specifically, we identified a group of high-rate offenders who display lower perceived risks of detection and punishment for crime and also higher perceived rewards from crime. Alternatively, we identified a group of low-rate offenders who report higher perceived risk and lower perceived reward regarding offending. These differences seem stable over time: The differences in perceptions between the three offending types do not converge after 3 years.</p>
<p>Yet some important changes in risk and reward perceptions were observed among the three offender groups. Recalling the notion of differential deterrence advanced earlier, we show that there exists a potential ceiling and floor of sanction threat perceptions that is evident across the three offending groups. This finding indicates that certain types of offenders may be more deterrable than others in that they adjust their sanction threat perceptions in heterogeneous ways in the transition from adolescence to adulthood. If certain adolescents never enter the range of perceptions in which sanction may be seen as a reasonable likelihood, and in which costs are consistently low and rewards are consistently high, then it is not surprising that the deterrence process is not affecting their decision making. Exactly how these factors combine to determine that point is an open question, but it is clear that the amount of heterogeneity and the consistency of the patterns observed here make it highly likely that expecting a uniform effect of deterrence in serious adolescent offenders is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings show the change process underlying deterrence perceptions among active and serious young offenders. Nevertheless, several limitations remain before we can reach more robust conclusions about the deterrence process among serious offenders. First, a key aspect of our analysis was based on the classification of offenders into three groups parceled by their offending frequency, which may reasonably be thought of as the individual’s prior information. Whether similar conclusions would be reached using more multidimensional alternative procedures for determining typologies is an empirical question. Second, although our longitudinal investigation focused on an important transitional period in the life course, it would be important to understand the point at which sanction threat perceptions originate earlier in the life course and how they may wax and wane as these juveniles enter adulthood. An interesting question is whether the ceiling and floor effects observed in the current study were a peculiar aspect of the 3-year observation period.</p>
<p>Third, given that our sample is comprised of juveniles transitioning into early adulthood, our ruling out age and maturity factors as possible differences between types is notable yet ultimately incomplete as a means to properly account for development as an explanatory process among these particular individuals. Indeed, a more formal specification of change that includes a broader spectrum of developmental factors such as cognitive development is necessary to better identify the role of developmental factors beyond the simple notions of age or psychosocial maturity in forming perceptions of risk and reward.</p>
<p>Fourth, due to resource constraints and thus lying beyond the scope of the current study, a stronger research design would compare serious offenders to nonserious (community offenders, not processed by the system) individuals and assess how the deterrence process (investigated in our study) plays out across these different types of samples. This would be an important inquiry for future investigations.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most important, we did not examine how different forms and doses of punishment influenced subsequent perceptions and offending behavior and how this process may vary across certain offenders types (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128709345971">Loughran et al., 2009</xref>). This is an important component of the deterrence process. Further analysis of this issue is warranted, especially given the variation in offending pursuant to punishment generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709345971">Bhati &amp; Piquero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709345971">Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984</xref>) and this study’s differential deterrence results specifically.</p>
<p>With these limitations in mind, we envision a healthy agenda for future research that may generate unique insights into how experience influences sanction threat perceptions, whether and how this interplay is conditioned by one’s level and type of offending, and how these insights can help identify important and novel theoretical insights into and extensions to policy. Principal among these is further documentation of whether and how criminal or compliant behavior changes once offenders gain more information from the consequences of offending. Rooted in notions of Bayesian updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709345971">Matsueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709345971">Pogarsky &amp; Piquero, 2003</xref>), our results suggest that different offender types engage in differential patterns of perception updating. That perceptions among high-type offenders do not move much over the 3-year period suggests not only that some higher crime individuals may be linked to different “anchor” perceptions of risk, cost, and rewards of crime but also that ceiling and floor effects may somehow compromise any potential updating that may occur among high-rate offenders. Thus, the incorporation of consequences, most notably in the form of sanctions, into the notion of information, and an individual’s response to it, will become an important consideration.</p>
<p>Results from the current study also will motivate investigation of other theoretical and empirical questions, including a more elaborate depiction of the calculus of rational choice, especially within the context of prospect theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128709345971">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>) vis-à-vis the resetting hypothesis. For example, expected utility calculation could be confounded by resetting of the zero point. That is, once an individual initiates offending, his or her benefit from offending is positive (from zero) originally but then resets to zero, meaning that refraining from offending is actually a negative utility. Also, rooted in prospect theory, certain individuals may report a different internal calculus of a rational choice decision based on their perceived rewards, as those who gain positive rewards or utility may be less risk averse because the outcome may be weighted more heavily toward a positive outcome for them. Similarly, understanding individuals with very small or very large sanction threat probabilities, and understanding any movement away from these under- and overinflated perceptions, seems to be an important question, especially given the variation that exists across objective sanction probabilities.</p>
<p>Two other related hypotheses appear worthy of investigation among identifiable subgroups of serious offenders. The first concerns the concept of a rational expectations hypothesis, in which an individual’s current perceptions of expectations are necessarily functions of an individual’s expectation of future outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709345971">Manski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709345971">Muth, 1961</xref>). In other words, outcomes do not typically or systematically differ from what individuals expect them to be. Thus, the linkage of perceptions and expectations to future beliefs and actions is important to understand the degree to which the subjectivity component of individual perception is playing a role in this observed heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Finally, it is necessary to ultimately tie individuals’ perceptions of risk and reward to later offending, as any study of perceptual deterrence must return to this core theoretical principle. Particularly among individuals who seemed to have reached a plateau in the development of their individual perceptions, understanding how this linkage relates to offending is critical to the ultimate issue of deterrence with respect to both theory and policy.</p>

<p>Namely, this difference revolves around the question of specific deterrence, as opposed to the general deterrent effects of sanctions, which may shift among those nonoffending individuals in response to their perceptions that active offenders are sanctioned. In other words, at the margin, some would-be offenders may perceive higher risks of detection and punishment if active offenders are punished and thus may be deterred from initial forays into crime that could launch criminal careers of uncertain length.</p>

<p>Given that some self-reported offending (SRO) items may be naturally prone to higher counts (e.g., carrying a gun) and thus may have artificially inflated the total frequency score, we tried alternative methods of delineating groups to account for this possibility, including top-coding and individually counting the number of endorsed items. As there were no major differences in either group classification or results using these alternatives, they are excluded from our reporting.</p>

<p>This simplistic metric of delineating offending groups or types is intended merely for the purpose of exploratory sample heterogeneity; it is not meant to suggest that (a) this is the only manner in which such heterogeneity will become apparent or (b) these rough groups represent a formal or rigid taxonomy of different offenders. Indeed, our usage of the term <italic>type</italic> is exclusively intended to differentiate groups with different levels of prior offending experiences.</p>

<p>As a supplemental analysis, we stratified the sample based on the official records (prior court petitions) at baseline and conducted the same analyses as found in the main text. Given the skewed distribution of prior petitions from the official court record data, we were prevented from explicitly dividing the distribution into relative thirds, as was done with the SRO data. Still, we were able to define three groups of individuals, stratified on the official prior petitions before baseline (recall that all individuals had at least one prior petition in order to gain inclusion into the sample, so we forego counting this one). We delineate a no-prior group of individuals with zero prior court petitions (25.8% of the sample), a low-prior group including individuals with one or two prior court petitions (41.2% of the sample), and a high-prior group of individuals with more than two prior court petitions (33.0% of the sample). The substantive patterns of risk, cost, and reward perceptions among these three groups, defined using official records, are nearly identical to the results contained in the main text, where we stratified on SRO. Detailed results are available by request.</p>
