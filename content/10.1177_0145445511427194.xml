<abstract>
<p>In two experiments, the authors evaluated the extent to which (a) individuals preferred engaging in object stereotypy versus observing an experimenter while the experimenter engaged in object stereotypy and (b) an experimenter’s engagement in object stereotypy decreased the participants’ engagement in object stereotypy. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that behaver-controlled (BC) object stereotypy was preferred over experimenter-controlled (EC) object stereotypy by three of four participants. Results of Experiment 2 indicated that EC object stereotypy decreased object stereotypy for only one of three participants. Implications of these findings for determining the relative importance of control over stimulation generated by stereotypy are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>Effective treatment of aberrant behavior is generally dependent on identifying the consequence that maintains the behavior and, thereafter, implementing procedures designed to alter the response–reinforcer relation. Although functional analysis methodology provides a technology for determining whether a behavior is reinforced by social or nonsocial consequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445511427194">Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, &amp; Richman, 1982/1994</xref>), it does little to identify specific sensory products that contribute to the maintenance of automatically reinforced behavior. Stereotypic or “self-stimulatory” behaviors present a particularly unique challenge for behavior analysts insofar as such behaviors are often insensitive to environmental events and are typically maintained by automatic positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511427194">Rapp &amp; Vollmer, 2005</xref>). Specifically, stereotypy and other automatically reinforced behaviors can be difficult to assess and treat because the consequent stimulation is difficult to manipulate and, furthermore, is often available to the behaver on a continuous basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445511427194">Piazza, Adelinis, Hanley, Goh, &amp; Delia, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>More than two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511427194">Buyer, Berkson, Winnega, and Morton (1987)</xref> suggested that an individual’s control over stimulation generated by his repetitive or “self-stimulatory” behavior likely contributed to the maintenance of his behavior. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511427194">Lovaas, Newsom, and Hickman (1987)</xref> suggested that many forms of stereotypical behaviors may be maintained by conjugate schedules of reinforcement. A schedule is referred to as conjugate when the “frequency, intensity, and duration of the reinforcement varies directly with the rate, intensity, or duration of the response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511427194">Lovaas et al., 1987</xref>, p. 53). In other words, a conjugate reinforcement schedule is a type of fixed-ratio (FR) 1 schedule, but unlike traditional FR schedules, the consequence for each response is proportional to the respective response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511427194">Lovaas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445511427194">Rapp, 2008</xref>). In this sense, a conjugate reinforcement schedule could be conceptualized as an FR schedule that affords the behaver direct control over the consequent sensory stimulation. As an illustration of the potential relevance of conjugate reinforcement schedules, assume that two individuals engage in a topographically similar form of object stereotypy involving flapping of an item. One individual may consistently engage in rapid flapping, whereas the other individual may alternate between rapid and slow flapping. Although both individuals may flap the item the same number of times during a given observation period, the visual or auditory stimulation generated by their respective responses would likely differ.</p>
<p>Relatively few studies have used single-subject designs to evaluate the effects of an individual’s control over stimulation produced by stereotypical behavior. In one such study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445511427194">Rapp, Dozier, Carr, Patel, and Enloe (2004)</xref> evaluated the extent to which a child’s control over visual stimulation influenced the maintenance of his or her automatically reinforced behavior. Specifically, Rapp et al. used a concurrent operants design to evaluate the child’s erratic body movements (EBM) and visually orienting toward a reflective surface (observing behavior). The authors compared levels of EBM when the participant stood in front of concurrently available monitors that projected either (a) real-time images of his behavior (behaver-controlled [BC] stimulation in the controlled video condition), or (b) previously recorded images of his behavior from prior controlled video sessions (experimenter-controlled [EC] stimulation in the uncontrolled video condition). Results showed that the child not only spent more time in front of the controlled video but also displayed more EBM while watching the controlled video.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445511427194">Rapp et al. (2004)</xref> concluded that the visual stimulation produced directly by the participant’s EBM reinforced the participant’s observing behavior. That is, the extent to which the participant controlled the production of reinforcing visual stimulation (presumably the topography, duration, and intensity) may have contributed to the maintenance of his EBM. Nevertheless, the results of this study are potentially limited because the separate effects of the controlled and uncontrolled video conditions on EBM were not directly evaluated. Thus, even though the individual clearly preferred to view the controlled video, it is possible that continuous access to the uncontrolled video would have decreased his EBM.</p>
<p>As a whole, the literature suggests that providing noncontingent access to empirically identified preferred stimuli decreases stereotypy and other automatically reinforced behavior for many individuals (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511427194">LeBlanc, Patel, &amp; Carr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511427194">Rapp &amp; Vollmer, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, some studies show that noncontingent access to preferred stimulation does not decrease automatically reinforced behavior for everyone who displays such behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511427194">Hall, Thorns, &amp; Oliver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445511427194">Taylor, Hoch, &amp; Weissman, 2005</xref>). It is possible that preferred stimulation may compete more effectively with automatically reinforced behavior when the respective individual is permitted to control the production of the preferred stimulation. In this way, the stimulation generated by a preferred item may be more similar to that generated by stereotypy. For example, music may produce greater reductions in vocal stereotypy when the individual is permitted to adjust the volume or repeat segments than when the same music is presented independent of a controlling response. Alternatively, free access to the stimulation, rather than control over its production, may be important for some individuals. Thus, it may be possible to decrease stereotypy for some individuals by allowing them to observe as another individual engages in a similar topography of behavior. In this way, access to observing stereotypy could be provided for appropriate behavior. Thus, research on the potential influence of control over stimulation generated by automatically reinforced behavior is warranted as an early step toward evaluating the aforementioned possibilities.</p>
<p>Object stereotypy may be an ideal response form with which to study the relative importance of behaver control over stimulation that is generated by repetitive behavior. Presumably, many individuals manipulate objects to generate visual or auditory stimulation. Assuming that object stereotypy can be imitated with fidelity by an experimenter, an individual’s engagement in object stereotypy can be evaluated while an experimenter engages in the same form of object stereotypy to determine if the latter affects engagement in the former. As such, the purposes of the following experiments were to determine whether (a) participants preferred EC or BC object stereotypy and (b) continuous access to EC stereotypy decreased participants’ engagement in object stereotypy.</p>

<title>General Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0145445511427194">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Four individuals who were diagnosed with autism participated in the following experiments. Miles was a 10-year-old boy who had been diagnosed with a seizure disorder. Jimmy and Beau were 7-year-old boys. All sessions for Miles, Jimmy, and Beau were conducted in a therapy room located in their school. The room was equipped with a video camera, two small tables, and two chairs. Daniel was a 12-year-old boy who attended a school for children with special educational needs on a part-time basis and received a home-based Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) educational programming. The programming focused primarily on acquisition of mands, tacts, and intraverbals. All sessions for Daniel were conducted in the same room at his home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145445511427194">
<title>Response Definitions and Interobserver Agreement (IOA)</title>
<p>Each participant engaged in object stereotypy. Miles exhibited object stereotypy in the form of string twirling, which was defined as manipulating a string on the carpet for 2 s or more while visually orienting toward it. Jimmy exhibited object stereotypy in the form of spinning items in close proximity to his eyes for 2 s or more while visually orienting toward the item. Beau displayed object stereotypy in the form of object flapping, which was defined as flapping items either in front of or to the side of his eyes, or just below his face for 2 s or more. Daniel exhibited object stereotypy in the form of repetitive manipulation of hair bands, which was defined as collecting hair bands together, looping the bands onto the fingers or thumb, shaking the bands in front of his eyes, or dropping the bands from eye-level onto a surface or the floor for 2 s or more. The hair bands were multicolored and approximately 5 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>Each session was videotaped and subsequently scored by trained observers using laptop computers. IOA scores were obtained by having a second observer collect data for a minimum of 30% of sessions for each participant. The IOA scores for each dependent event in both experiments were calculated using block-by-block agreement within 10-s blocks method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445511427194">Mudford, Taylor, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Experiment 1: Assessment of Preference for BC or EC of Object Stereotypy</title>
<p>Some studies have evaluated the extent to which participants who engage in socially maintained problem behavior prefer treatment procedures that involve noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) versus those that afford more control over reinforcement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445511427194">Hanley, Piazza, Fisher, Contrucci, and Maglieri (1997)</xref> found that NCR with attention and functional communication training (FCT) with attention produced comparable decreases in attention-maintained problem behavior for two participants. Subsequently, Hanley et al. found that both participants preferred FCT over NCR when they were permitted to choose between the two function-based interventions. Although both of the conditions used by Hanley et al. contained similar rates of attention delivery, the FCT condition essentially allowed the participants to control the delivery or production of reinforcing stimulation, whereas the NCR condition did not.</p>
<p>Using a group design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511427194">Buyer et al. (1987)</xref> evaluated body rocking that was displayed by 10 children diagnosed with an intellectual disability. As a part of their analysis, Buyer et al. used a variation of a concurrent operants preparation to evaluate the participants’ relative preferences for (a) a condition in which the participant controlled the rate of rocking in a rocking chair or (b) a condition in which an experimenter rocked the participant in a chair at a rate that was yoked to the participant’s prior rocking rate. Buyer et al. found that each participant preferred the rocking chair that he or she controlled.</p>
<p>It is possible that a concurrent operants arrangement can also be used to evaluate the relative importance of individual control over the stimulation that is generated by repetitive movement of objects (i.e., a nonsocial reinforcer). The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the extent to which individuals preferred to control the stimulation generated by repetitive manipulation of specific items (i.e., BC) relative to observing an experimenter engaged in the same repetitive behavior (i.e., EC).</p>
<sec id="section5-0145445511427194">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0145445511427194">
<title>Participants and procedures</title>
<p>All four individuals participated in this experiment. Each participant’s relative preference for BC or EC object stereotypy was assessed using a concurrent operants design (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427194">Dozier et al., 2007</xref>). A piece of tape was used to divide the room into two halves. One side of the room contained the BC condition and the other side contained the EC condition. The half of the room associated with each condition was counterbalanced on a session-by-session basis to control for possible side bias. Three to five, 5-min sessions were conducted in succession each day until a consistent pattern of responding was evident. The EC condition was signaled by the presence of a trainer at the table with the respective object. Conversely, the BC condition was signaled by the placement of the object on a table or on the floor (Miles only) in the absence of a trainer. Prior to each session, the participants were guided to each side and allowed to experience the conditions in effect for 1 min. Following the presession training, the participant was asked to stand on a line of tape or sit in a chair (Daniel only) at one end of the room before being told he could go to either side of the room. Participants were allowed to switch sides of the room at any time during the sessions.</p>
<p>During each session, identical strings (Miles), shapes (Jimmy), puzzle pieces (Beau), or hair bands (Daniel) were available on both sides of the room. The experimenter did not allow the participant to bring the items from the BC side to the EC side (attempts were physically blocked; this rarely occurred) to ensure that response allocation to the side of the room was due to preference for the condition that was in place. On the BC side of the room, participants were free to engage in object stereotypy. On the EC side, the experimenter held the respective object and, when the participant crossed the line to the EC side, immediately simulated the participant’s engagement in object stereotypy. The purpose of this condition was to provide the participant with the opportunity to observe the visual product of manipulating the item without engaging in object stereotypy. The experimenter immediately stopped engaging in object stereotypy if the participant crossed the line to the BC side of the room.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145445511427194">
<title>Dependent variable and IOA</title>
<p>The dependent variable and measure used to indicate preference was the duration of time (converted to a percentage of the session) allocated to each side of the room. The mean IOA scores for room side were 99% for Miles, 98% for Jimmy, 100% for Beau, and 97% for Daniel.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445511427194">Figure 1</xref> depicts the results of the preference analysis for Miles (first panel), Jimmy (second panel), Beau (third panel), and Daniel (fourth panel). Results show that Miles allocated the majority of his responding to the BC stereotypy side of the room (<italic>M</italic> = 80%) and far less time to the EC stereotypy side (<italic>M</italic> = 20%). Thus, Miles preferred BC stereotypy over EC stereotypy. Jimmy typically spent time on both sides of the room during each session; however, he allocated more time to the BC side of the room (<italic>M</italic> = 66%) than the EC side (<italic>M</italic> = 34%) in 7 of 10 sessions. This pattern suggests that Jimmy preferred BC stereotypy, although his preference was not as strong as Miles’ preference. Similar to Miles, Beau showed a strong preference for BC stereotypy by allocating nearly all of his time to the BC side of the room (<italic>M</italic> = 99%). By contrast, Daniel initially alternated between the EC and BC conditions across the first 4 sessions; however, after Session 4 he allocated the majority of his time to the EC side of the room (<italic>M</italic> = 58.9%) and split the remainder of his time between the BC side (<italic>M</italic> = 26.7%) and the neutral chair. Data from Sessions 10 and 12 also suggest that Daniel may have experienced satiation for the stimulation produced by EC stereotypy, BC stereotypy, or both. Specifically, Daniel returned to and remained seated in the neutral chair, the place from which each session was begun, after briefly sampling the BC side of the room in both sessions. Presumably, neither side of the room contained reinforcing events for Daniel during these two sessions. Unlike the other three participants, the overall results for Daniel suggest that he preferred the EC stereotypy over BC stereotypy. As a whole, the results of this analysis suggest that 3 of 4 participants demonstrated a preference for controlling the reinforcing visual stimulation produced by engaging in object stereotypy over observing the visual stimulation produced while the experimenter manipulated the item.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results of this analysis are potentially limited insofar as Miles, Jimmy, and Beau may have chosen the BC stereotypy side of the room because of a history of social punishment for engaging in object stereotypy near adults. Nevertheless, we used a unique trainer for this preference assessment and each participant was allowed to engage in object stereotypy in close physical proximity to the trainers prior to each session. Moreover, both Miles and Jimmy contacted the contingency on the EC stereotypy side of the room during multiple sessions. Thus, it seems unlikely that Miles, Jimmy, and Beau chose the BC side of the room to avoid social consequences for object stereotypy.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Jimmy’s engagement in object stereotypy decreased to zero levels just after this experiment. Prior studies have suggested that uninterrupted access to stereotypy may produce satiation for the stimulation generated by engagement in the repetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445511427194">Lang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445511427194">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445511427194">Rapp, 2004</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that caregivers blocked or otherwise interrupted his object stereotypy outside of our sessions.</p>

<title>Experiment 2: Evaluating the Possible Treatment Effects of Experimenter Control of Object Stereotypy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445511427194">Hanley et al. (1997)</xref> found that both preferred and nonpreferred function-based interventions decreased problem behavior for two individuals who displayed attention-maintained problem behavior. Given this outcome, it is possible that EC object stereotypy decreases object stereotypy for individuals who do and do not exhibit relative preferences for EC stereotypy. Thus, the purpose of Experiment 2 was to evaluate the extent to which EC stereotypy, regardless of whether it was preferred, decreased the participants’ engagement in object stereotypy. Although EC object stereotypy was provided on the EC side of the room in Experiment 1, participants could not engage in object stereotypy on that side of the room because objects were not available. However, as with NCR for socially reinforced behavior, participants could obtain visual stimulation independent of engaging in object stereotypy by watching the experimenter manipulate the object. Thus, Experiment 2 evaluated whether each participant’s object stereotypy decreased when EC stereotypy was simultaneously available. In this way, we determined whether EC stereotypy could be used to reduce each participant’s engagement in object stereotypy. In addition, we were able to determine whether each participant’s preference for BC or EC stereotypy predicted that EC stereotypy would decrease his object stereotypy.</p>

The BC condition was identical to the condition that was used in Experiment 1. During the BC + EC condition, identical objects were simultaneously available to both the participant and the experimenter. The experimenter manipulated the item for the entire duration of each session.

</fig>
<p>Results of this analysis suggest that EC stereotypy reduced object stereotypy for Daniel, but not for Miles or Beau. Interestingly, the results of the preference analysis showed that only Daniel preferred EC stereotypy over BC stereotypy, and thus predicted that EC stereotypy would decrease object stereotypy for Daniel, but not for Miles or Beau. As a whole, it is not clear why EC stereotypy did not decrease object stereotypy for Miles or Beau; however, it is possible that the stimulation produced by EC stereotypy was functionally dissimilar (or not functionally similar enough) to the stimulation produced by BC stereotypy. For example, EC stereotypy may have produced visual stimulation, but BC stereotypy produced visual stimulation as well as proprioceptive stimulation.</p>
<p>It is also possible that EC stereotypy did not affect engagement object stereotypy for either Miles or Beau because neither actually observed the experimenter engaged in object stereotypy. Assuming that the marginal increase in Beau’s object stereotypy during the BC + EC condition is indicative of an actual change in his behavior, this finding may suggest that he did, indeed, observe EC stereotypy (i.e., his behavior contacted the independent variable). Nonetheless, it is also not clear why EC stereotypy may have increased his object stereotypy. Prior studies have found that ambient stimulation may increase engagement in automatically reinforced behavior for some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511427194">Friman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445511427194">McAdam, DiCesare, Murphy, &amp; Marshall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445511427194">Piazza, Fisher, Hanley, Hilker, &amp; Derby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445511427194">Rapp, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445511427194">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445511427194">Van Camp et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the auditory or visual stimulation produced by EC stereotypy increased the value of the stimulation generated by Beau’s engagement in object stereotypy; however, further analysis would be required to explore this possibility.</p>
<p>The results of this analysis are also potentially limited because of our use of 5-min sessions. That is, it is possible that more extensive exposure to EC stereotypy may have decreased object stereotypy for Miles and Beau. However, each participant was exposed to the EC condition numerous times in Experiments 1 and 2, and 5-min sessions with the EC condition were sufficient for decreasing Daniel’s behavior. In a similar vein, it is possible that the effects of the EC condition on Daniel’s behavior could diminish during lengthier sessions. In short, our decision to use 5-min sessions to evaluate the effects of the EC condition was arbitrary.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Together, results from the two experiments showed that (a) BC stereotypy was preferred over EC stereotypy by three of four participants and (b) EC stereotypy decreased object stereotypy for only one of three participants. Results from Experiment 1 are consistent with those from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511427194">Buyer et al. (1987)</xref> study insofar as most participants preferred BC object stereotypy over EC object stereotypy and therefore provide additional support for the position that control over the production of stimulation that likely contributes to the maintenance of stereotypic behavior.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible that the effects of EC stereotypy for Daniel (Experiment 1) or lack thereof for Miles (Experiment 2) are a function of one or more variables that are unrelated to control over the stimulation generated by object stereotypy. For example, it is possible that Beau’s object stereotypy was maintained by proprioceptive stimulation to the arms or shoulders generated by flapping objects, as opposed to visual stimulation generated by movement of items in his visual field (as was our hypothesis). In addition, it is possible that his behavior was maintained by the simultaneous production of multiple types of stimulation (e.g., visual and proprioceptive). Nevertheless, assuming that his arms were not restrained, proprioceptive stimulation would have been available to Beau in the absence of small objects, yet he did not flap his arms unless the objects were in his hands. Similarly, it is possible that Beau’s behavior was maintained by the auditory product of object stereotypy; however, there is no reason to believe that EC stereotypy did not also produce an auditory product or that the auditory product was qualitatively different when an experimenter flapped the objects in a yoked manner (Beau’s proximity to the experimenter was not constrained). Moreover, the logic of simulating a participant’s engagement in stereotypy was based on the results of studies showing that the availability of items that were matched to the overt product of automatically reinforced behavior produced greater decreases in automatically reinforced behavior than unmatched items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427194">Higbee, Chang, &amp; Endicott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445511427194">Piazza et al., 2000</xref>). That is, EC object stereotypy could be categorized as a putative, structurally “matched” intervention for BC object stereotypy. Aside from control over the consequent stimulation, perhaps the only noteworthy difference between the EC and BC conditions in Experiment 2 was that EC stereotypy was exhibited at a level (i.e., 100% of the session) that exceeded two participants’ baseline levels of engagement in object stereotypy (note that participants did not observe EC stereotypy for 100% of any one session). Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the primary difference between the EC and BC conditions was the control over the visual production of stimulation from manipulating objects.</p>
<p>There are at least two potentially important implications of the findings from this study. First, the condition in which participants could exert direct control over stimulation generated by repetitive object movement (i.e., the BC condition) was preferred by most of the participants. It seems likely that this preference is based, at least in part, on the conjugate relationship between the movement of the object and the sensory consequence. By extension, effective interventions for individuals who prefer BC stereotypy may need to disrupt or otherwise alter the behaver’s control of stimulation generated by stereotypy, allow the behaver a high level of control of competing stimulation, or both. Second, the results of the treatment evaluation showed that response-independent access to stimulation via EC stereotypy decreased Daniel’s engagement in object stereotypy. Assuming that the stimulation generated by EC stereotypy was functionally similar to the stimulation generated by Daniel’s stereotypy, it may be possible to decrease some individuals’ object stereotypy by providing access to EC stereotypy (a) independent of the repetitive response or (b) dependent on engagement in an alternative response (e.g., engagement in an academic task). Future research should evaluate both possibilities.</p>
<p>This study potentially extends the literature on the assessment of stereotypical behavior in at least two ways. First, this is one of only a few studies to provide direct evidence that control of the stimulation generated by stereotypy (BC stereotypy) is an important variable in the maintenance of stereotypic behavior by showing that most participants preferred BC stereotypy over EC stereotypy. Second, we found that each participant’s relative preference for BC or EC stereotypy ultimately predicted whether EC stereotypy decreased their object stereotypy. It is possible that an individual’s preference for EC or BC stereotypy may ultimately predict whether interventions that afford low or high levels of alternative stimulation decrease stereotypy. Further research on the influence of control over stimulation generated by stereotypy is clearly warranted.</p>
<p>Some potential limitations of this study should also be noted. First, a traditional functional analysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445511427194">Iwata et al., 1982/1994</xref>) was not conducted to demonstrate that each participant’s object stereotypy was maintained by automatic reinforcement. Nonetheless, we demonstrated the persistence of object stereotypy in the absence of social consequences for Miles, Beau, and Daniel during the BC stereotypy condition in Experiment 2 in a manner not unlike that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445511427194">Iwata and Dozier (2008)</xref> for assessing behavior that is suspected to be automatically reinforced. Second, although Daniel’s stereotypy decreased when EC stereotypy was provided, it is possible that his behavior would have increased (relative to the BC baseline condition) during lengthier sessions or after EC stereotypy was removed (i.e., it is possible that EC stereotypy was not functionally matched or similar to the product of Daniel’s object stereotypy).</p>
<p>Future research should evaluate the extent to which EC stereotypy is functionally similar to BC stereotypy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445511427194">Lanovaz, Rapp, and Fletcher (2010)</xref> describe how a three-component multiple schedule with a test sequence and a baseline sequence can be used to identify immediate (when intervention is being implemented) and subsequent (after intervention is removed) effects of interventions on engagement in automatically reinforced behavior. Each sequence is composed of three consecutive components of equal duration. All three components of the baseline sequence contain a no-interaction (NI) condition (i.e., no social consequences are provided). By comparison, the first and third components of the test sequence are NI conditions and the second component contains an independent variable. Using these procedures, a researcher can compare the level of stereotypy in one component to the level of stereotypy in the other components between sequences (e.g., comparing the third components of the baseline and test sequences) or within sequences (e.g., comparing the third component and first component of the test sequence). If EC stereotypy decreased an individual’s immediate engagement in object stereotypy but increases his subsequent engagement in object stereotypy, it would indicate that EC stereotypy is functionally dissimilar to BC stereotypy. By contrast, if engagement in immediate object stereotypy decreases and engagement in subsequent object stereotypy does not increase above baseline levels, it would suggest that EC stereotypy was functionally similar to BC stereotypy.</p>
<p>Future research should also replicate our procedures with other response forms of stereotypy (e.g., hand flapping). In addition, future research should evaluate whether providing individuals with access to BC-preferred stimulation is more effective for decreasing stereotypy than EC-preferred stimulation. It is possible that preferred stimulation may compete more effectively with automatically reinforced behavior when the respective individual is permitted to control the production of the preferred stimulation. In this way, the stimulation generated by a preferred item may be more similar to the stimulation that is generated by stereotypy and, thereby, that stimulation may be more effective for decreasing stereotypy.</p>
