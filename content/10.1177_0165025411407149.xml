<p>The collection of papers in this special issue reflects presentations at The Second Herzliyah Symposium on Developmental Psychopathology that took place during June 7–10, 2010 at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) New School of Psychology in Israel. The theme of the conference was the effects of stress and early adversity on children’s development. The presenters at this meeting spanned a broad range of interests, from individuals studying stress resilience in nonhuman primates to researchers studying the effects of exposure to political violence within the context of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Three themes emerged from this series of papers. First, and most obvious, was the evidence that infants and children exposed to different types of adversity (specifically, trauma, neglect, or violence) are significantly affected by such exposure, and that these effects often persist. Thus, for example, Phillip Fisher from the University of Oregon presented data on both the short- and long-term effects of neglect on children in the foster-care system. Megan Gunnar (University of Minnesota) presented data on postinstitutionalized children, and Marinus van IJzendoorn provided evidence for the effects of severe neglect on young institutionalized children in the Ukraine. These effects often appear to be pervasive, affecting multiple domains of functioning including cognitive and social-emotional behaviors.</p>
<p>A second theme to emerge from this series of papers was identification of the underlying neurobiology of stress adversity. A number of papers focused on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and measured both cortisol reactivity and diurnal rhythm. This was the case of work presented by Megan Gunnar, Phillip Fisher, and Marinus van IJzendoorn. It appears that the stress system is extremely sensitive to significant caregiving perturbations in the early years of life, and experiences of trauma, neglect, and exposure to violence affect both reactivity and regulation of this system. As well, early exposure to stress appears to affect neural circuits involving amygdala and prefrontal cortex. These circuits underlie the expression of anxious behaviors and cognitive biases that reinforce anxiety. The paper by Daniel Pine (National Institute of Mental Health) and Jennifer Lau (Oxford University) provides evidence of perturbations in these circuits and relations to anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>A third theme of the presentations provided a balance to the dire consequences and outcomes of early exposure to adversity. A number of papers suggested that individual differences in genetic, temperamental, or contextual factors could moderate exposure to stress such that certain children may flourish or at least show a diminution of negative outcomes over time. Jay Belsky (University of California, Davis) presented a model by which one may understand these individuals. The model, differential susceptibility to context, argues that different environments may dramatically amplify or reduce adaptive outcomes for some children, while having few effects on others. Karen Parker (Stanford University) provided evidence using a nonhuman primate model of stress resilience. Monkeys who undergo mild stress early in life are actually better able to respond to stressors later in life than monkeys without those experiences. Finally, work by Avi Sagi-Schwartz and colleagues suggests that even among individuals who experienced a trauma as significant as the Holocaust there are important individual differences that suggest resiliency in the face of extreme conditions of exposure to violence. As well, their longitudinal multigenerational data provide evidence for the lack of intergenerational transmission of psychopathology.</p>
<p>The 10 papers in this section are arranged to reflect these themes. The first paper by Belsky and Pluess provides a model for thinking about the effects of individual differences and context on response to stress. This paper is followed by papers from Bakermans-Kranenburg and colleagues, Quevedo and colleagues, and Fisher and his group, which provide empirical evidence of the effects of early neglect either in the case of children living in institutions, postinstitutionalized children living in the United States, or children in the foster-care system in the USA. Following these papers are three more that describe the underlying neurobiology and genetics in response to stress (Lau and Pine, Parker and colleagues, and Hartley and colleagues). The final three papers by Slone and colleagues, Guttman-Steinmetz, and Fridman and colleagues provide evidence of the effects of exposure to violence on children and on their offspring, and offer insights into factors associated with resilience and vulnerabilities to trauma.</p>
<p>We would finally like to thank Professor Mario Mikulincer and the staff at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliyah Israel for sponsoring this meeting and hosting it. Their generosity and hospitality created an atmosphere of scholarly interaction and scientific interchange in a friendly and beautiful setting. These efforts promoted advances in our understanding of the effects of stress and adversity on children’s development, as reflected in the following important contributions.</p>
