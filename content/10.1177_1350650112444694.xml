<abstract>
<p>The traction provided by shoe–surface interactions in tennis can have an impact on player safety, performance and overall enjoyment of the sport. There is a requirement for an improved scientific understanding of the tribological interactions at the shoe–surface interface and the effects that footwear and surface characteristics have on the traction developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence surface roughness has on traction present during a sliding contact between a shoe and an acrylic hard court tennis surface. The substrate of acrylic hard court tennis surfaces are formed from a coating of a silica sand and acrylic paint mix, giving them variations in surface roughness characteristics. Mechanical traction tests were performed on five surfaces of varying roughness at normal forces of between 400 N and 800 N with a commercially available acrylic hard court tennis shoe (with a herringbone outsole pattern) and a shoe with a flat outsole. Significant linear relationships were found between dynamic traction force and normal force. A trend for decreased dynamic traction with increased roughness was found. When examined under a microscope after testing evidence of contact between the shoe and the surface decreasing with increased surface roughness was found. With the flat shoe, surface roughness affected the relationship between the coefficient of traction and the normal load. As roughness increased the coefficient of dynamic traction becomes less dependent on normal force. Evidence of a sudden increase in traction with the flat shoe when tested on the roughest surface suggests other friction mechanisms caused by the outsole overcoming the roughness of the surface, such as abrasive wear, had a significant effect on dynamic traction force.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650112444694" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article the dynamic traction force (F<sub>N</sub>) relates to the horizontal force generated at the shoe–surface interface during a sliding movement. Dynamic traction can be defined by the ratio of the horizontal dynamic traction force and the normal applied force; this is termed the coefficient of traction (COT). During dynamic tennis-specific movements, such as accelerating and side stepping, the dynamic traction provided by a shoe–surface combination is critical to the injury risk and performance of the player.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112444694">1</xref></sup> The tractional properties of a shoe–surface combination must therefore be within an optimal range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112444694">2</xref></sup> Excessive traction may result in an injury caused by an over loading in the lower extremities. Insufficient traction may cause a slip, which will result in a loss of performance or, if the slip is severe, lead to a fall which may cause injury itself.</p>
<p>Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces. Elite tennis is played on grass, clay and acrylic hard court surfaces. Nigg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112444694">3</xref></sup> reported clay surfaces to have traction/friction coefficients from 0.5 to 0.7 whereas the other types of surfaces had traction/friction coefficients from 0.8 to 1.2. Damm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112444694">4</xref></sup> found the traction demands of players on clay surfaces were significantly different to on an acrylic hard court surface. Damm et al. measured three-dimensional ground reaction forces, via a force platform, of the leading leg as tennis players performed a side jump movement. The mean of the peak normal components of the ground reaction forces (F<sub>N</sub>) on both surfaces were not found to be significantly different. The mean peak normal force on the acyclic hard court surface was 1153.3 ± 153.6 N and the mean peak on the clay surface was 1035.6 ± 153.6. However, surprisingly, the mean peak horizontal force (F) during impact was found to be significantly greater on the clay surface (442.3 ± 65.7 N) than on the acrylic hard court surface (284.1 ± 87.1 N). It was concluded that players adapt to the traction characteristics of the playing surface. The players favoured to slide and, therefore, utilise the low dynamic friction characteristics of the clay surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112444694">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of studies have been conducted to understand how the differing surfaces affect injury risk in tennis. Biener and Caluori<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112444694">5</xref></sup> reported that 21% of injuries over a range of tennis surfaces were due to uncontrolled slipping. The severity of a slip can be determined by the distance which the shoe moves relative to the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112444694">6</xref></sup> which will be dependent on the dynamic traction force at the shoe–surface interface. Injury occurrence on clay surfaces have generally been reported to be lower than on acrylic hard court surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112444694">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112444694">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112444694">10</xref></sup> The difference in injury occurrence between surfaces has partly been attributed to inherent differing styles of play on each surface caused by differences in ball speed and bounce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112444694">3</xref></sup> However, the tractional characteristics of the playing surface also affects the risk of accidental injury occurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112444694">11</xref></sup> This has lead to the hypothesis that surfaces which do not allow sliding increase the potential to cause injury. Wannop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112444694">12</xref></sup> significantly correlated peak dynamic traction force data, measured via mechanical test methods, from two shoes on an athletic running track surface with knee and ankle joint moment data, collected via biomechanical test methods, of recreational athletes performing a ‘V-cut’ movement. This finding supports the hypothesis that excessive forces in the lower extremities are caused by high surface traction. Wannop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112444694">12</xref></sup> concluded that joint loading in the knee and ankle, and therefore injury risk, increases as shoe–surface traction increases.</p>
<p>This article presents experimental data with the aim to investigate the influence surface roughness characteristics have on the traction of acrylic hard court tennis surfaces. Despite the understanding that a shoe–surface combination with excessive traction is likely to increase injury risk in sport and the large number of studies that have investigated shoe–surface traction in sport, there is little scientific research on how shoe and surface characteristics influence traction. Severn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112444694">13</xref></sup> highlight there is a requirement for improved scientific understanding of the tribological interactions at the shoe–surface interface in sport. Understanding how traction is developed will aid the improvement of playing surfaces and footwear constructions. Once traction mechanisms are understood, surface properties and/or footwear can be effectively changed to maximise performance and/or minimise injury risk. The aim of this work was to isolate the affect of roughness on traction in order to provide a fundamental understanding of the contact characteristics of shoe–surface interactions in tennis.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1350650112444694"><title>Theory</title>
<p>Viscoelastic rubber is generally used on the outsoles of tennis shoes. In clean, dry conditions, sliding contacts between viscoelastic rubbers and a hard solid substrate will result in a combination of the following friction mechanisms: adhesion and hysteresis and abrasive wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112444694">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112444694">17</xref></sup> Therefore, during dynamic footwear–surface interactions, the roughness of the surface will undoubtedly affect the dynamic traction force developed.</p>
<p>During a horizontal sliding event the asperities of the solid substrate cause cyclic elastic deformation of the viscoelastic rubber material. Internal damping causes energy dissipation during the loading and unloading cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112444694">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112444694">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112444694">18</xref></sup> This loss is the hysteretic component of the contributing friction mechanisms. If local stresses deform the rubber beyond its elastic limit, it will be unable to recover. This results in tearing of the material and leads to additional friction forces at the interface between rubber and surface. Tearing can result in wear and cause the separation of fragments of material from the rubber, this mechanism is termed abrasive wear.</p>
<p>Adhesion is the process of junctions forming, caused by van der Waals interactions between the contacting surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112444694">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112444694">21</xref></sup> and the arising friction force is the force required for the junctions to shear. Adhesive friction is more prevalent when rubber slides over a smooth surface and depends significantly on the real contact area (contact between asperities) and therefore the roughness characteristics of the surface the rubber is sliding relative to. On increasingly rough surfaces the contribution of the adhesive component of traction has been found to decrease caused by a reduction in asperity interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112444694">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112444694">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112444694">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>An initial decrease in friction/traction coefficient with increasing normal force has been observed with interactions between rubber and hard surfaces, with it becoming constant at higher loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref></sup> A power relationship was observed between normal force and COT by Clarke et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112444694">22</xref></sup> with shoe–surface interactions in tennis. Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112444694">15</xref></sup> states that such a relationship will be due to molecular adhesion. As the normal force increases the COT becomes constant as the real area of contact increases proportionally with normal force.</p>
<p>Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112444694">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref></sup> explains how real contact area will be dependent on the wavelength (λ) and amplitude (h) of the surface profile, as well as the loading conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112444694">Figure 1</xref> (adapted from Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112444694">15</xref></sup>) illustrates how as the amplitude of the surface roughness is decreased, under the same loading conditions, surface contact will increase. The compressibility of a viscoelastic material leads to its area in contact to a surface of the same profile being dependent on the normal loading conditions. As normal force increases the rubber compresses against the surface increasing asperity contact, this is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112444694">Figure 2</xref>. Therefore, increased normal force results in greater asperity contact and an increase in the adhesional and hysteretic components of traction.

<p>When investigating hard court acrylic tennis surface traction, Clarke et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112444694">22</xref></sup> found, via mechanical testing, that under low normal loading conditions (100–500 N) a surface of higher average roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) had a lower dynamic coefficient of traction. However, as the normal force increased (600–800 N), a transition occurred causing the coefficient of traction of the rougher surface to be greater than that of a surface with lower R<sub>a</sub>. Clarke et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112444694">22</xref></sup> hypothesised the hysteretic friction mechanisms associated with overcoming surface roughness during sliding became increasingly dominant as normal force increases due to increased asperity contact of the viscoelastic tennis shoe sole.</p>
<p>Acrylic hard court tennis surfaces are constructed with a coating of acrylic paint and silica sand mix. This is likely to give increasing rough surfaces a profile characteristic with short- and long-range wavelengths. As highlighted by Palasantzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112444694">16</xref></sup> such real surfaces will have a profile with a degree of randomness (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112444694">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The profile characteristics (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112444694">Figure 3(b)</xref>) will be dependent on the silica sand particle size and the ratio of paint to sand in the coating mix. When considering surfaces of short- and long-wavelength profiles, Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112444694">21</xref></sup> notes although the applied pressure may be high enough to cause direct contact between the rubber and the surface into the short-wavelength asperities at the top of the surface, it may not be high enough to cause asperity contact within the short-wavelength asperities at the bottom of the long-wavelength profile.

<sec id="sec3-1350650112444694" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>As discussed, the top layer of acrylic hard court tennis surfaces are made from a mix of silica sand and acrylic paint. In this study the blend was manipulated to control the roughness of five surface samples (summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112444694">Table 1</xref>). Clarke et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112444694">22</xref></sup> reported the mean average surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of five existing hard court tennis surface systems varied between 14.47 µm and 32.56 µm. Surface D is an existing commercial hard court tennis surface constructed on 10 mm Perspex sheet with acrylic paint surface coating with silica sand mix. The other surfaces were also constructed on 10 mm Perspex sheet. Firstly the Perspex sheet is applied with an acrylic paint silica sand mix (this provides the surface with its texture) and secondly a coating of only acrylic paint is applied (this provides the surface with an improved aesthetic finish but also provides additional durability). Surface E therefore represents an extremely rough surface and surface A might be considered a smooth surface or a surface that has experienced usage wear. No layers of cushioning were used within the sub layers of the surfaces to negate any effects energy dissipated during the deformation and recovery of such a deformable layer may have on the traction recorded. Roughness profiles of the test surfaces were measured with a laboratory-based Mitutoyo Surftest SV-600 profilometer and analysed using Mitutoyo Surftest-SV Version 1.3. The measurement distance was 10 mm and the speed of the probe was 0.1 mm/s giving 10,000 data points in total. The profilometer was used to measure the mean roughness parameters shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112444694">Table 1</xref> for each surface. The surfaces are referenced A–E with increasing R<sub>z</sub>. R<sub>z</sub> is the average height difference between the highest and lowest peaks in the profile and will therefore be related to the mean amplitude of the surface profiles. The plots of each surface roughness profile which gave the median R<sub>a</sub> result are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112444694">Figure 4</xref>.

<p>Tests were conducted at the Health and Safety Laboratory (Buxton, UK) with a SATRA slip resistance testing machine (STM 603) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112444694">Figure 5</xref>) with the forefoot segment of two test shoes (EU size 42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112444694">Figure 6</xref>). The test shoes were an existing commercially available acrylic hard court tennis shoe (adidas Barricade 6.0) which has an outsole with a herringbone pattern, and a shoe with a flat Standard Simulated Shoe Sole (4S) rubber outsole. 4S rubber is a standardised rubber compound developed specifically to be used as a benchmark rubber for shoe outsole rubbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112444694">23</xref></sup> The Shore hardness of the 4S rubber is 96A and the Shore hardness of the adidas Barricade 6.0 outsole is 75A. However, for confidentiality reasons, the respective manufacturers did not provide other mechanical properties of interest. The shoe was aligned parallel to the direction of movement with a preloaded contact angle between the outsole and each surface sample set at 7°. For each test a motor drove the surface at a horizontal velocity of 0.3 m/s to replicate a dynamic slip event.

<p>Clarke et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112444694">22</xref></sup> highlighted the importance of testing under a range of normal loads as the relationship between normal force and traction force is shoe–surface dependent. This was attributed to changes in the tribological interaction under varying load. In a number of previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112444694">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650112444694">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350650112444694">28</xref></sup> conducting comparative investigations into sport shoe–surface traction via mechanical test methods the applied normal force has remained at the same value throughout testing. A cross-over point can occur after which shoe–surface combinations will give comparatively different traction measurements. It is therefore potentially misleading to draw conclusions on the traction a player is likely to experience from shoe–surface combinations when based on the mechanical traction value performed under a single normal force. In this study, tests were conducted at normal forces of 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 N, resulting in 50 shoe–surface testing conditions. For each condition tests were repeated five times for statistical analysis. A fresh area of surface was tested after the five tests were conducted at each normal force, as similar previous studies have found testing can change the surface topography due to wear and the transfer of polymeric material from the shoe sole to the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350650112444694">29</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350650112444694">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tests were conducted in accordance with parts of BS EN ISO 13287:2007 (International Standard: <italic>Personal protective equipment. Footwear. Test method for slip resistance</italic>). Before testing began the outsoles were cleaned with an ethanol solution and allowed to dry at ambient temperature. Prior to testing under each condition the outsole rubber was prepared by applying P400 silicon carbide paper by hand under minimal pressure as to not change the tread pattern nor the surface texture of the sole. Any debris from the shoe was removed using a clean, soft, dry brush. The mean dynamic coefficient of traction was measured between 0.30 s and 0.60 s after the start of each sliding movement. Plots of force against time and distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112444694">Figure 7</xref>) are produced by the test devices bespoke software ‘Slipmaster’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112444694">Figure 7</xref> shows how the traction (termed ‘Coefficient of Friction’ by the software on the plot) remains relatively constant over the 0.3 second period.

<p>The surface area in contact between each shoe and surface (A<sub>0</sub>) was estimated by forming ink prints. This technique was also used by Valiant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350650112444694">32</xref></sup> in order to compare the contact area between a flat shoe outsole and a herringbone shoe outsole. A film of ink was applied to cover the outsole of each shoe. The shoes were then positioned with, as discussed, a preloaded contact angle between the outsole and each surface sample set at 7° within the test rig. Graph paper was rigidly attached onto a smooth Perspex sheet under the shoes before they were loaded vertically at the same normal forces as the test conditions (400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 N). The thresholding function of Mimics software (Materialise, version 14.12) was used to calculate the area from digital images of each ink print (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112444694">Figure 8</xref>). This procedure was repeated 5 times for each condition to generate a mean; the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112444694">Figure 9</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-1350650112444694"><title>Relationship between dynamic traction force and normal force</title>
<p>Plots of normal force against mean dynamic traction force for the five surfaces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112444694">Figure 10</xref>. The results show that dynamic traction force is linearly proportional to normal force. On surfaces A to D the Barricade 6.0 shoe has higher traction whereas on surface E (the roughest surface) the traction is similar for both shoes. For all shoe–surface combinations strong significant linear relationships were found between normal force and traction force (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>&gt; 0.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, the traction force does not increase at the same rate as the normal force. Each relationship is specific to the particular shoe–surface combination and can be described by the equation: COT = (<italic>m</italic>F<sub>N</sub> ± <italic>c</italic>)/F<sub>N</sub>, where <italic>m</italic> and <italic>c</italic> are arbitrary constants and dependent on the particular shoe–surface combination. As <italic>c</italic> is non-zero it can be assumed, there is a region of non-linearity at lower loads. Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350650112444694">33</xref></sup> reported a two part linear relationship between normal force and friction force for viscoelastic contacts. However, the relationship at lower forces is not relevant when simulating high loading dynamic movements carried out in tennis play.

<p>For each surface tested the relationship (<italic>m</italic>) at which the traction force increases with normal force was higher with the Barricade 6.0 shoe.

The Barricade 6.0 shoe shows a trend for decreased dynamic traction with increased surface roughness. This is also true for the 4S shoe between surfaces A and D. However, with the 4S shoe, the traction increases with surface E. This may be due to an increase in the dominance of the abrasive wear friction component of the contributing friction mechanisms. With the 4S shoe, a decrease in the variation between the mean coefficients of traction, found under each loading condition as surface roughness increases, is observed. This suggests that the coefficient of traction is less dependent on normal force as roughness increases.

<p>It is an interesting result that as surface roughness increases there is trend for decreased traction. It might be expected that the hysteretic component of friction caused by the rubber deforming around the surfaces profiles would result in increased traction with increased roughness. Palasantzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112444694">20</xref></sup> concluded the contributing influence of hysteretic and adhesive friction mechanisms for rubber–surface sliding contact are dependent on surface roughness characteristics and sliding velocity. Palasantzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112444694">16</xref></sup> and Palasantzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112444694">20</xref></sup> show the adhesive component becomes increasingly dominant as a surface profile becomes less irregular at short-wavelength scales and sliding velocity increases. Palasantzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112444694">20</xref></sup> also notes that as the long-wavelength profile increases the contribution of the hysteretic friction component increases. However, Persson (1998) and Persson (2001) note if the applied load is not sufficiently high the rubber will not deform and interact at the bottom of the long-wavelength cavities, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1350650112444694">Figure 13</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112444694">21</xref></sup> This will have a reducing influence on asperity contact area (reducing adhesion). Therefore as R<sub>z</sub> ↑ and λ<sub>a</sub> ↑ a reduced number of adhesional junctions may be forming, explaining the decrease in traction observed in the results.
<fig id="fig13-1350650112444694" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>(a) The rubber surface is unable to interact at the bottom of the long-wavelength profile. (b) The smaller but increased number of silica sand particles reduces the profile wavelength and amplitude, increasing interaction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112444694-fig13.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>After testing at the 700 N normal load condition with the 4S shoe and loose debris had been brushed away, the surfaces were examined under a microscope. Evidence of rubber–surface contact within the short-wavelength profile at the bottom of the surface substrate was found to increase as surface roughness decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1350650112444694">Figure 14</xref>). The amount of rubber material that had adhered to the surface appeared to be dependent on surface roughness. Visually, this is less obvious for surface D as a darker surface paint was used for its coating so a clear image was not achieved. From the relationships presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112444694">Figure 10</xref>, plots of COT against normal force have been formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1350650112444694">Figure 15</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1350650112444694">Figure 15</xref> plots normal force against COT with power relationship best fit curves which can be described by the relationship COT = <italic>a</italic>(F<sub>N</sub>)<italic><sup>b</sup></italic> where <italic>a</italic> is an arbitrary constant and <italic>b</italic> is an arbitrary exponent. As surface roughness increases the exponent (<italic>b</italic>) decreases and the COT becomes less dependent on the normal force. As Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref></sup> notes adhesion plays an important role in rubber contacting hard surfaces with either long- and/or short-wavelength profiles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1350650112444694">Figure 15</xref> shows that, as surface roughness decreases the COT → ∞ as F<sub>N</sub> → 0 and as roughness increases there is a tendency for the COT to remain constant. Persson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref></sup> states such relationships are due to the influence of adhesion. At low loads the friction force due to adhesion will increase but at a lower rate than the normal force. Hence the COT is load dependent, and initially decreases with increased normal force. The COT becomes constant at high loads as the area of real contact increases proportionally with the normal force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112444694">19</xref></sup> As roughness increases the effect described is reduced because of a decrease in the influence of adhesion with increased surface roughness.

<sec id="sec8-1350650112444694" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>With the flat 4S rubber shoe outsole, the coefficient of traction becomes less dependent on normal force as roughness increases due to the reduced influence of adhesion. With the barricade 6.0 shoe for all surfaces and the 4S shoe between surfaces A and D, there is a trend for decreased COT with increased roughness as adhesion effects decrease due to a reduction in asperity contact. For the 4S shoe there is a transition between the rougher surfaces D and E at which the traction increases. This transition may be at which the hysteretic and abrasive wear friction mechanisms become dominate. The increase in traction observed with the 4S shoe (between surfaces D and E) was not observed with the Barricade 6.0 shoe. This may be due to the differences in contact area, rubber compound and/or tread pattern and warrants further investigation. A sudden increase in traction will have implications to a tennis player. During play a hard court tennis court may have differing regions of mean roughness characteristics on its surface. If a player has a required traction demand for a specific movement, but the surface has differing roughness characteristics, the player is likely to experience a change in their traction. This will affect the player’s performance and/or injury risk.</p>
<p>As surfaces which allow sliding have been found to reduce the risk of injury the findings suggest that, within the range of surface roughness tested in this study, the flat 4S shoe on surface D can be considered to be the shoe–surface combination with the lowest injury risk. Although results with the Barricade 6.0 shoe suggest a rougher surface will provide reduced resistance to sliding, the results from the 4S shoe suggest this trend may only be true up to a certain roughness. This has implications for new surface installations as different players are likely to wear a variety of footwear outsole treads. Ideally a surface will have a roughness which provides an optimum level of sliding resistance to the player. In this study surface D may be considered to be at an optimum roughness as it has least resistance to sliding with the flat shoe and a relatively low resistance to sliding with the Barricade 6.0 shoe. As a surface is continually used for tennis play it is likely to experience wear and a reduction in roughness as the surface materials deteriorate. The findings from this study show that a worn (less rough) surface is likely to provide a player with increased traction during a sliding event. Therefore it is likely that injury risk will increase with the life of a surface installation.</p>
