<abstract>
<p>Police intervention is a primary response to intimate partner violence (IPV) but does not guarantee a victim’s future safety. This study sought to identify factors associated with IPV survivors’ perceptions of safety and risk of revictimization following police intervention. One hundred sixty-four women completed a questionnaire, and 11 of those women also took part in qualitative interviews. The findings revealed that feeling unsafe and perceiving oneself to be at risk of future violence is associated with experiencing particular forms of IPV, including battering, lethality threats, and sexual violence. Having support from others and distance from the partner helps women feel safe.</p>

<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>As with other forms of violence, intimate partner violence (IPV) is a criminal act in the United States, and the primary societal response is arrest and prosecution. Criminal system intervention, however, does not guarantee a victim’s future safety. Unlike other violent crimes, IPV victimization is typically not a one-time event and, in many cases, a victim experiences multiple incidents of victimization from the same “offender” over time, sometimes even after an offender has been arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437016">Cattaneo &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437016">Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212437016">Sonis &amp; Langer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212437016">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212437016">Ventura &amp; Davis, 2005</xref>). Identifying individuals who are at risk of revictimization and understanding victims’ perceptions of risk of future violence may be important for informing interventions to protect future safety.</p>
<p>Numerous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212437016">Cattaneo, Bell, Goodman, &amp; Dutton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437016">Cattaneo &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212437016">Hilton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212437016">Weisz, Tolman, &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>) have found that female IPV victims’ assessment of risk is associated with actual subsequent victimization. Individual risk perception is important not only because it may be an accurate predictor of future victimization but also because perception of risk is associated with taking action toward protective or risk-avoidant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437016">Brewer et al., 2007</xref>). Although individuals are certainly not responsible for their own victimization, those who perceive themselves to be in danger may be able to take steps to decrease their risk of violence victimization if they are afforded adequate resources to do so.</p>
<p>Prior literature has identified some risk factors for revictimization. However, we know little about what factors are associated with women’s perceptions of risk, nor do we have much data about the differences between women who feel at risk and those who do not. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors associated with IPV survivors’ perceptions of safety and risk of future violence following police intervention for IPV.</p>

<title>Revictimization Risk Factors</title>
<p>In previous studies, women who reported that their partners controlled their freedom and independence, such as monitoring and restricting their activities, and who were jealous or suspicious about the women’s relationships, were more likely to experience ongoing repeat victimization than women who reported that their partners did not engage in such behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437016">Cattaneo &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437016">Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212437016">Sonis &amp; Langer, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437016">Robinson (2007)</xref> also found an association between women feeling “very frightened” of their partners’ violence and experience of repeat victimization. Having access to resources that facilitate independence and freedom, such as money, employment, and social support, however, is associated with less repeated violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437016">Bybee &amp; Sullivan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212437016">Goodman, Dutton, Vankos, &amp; Weinfurt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212437016">Perez &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings related to separation or relationship termination are mixed. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212437016">Sonis and Langer (2008)</xref> found that women who had left an abusive partner were at decreased risk of future violence, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437016">Robinson (2007)</xref> found that relationship separation was associated with an increase in repeat violence. Leaving the relationship does not guarantee safety and, in fact, may increase risk of further violence. For some women, the point of highest risk of violence is when they make known to their partners the decision to leave the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437016">Fleury, Sullivan, &amp; Bybee, 2000</xref>) and assaults may increase in severity after leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437016">Anderson &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>). Women who are victims of intimate partner homicide are more likely to have left the relationship and to be separated from the partner than to be still in the relationship at the time of their death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437016">Anderson &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212437016">Dobash, Dobash, Cavanagh, &amp; Medina-Ariza, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212437016">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). Leaving threatens the partner’s dominance, which may then lead to violence in an attempt to regain power, among those perpetrators for whom violence is related to an attempt to dominate and control the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437016">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212437016">Mahoney, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212437016">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, prior studies on risks for revictimization suggest that revictimization is associated with a particular form of IPV, referred to as <italic>battering</italic>. Battering is a pattern of violence used to gain coercive control over the victim; through violence and threats of violence, the batterer establishes dominance in the relationship and decreases the victim’s independence. Not all violence used against partners is battering. Violence used in anger, frustration, retaliation, or self-defense; that does not have coercive, fear-inducing, and threatening power over the victim, is nonbattering IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212437016">Dutton &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212437016">Smith, Thornton, DeVellis, Earp, &amp; Coker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212437016">Stark, 2007</xref>). Battering is measured not by individual assault incidents, but by the dynamic of the violence in the relationship—by measuring behaviors reflective of control and dominance, a perpetrator’s motive to control the victim, and/or the victim’s experience of being dominated and controlled through threats of violence.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077801212437016">
<title>Reporting to Police</title>
<p>Approximately one in four cases of physical IPV against women, and one in four cases of intimate partner rape, are reported to the police, either by the female victims themselves or by others (e.g., bystanders, children, doctors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212437016">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). The cases that reach police tend to be more severe than those that do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212437016">Akers &amp; Kaukinen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212437016">Bonomi, Holt, Martin, &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>) and, for many of these cases, involving the police has a deterrent effect on future violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437016">Felson, Ackerman, &amp; Gallagher, 2005</xref>). Police intervention may be necessary, but not sufficient, for arrest. When police intervene, they may or may not make an arrest; if they do make an arrest, they may arrest either partner, or both partners, depending on the evidence suggestive of criminal activity. Recent studies have found little to no relationship between arrest of the male partner and reassault (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437016">Felson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212437016">Hilton, Harris, &amp; Rice, 2007</xref>). This study focused on women who had experienced police intervention because they are likely to have endured severe and/or ongoing violence and because the police contact presents an opportunity to connect victims to a range of health and social services.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used a nonexperimental, cross-sectional design, employing both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A self-report questionnaire was the primary method of data collection; a subset of women who completed the questionnaire also took part in an in-depth qualitative interview.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077801212437016">
<title>Setting and Sample</title>
<p>Data collection for the study took place in Philadelphia, PA, a large city on the east coast of the United States, between September 2006 and June 2008. Participants included English-speaking adult (18 to 64) women who had experienced police response to an incident of violence between themselves and a current or former male intimate partner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077801212437016">
<title>Recruitment and Data Collection</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from a hospital emergency department (ED) as well as four organizations in Philadelphia that provide counseling and support to women who have experienced domestic violence. In the hospital, research assistants screened female adult patients for IPV and eligibility for this study (women having had the police called to respond to an incident of fighting or violence between themselves and a male partner). Patients who revealed a police call were then invited to participate in the study by completing the questionnaire during their ED visit. Participants who were interested in participating in an in-depth interview were referred to the principal investigator (first author). At the organizations, flyers and counselors informed clients about the study. Potential participants then arranged individual meetings with the study investigator.</p>
<p>Data collection took place in a private space at the hospital or organization from which the participant was recruited. Participants were provided with the option of reading and completing the questionnaire themselves or having the questions read to them. The principal investigator conducted all of the in-depth interviews, using a semistructured interview guide that asked the participant to elaborate on themes raised in the questionnaire through open-ended questions (e.g., “Can you tell me more about that?”). All participants provided oral informed consent before beginning the questionnaire or interview. To protect participant safety and confidentiality, we did not solicit or record any individual identifying information. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

<title>Key Variables and Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1077801212437016">
<title>Relationship Factors</title>
<p>Participants were asked to provide responses about a relationship with a current or former male intimate partner in which the police were called to respond to an incident of IPV. Relationship variables included status of the relationship (current/former), cohabitation, and whether the couple had children in common. Participants were also asked who in the couple, if anyone, was arrested as a result of police intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212437016">
<title>Violence Victimization and Perpetration</title>
<p>Violence in the relationship was measured in multiple ways. Physical and sexual assaults by either partner against the other were measured with questions from the short form of the Revised Conflict Tactics scales (CTS2S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212437016">Straus &amp; Douglas, 2004</xref>) that ask about specific behaviors (e.g., pushing, shoving, slapping, punching, insisting on or forcing sex).</p>
<p>Three variables that have been identified as highly associated with lethality risk—threats to kill, attempts to choke, and threats with a lethal weapon—were measured using the corresponding items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212437016">Campbell’s (1995)</xref> Danger Assessment (DA) scale. Participants were asked if their partners had ever used any of these behaviors against them to yield a dichotomous measure (yes/no).</p>
<p>The respondent’s subjective experience of battering—entrapment and disempowerment resulting from her partner’s behavior—was measured with the Women’s Experience with Battering Scale (WEB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212437016">Smith, Earp, &amp; DeVellis, 1995</xref>). The WEB has 10 statements reflective of the experience women have when battered (e.g., “I feel owned and controlled by him”; “I feel like he keeps me prisoner”; “He can scare me without laying a hand on me”). Based on recommendations from participants in a pilot test, we used a dichotomous scoring system (agree/disagree) in which agreement with two or more of the ten items indicates battering. The dichotomous scoring system corresponds well to the original version and has strong sensitivity (79.8%) and specificity (99.4%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437016">Coker et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801212437016">
<title>Resources and Social Support</title>
<p>Employment was used as a proxy of resource availability: access to income. Women were asked whether they were currently (at the time of data collection) employed in full- or part-time work for which they earned an income. Social support is a personal characteristic based on interpersonal relationships. Women’s social support was measured with two questions: Do you have someone you can . . . (a) stay with in an emergency? (b) borrow money from if needed? These questions were taken from the Social Support Network Scale developed as part of the Chicago Women’s Health Risk Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212437016">Block, 2000</xref>) and scored dichotomously (yes/no).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801212437016">
<title>Perceptions of Safety and Risk</title>
<p>Safety and risk are measured based on the women’s own perceptions with two close-ended questions: (a) How safe do you feel in terms of this relationship? That is, how safe do you feel around your partner/ex-partner currently? and (b) How likely do you think it is that your partner/ex-partner will use violence against you in the future? Participants responded on a 4-point Likert-type scale (<italic>very safe</italic> to <italic>very unsafe</italic> or <italic>very unlikely</italic> to <italic>very likely</italic>) and responses were collapsed to a dichotomous measure (<italic>safe</italic>/<italic>unlikely</italic> vs. <italic>unsafe</italic>/<italic>likely</italic>) to facilitate analysis. The questions were asked in reference to the partner or ex-partner with whom the women had the relationship in which the police were called. The two concepts—safety and risk—are related to, but distinct from, one another. Sense of safety is an emotion, possibly based on past trauma even in the absence of future risk. Risk perception, however, is a cognitive assessment that may or may not be related to feelings of safety.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="section13-1077801212437016">
<title>Quantitative Data</title>
<p>SPSS 16.0 was used to conduct statistical analyses of quantitative data. Crosstabs, along with the Pearson chi-square test of statistical significance, were used to measure association between each of the key independent variables and each of the outcome variables (feeling unsafe and feeling at risk). Binary logistic regression models were used to identify odds of each of the outcomes (feeling unsafe and feeling at risk), controlling for all other key variables in the model. To optimize model efficiency, only key variables that produced chi-square <italic>p</italic> values of &lt;. 25 at the bivariate level were included in the multivariate models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077801212437016">
<title>Qualitative Data</title>
<p>Qualitative data were analyzed using a technique of constant comparative analysis, based on grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212437016">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212437016">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). Grounded theory allows the theory to emerge from the data itself, rather than using the data to test preformed ideas. Constant comparative analysis is an iterative process of coding data, identifying themes, and comparing examples to refine the outcomes and understanding of the findings. Coding of interview transcripts was facilitated by a qualitative data software package, QSR NVIVO7.</p>

<sec id="section17-1077801212437016">
<title>Sample Description</title>
<p>One hundred seventy-three women participated in the study. There were missing data on the outcome measures (safety and risk) for nine of the questionnaire participants, and those participants were dropped from this analysis, leaving a sample size of 164. There were no statistically significant differences between those who had missing data on the outcome variables and those who did not, suggesting that the data were missing at random.</p>
<p>Three quarters of the participants were recruited from the hospital emergency department with the remaining recruited from community-based organizations. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 57, with a mean age of 32.49. The majority (78.1%) of the participants identified as Black or African American; 15.6% identified as White, and the remaining 6.3% identified as another or mixed race. More than a quarter (27.6%) of the participants had not finished high school; less than 10% (9.6%) graduated from college. The majority (80.5%) of the participants had children. There were no statistically significant differences on the outcome variables of feeling unsafe or at risk of future violence by recruitment site or by sociodemographic characteristics.</p>
<p>Univariate statistics for the key independent and the dependent variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437016">Table 1</xref>. About half (49.4%) of the participants said that they felt unsafe at the time of data collection, and about half (51.2%) said that they thought it was likely that their partners would use violence against them in the future (at risk). Although the distributions are nearly equal for these two variables, there is not exact overlap. Nearly one third (31.3%) of the women who reported feeling safe also said that they perceived themselves to be at risk of future violence; over one quarter (28.4%) of the women who feel unsafe said that they do not think that future violence from the partner is likely (not shown in table).</p>

<p>Most of the participants were no longer in a relationship with, and were not living with, their (ex)partner at the time of data collection; about half had children in common with the (ex)partner. For more than a third of the women, their partners had been arrested for violence used against them; nearly 15% of the women had, themselves, been arrested for IPV-related incidents. The overwhelming majority of the participants had experienced physical violence victimization, lethality threats, and battering; more than half had experienced sexual violence victimization. More than two thirds of the women reported using physical violence against their partners and nearly 12% reported sexual violence perpetration. About a third of the participants were employed in full- or part-time work at the time of data collection and more than three-quarters reported that they had social support in the form of someone from whom to borrow money or with whom to stay in an emergency.</p>

<title>Bivariate Associations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437016">Table 1</xref> presents the bivariate analyses for the two outcome variables. Of the relationship factors, only relationship status and current cohabitation were statistically significant at the level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 for the outcome of feeling unsafe. Women were more likely to feel unsafe if they were no longer in the relationship (former relationship) and if they were not currently living together. None of the relationship factors had any significant association with predictions of risk.</p>
<p>There were also no statistically significant associations between arrest and feeling unsafe or at risk. The breakdown between feeling safe or unsafe was evenly split between women whose partners were arrested versus not, and the same was true for women who themselves were arrested versus not. Just over half of the participants who were arrested, or whose partners were arrested, felt at risk of future victimization, compared with exactly half of those who were not arrested and just under half (46.1%) of those whose partners were arrested.</p>
<p>The significant differences between those who felt safe or unsafe, at risk or not, emerged with the predictor variables of violence victimization. Having experienced physical or sexual violence victimization was significantly associated with feeling unsafe, with more than half of those who experienced such victimization feeling unsafe verses less than a third of those who did not experience such victimization. Also, more than half of those who experienced battering or lethality threats felt unsafe, significantly more than those who did not have these experiences. The results were essentially the same for feeling unsafe and for perceiving oneself to be at risk for future violence.</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant associations between women’s use of violence (perpetration) and feeling unsafe or perception of risk. The breakdown between feeling safe or unsafe, and at risk or not, for those participants who reported using physical violence was nearly even. Feeling unsafe or at risk was also not associated with the women’s employment status. Women who reported having social support were less likely to feel at risk than those who reported not having social support. There was no statistically significant association between social support and feeling unsafe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077801212437016">
<title>Multivariate Associations</title>
<p>The multivariate models included only those variables that produced chi-square <italic>p</italic> values of &lt;. 25 at the bivariate level. Based on this criterion, the following variables were deleted from both models: children in common, participant arrested, perpetration of physical violence, and participant employment status. In addition, partner arrested and perpetration of sexual violence were deleted from the regression model for predictors of feeling unsafe. Relationship status and current cohabitation were deleted from the model for predictors of feeling at risk of future violence. When tested in the multivariate models, the excluded variables were not significant predictors of the outcomes.</p>
<p>The multivariate regression results for feeling unsafe are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212437016">Table 2</xref>. When controlling for all other key independent variables, only battering emerged as a statistically significant predictor of feeling unsafe. Women who had experienced battering were more than four times as likely as those who did not to report feeling unsafe. A number of variables that were significant at the bivariate level (relationship status, cohabitation, physical violence victimization, and lethality threats) were no longer significant when adjusting for other key independent variables.</p>

<p>The multivariate regression results for perceiving oneself to be at risk of future violence are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212437016">Table 3</xref>. When controlling for the other key variables, sexual violence victimization, lethality threats, and sexual violence perpetration all emerged as significant predictors of feeling at risk. Women who had experienced sexual victimization were more than twice as likely as women who had not to feel at risk. Women who had experienced lethality threats were more than three times as likely as women who had not to feel at risk. In addition, women who had perpetrated sexual violence were significantly less likely to feel at risk. Physical violence victimization, battering, and lack of social support were all significant predictors of feeling at risk at the bivariate level but not in the multivariate regression model. Perpetration of sexual violence did not reach a level of statistical significance in the bivariate analysis but did emerge as significant in the multivariate model with those reporting perpetration of sexual violence less likely to perceive themselves to be at risk of future violence victimization.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sexual violence variable is composed of two behavioral measures (insisting on sex and forcing sex) and that the distribution between these two differs for men and women. Nearly two thirds (66%) of the women who reported sexual violence victimization reported that their partners “used force to make [her] have sex” (not shown in the table). In comparison, only 20% of the women who reported perpetrating sexual violence said that they “used force to make [her partner] have sex”; 80% of the women who reported sexual violence perpetration reported “insisting on sex, or sex without a condom” but not forcing sex.</p>
<p>In sum, these findings reflect that women’s perceptions of being unsafe and at risk are associated with the women’s experiences of particular forms of violence—battering, lethality threats, and sexual violence—and not with their own characteristics or police arrest actions. These forms of violence seem to have particular meanings for women, and the meanings may be influenced by their co-occurrence.</p>
<p>When controlling for other relevant variables, battering predicted feeling <italic>unsafe</italic> but was not associated with feeling <italic>at risk</italic>, indicating that, in the absence of lethality threats and/or sexual violence, battering alone does not have the same effect of threatening future assault. Lethality threats dropped out as a significant predictor of feeling <italic>unsafe</italic> in the multivariate models, suggesting that threats of lethality alone, without battering or sexual victimization, may not cause someone to feel unsafe. For example, a “threat to kill” may feel relatively insincere—uttered in frustration, anger, or even as a benign taunt—from someone who is not also engaging in behavior that causes the victim to feel trapped, controlled, dominated, and/or humiliated. Of course, threats to kill should not be easily dismissed. However, the larger context of the relationship within which the threat is presented likely impacts the meaning and impact of the threat for the victim. The qualitative findings, presented below, substantiate and help to provide a richer context to better understand the quantitative findings.</p>

<title>Sample Description</title>
<p>The age range for the 11 in-depth interview participants was 21 to 54 years, with a mean of 39.8; higher than that of the full sample. Participants who self-identified as White were overrepresented in the interview sample (63.6%); Black/African American participants were underrepresented (36.4%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1077801212437016">
<title>Themes: Safety and Risk</title>
<p>Despite conceptual differences and lack of complete overlap between those who felt unsafe and those who felt at risk, analysis of the qualitative interviews revealed that the participants perceived safety and risk as companion concepts, along a single continuum. Findings from the qualitative data, therefore, are presented together for both concepts. Three primary themes—(a) lethality, (b) separation and distance, and (c) social support and protection—emerged from the qualitative data regarding participants’ feelings of danger and vulnerability to, or protection from, future violence. Each of these themes is described in more detail below, with excerpts from the transcripts illustrating each theme.</p>
<sec id="section23-1077801212437016">
<title>Lethality</title>
<p>Validating the meaningfulness of lethality threats found in the quantitative analysis, when asked about what kinds of things made them feel unsafe, interview participants spoke about what they perceived to be credible threats against their lives. From the interviews, we understand that women’s individual experiences with their partners inform their perceptions of credibility of lethality threats. Women talked about being fearful not of being “hurt” but of being “killed.” They had learned how to manage and survive often severe, but nonlethal, violence. What they feared and had not experienced was death. The risk of death was prominent in the women’s thinking as they prepared to try to escape from their partners to protect themselves and others.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At that point he knew I was trying to leave, and I just remember thinking, he could really kill me. (Erica)</p>
<p>One of these days he was going to kill me and my kids. (Justine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In general, participants did not refer to methods of killing; they did not mention guns or weapons. One participant referred to “choking.” Choking is used to cause death by cutting off airflow to the brain (strangulation). An act of choking that stops short of killing can be perceived as a symbolic act that indicates a threat of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212437016">McClane, Strack, &amp; Hawley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One reason I don’t feel safe is because he threatened my life, and I know what he’s capable of doing. . . . At any point when this man was hitting me and choking me and started choking me unconsciously, I could have died. I could have died. I don’t feel safe. . . . I’m still afraid because he threatened my life. And, you know, when you’ve been attacked and abused by someone for so long and you know their background and their history, you just never know. (Tania)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This woman recognized that the choking could have been lethal and considered the act to be a threat against her life. Her experience in the relationship led her to believe that her partner was “capable” of killing her and that his behavior was unpredictable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1077801212437016">
<title>Separation and distance</title>
<p>Some women felt that being away from the partner—physically and geographically separated—helped, or would help, them to feel safer and protected from future assaults. None of the interview participants was living with her partner at the time of the interview. The women did not feel that their partners would spontaneously stop using violence if they continued to live together or remain in the same area. Hillary, for example, felt that she was safe from future violence because she avoided being near her partner:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m not around him; I don’t let him come around me. He knows where I live but I’m never there and he lives in another county.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Felicia felt that she was able to avoid future violence by avoiding her partner and not returning to the relationship:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He’ll never get the chance [to hurt me again]. I went back before, I bought into it but that will not happen any more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of women spoke about being in a different state from their partner as being protective; for these women, greater physical distance felt important to their sense of safety.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I feel safe because he left [for] another state. Safer is living in my own house instead of living with him, to be away from his family. (Carol)</p>
<p>I don’t know whatever is going to make me feel safer again. I say leaving the state. (Daphnie)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Erica considered moving out of the state, with the support of friends and family, to be life saving:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Had I not the family and friends I had, had I not moved out of [the state], that would have been the death of me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote speaks to all three of the themes from the qualitative analysis—threat of death, separation and distance, and social support. If she did not move far away from her partner, she presumed that he would have killed her. She believed that it was the support of family and friends that helped her move away from him and, thus, be protected from being killed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1077801212437016">
<title>Social support and protection</title>
<p>Whereas being away from the partner and living independently helped some women feel safer, women also spoke about the critical importance of informal social networks—through friends, family, or acquaintances—in providing protection and safety. Carol said, “I don’t feel safe because I live alone”; she was not living with an abusive partner, but she felt vulnerable because she was also isolated from anyone else who could help her in a time of need. In contrast, Georgia felt more secure because she had a network of people watching out for her:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The things that make me safe is because the apartment building that I live in now, the manager . . . she told me that, you know, if she saw anybody suspicious walking around or in the building, or if anybody asks about me and she’s not sure who they were, she would let me know, and she would just call the police. She has me on the fourth floor. And she has a brother-in-law on the same floor and a sister on the same floor. So they look after me. I feel pretty safe, yeah; so she always asks me how I’ve been, how are things going. Yeah, so she looks after me and takes pretty much care of me upstairs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Georgia, the informal support (from apartment manager/neighbors) felt important but the formal institution (police) was also a source of potential support—one of the ways in which informal support systems could be helpful was by reaching out to the formal support system.</p>
<p>Felicia felt safer through “becoming stronger and more confident.” Social support and support programs like alcoholics anonymous, and a supportive faith community helped her gain strength and confidence. Working toward financial independence and independent housing, with the assistance of social service programs, also helped her feel safer through gaining freedom from dependency on others.</p>
<p>Women spoke of lack of support from formal institutions, including governmental and religious entities, for protecting them from violent partners. They felt that they could not get help where they would typically seek such assistance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The state can’t really protect me. No protection order can protect me. He’s [in law enforcement] so [he] can go anywhere he wants and no one can tell me that they can’t go into their computers and find where I’m located at. The thing is they can get away with it. (Daphnie)</p>
<p>Another reason [I don’t feel safe] is because the leadership in the mosque don’t respect the fact that they know this man to have a history of violence. (Tania)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women recognized that particular institutions exist within society to provide support and protection and felt particularly vulnerable when they felt that they had to “fend for” themselves because such institutional support was not available to them. The systems were inadequate or dysfunctional in meeting their needs. If an abusive partner is a member of the law enforcement system, or enjoys privilege and immunity from that system, the victim loses this system as a resource. Other institutions, such as religious congregations, or places of employment, may not be designed to provide protection but may, because of their relationship with the individual, be expected to be a source of informal or formal support. Women felt more protected when these institutions could serve as a source of support and less so when they failed to be supportive.</p>
<p>Threat of consequences from the criminal legal system did help some women feel that they were protected; they felt that the criminal legal system intervention would serve as a deterrent against future violence. Georgia explained why she felt it was unlikely that he would use violence against her in the future:</p>
<p>After I called the cops and everything, I don’t think he would do anything else. Another participant said that she felt safe because she had an order of protection and did not think that her partner would “risk going to jail” for violating the order. For these women, the system worked to protect them. However, the extent to which they would be protected depended on the interaction with the perpetrator; in these cases, the women felt that the threat of criminal sanction would deter the perpetrator. Other perpetrators, however, might not be so deterred.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The findings from this study should be considered in light of methodological limitations. The data collection relied on self-report of sensitive topics and participation was voluntary, allowing for possible self-selection bias around participation and reporting. In addition, some of the measures are retrospective and participants’ memories may not have been entirely complete. A potentially confounding variable that we did not measure is length of time between the police-reported incident or the violence in the relationship, and the point of data collection. This study gathers information from the participant solely and does not attempt to validate the data through other sources. The goal of this study, however, was to understand the experience from the woman’s point of view rather than attempt to capture objective “fact.”</p>
<p>This is a cross-sectional study, surveying respondents at a single point in time. Temporal ordering or causal processes, therefore, cannot be verified. There is no follow-up to assess the true future impact of events or later use of, or victimization by, violence. Without a longitudinal design, however, anonymity and confidentiality is more clearly maintained, and participant attrition is not a problem.</p>
<p>As this study employs nonprobability sampling methodology, the degree of sampling error is unknown and the sample cannot be confidently generalized to other populations or places. This study does not allow for comparison to groups of men, to those in same-sex relationships, or to those who have not experienced police intervention IPV. Furthermore, all of the participants were receiving IPV-related services from community organization or care (not necessarily IPV-related) from a hospital emergency department. Previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212437016">Howarth, Stimpson, Barran, &amp; Robinson, 2009</xref>) have demonstrated that receipt of IPV-related advocacy and support services is associated with victims’ perception of increased safety and decreased risk. In this study, we do not know the extent of services that the victims have received and the extent to which those services have impacted the victims’ sense of safety or risk.</p>

<title>Context and Meaning of Partner’s Violence</title>
<p>The findings support perspectives that highlight the significance of context (meaning, motivation, and impact) in assessing IPV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212437016">Dasgupta, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212437016">Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212437016">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212437016">Stark, 2007</xref>). It is not the violence itself that causes women to feel in danger, but rather the meaning of the violence and the context in which the violence occurs with battering, lethality threats, and sexual violence holding particular meaning.</p>
<p>Battering is the offender’s attempt to gain and maintain power and control over the partner through ongoing violence and/or threats of violence and is distinct from individual assaults. Lethality threats may be fueled by a fear of loss of control over the partner and can be used as mechanisms of gaining control over the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437016">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212437016">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). Men who are possessive over their female partners are more likely than those who are not to kill their partners, and it is when female partners leave or attempt to leave relationships with possessive males that they are at greatest risk of being killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212437016">Dobash et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212437016">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). Killing is the ultimate form of power and control over another’s life.</p>
<p>Sexual violence may be especially degrading and humiliating for the victim, thus having particular coercive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212437016">Gelles, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212437016">Shields &amp; Hanneke, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212437016">Harding and Helweg-Larsen (2009)</xref> found that “severe sexual coercion” (measured as forced sex through physical or verbal means), but not physical assault, injury, or psychological violence, was associated with women perceiving themselves at greater risk of future violence from their partners. These authors offered two possible interpretations of these findings: (a) “that sexual coercion is a more psychologically salient form of abuse that increases victims’ responses to cues of danger,” and (b) “that certain types of batterers may be more likely to utilize sexually coercive forms of violence perpetration and women may (accurately) perceive these batterers as more dangerous” (p. 83). The impact of sexual assault, therefore, may be about the type of violence or about the type of person who uses that type of violence.</p>
<p>Although Stith and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212437016">Stith, Smith, Penn, Ward, &amp; Tritt, 2004</xref>) found that a woman’s use of violence predicted her victimization, in this study perpetration of violence was not associated with women feeling unsafe or at risk for further violence, with one important exception: in the multivariate analysis, women’s reports of perpetrating sexual violence were associated with their feeling less at risk of future assault. Perpetration of sexual violence, in the form of coercion or force, has been described as a form of control-taking with the perpetrator establishing power over the victim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212437016">Brownmiller, 1975</xref>). It may be, then, that women who perpetrate sexual violence feel more power in the relationship and, thus, less vulnerability to future assault. They may feel that their use of sexual coercion has deterred their partners from using violence against them in the future.</p>
<p>In the qualitative interviews, women were not specifically prompted to talk about sexual violence in particular. That sexual violence did not emerge as a salient topic in the qualitative interviews likely reflects the discomfort that women have in talking about this particularly sensitive and shaming form of violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1077801212437016">
<title>Separation, Distance, and Support</title>
<p>Separation from the relationship may affect the woman’s perceptions of safety in multiple ways. Although living together and being in a current relationship may allow for increased access and time together, potentially increasing opportunity for violence, not being together may be viewed as a threat to the partner’s dominance and could stimulate some partners’ drives toward violence as a mechanism for control. By staying with the partner, women avoid the risks associated with leaving. Being together may allow a woman to monitor her partner’s moods and behaviors, to notice triggers for violence, and perhaps to escape or minimize assaults with survival strategies such as placating or hiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212437016">Campbell, Rose, Kub, &amp; Nedd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212437016">Langford, 1996</xref>). Women currently in a relationship with an abusive partner may, alternatively, minimize the abuse as part of a coping mechanism, or may have learned to not trust their own instincts and perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212437016">Campbell, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that being away from the partner does not necessarily mean that a woman is safe from future violence. And the fact that a woman remains with a partner does not necessarily mean that she feels—or is—safe. Women face numerous barriers to leaving an abusive partner, ranging from fear of increased violence to lack of economic or social resources, concern for children, sense of moral obligation, or love for the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437016">Anderson &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As emphasized in the qualitative interviews, once out of the relationship, having physical distance from the (ex)partner and an informal social support network are critical to women’s sense of security. Sources of informal (social) support, including family members, friends, acquaintances, and neighbors, may be able to intervene to help protect a woman if and when a partner attempts to use violence against her. Without such support, women are more vulnerable to further violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437016">Bybee &amp; Sullivan, 2005</xref>). Having informal support would not necessarily prevent the partner from attempting to use violence in the future, but could help to prevent him from being successful in doing so.</p>
<p>One way that informal support networks can be helpful is by soliciting intervention from formal support systems, such as the police. Although some of the women in this study felt that the threat of police sanctioning would deter their partners from using violence in the future, other women said that the lack of accountability from formal institutions (including the criminal legal system and religious institutions) contributed to their feeling less safe and less protected. In general, for this group of women who had all had police involvement in their IPV cases, the existence and function of formal institutions did not play a substantial role in their feeling safe. Lack of assistance from formal support systems not only fails to protect a victim but could exacerbate her risk by removing a deterrent; if the partner learns or perceives that he will not be held accountable, he may be more likely to proceed with violence than if he thought he would be subject to formal sanction.</p>

<sec id="section30-1077801212437016">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>This study reinforces the need to treat IPV as a multifaceted phenomenon in our theoretical, empirical, and practical approaches and identifies factors to consider when assessing individual women’s safety risks and service needs. In addition to asking about women’s feelings of safety and perception of their risk of future victimization, we should identify the form, context, and meaning of the violence from the victim’s perspective in order to match women with effective interventions.</p>
<p>If the violence experienced reflects what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212437016">Johnson (2008)</xref> refers to as <italic>situational couple violence</italic>—violence that starts within the context of a conflict in the relationship and escalates to aggressive tactics—interventions that help the couple stay together and be nonviolent (e.g., anger management, couples counseling) or to end the relationship, may be appropriate. Coercive controlling violence, or intimate terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212437016">Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212437016">Stark, 2007</xref>), however, carries different risks and calls for different interventions. In such cases, where there is an imbalance of power in the relationship, and violence is used manipulatively, couples counseling, for example, would not likely be effective and might be counterproductive. In addition, relationship breakup may carry risks of further violence, particularly if the victim initiates separation, and safeguards may be needed to protect the victim during such a time of vulnerability.</p>
<p>In developing safety plans with victims who feel at risk, we need to focus on strengthening an individual’s informal support network and ability to have significant geographical distance from the (ex)partner. At the same time, we should seek to improve the responses to IPV within community-based formal support systems.</p>
<p>In research and theory development, we need to tease out the various forms of violence and pay particular attention to sexual violence, lethality threats, and battering. In addition to carrying special meaning, these are forms of violence in which we see the most gender disparities with women being far more likely than men to be victims of such violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212437016">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212437016">Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212437016">Rennison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212437016">Robinson &amp; Rowlands, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212437016">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). When assessing the extent to which victimization and perpetration differs (or not) between males and females, excluding these forms of violence leaves us with an incomplete understanding of IPV. Practitioners, including criminal legal system and health care personnel, should also ask about particular forms of violence (including sexual violence and lethality threats) when conducting screening, assessments, or intervention with possible “perpetrators” or “victims” as there may be implications for treatment and safety planning. There may be different risks associated with having experienced these forms of violence, both for future safety and for the individual’s treatment outcomes.</p>
