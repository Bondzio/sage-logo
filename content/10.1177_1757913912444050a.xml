<p>Experts seem increasingly to be at variance over the cause, effect and implications of climate change and so it is no surprise that lay people end up confused to the point that they switch off. Historic records reveal that climate change is nothing new. Reliable documentation tells us that extremes of temperature have changed in many areas. Some have become hotter, whilst some colder. This has influenced lifestyles. It has concentrated populations in some areas, sparsified others.</p>
<p>So what is new? It is probably the rate at which the change is taking place. However that itself is open to debate. We can argue that climate change is the product (or penalty) of man’s ingenuity. Man’s inventiveness has upset the balance of nature by creating hot spots of heat (look at China’s green gas emissions for example) which has a direct bearing on the environment and that in turn on us all. But is it all cyclical? It’s all happened before and on a regular basis; the only difference is that man is better able to respond and cope with the changes now than in the past. Yet the scale of today’s industry poses an influence (sometimes a threat) never before experienced.</p>
<p>Climate change is a battleground for diverse opinion. It has spawned a whole new range of expressions, for example Global Change Vulnerability Assessment (GCVA) and Intergenerational Justice (IJ). Scientists of every persuasion continue to argue their case. Many well established champions find themselves defending their corners as they come increasingly under attack. Latterly the politicians have weighed in bringing with them economists and sociologists.</p>
<p>This Oxford Handbook poses as many questions as it answers; as it should. It draws upon the knowledge of a range of contributing international experts and each chapter addresses important elements of the climate change debate. This book is written in easy to understand language, which makes it easy to read. The book can act as a study into the implications of climate change and also as a guide for those who can influence climate change in the future.</p>
<p>This is a valuable contribution to an emotive debate and topic. The 700 plus page to me should not be too off putting at first glance for it is all very conveniently broken into easily digestible chapters. Having worked my way through the chapters, I feel that it would have helped the tired eye if some complementary photographs and maybe other illustrations/graphs were included. Otherwise an important contribution to a subject that increasingly demands our attention and one which we ignore at our peril.</p>
