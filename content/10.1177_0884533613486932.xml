<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success rate, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of blind bedside placement of postpyloric feeding tubes by registered dietitians. Feeding tubes placed by a physician using fluoroscopy were used to benchmark certain study parameters. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Patients who underwent postpyloric feeding tube insertion between June 1, 2007, and May 31, 2011, were included in the study. Medical charts were reviewed for the time span between physician order and procedure documentation, bedside feeding tube tip location, number of radiographic images to confirm placement of tubes placed at the bedside, physician clearance to use the feeding tube when applicable, and reported complications. Patient charges for each procedure were also compared. <italic>Results</italic>: Data were collected on 729 patient encounters, with 285 encounters per study group and 159 encounters excluded for incomplete documentation. The average time span to bedside procedure completion was 3.7 hours compared with an average of 4.2 hours for insertion using fluoroscopy. Dietitians achieved postpyloric access 73% of the time, and an additional 16.8% of bedside tubes were deemed appropriate for use for gastric feeding. The majority of bedside insertion encounters required 1 abdominal radiograph to confirm placement, and no reported complications were associated with either technique. A 66% reduction in patient charges was associated with bedside tube insertion. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Based on this sample, blind bedside postpyloric feeding tube insertion by registered dietitians may be a safe, cost-effective method for achieving short-term feeding tube access in the hospitalized patient.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Postpyloric feeding tubes are enteral access devices often used to provide enteral nutrition (EN), water, and medications to patients unable to consume adequate oral intake. Patients who are intolerant of gastric feedings or at an increased risk for aspiration of gastric contents may benefit from postpyloric feeding tube insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613486932">1</xref></sup> At our facility, the procedure was traditionally performed by a physician (radiologist) using real-time imaging of structures (fluoroscopy) but, since 2006, has been offered by trained registered dietitians and intensive care unit (ICU) registered nurses who place tubes at the bedside and confirm placement with an abdominal radiograph prior to use. The registered dietitians and ICU registered nurses coordinate care to ensure feeding tubes are placed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Although the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have included the placement of enteral feeding tubes within the scope of practice for advanced-level registered dietitians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613486932">2</xref></sup> there is much controversy regarding the safety and effectiveness of this practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613486932">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613486932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613486932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613486932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613486932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613486932"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613486932">10</xref></sup> Recent publications have cited inadvertent lung intubation as a major complication of blind tube insertion in adults, with as high as 2.1% of tubes inserted into the lung.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486932">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613486932">9</xref></sup> Efficacy of insertion is another area of concern, with the percentage of tubes successfully placed in the small intestine ranging from 60%–100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613486932">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613486932"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486932">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613486932">11</xref></sup> Adverse events associated with the procedure, proper device positioning, and financial cost should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of blind bedside postpyloric feeding tube insertion.</p>

<sec id="section2-0884533613486932" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of blind bedside insertion of postpyloric feeding tubes by registered dietitians compared with feeding tubes placed by a physician using fluoroscopy. Institutional review board approval, which included a waiver of informed consent and provisions to meet the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was obtained from the Springfield Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects prior to data collection.</p>
<p>All patients who underwent postpyloric feeding tube insertion by a registered dietitian at the bedside between June 1, 2007, and May 31, 2011, were included in this study. Data were collected retrospectively on 444 patient encounters, with 159 patient encounters being excluded for incomplete documentation. Cases were then matched based on insertion date at a 1:1 ratio by the principal investigator with patients who underwent postpyloric feeding tube insertion by a physician using fluoroscopy during the same time frame (n = 285) for a total of 570 patient encounters.</p>
<p>Feeding tubes inserted by registered dietitians who have demonstrated competency at the facility were done so at the bedside using a 43-inch or 55-inch nonweighted 10 French feeding tube with stylet using a modified 10-10-10 method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613486932">1</xref></sup> According to hospital policy, a registered dietitian or ICU registered nurse may demonstrate competency by successfully placing 3 feeding tubes into the postpyloric position, or small bowel, under the observation of a registered dietitian or ICU registered nurse who has already demonstrated competency. He or she must then successfully place 6 feeding tubes into the small bowel each year to maintain competency. During the study period, 6 registered dietitians, all of whom were included in the data collection, actively placed feeding tubes, with individual success rates ranging from 65%–91%, with success defined as the percentage of feeding tubes placed with the tip in the postpyloric position.</p>
<p>The policy for bedside postpyloric feeding tube insertion was approved by the facility’s Medical Executive Committee prior to the study data collection period. The intent of this procedure is to nasally insert a nonweighted feeding tube with stylet and advance it into the postpyloric position. Current practice at our facility is to review the medical record to identify any contraindications to the procedure such as nasal fracture or epitaxis. Care is then coordinated with nursing staff as well as respiratory staff, when appropriate, prior to beginning the procedure. Once the procedure is completed, an abdominal radiograph is ordered to confirm placement. If the tip of the feeding tube resides in the stomach and cannot be advanced, the ordering physician is notified. An order is then obtained to either use the feeding tube with the tip in the stomach or for a physician to advance the feeding tube using fluoroscopy.</p>
<p>For the bedside group, information was collected on feeding tube tip location per radiograph report, physician clearance to use the feeding tube if the tip was in the stomach, and the number of radiographic images required to confirm placement of tubes placed at the bedside. Study group comparison included time span between the time the physician order for feeding tube insertion was written and the time the procedure was documented in the medical record, as well as reported complications related to the procedure. Encounters with incomplete information were excluded from the study. Patient charges associated with each procedure were obtained from the medical center as well as the corresponding physician service.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was completed using SAS software (SAS v9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) by performing a χ<sup>2</sup> test of independence and the Fisher exact test. Significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> value ≤.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Successful blind postpyloric feeding tube placement was achieved by registered dietitians 73.0% (n = 208) of the time. An additional 16.8% (n = 48) of feeding tubes placed at the bedside were confirmed in the stomach and deemed acceptable for use by the referring physician. The remaining 10.9% (n = 29) of bedside tubes were confirmed in the stomach but not approved for use by the referring physician (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533613486932">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of bedside procedures (n = 239, 83.9%) required 1 abdominal radiograph to confirm tube placement. The remaining bedside procedures required 2 or 3 abdominal radiographs to confirm tube placement (n = 43 [15.1%] and n = 3 [1.1%], respectively), with tube repositioning performed by the registered dietitian before each additional abdominal radiograph (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533613486932">Table 1</xref>). In comparing bedside feeding tube insertion by registered dietitians with tubes placed by a physician using fluoroscopy, no reported complications related to either insertion technique were identified. Time span between procedure order and feeding tube insertion was statistically similar in the registered dietitian group compared with the physician group, with the mean length of time at 3.7 hours vs 4.2 hours, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533613486932">Figure 2</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .4182).</p>

<p>A notable difference between groups was patient charges associated with each procedure, with a 66% reduction in patient charges associated with bedside tube insertion. Patient charges for each group included feeding tube, insertion supplies, radiographic imaging, physician services, and hospital staff charges. At our facility, there is no procedure charge for the registered dietitian’s time to insert the feeding tube. Although registered dietitian time to place bedside feeding tubes is of value, actual cost data were not collected.</p>

<sec id="section4-0884533613486932" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report of 570 feeding tubes inserted over a 4-year historical time span, registered dietitians were able to achieve postpyloric feeding tube access 73% of the time. Success in achieving postpyloric access at the bedside is similar to the findings of Gray et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613486932">4</xref></sup> who reported a 63% success rate using a blind technique and a 73% success rate using electromagnetic guidance. Interestingly, in this study, when tubes placed into the stomach and deemed appropriate for use by the ordering physician are included, nearly 90% of bedside procedures were successful. This is likely because, in practice, postpyloric feeding tubes are sometimes ordered when the physician simply desires a smaller bore feeding tube. At our facility, the typical nasogastric feeding tube size is 16 French to allow for gastric suction, if indicated, whereas the postpyloric feeding tube inserted at the bedside is a 10 French tube.</p>
<p>In addition to tube usability, timeliness of tube placement and the amount of radiographic exposure required are also of interest. Registered dietitians, on average, were able to complete the procedure in less than 4 hours after the order was written and confirm the feeding tube insertion with 1 radiographic image. This means the potential for timely delivery of medications, enteral fluids, and, of course, nutrition therapy.</p>
<p>A potential for reduced patient charges was also illustrated with this study. A 66% reduction in patient charges was associated with bedside tube insertion. More important, zero reported complications were associated with the blind bedside procedure, which is an improvement over the 0.25%–4% of tubes noted by Krenitsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613486932">8</xref></sup> to enter the airway undetected.</p>
<p>However, this study does have some limitations. Given the retrospective nature of data collection, 159 encounters (21.8%) had to be eliminated due to missing documentation. Second, since data were collected prior to the introduction of an electronic medical record, the time span between physician order for tube insertion and procedure documentation may have been skewed if the practitioner was delayed in documenting the procedure. In addition, minor complications related to the procedure, such as epitaxis or patient discomfort, may not have been documented within the medical record and therefore not identified by this study. Last, attempts at bedside tube insertion prior to placement using fluoroscopy were not recorded in the data collection. Patients who underwent a bedside procedure prior to placement by a physician using fluoroscopy would incur charges for both procedures, and this information was not captured by the study cost comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0884533613486932" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Acknowledging the aforementioned study findings and limitations, we believe blind bedside postpyloric feeding tube insertion by registered dietitians may be a safe, cost-effective method for achieving short-term feeding tube access in the hospitalized patient.</p>
