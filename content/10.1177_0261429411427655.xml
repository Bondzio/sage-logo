<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Does a real-time, two-way, mobile, remote webcasting system have special properties for learning compared with traditional distance learning platforms? ‘Interactive Expeditions: A South Africa Cultural Transect’ was a pilot project at the University of Central Florida (UCF) that sought to answer this question during the Fall 2010 semester. The primary technological objective of this project was to offer a transformational means of experiential teaching and learning through a real-time, interactive media platform that enables geographically remote research teams to produce on-the-fly educational webcasts while any web-connected student can participate worldwide. The pedagogical objective was to discover effective ways for these distributed learners to actively participate in authentic field research. The Interactive Expeditions (INTX) synchronous learning environment was piloted with two different, but related, undergraduate college courses: ‘African Humanities’ and ‘African Societies and Cultures’. Lastly, we undertook a program evaluation to determine whether or not the unique interaction capabilities provided by the INTX media platform has added impact on student learning and engagement outcomes.</p>
<p>The term ‘Cultural Transect’, which we define as a method for recording and observing occurrences of cultural phenomena through regions and across borders of contemporary cultural systems around the world, crystallized the confluence of the two UCF courses. Examples of interactive sessions that the enrolled students experienced along the transect included demonstrations and interviews with artists, dancers, musicians, poets, actors, and filmmakers. Performing exploratory research in tandem with a real-time online learning environment integrated the academic disciplines of digital media, humanities, philosophy, and cultural anthropology. Eight interactive webcasts occurred during the final four weeks of the semester. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261429411427655">Figure 1</xref> highlights several of the areas we focused on along our route.</p>

</fig>
<p>We believe that this interactive cultural transect model has changed how students learn and instructors teach, in the way that it augmented the traditional classroom by providing experiential access and interaction with authentic data, content, people, and real-world contexts. The model combined the strengths of all these modes of teaching and altered the paradigm by providing the opportunity for students to have direct contact with cultures they are learning about. Groups of online students formed research teams in which they learned the basics of a course while at the same time contributed to in-field research with their comments and questions. As this is a new mode of delivery it is creating new avenues of pedagogical research.</p>
<p>We join a long line of learning theorists since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411427655">Dewey (1938)</xref> who argued for the importance of providing education where students are involved in authentic or real-world experiences in which they engage in dialogue, take action, and reflect on the possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411427655">Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427655">Rogers, 1969</xref>). Experiential learning theory defines learning as the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411427655">Kolb, 1984</xref>). Further, by providing this unique virtual-abroad opportunity to motivated, <italic>place-bound students</italic> – who could not typically travel on this type of extended, immersive experience owing to cost, travel, or family obligations – they were able to participate in our interactive interviews, workshops, and lectures hosted by UCF professors, along with local scholars and citizens who became members of the field research team, as they transected South Africa.</p>
<p>A brief history of how we developed this initiative is informative. In 2007, the INTX project at UCF began research and development on this new pedagogical model and succeeded in its maiden voyage to the deserts of the American Southwest for an online course titled ‘Cowboys with Cameras’, which was based on the history of the Western film genre. In this first iteration, while students were viewing the live video feed, they were limited to participating via text-based inputs to an online conversation queue. The next iteration commenced during the summer of 2008, which enabled full two-way audio and video between in-field teacher and a single classroom venue. For this expedition, INTX partnered with the Cambrian Foundation to deliver interactive marine biology education direct from the underwater caves of Bermuda to groups of students at Science Center venues in Orlando and Texas. Most recently, in summer 2009, INTX partnered with UCF’s Department of Biology and delivered a transect dedicated to the study of botany, which included real-time, remote webcasts from Delhi to Rishikesh, India, over a two-week period. This India-based iteration of the technology allowed any web-connected student worldwide to transmit video-enhanced questions and comments into the conversation queue, using their own webcam and microphone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261429411427655">Figure 2</xref>, a web browser screenshot, shows the media portal through which the students interacted with the botanist during the India transect.</p>

</fig>
<p>The dominant aspect of the portal is the video feed, which is accompanied by chat rooms and the conversation queue that allows anyone to transmit their questions directly to the professor. During the South Africa expedition, INTX also tested a hand-held tablet computer version of the media portal software that enabled the in-field professor to trigger real-time instructional events on the students’ media portal and dynamically control the telepresence of each participant as they entered the conversation queue. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261429411427655">Figure 2</xref>, the face of a student prompted by the professor to ask a direct question is visible adjacent to the main video feed. In summary, a key benefit of the INTX platform was the real-time, face-to-face link established between instructors and students. Only traditional classrooms typically offer such an intimate learning experience. The closest technological solution currently used in the school systems is the classroom teleconference: a professor at the main campus of a university teaches a class that is videotaped and simultaneously broadcast to other branch campuses over two-way Internet data connections, which in turn allows the connected students to ask questions. This type of instruction may work well for a ‘stationary’ class, but it does not encompass the real-time, remote interaction required by mobile research transects.</p>

<title>An anthropological perspective</title>
<p>A central tenet of anthropology is the holistic study of cultures. The primary method that cultural anthropologists employ to achieve such a holistic perspective is direct, extended cultural contact, i.e. living there. Anthropologist Franz Boas was one of the first to promote the first-hand study of cultures in the early 20th century, and he advocated an approach called cultural relativism, viewing other cultures through their own, or ‘insider’, cultural lenses. The best way to achieve that insider’s perspective is to conduct ethnographic fieldwork for an extended period of time, observing and participating in another culture. Many students today, particularly undergraduates, do not have the opportunity to travel and study abroad in order to observe and experience other cultures first hand. While recent advances in the world wide web technology have connected us ‘virtually’ to even the most remote places on earth, this connection is still second hand because we are experiencing it through the lenses of the website designer or being guided by the agendas of those who post information. The state-of-the-art technology employed in this pedagogical project permitted undergraduate students to closely approximate ‘being there’ without physically ‘being there’; it provided opportunities for students to have real-time, personal experiences with the peoples and cultures of South Africa and Swaziland.</p>
<p>South Africa, where the INTX team spent the majority of its time, possesses a unique cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as an infamous political history whose devastating impact remains evident. The technology employed in our Cultural Transect availed students of an opportunity to be ‘virtually’ immersed in this country. Although the inhumane practice of apartheid by the Afrikaaner regime ended almost 20 years ago, and Nelson Mandela, a black South African, was elected president in 1994, South Africa’s transition to a representative democracy is an ongoing struggle. This project allowed our students a unique view of diverse perspectives on this process of cultural change. One of these perspectives was provided by Professor David Coplan, Chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Witwatersrand. As an expatriate from the USA, he was able to provide insights about the culture from both insider (emic) and outsider (etic) perspectives, providing students with keen observations about the cultural processes evolving in South Africa. Another valuable perspective was gleaned from the current leader of Inkatha, the opposition political party in South Africa. <italic>Inkosi</italic>, or Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is also the Prime Minister of the Zulu nation and chief of the Buthelezi clan; he is directly descended from the royal line of Shaka Zulu, an historic Zulu warrior. Although 83 years old, he vividly recited his family history from centuries ago to the present, and revealed a painful part of his personal life that was ultimately inspirational to other South Africans. Two of his children died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and he openly admitted this to the public, a brave and highly unusual thing to do. One of the most challenging issues facing the people of South Africa today is the scourge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS; this country has one of the highest per capita rates of HIV/AIDS infection in the world. One of the major obstacles in fighting this disease, however, is the significant stigma attached to having it. This stigma prevents people from being tested and from openly admitting that it was a cause of death. This is why <italic>Inkosi</italic> Buthelezi’s public pronouncement was so significant. Both he and former President Nelson Mandela, who admitted that he lost a son to AIDS, have been inspirational by their revelations. We knew that HIV/AIDS is such a significant issue in the societies of South Africa and Swaziland, and therefore we designed the webcasts in such a way that it was the overarching theme of our Cultural Transect. This focus allowed students to learn how it is being addressed throughout these societies. One of the major avenues toward HIV/AIDS prevention is through the arts – the performing arts, graphic arts, literature, and music are all being utilized in the encouragement of prevention and testing.</p>
<p>Another of our foci from this Cultural Transect was to dispel cultural stereotypes by providing students opportunities to ask questions of the people who live there. One of our interactive webcasts occurred in Soweto, a township near Johannesburg that was once home to former president Nelson Mandela. In the 1970s, Soweto was the site of riots and bloody battles against the Apartheid regime and, unfortunately, its image for many in the USA has not changed. We toured the Mandela house, now a museum, and, during the question and answer sessions, students posed questions to the museum docent, a professor, and two Soweto residents.<sup>1</sup> One of the residents, a graduate of the anthropology program at the University of Witwatersrand, clearly addressed the negative stereotypes and revealed how diverse Soweto is while answering students’ questions about her community. Another resident related the inspirational story of how he has transformed himself from a criminal to a sculpture artist. The personal insights that this technology permitted them to share about their community, while directly interacting with our students in the USA in real time, could never be duplicated by reading books or watching movies.</p>
<p>Conducting our Cultural Transect across South Africa and Swaziland permitted students not only to passively experience the cultures – observing behaviors, listening to interviews, and visually exploring through performances and museum collections – but also to actively participate by posing questions about what they saw and heard during the twice-weekly, real-time broadcasts. Engaging in video chat and instructional sessions fostered both instructor–student and student–student interaction. The professors, Bruce Janz and Rosalyn Howard, designed a collaborative group project that connected students in the humanities course and anthropology course. Students’ assignments allowed them opportunities to view and interpret events using their individual disciplinary approaches, and provided a venue through which to share insights, a shared distributed learning site (Webcourses). As evidenced by the students’ comments, this collaboration broadened their perspectives; it gave them valuable occasions to view the world not only through the eyes of South Africans and Swazis, but through different disciplinary lenses. Beyond the scope of the collaborative project, students in both courses were availed of synchronous and asynchronous resources that provided current information on cultural events, musicians, and other artists. The analysis of these complementary modes of presentation is presented in a later section of this paper.</p>
<p>The experience of employing this technology as a pedagogical tool, specifically from an anthropological perspective, represented a quantum leap from the 1930s advent of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson’s forays into the use of film and photography that enhanced our appreciation for and understanding of other cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411427655">Bexley and Fijn, 2007</xref>). This project’s technology proved to be a powerful new tool for documenting social and cultural reality in real time, and facilitated a unique method of interdisciplinary collaboration that enhanced the students’ learning experiences.</p>

<title>Assessment methodology</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the INTX media platform has special properties for achieving the interactive Cultural Transect and for exceeding the capacity for learning from traditional distance learning platforms, the research team collected data about several different aspects of the online experience. A meta-analysis of distance learning platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411427655">Bernard et al., 2009</xref>) revealed no other studies that compare a traditional text- and discussion-based online learning platform with an interactive live broadcast platform. However, studies have demonstrated the efficacy of live broadcasts on achievement and engagement outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411427655">Grimes et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411427655">Saporta and Beyth-Marom, 2002</xref>). For this evaluation we examined the effects of an ‘enhanced’ live webcast (i.e. additional interactive supports and communication channels to the live video stream) on a specific set of learning outcomes targeting cultural understanding and research skills.</p>
<p>A total of 34 students enrolled in the African humanities course and 56 students were enrolled in the African societies and cultures course. Given the structure of the course and the timeline of opportunity to conduct the INTX webcast series, we conducted our assessment as a within-subjects comparison – all students were exposed first to course content using a traditional online learning platform (text-based, no rich media) and for the remaining five weeks of the course students primarily engaged with the content through the INTX webcasts. While we are aware of the potential for order effects on our learning and engagement measures, we were careful to target our evaluation to only the content and activities involved in each phase of the course.</p>
<p>The basic learning outcomes targeted by both of the participant courses were for students to understand the research practices of exploring and understanding different cultures. The expectation was that students would come away from the course equipped with the skills necessary to evaluate source data, construct their own research questions, and reflect on their own learning experiences. Students were also expected to learn basic communication and presentation skills and how to interact within the contexts of a multidisciplinary team, and, finally, each course was an opportunity for students to acquire foundational knowledge (e.g. South African history, cultural traditions, etc.). In addition to questions of learning, we were also interested in student interest and engagement with course topics. Did they feel a connection to the people and artifacts they were learning about? Were they motivated to ask questions and seek out new knowledge? The central question for our evaluation was whether or not the unique interaction capabilities provided by the INTX platform has added benefits for these learning and engagement outcomes.</p>
<p>Several sources of data from the INTX expedition in South Africa were collected and were used to address our assessment objectives. These sources include surveys delivered to students twice for each platform inquiring about their engagement and interest in the course, transcripts and observations of students’ online activity such as statements made on course discussion forums, assignments and examinations completed during each segment of the course, and the number of users and the time spent online. We hypothesized that the opportunity for direct interaction with the source material via the INTX platform would lead to greater knowledge of and interest in the specific communities and people encountered in the course. We also predicted that in the second half students would use more ‘field trip’ terminology and more action words, indicating a higher level of engagement with the source material. Our analysis includes looking at whether students were more likely to ask questions of other students and instructors, and whether they demonstrated more of an emotional response to the course subject matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429411427655">
<title>Expedition reflections and preliminary analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the large corpus of data collected from the South Africa expedition is still ongoing, but some preliminary results and insights from instructors and student users are shared here.</p>
<sec id="section5-0261429411427655">
<title>Anecdotal evidence</title>
<p>First we will share some anecdotal insight from an on-camera instructor who participated in the program. These insights were gathered at the conclusion of the field-based work, when we conducted some exit interviews with the instructors in order to better understand their experiences. One interviewee explained that the project was not merely an opportunity to play with some ‘cool new technology’; rather, it provided a form of media delivery that can help change the metaphors we use for knowledge acquisition and teaching. However, in the interview, the instructor reflected on a strong initial inclination to use the telepresence technology more like an ‘additive’ way to conduct a lecture, which does not necessarily imply a game-changing way of conducting distance education because it retains the familiar metaphor of the classroom.</p>
<p>As with any new technology, the instructors began with what they already knew, and then built a new set of conventions while using the new media for teaching. What they already knew was the traditional classroom model as well as more recent notions of online teaching. Then, as the additional features of technological mediation became available to them during the South Africa expedition, the instructors had the opportunity to borrow additional conventions from metaphorical modes of newscasts, reality television, live sports broadcasts, and more if they so desired. In the end, even though we did not push the metaphor this time much beyond a portal-based virtual lecture, we agreed that this topic deserves further analysis and discussion because these modes mentioned each come with different implications as to how they are set up and the overall effectiveness for the occasion. In summary, this anecdotal evidence emphasizes that the game-changing aspect of the INTX platform lies not solely in its current feature set but instead in its potential to help instructors consider new metaphors for knowledge acquisition and teaching – beyond the familiar ‘classroom’ model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411427655">
<title>User data</title>
<p>Although participation in the live webcasts could not be required of students enrolled in the online courses, it was strongly encouraged, and login records confirm that a large number of students were in attendance during each of the live webcasts. The number of unique users who logged onto each of the eight webcasts was in the range of 25–55. Most of these attendees were students, while a smaller percentage comprised project partners and interested members of the public who had requested a login account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411427655">
<title>Student interactions</title>
<p>Student interactions in the discussion forums of the traditional online platform were fairly restrained – often these were straightforward responses to instructor prompts or simple inquiries about course logistics. When the course shifted to the INTX platform these interactions were more spontaneous, motivated by genuine curiosity grounded in the events occurring in the video stream. In this excerpt the video broadcast is showing landscape art from Swaziland. One of the instructors points out the spacing between people and other elements in the paintings.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Student 1:</speaker>
<p>Maybe the spacing is the result of not living in a cluttered society like metropolitan Western cities.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student 2:</speaker>
<p>Interesting how he focuses on the roads … showing progress with the stick and mud homes?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student 1:</speaker>
<p>Not feeling crowded perhaps.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Instructor:</speaker>
<p>Maybe, although some of these places can be pretty crowded. Public space in many African small towns can be quite crowded. Remember, very few are in cars, as in the US. Everyone’s out walking all the time.</p>
</speech>
<p>With the chat functionality students were able to raise questions and make important insights about video events without interrupting the flow of the broadcasts. These side conversations were enhanced by instructor input and a few subject matter experts who were invited to participate in the discussions. Additionally, there was a ‘question queue’ where students could pose more formal questions to the individuals being interviewed in South Africa. A popular feature of this queue was the ability of students to vote on questions they wanted to have asked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429411427655">
<title>Engagement surveys</title>
<p>Following both the traditional online segment of the courses and the INTX segment, we administered a survey to students asking them identical questions about how the platform affected their interest in and ability to learn the course content. We asked students to respond to statements such as ‘I care about the people and the cultures I am learning about in this course’ and asked them how often during each segment they did things like pose a question to other students in the course. A challenge with interpreting these surveys was that many students did not restrict their comments to the online course platform, as indicated by their responses to open-ended questions. Many students seemed to be using the survey to express frustrations about grading or other tangential course issues. Nonetheless, trends in the survey data indicate some genuine strengths of the INTX platform for engaging students.</p>
<p>A total of 30 students took the pre-survey and 19 students took the post-survey. A few surveys had to be removed from the analysis because they showed no variability in the responses (i.e. students gave the same response for every question). In response to the statement ‘I feel that my input and opinions matter in this course’, the average response, on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), was higher for the INTX segment (<italic>M</italic> = 4.80) than for the traditional online segment (<italic>M</italic> = 4.20). Another interesting trend was that during the INTX segment students reported that, on average, they discussed course concepts outside of class more frequently than during the traditional online segment (<italic>M</italic> = 2.84 compared with <italic>M </italic>= 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 4). These results are preliminary given the relatively small sample of students who completed the survey, but they suggest that the INTX platform has potential benefits for promoting student engagement.</p>
<p>The surveys also included a few open-response questions about perceived strengths and weaknesses of the online course platforms. Outside of individual technical issues and scheduling conflicts with the webcasts, students were quite positive about the experience provided by the INTX platform. The following are two student responses to a question about how the platform affected their ability to learn:<disp-quote>
<p>The broadcasts really helped me feel a connection to the material, and it was neat to know that what we were learning was stuff that is going on now, and not just in the past.</p>
<p>It allowed me to experience places which I would not otherwise have had easy access to. The experience was live, which made me feel more connected to it than if I was just reading about it in a book.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While the student reaction to the webcast platform was mostly positive, we did receive helpful suggestions and some legitimate concerns. For example, a couple of students noted that they had some anxiety about asking questions in such an open, public forum. A few other students had some ideas for different content that could have been presented, such as this response:<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe visit someone and see how and what they would prepare for the evening meal. Meander through a marketplace, I would like to have seen the group visit an AIDS clinic and talk with those workers.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>We will continue to analyze the dataset that we collected and investigate other dimensions of learning and engagement that are influenced by this new online course platform. Our intent is to continue to make improvements that will provide the best possible distance learning experience for enabling an interactive Cultural Transect.</p>

<title>Future prospects</title>
<p>There is immense potential to enhance and transform future educational opportunities with this platform. Through rigorous assessment of our pedagogy and virtual-abroad technological performance characteristics, we believe that our project efforts demonstrate how the interactive Cultural Transect model can apply to numerous educational programs as well as scale-up to multinational collaborative learning models. Research expeditions need not be focused on humanities topics; science and technology courses could also adopt this approach. Consider the possibility of using this technology in an archaeology course, where in-field students could both conduct research and help to train other students at home. Consider an engineering course that travels to diverse locations and explores labs, examines large-scale engineering projects, or addresses specific conditions where some engineering solution is needed. Consider medical training where students could travel to different places to observe conditions and procedures that are rare or non-existent in the USA. In the new global economy, US students must compete at the highest level – hence the need to bring a global education right to their desktop.</p>

<p>A quite unexpected event occurred while we were webcasting from the Nelson Mandela house. Reverend Jesse Jackson (well-known minister, ‘ambassador’, and former presidential candidate from the USA) happened to be visiting there at the time we were conducting our live broadcast, and he agreed to speak on camera to our students.  He stated that he had first visited there when Nelson Mandela was released from 27 years of imprisonment in 1990.</p>
