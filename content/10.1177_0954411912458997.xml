<abstract>
<p>After total knee replacement, the monitoring of the prosthetic performance is often done by roentgenographic examination. However, the two-dimensional (2D) roentgen images only provide information about the projection onto the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) planes. Historically, the model-based roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) technique has been developed to predict the spatial relationship between prostheses by iteratively comparing the projective data for the prosthetic models and the roentgen images. During examination, the prosthetic poses should be stationary. This should be ensured, either by the use of dual synchronized X-ray equipment or by the use of a specific posture. In practice, these methods are uncommon or technically inconvenient during follow-up examination. This study aims to develop a rotation platform to improve the clinical applicability of the model-based RSA technique. The rotation platform allows the patient to assume a weight-bearing posture, while being steadily rotated so that both AP and ML knee images can be obtained. This study uses X-ray equipment with a single source and flat panel detectors (FPDs). Four tests are conducted to evaluate the quality of the FPD images, steadiness of the rotation platform, and accuracy of the RSA results. The results show that the distortion-induced error of the FPD image is quite minor, and the prosthetic size can be cautiously calibrated by means of the scale ball(s). The rotation platform should be placed closer to the FPD and orthogonal to the projection axis of the X-ray source. Image overlap of the prostheses can be avoided by adjusting both X-ray source and knee posture. The device-induced problems associated with the rotation platform include the steadiness of the platform operation and the balance of the rotated subject. Sawbone tests demonstrate that the outline error, due to the platform, is of the order of the image resolution (= 0.145 mm). In conclusion, the rotation platform with steady rotation, a knee support, and a handle can serve as an alternative method to take prosthetic images, without the loss in accuracy associated with the RSA method.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Total knee replacement with metallic prostheses and plastic inserts has been extensively used to treat the various kinds of the knee diseases. During the postoperative follow-up, roentgenographic examinations are often used to monitor prosthesis failure, insert wear, and intercomponent misalignment. For the common knee system, an insert is assembled into the tibial prosthesis with a locking mechanism. Theoretically, the pose and wear in a radiolucent insert can be determined from the relative location of the femoral and tibial prostheses. Even for a metallic prosthesis, however, the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) roentgen images merely reveal definite two-dimensional (2D) information. The three-dimensional (3D) relationship between the metallic prostheses cannot be exactly defined. Consequently, the region and extent of insert wear are subject to the inference of the observer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912458997">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912458997">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the literature, two methods of the marker and the model-based roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) have been developed to estimate the 3D position of prostheses in space, using roentgen images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912458997">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912458997"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912458997">7</xref></sup> With the marker-based RSA, some prearranged tantalum markers are embedded into the bones, and a calibration cage is used to establish and calculate the coordinate information for the markers and prostheses. However, the use of tantalum markers raises ethical problems and limits the applicability of this method in the usual follow-up examinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912458997">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912458997">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, advances in computer-aided design (CAD) have hastened the development of the model-based RSA technique. The model-based RSA is based on minimizing the geometrical differences between the simulated projections of the CAD prosthesis and the actual projections of that prosthesis, as it appears on the roentgen images. Accordingly, the position of the prosthesis can be estimated by iteratively calculating the geometrical differences until the desired cost function is achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912458997">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912458997">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Theoretically, both the quality and inclined angle of the two images should be certified and known, prior to the model-based RSA calculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912458997">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912458997">12</xref></sup> Image quality information is used to certify and calibrate induced errors in the prosthetic shape and size, especially for X-ray equipment with perspective projection. Image intensifier/TV digital system has been used for this purpose, for more than two decades. However, perspective projection necessitates calibration for image distortion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912458997">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912458997">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Flat panel detector (FPD) is an alternative technology to common X-ray equipment. The manufacturer states that the benefits of FPD image quality include lack of geometric distortion, little or no veiling glare, and a uniform response across the field of view.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912458997">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912458997">17</xref></sup> The ideal views of the two images are exactly orthogonal (i.e. AP and ML). However, some human or equipment-related factors often result in nonorthogonal images. Historically, some numerical and experimental methods have been proposed to calculate or limit the value of the image angle. Among these methods, specific X-ray equipment (e.g. dual) is used to synchronize the capture of two knee images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912458997">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912458997">10</xref></sup> In most countries, however, this dual equipment is not common in routine roentgenographic examination of total knee replacements, due to cost and practicability. Other methods keep the subject’s knee in a specific posture, such as supine, but some specific postures cause no physiological pressure at the knee joint and eventually produce an unrealistic estimation of prosthetic position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912458997">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912458997">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study aims to solve the aforementioned equipment and posture-induced problems, in order to enhance the clinical applicability of the model-based RSA technique. The equipment used consists of a single X-ray source and FPD. The FPD image quality is experimentally evaluated. A motor-driven platform allows rotation of the subject, so that two orthogonal images can be obtained, using a single X-ray source. Four tests are conducted to evaluate the FPD image quality and the value of the rotation platform. The results of this study anticipate providing the information about the error calibration of the FPD images and the design validation of the rotation platform.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>A rotation platform, with handle and support, designed to reduce the relative motion between knee prostheses during autorotation by the subject. The X-ray equipment used in this study is a Philips DigitalDiagnost (Philips Co. Ltd, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). It is equipped with a single source and FPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912458997">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the influence of perspective projection on FPD image quality initially evaluated and calibrated, prior to the RSA calculation. Subsequently, the tests to verify the stability of the motor-driven platform and the accuracy of the predicted RSA results were conducted.</p>

<title>Verification of the FPD image quality</title>
<p>In general, three potential factors affect the FPD image quality; they are distortion, scale, and resolution. These factors are closely related to both projection type and hardware quality of the X-ray equipment. This study uses a plate with a predrilled hole to evaluate the distortion in the FPD image quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912458997">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The aluminum plate of 2.0 mm in thickness, 350 mm in length, and 150 mm in width has about 4000 predrilled holes. The hole-predrilled plate is numerically manufactured using a CNC system, which is accurate to 10 µm. This is notably higher than the resolution (≅0.1 mm) of an image pixel. Each hole is 2.0 mm in diameter, and the separation of the holes is 3.0 mm. The plate is placed adjacent to the FPD and orthogonal to the projection axis of the X-ray source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912458997">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411912458997-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>All holes (40 columns × 105 rows) are used to calculate the distortion in the FPD images. The size (≅12 × 31.5 cm, for about 4000 holes) is designed to provide the distortion information about the area comparable to that of the femoral and tibial prostheses. If image distortion exists, the hole-centers, in each row, do not appear to line up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912458997">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The hole-center line of a row is defined as the least squares regression line through the hole-centers of that row. For a hole-center, the line error is denoted as the closest projective distance between that hole-center and the hole-center line. In this study, the root mean square (RMS) of the line errors, for the holes in the same row, is used as one of the distortion indices. Another index of FPD image distortion is the horizontal error that is the inclined angle between the hole-center and horizontal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912458997">Figure 2(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>The scale factor of the FPD image is calibrated using a set of seven metal balls of equal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912458997">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Each ball is made of 316L stainless steel, and adjacent balls are spanned in a coplanar manner. The balls are placed on a radiolucent box of cubic shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912458997">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The ball-spanned width (= 65 mm) is the projective width of the seven balls. Its dimensions are equivalent to the AP and ML size of the knee prosthesis. The results can provide information about scale error within the range of prosthesis size. The ball set is placed at two panel-ball distances of 0 cm (position 1) and 60 cm (position 2) from the FPD plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912458997">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The placement of the seven balls at the two positions is designed to evaluate the effects of source-ball distance on the scale and resolution of the projective balls. The pixel resolution and the difference in size between the projective balls at each of the two positions are calculated and compared.</p>

<title>Design of the rotation platform</title>
<p>The rotation platform consists of three parts: a motor-controlled platform, a handle, and one knee support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The standing platform can rotate clockwise at a controlled velocity to allow the two orthogonal roentgen images to be obtained. For the subject’s comfort, the rotational velocity of the platform is designed to gradually accelerate from 0°/s to 3.0°/s in 30 s. Before roentgenographic examination, the front of the rotation platform is defined as the AP direction and is placed orthogonal to the X-ray source. The rotation range of the platform is 90° in order to simulate the AP and ML views. During rotation, the subject can grip the handle to support the upper body more stably. The use of the knee support can further stabilize the instrumented knee joint to decrease undesirable intercomponent motion.</p>

<title>Subject preparation and sawbone simulation</title>
<p>Five subjects with total knee replacement participated in the evaluation of the rotation platform. The sample consisted of two males (age: 62.5 ± 23.5 years and weight: 84.0 ± 7.0 kg) and three females (age: 63.0 ± 4.3 years and weight: 59.2 ± 8.5 kg). The knee systems used in the subject are all the Zimmer NexGen (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA). Before testing, they are familiarized with the rotation of the platform for at least five cycles each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(a)</xref>). During testing, each subject is asked to move the center of gravity of the upper body onto the instrumented leg. The other leg is extended to avoid image interference. This results in a slight flexion of the instrumented knee, causing it to make contact with the support, which further enhances the stability of the knee joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(a)</xref>).</p>
<p>The center of the platform is placed about 70 cm in front of the X-ray source, and the front of platform is orthogonal to the projection axis of the X-ray source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912458997">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Initially, each subject faces to the X-ray equipment, and the AP image is taken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Subsequently, the platform is rotated 90° clockwise and then returned to its original position, when another AP image is taken. A comparison of the prosthetic outlines, in these two AP images, allows a good evaluation of the stability of the rotation platform. If the outline difference is acceptable, the rotation platform is deemed to be a suitable alternative to dual X-ray equipment.</p>
<p>Another test uses the CAD models and the roentgen image to calculate the RSA results. Subsequently, the projective outlines of the RSA results are compared with the original images. The outline difference provides another reference, by which the performance of the rotation platform could be measured. For the ML images, both procedure and comparison are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The calculation and comparison of the prosthetic outlines are conducted using the software RevCAD version 1.50 (Pouyuen Co. Ltd, Changhua, Taiwan).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912458997">Figure 4</xref>, the stability of the rotation platform is further evaluated by RSA calculation using a femorotibial sawbone (Pacific Research Laboratories Inc, Washington, DC, USA). The radiolucent jig is made of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and designed to fix the flexion angle of the femorotibial sawbone. The total knee system used in the sawbone tests is the Stryker Triathlon PS TKR (Stryker, Inc., Hopkinton, MA, USA). The AP and ML images are first taken using the rotation platform. Subsequently, the position of the bone–prosthesis construct remains unchanged, and the spatial relationship between the prostheses is reversely constructed, using an ATOS III scanner (GOM mbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The outline, rotation, and translation errors in the predicted and scanned prosthetic models are compared in order to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted RSA results. The initial and final registrations of the prostheses are described in the authors’ previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912458997">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Verification of the FPD image quality</title>
<p>The FPD image distortion is evaluated by the alignment of the hole-centers in the same row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912458997">Figure 5</xref>). The maximum value of RMS line error does not exceed 0.02 mm, for each of the 105 rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912458997">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The maximum value of the horizontal error is less than 0.15° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912458997">Figure 5(b)</xref>). Both indicate that the distortion of the FPD image is acceptable, as compared to the image resolution (= 0.145 mm/pixel).</p>

<p>To evaluate the scale factor, the projective diameters of the seven balls at the two positions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912458997">Figure 6(a)</xref>. At position 1, ball no. 1 is nearly in the FPD plane, so that the projective size (= 9.616 mm) is almost equal to the original value (= 9.600 mm). Using the scale rule of the roentgen image, the ball diameter at position 2 is notably greater than that at position 1. This indicates that the scale rule should be modified, when the object is far from the FPD.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the rotation platform</title>
<p>The stability of the rotation platform is evaluated, using the comparison of prosthetic outlines. Two types of outline comparison are investigated in this study. One is the origin versus RSA outline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912458997">8(b)</xref>) and the other is the origin versus rotation outline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912458997">Figure 8(a)</xref>). The origin and rotation images show the prosthetic outlines before and after subject rotation, respectively. The RSA outline is the result of a projection of the 3D prosthetic models after the RSA calculation. In general, the errors of both origin versus rotation and origin versus RSA are higher in the AP view than in the ML view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, image overlap of the femoral and tibial prostheses is more commonly observed in the AP view. For FPD images, the thinner structure (e.g. tibial flanges) of the metallic prosthesis is somewhat radiolucent, as in the regions <italic>abc</italic> and <italic>de</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">Figure 7</xref>). This has the potential to create errors in the recognition of the outline between bone and prosthesis in these regions. Consequently, the maximum value of the outline error is generally higher in the AP view than in the ML view.</p>

<p>For the origin versus rotation outline comparison, the RMS and mean errors in the prosthetic outline are 0.173 and 0.144 mm, respectively. This is somewhat comparable to the resolution (= 0.145 mm) of the FPD image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912458997">Figure 8(a)</xref>). For the origin versus RSA outline comparison, however, the RMS and mean errors increase to 0.325 and 0.250 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912458997">Figure 8(b)</xref>). This 80.8% increase in outline error reveals that the RSA calculation induces an additional error in the prediction of the prosthetic outline. For the two outline comparisons, the value of the RMS outline error is significantly less than that of the maximum error. This indicates that greater outline differences only occur in some regions. For the rotation and RSA outlines, the RMS and mean errors in the two prostheses are comparable.</p>

<p>The comparisons between the predicted and scanned prosthetic models are evaluated in terms of outline, rotation, and translation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912458997">Figure 9</xref>).

On average, the error values for the sawbone test are notably less than those for the subject tests.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rationale of the model-based RSA technique involves recording the positions of the prosthetic models and roentgen images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912458997">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912458997">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912458997">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912458997">18</xref></sup> Two inclined images with the acceptable quality, known angle value, and stationary prostheses are essential to the RSA calculation. These are equipment and technique dependent, which caused the authors to design a rotation platform to obviate the need for both dual X-ray equipment and a specific posture.</p>
<p>This study presents one design and conducts four tests to investigate the effects of FPD image quality and the use of a rotation platform on the RSA results. The ideal value for the angle between images is 90°. Even using dual equipment or a rotation platform, however, the angle between images might not be exactly orthogonal due to equipment and operation-induced errors. From a technical viewpoint, this method obviates the strict requirements, both for design of the rotation platform and for the posture of the subject.</p>
<sec id="section11-0954411912458997">
<title>Verification of the FPD image quality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912458997">Figure 5</xref> shows the results for the distortion and scale factors for the FPD images. The RMS of the line error and the horizontal error does not exceed 0.02 mm and 0.15° within the 315 mm length. The distortion error in the FPD image is significantly less than the image resolution (= 0.145 mm). In general, the AP and ML size of the knee prosthesis is about 70 mm (23-hole width), so the deviation of the prosthesis at the image margins is also less than 0.01 mm. This demonstrates its value as an image tool for the RSA calculation. As long as the prosthesis is not placed in the margin of the field of view, calibration of the FPD image distortion is not necessary prior to the RSA calculation.</p>
<p>The difference in size of the ball set at the two positions demonstrates the perspective form of the FPD image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912458997">Figure 6</xref>). The perspective projection of the FPD equipment means that the prosthetic size appears to be increased as the ball moves closer to the X-ray source. On average, the differences in size between ball no. 1 and ball no. 7 are 0.342 mm (position 1) and 0.599 mm (position 2), respectively. These scale errors represent 3.6% and 6.2% of the original size (9.6 mm in diameter) of the scale balls, respectively.</p>
<p>The size of the knee prosthesis is of the same scale as the ball-spanned width, so the calibration of the induced scale error for the prosthetic images is necessary for more accurate RSA results. The projective size of the scale ball versus the source-ball distance shows the quasi-linear relationship that can be regressed as a least square line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912458997">Figure 6</xref>). At the two positions, both regression lines show an approximately equal slope, which can be assumed as a property of the equipment and used to calibrate the projective size of the prostheses.</p>
<p>Similar to the concept of the calibration cage in the marker-based RSA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912458997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912458997">5</xref></sup> another calibration method involves the placement of more than two balls to measure the scale information around the knee prostheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411912458997">Figure 10</xref>). Accordingly, the scale function of the FPD images can be formulated to transform the original outline into the calibrated outline, prior to the RSA calculation.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the rotation platform</title>
<p>When the platform rotates, the device-induced problems include the stability of the platform in operation and the balance of the subject under rotation. In this study, the rotation speed of the platform is properly adjusted, and the subjects are well trained before the test. From the authors’ experience, these factors are important to the clinical applicability of the rotation platform. If the platform accelerates and decelerates rapidly, the inertia momentum of the upper body has the potential to cause slippage in the interfaces between the knee prostheses.</p>
<p>During testing, the location of the knee support necessitates a slight flexion of the knee, in order to make proper contact between the knee and the support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figure 3(a)</xref>). This can result in image overlap between the femoral and tibial prostheses, which is more prevalent in the AP view than in the ML view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figures 3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">7</xref>). Beyond the overlapped region(s), however, the decrease in available outline makes the overlap as another error source in the subsequent RSA calculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912458997">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912458997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912458997">15</xref></sup> From the authors’ experience, the knee support could be redesigned to take knee images with the knee extended. Additionally, the X-ray source should be adjusted to the same horizontal level as the subject’s knee. This can avoid image overlap, due to a higher or lower projection angle. For the FPD images, the radiolucency of the thinner regions (e.g. <italic>abc</italic> and <italic>de</italic>) renders the outline between the prosthesis and bone difficult to recognize and serves as another source of outline error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>For the subject tests, the calculation of the RSA outlines is based on the use of the roentgen images with the rotation platform. However, the RSA calculation involves the two-stage registrations of the prosthetic position, and the value of the image angle is iteratively calculated even using the rotation platform. Consequently, the accumulated errors in the predicted RSA outline are higher than those of the origin versus rotation outline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912458997">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0954411912458997">
<title>Comparison of the predicted RSA and reconstructed laser results</title>
<p>The average and maximum errors in the prosthetic outlines are about 0.01 and 0.4 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912458997">Figure 9(a)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912458997">(d)</xref>). Those errors are comparable with the reported results in the literature studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912458997">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912458997">9</xref></sup> This is reasonable due to the fact that the sawbone–prosthesis construct is almost stationary. However, the prerequisites are that the platform rotates steadily and the patient remains stable.</p>
<p>The difference between a sawbone and prostheses is significantly more obvious than that between bone and prostheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912458997">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912458997">7</xref>). In addition, the sawbone–prosthesis construct is more tightly constrained by the UHMWPE jigs than the subject tests, which notably decreases undesirable movement at the prosthetic interfaces. Both factors account for higher accuracy of the outline error in the sawbone tests than that for the subject tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912458997">Figure 9(a)</xref>). This proves that both support and handle should be used in the stable rotation of the platform.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both projection type and image errors in X-ray equipment should be verified to ensure the accuracy of the RSA calculation. For the FPD image, the distortion-induced error is quite minor, but the prosthetic size should be calibrated by means of the scale ball(s). Both steady rotation and stable knee support are necessary for the platform design. The ideal location of the rotation platform is close to the FPD and central to the projection axis of the X-ray source. Image overlap for metallic prostheses can be avoided by extending the knee and adjusting the projection angle of the X-ray source. With careful set up, the rotation platform can serve as a viable alternative for obtaining images of prostheses with acceptable accuracy of the RSA results.</p>
