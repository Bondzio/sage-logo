<p>Conducting field research (collecting new and original primary data, undertaking interviews, administering surveys and questionnaires, etc.) has long been an important part of the social scientific endeavor. Some would even argue that field research is a critical part of attaining a deeper understanding of and gaining access to other cultures and societies. By getting closer to real-world conditions of the culture or society in question, the given scholar can discover the proper research design necessary to get at the questions she or he wants to address. Fieldwork leads to better, more informed research. This is one of Adrienne LeBas’s strong points in this thought-provoking work.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with all the wonders of our contemporary and increasingly globalized world, some bring into question whether the use of financial resources for travel and long-term stays abroad is justified in the tight budgetary constraints recently confronting universities. Some point out that the Internet gives us virtually unlimited access to worldwide media sources, comprehensive data sets, and NGO, international organization, and state archives. Why go anywhere? It would seem that today we can undertake meaningful research without even leaving our university offices and computers. But can we? LeBas would come back to us with a resounding no for an answer. Certainly these phenomena related to globalization make some aspects of our research much easier than they were just a few decades ago. However, clear limits exist for many scholars who study places such as Africa. The “data” that exist are frequently riddled with holes or downright wrong. Regardless of these problems, getting critical access to information without the proper context can lead scholars to arrive at erroneous conclusions that do not match up with the realities on the ground. LeBas understands this, and her research demonstrates it. We cannot produce new data, test our hypotheses, and uncover important causal processes without obtaining critical input derived from being on the ground and talking with those involved in making important decisions and those affected by these choices. This is the payoff that fieldwork provides. Our ideas and the data we can find readily available on the Internet can take us only part of the way. This conclusion about the fundamental importance of field research is at the heart of LeBas’s new book on party building and democratization in Africa. LeBas’s research is based on fieldwork that expands on her doctoral dissertation from Columbia University in 2006. Her field research in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Kenya transformed her initial assumptions in important ways. Extensive interviews, sometimes under difficult circumstances, paved the way for this innovative and thought-provoking book. More important, this research provides a very strong counter to some of the conclusions from the leading democratization literature that has been produced on the third wave of democratizers.</p>
<p><italic>From Protest to Parties: Party-Building and Democratization in Africa</italic> dives into the inner workings of the politics and party formation of two countries in Southern Africa—Zambia and Zimbabwe—along with another Anglophone country in Eastern Africa—Kenya. LeBas’s initial regard into the politics of these three countries led her to ask, “Why do we find strong, cross-ethnic opposition parties in some democratizing countries, while opposition parties tend toward organizational weakness and fragmentation in others?” (p. 245). Central for the rather detailed comparisons, all three of these countries share similar institutional arrangements and electoral systems. However, political party development took very different routes in each of the three cases. LeBas explains that the differences in opposition party strength in these three African hybrid regimes (mixing aspects of democracy and authoritarianism) are in large part the result of past patterns of authoritarian rule during single-party dominance. In the authoritarian states that based their rule on cooperation with corporatist actors such as organized labor unions that the regime created itself, LeBas finds that these states actually created strong adversaries that could be used to mobilize large constituencies and effectively challenge the state during the democratization process and beyond. In two of the cases in the book, Zambia and Zimbabwe, key opposition leaders emerged from strong labor movements that were created by the state during authoritarian rule. On the other hand, Kenya did not have a strong centralized labor union. Instead, the Kenyan state controls politics through regional ethnic power brokers, breaking down potential opposition formations. So in Zambia and Zimbabwe we see powerful political opposition movements, where in Kenya we find a fragmented opposition along regional and ethnic lines, a product of what Donald Rothchild calls a system of “hegemonic exchange.”</p>
<p>Perhaps more important, LeBas asks if polarization among critical social groups undermines democratization or if it might play an important role in party building. This question is where she charts new and fascinating ground for scholars of third wave democratization in Africa and beyond. The clearly novel part of this book is that LeBas suggests that conflict can actually help build the institutions necessary for the emergence of democratic governance. Gone are the theories about how an emergent bargaining culture and negotiations can lay the ground for a stable democracy. However, LeBas does temper these conclusions by indicating that although polarization can be useful in building strong opposition parties, clearly necessary for a vibrant democracy, it may also increase the likelihood of violence that can undermine democratic transitions and therefore reinforce authoritarian rule. That said, LeBas points out that the strategic choices of elites interact with these historical legacies to affect the organizational development of political formations. The paths chosen by political leaders deeply influence emergent party systems.</p>
<p>However, this is not the novel part of the author’s argument. That comes from the evidence provided by these three cases, suggesting that social polarization can lead to stronger political parties. This allows opposition parties to maintain organizational cohesion and the loyalty of their core constituents. Here, elites use strategies that purposefully escalate conflict and serve to reorganize partisanship around group identities such as ethnicity. This strengthens party formations, while also potentially spurring violence. Somewhat counterintuitively, social polarization and the conflict that it may produce can actually lead to strong opposition movements and vibrant democratic governance.</p>
<p>Finally, back to the first point, that is the importance of field research in the social scientific endeavor. LeBas should be commended for the risks she took in her amazing field work under unquestionably difficult circumstances in places such as Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. Clearly, this is not an easy place to undertake extensive interviews of opposition and trade union leaders and activists, demonized by this repressive regime. That said, LeBas was able to get critical interviews with and points of view of important actors on the democratization processes in these three countries that one cannot obtain from the Internet or “shovel-ready” data sets. Because of this, she has produced an important piece of research that will leave scholars thinking for some time to come.</p>
