<p>Early in her introduction to <italic>The Trouble with City Planning</italic>, the author and former director of City Planning in New Orleans, Kristina Ford, offers a critical insight into a theme that runs through her book:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although I didn’t perceive it while talking to the reporter so soon after the hurricane, I began to think in the following days that the city awash in flood and its own bad decisions might actually be experiencing a rare opportunity. For in one terrible night and day, a new recourse for correcting old mistakes had become thinkable. In the face of this destruction, rebuilding and reuniting the city’s absent population were now unarguably necessary. By this disastrous stroke, city planners were given an opportunity to do the jobs they were trained to do—to devise how to use the city’s lands more to the city’s betterment. (3-4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ford’s revelation about the disaster is indicative of the “design moment” in New Orleans. Design moment thinking has many dimensions, but its key aspect is the notion that urban catastrophes like Katrina provide a unique “opportunity” to fundamentally rethink the physical structure and political organization of a city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412442485">Wagner and Frisch 2009</xref>). In particular, Ford’s book is a significant example of the professional dimension of design moment thinking in which reflection upon the city and the disaster provides an opportunity to reconsider the planning processes that shape urban space.</p>
<p>Ford’s book is an interesting mix of anecdotal tales about city planning in New Orleans before and after that great disaster of 2005. Her contribution to the expanding scholarship on New Orleans is based primarily upon her own experiences and a kind of professional “participant observer” mode of urban research and reflection. In taking this approach, Ford has made an important contribution to the literature of urban planning in New Orleans by linking pre-Katrina planning case studies to the experiences of planning in years following August 2005. Such an approach to the analysis of planning in New Orleans is refreshing in the context of so much work that lacks knowledge of the city before August 2005.</p>
<p>There are, however, limits to this approach. Scholars looking for a detailed account of what happened to New Orleans’s urban politics after Hurricane Katrina won’t find a comprehensive version of that story here. In fact many of the key players in the drama of post-disaster planning remain unnamed. Instead, Ford treats us to an urban planning “morality play” in which the disaster becomes a trial for the good and evil of city planning.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts with nineteen chapters. In the first part, the author provides seven chapters that set the stage for the book’s main arguments, including a basic introduction to New Orleans before and after 2005, and to city planning in the United States. In Part Two, the author hones in on the “trouble” with city planning, focusing on the different views of plans and planning held by planners, citizens, and elected officials.</p>
<p>Finally, in Part Three, the author offers us a normative vision of the Good City Plan as well as a valuable self-reflection on the limits of existing plans in the wake of the hurricane. Here we find Ford addressing what she calls the “moral dimension of planning” defined as the failure to discuss and address “intractable,” “unthinkable,” and “persistent” problems. Planning should have risen to the occasion of the disaster, Ford seems to tell us, to address these underlying problems with the physical and social city that were brutally exposed by the flood of August 2005. Instead, she laments, the collective “we” of city planning (planners, citizens, and elected officials) has failed the city and its most vulnerable citizens.</p>
<p>Those readers familiar with New Orleans before and after the disaster will be most able to read between the lines of Ford’s account. In fact, her stories are most interesting when she uses examples from her own experience as director of City Planning in New Orleans, a position she held from 1992 to 2000. Further, Ford and the City’s planning accomplishments prior to the disaster have generally been underappreciated by the myriad groups of planners and architects engaged in planning practice and scholarship after the disaster. This book stands as a much-needed counterpoint to the tired notion that the City of New Orleans “had no plan” (see, e.g., the claim by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078087412442485">Olshansky et al. 2008</xref> that the city’s comprehensive plan, recently updated in 1999, was “outdated” by 2005) or that the City somehow lacks a “culture of planning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412442485">Tulane’s School of Architecture held a conference implying such a conclusion in 2009</xref>). Instead, we see in the small cases throughout this book numerous examples of the use of actual plans and planning processes. It is in these small but devilish details that Ford finds the “trouble” with city planning in New Orleans and beyond.</p>
<p>Readers seeking interesting insights into the unfolding redevelopment of the city after the disaster won’t be disappointed. Ford’s insight into the Preserve Apartments redevelopment of the old Baumer Foods site (producers of Crystal Hot Sauce), for example, suggests the underlying influence of the 1999 Land Use Plan on the production of an affordable housing corridor along Tulane Avenue. Here we find some evidence for the emerging landscape of midrise, affordable apartment complexes along Tulane Avenue that seems to have set the stage for the rise of a new medical complex on the ruins of the historic, lower Mid-City neighborhood.</p>
<p>The planning morality play presented here uses the experience of plans and planning in New Orleans as a way to expose what Ford sees as much broader trends and problems in American city planning. Throughout the book, in fact, the author argues that the trends and patterns found in New Orleans are not unique to the city, but representative of a broader experience. This is also a refreshing change from the typical pattern of treating New Orleans as a unique and incomparable city.</p>
<p>The voice of the book aims for an audience of the general public and undergraduate students of planning with little or no prior experience with the ABCs of urban planning. Ford is an honest critic of plans, planners, and planning. Throughout the book, the author introduces her reader to the basic concepts of urban planning and development in a simple, straightforward language. Her intent seems to be to educate her audience so that we can all become better makers and users of city plans.</p>
<p>In the end, however, it seems that Ford is too hard on herself and her profession in reflecting upon the lessons learned from post-Katrina planning in New Orleans. While plans and planning may have failed in certain instances, an entire generation of residents and college students were introduced to community-based planning in New Orleans. In many ways, New Orleans became a hothouse of new planning ideas and experimentation over the past six years. The opportunity of the disaster—as Ford begins—certainly was one of social learning about planning. Ford’s book is a continuation of that important process.</p>
