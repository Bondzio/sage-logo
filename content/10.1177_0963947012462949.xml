<abstract>
<p>This quantitative and qualitative study argues that the One Ring in <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> (<italic>LotR</italic>) is based on a metaphoric blend, which is echoed in related metaphors for power throughout the trilogy. Particular metaphors may be repeated in a literary work to achieve a stylistic effect (Ben-Porat, 1992; Crisp et al., 2002; Sullivan, 2007; Werth, 1994). This article suggests that the One Ring, and other powers conceptualized as objects, repeatedly test the mettle and morality of characters throughout the <italic>LotR</italic> trilogy. The current study examines the One Ring as a metaphoric blend (in the sense of Fauconnier, 1997) based on the Object Event-Structure (OES) metaphor, in which abstract goals are conceptualized as physical objects (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999), and compares the structure of this blend with all other OES metaphors for power throughout <italic>LotR</italic>. The study finds that just as good characters are ‘weighed down’ by the Ring, they feel ‘burdened’ by other forms of power and authority, whereas evil characters do not feel that power is a ‘burden’. Similarly, the manner in which the Ring is acquired is indicative of character quality, a trend shared by other metaphors for power and authority. Finally, the Ring is a non-living object; and throughout the trilogy, other metaphoric ‘objects’ are found to be more likely to be evil, whereas plants and growing things are more likely to map metaphorically onto the forces of good.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Sauron’s ‘arm has grown long’, the wizard Gandalf warns in <italic>The Fellowship of the Ring</italic> (<italic>FotR</italic>: 377), a message repeated throughout <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> (<italic>LotR</italic>) trilogy by JRR Tolkien. Metaphorically, Sauron is reaching over Middle-earth, meddling and influencing, and trying to grasp the all-powerful One Ring. Frodo, on the other hand, possesses the Ring but feels weighed down by the responsibility of bearing it: ‘It’s heavy on me, Sam lad, very heavy’, he says in <italic>The Two Towers</italic> (<italic>TT</italic>: 399),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963947012462949">1</xref></sup> a description repeated with increasing persistence as Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom, where they hope to destroy the Ring. Both the reach of Sauron (metaphorically, his influence), and the weight of the Ring (the responsibility associated with it) can be ascribed to mappings in the Object Event-Structure (OES) metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012462949">Lakoff and Johnson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study investigates Tolkien’s employment of the OES metaphor throughout the <italic>LotR</italic> trilogy by considering all instances of OES metaphors for power, leadership roles and abilities, plus selected other metaphors in the three <italic>LotR</italic> books. The OES, though most evident in the One Ring, also consistently describes other sources of power and influence, such as kingship, command, and fighting prowess. Throughout the trilogy, Tolkien appears to characterize good and evil by the use of particular mappings in the OES to make a statement about power, corruption and morality. For example, Frodo’s complaint mentioned earlier is characteristic of OES in <italic>LotR</italic> in that the Ring, like other forms of power in <italic>LotR</italic>, is only a burden to the characters with a conscience. Gandalf’s warning about Sauron is typical in that evil characters tend to ‘reach out’ for power, attempting to steal it or take it by force, as does the arm of Sauron.</p>
<p>The study also considers other metaphors with object-related source domains, including image metaphors, The Mind is a Machine, The Body is a Machine, and Location Event-Structure metaphors, which map the force of natural phenomena (such as storms and tides) onto animate entities, such as individuals and armies. The study finds that evil forces are more likely to be represented as non-living objects, whereas the powers of good are more often conceptualized as plants. I argue that these metaphors complement the distinctions in the OES insofar as inanimate, artificial objects are most likely to be stolen or snatched, whereas living objects, particularly plants, are more likely to be obtained by peaceful means (such as cultivation in a garden). Tolkien’s tendency to represent good individuals and groups as plants reinforces the theme observed in the OES, in that evil powers are represented as objects to be seized – or reluctantly borne as a burden by good characters – while good powers are more often represented as plants that can be cultivated or grown. This consistency in Tolkien’s metaphors adds to the strength and unity of the representation of good and evil attitudes to power in the <italic>LotR</italic> trilogy.</p>

<title>2 Definitions of extended metaphor in literature</title>
<p>The recurrent use of a given metaphor has been identified as one of the literary techniques available to authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947012462949">Ben-Porat, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012462949">Sullivan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462949">Werth, 1994</xref>). Repeated use of a metaphor is demonstrably effective. Even in simple paragraph-long narratives, consistent use of the same metaphor facilitates comprehension and speeds processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947012462949">Gibbs et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947012462949">Valenzuela and Soriano, 2007</xref>). Given the effectiveness of repeating a metaphor in even a short passage, it is unsurprising that professional writers should draw on this resource as a means of unifying and reinforcing the themes of entire works.</p>
<p>In fact, recurrent instances of metaphoric language have been singled out as one of the characteristics specifically of literary metaphor, including lengthy passages of source- or target-domain language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947012462949">Ben-Porat, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al., 2002</xref>); extended stretches of source-domain language that lack reference to a target domain (termed ‘allegory’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012462949">Sullivan, 2007</xref>); or recurrent use of a metaphor throughout a text, even if lengthy metaphoric passages are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462949">Werth, 1994</xref>). The ‘extended metaphors’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al. (2002</xref>: 64) are the most precisely defined, consisting of metaphoric language continued from one ‘T-unit’, or ‘semi-independent clause’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">2002</xref>: 57), to another. T-units may be ‘main clauses, matrix clauses plus their embedded clauses, non-restrictive relative clauses and most adverbial clauses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al., 2002</xref>: 56). T-units will be the items counted and considered in the current study.</p>
<p>The <italic>Lord of the Rings</italic> trilogy lacks long stretches of metaphoric language. The longest passages of sequential T-units, all instantiating the same metaphor, consist of only four T-units, as in Elrond’s description of the Ring as a ‘burden’ that he will not ‘lay on’ Frodo against his will (<italic>FotR</italic>: 354–55). Longer sequences containing multiple metaphors can be found, such as in the string of image metaphors describing Glorfindel and Elrond in their first appearance (<italic>FotR</italic>: 299), or Sam’s heartfelt description of Galadriel (<italic>TT</italic>: 365). However, these passages consist of strings of different image metaphors, one after the other. Tolkien does not dwell on a single metaphor for an extended stretch of text.</p>
<p>In fact, Tolkien repeatedly insisted that <italic>LotR</italic> was not intended as an allegorical work. In the foreword to <italic>LotR</italic> (<italic>FotR</italic>: 11) he claims that the work is ‘neither allegorical nor topical’; and in his letters he says ‘Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947012462949">Carpenter, 1981</xref>: 307). This attitude is consistent with the lack of either long metaphorical passages or a metaphoric interpretation of the work as a whole.</p>
<p>Though <italic>LotR</italic> may not be allegorical nor contain lengthy metaphoric passages, it does return repeatedly to a few metaphors salient to the major themes of the trilogy. As such, this study will focus on ‘extended metaphor’ as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462949">Werth (1994</xref>: 88ff), rather than the narrower definition introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al. (2002)</xref>. Werth defines ‘extended metaphor’ as ‘an entire metaphorical “undercurrent” running through a whole text, which may manifest itself in a large number and variety of “single” metaphors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462949">Werth, 1994</xref>: 80). That is, a specific conceptual metaphor or metaphors repeats throughout a literary text without necessarily occurring in any single sequence of T-units or rendering the work allegorical.</p>
<p>It is often the case that literary works are dedicated in whole or in part to the exploration of a particular metaphor, or testing a set of metaphors for a given source domain. For example, Sweetser and Sullivan (in press) describe how the <italic>tomorrow and tomorrow</italic> speech in Macbeth tests a series of metaphors for Life, drawing out negative inferences from each, and ultimately presenting Life as a hopeless cause regardless of the source domain via which it is understood. On a larger scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947012462949">Wallhead (2003)</xref> explores how AS Byatt takes conventional metaphors for the Self, and then builds on these in creative ways in <italic>The Biographer’s Tale</italic>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947012462949">Simon-Vandenbergen (1993)</xref> tracks metaphors related to speech and music throughout George Orwell’s <italic>Nineteen Eighty-Four</italic>. All these studies explore how the repeated use of particular metaphor ties in with the themes of a work.</p>
<p>The dominant recurrent metaphor in <italic>LotR</italic> is a variant of the OES particular to the trilogy, in which power is conceptualized as an object. This metaphor is most apparent in the One Ring: to possess the Ring is to be powerful, to lose it is to lose power, and to seek it is to seek power. The One Ring establishes a necessary connection between an object and an abstraction (i.e. power). The Ring itself involves a special blend, in that it can be literally worn, given and treated as an object. Other powers, such as leadership roles or abilities, are less obviously ‘objects’. Nevertheless it will be argued that characters’ treatment of these ‘objects’, like their reactions to the Ring itself, reveal their true natures according to Tolkien’s theory of morality and power, as encoded in OES metaphors throughout the trilogy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963947012462949" sec-type="methods">
<title>3 Methodology</title>
<p>This study applies the tools of Conceptual Metaphor Theory to 611 instances of metaphoric language in <italic>LotR</italic>. These include every instance of the OES (n = 346) in which power is conceptualized as a physical object. The study also includes metaphors by which individuals and groups are compared to objects, machines, plants, animals and natural phenomena (n = 265). Other metaphors are not examined.</p>
<p>Because the study has focused on a limited range of target domains and source domains, metaphor identification has been greatly simplified. For example, the narrow focus excludes most examples that could be attributed to metonymy or other non-metaphoric processes, which otherwise pose a recurrent problem in metaphor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947012462949">Heywood et al., 2002</xref>: 38–41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012462949">Pragglejaz Group, 2007</xref>). The only complicated case is that of supernatural objects such as the Ring itself. The Ring is a physical object that can be literally stolen, given, and so on, but at the same time represents power, which can only metaphorically be taken or given. As such, the Ring clearly is not a simple unidirectional metaphor, and involves a metaphoric blend unique to <italic>LotR</italic>, discussed and illustrated in Section 4.</p>
<p>Metaphor identification has focused on metaphoric ‘T-units’, or ‘linguistic units of discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462949">Crisp et al., 2002</xref>: 58) rather than on individual metaphorically used words (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012462949">Pragglejaz Group, 2007</xref>). That is, in ‘So long has the reach of our enemy become!’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 161) both <italic>long</italic> and <italic>reach</italic> could be judged as metaphorical words. Similarly, ‘his arm has grown long’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 377) could be deemed to contain three metaphoric words, <italic>arm, grown</italic> and <italic>long.</italic>) In this study, however, all the foregoing phrases, in their entirety, are each counted as one T-unit. On the other hand, ‘… victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched out his hand to seize it. But his arm was long’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 139) was counted as three metaphoric T-units (the two clauses in the first sentence, plus the second sentence).</p>
<p>The distinction between metaphoric words and T-units, including the complexity of these metaphors and the frequency of combinations of metaphors, can be a crucial aspect of an author’s style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947012462949">Heywood et al., 2002</xref>). This distinction was considered less relevant in the current study, given its focus on one trilogy, which was not compared with other authors’ works or texts, and considering that a limited range of metaphors were examined. As such, T-units were deemed most appropriate to the study’s aims, and smaller linguistic units were not considered.</p>
<p>On the conceptual side, metaphoric T-units were analysed based on the metaphoric mappings they involved. For example, <italic>his arm has grown long</italic> involves Control is Reach in the OES. The length of one’s reach, facilitating the acquisition of objects, maps to the degree to which one has control over events, enabling the achievement of one’s goals. Some metaphoric language evokes other mappings in the OES. When Glorfindel suggests that the failing of the three elven rings is acceptable to the Elves ‘if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion taken away for ever’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 352), the first T-unit maps the destruction of another’s possession onto the ending of another’s goal state (here, Sauron’s world domination) via Attributes are Possessions. The second instead maps the removal of an unwanted possession onto the cessation of an unwanted state (living in fear).</p>
<p>In examples such as the one just mentioned, mappings are identified in three steps. First, the relevant source-domain language is observed (<italic>broken</italic> in <italic>the power of Sauron may be broken</italic>). Next, a relevant underlying conceptual metaphor is identified (here, the OES). Because of the limited scope of the current study, these consisted of a limited set of metaphors well recognized in the literature. Finally, a search for counterparts of the source-domain vocabulary in the target domain is undertaken (here, Ending an Attribute for Destroying a Possession).</p>
<p>Following the identification of linguistic and conceptual metaphors, metaphoric T-units were categorized on the basis of the moral alignment of the forces or individuals in the target domain. In OES, these forces correspond to the agent in the source domain that owns or seeks an object, which maps onto the agent in the target domain that controls a power or wants to achieve a goal. Characters and powers in <italic>LotR</italic> were sorted into three classes of moral alignment proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">Perkins and Hill (1975)</xref>; the ‘corrupted’ such as Sauron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">1975</xref>: 62), here referred to as ‘evil’; those who have ‘withdrawn from the world’ such as Bombadil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">1975</xref>: 64), which I term ‘neutral’; and those with the stature of ‘hero’ such as Frodo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">1975</xref>: 69), which I will call ‘good’. The other categories of characters discussed by Perkins and Hill – ‘Great Ones’ such as Gandalf and Saruman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">1975</xref>: 66), and ‘men of Gondor’ such as Boromir and Faramir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462949">1975</xref>: 69), are divided between ‘good’ and ‘evil’ status. For example, Gandalf and Faramir are considered ‘good’, whereas Saruman and Boromir are ‘good’ until Saruman allies himself with Sauron, and until Boromir begins craving the Ring, at which point it seems fairly uncontroversial to say that they have fallen to evil. After this point, metaphoric descriptions of these characters’ behaviour is classified as ‘evil’ rather than ‘good’. Forces that have ‘withdrawn from the world’ play little role in the world’s power struggles, and few relevant examples of metaphors for ‘neutral’ powers were found (n = 16). Given the small number of instances of these metaphors, the current analyses focus on good and evil powers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963947012462949">
<title>4 The Ring as a metaphoric blend</title>
<p>Throughout <italic>LotR</italic>, the One Ring tests characters’ true nature. Some apparent heroes of the story, such as Boromir, are corrupted by the Ring; whereas Boromir’s brother Faramir remains incorruptible and thereby can ‘prove his quality’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 367). Any comparison of good and evil characters in <italic>LotR</italic>, and the metaphors describing them, must begin with the Ring itself. The Ring is both an object and an incarnation of power. Since ordinary physical rings are not powerful, the One Ring involves a metaphoric blend of the type discussed in Blending Theory (BT. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947012462949">Fauconnier, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462949">Fauconnier and Turner, 2002</xref>). This blend is based on the OES metaphor, which conceptualizes abstract properties, such as powers, as physical objects.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012462949">Lakoff and Johnson (1999</xref>: 196) attribute the mappings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462949">Figure 1</xref> to the OES metaphor. Note that all metaphors in this article are represented in BT rather than in Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) format as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012462949">Lakoff and Johnson (1999)</xref>. CMT includes only the two spaces labelled ‘Input Space 1’ and ‘Input Space 2’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462949">Figure 1</xref>, which in CMT are the target and source domains of a metaphor. BT representations also involve (minimally) the Blended Space in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462949">Figure 1</xref>. Simple instances of the OES, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462949">Figure 1</xref>, can be equally well represented in either BT or CMT. However, more complex metaphoric blends, such as that underlying the One Ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>), cannot be fully represented in CMT. For this reason BT is employed throughout.</p>

</fig>
<p>The Object Event-Structure blend is theorized to underlie expressions such as the following:<disp-quote>
<p>They just <italic>handed</italic> him the job. Fame and fortune were <italic>within my grasp</italic>, but once again they <italic>eluded</italic> me … He almost <italic>got his hands on</italic> the Johnson ranch, but it <italic>slipped through his fingers.</italic> She is <italic>pursuing</italic> an impossible dream.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012462949">Lakoff and Johnson, 1999</xref>: 197)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, Tolkien puts his own stamp on the conventional OES metaphor. Tolkien’s most frequent version of this metaphor is more specific, in that its target input tends to involve ‘Power’ rather than a more general ‘Attribute’. This Power is not necessarily desired, in the manner of a Purpose, but is necessarily attributed to some ‘possessor’ who may or may not wish to be powerful. As we will see, the desire for power in <italic>LotR</italic> is a sign of moral corruption.</p>
<p>The new specificity of the target input as Power leads to additional mappings, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0963947012462949" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0963947012462949-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In <italic>LotR</italic>, the responsibility of power is conceptualized as the weight of an object. Ultimately, this correspondence underlies Frodo’s physical suffering as he bears the Ring, and his increasingly frequent complaints such as ‘It’s heavy on me’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 399). Frodo experiences physical weight because he feels a moral obligation to resist the Ring’s power. If he were to decide to use the Ring for his own personal gain, presumably the weight would disappear along with his sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout <italic>LotR</italic>, only characters with a sense of responsibility in the use of Power feel the weight of the Ring. This inference is projected from the Power input to the blended space in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>. In <italic>LotR</italic>, the responsible use of power is a defining trait of morally good characters, as discussed in the next section. However, the Ring brings both physical weight and a sense of responsibility to its uncorrupted bearers. Additionally, the Ring is little, ‘so small a thing’, according to Boromir (<italic>FotR</italic>: 514). How can a tiny object be physically heavy? The Ring must be considered to involve a more complex blended structure than other ‘objects’ of power in <italic>LotR</italic>, and the representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref> must be refined to represent the Ring itself.</p>
<p>In the light of the blend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>, a ring is a counterintuitive choice for an object of power. It lacks the weight of the heavy things that typically represent emotional ‘burdens’ outside of <italic>LotR</italic>, such as boulders, stones, anvils, and so on. However, within the Nordic tradition that inspired aspects of Tolkien’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947012462949">Bowman, 2010</xref>), rings have a frame-based connection to the concept of power, in that chieftains would wear rings, and bestow these on their followers. For this reason men of power were often called ‘ring-givers’ or similar kennings, alluding to their role as the bestowers of gold rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947012462949">Jónsson, 1985</xref>). Based on these traditions, a ring connotes value and status, and can be considered an ideal prototype of a valuable possession, facilitating its choice as a representative of the category Object (a process illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947012462949">Sullivan and Sweetser, 2009</xref>). This allows the value, as well as additional properties of a ring, to be projected, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref> – boldfaced elements have values that project from only one space.</p>

</fig>
<p>Tolkien appears to have constructed this blend on his own. The concept of a ring that grants world domination appears in the <italic>Nibelungenlied</italic>, and hence in Wagner’s <italic>The Ring of the Nibelung</italic>, but Tolkien denies a resemblance between his One Ring and ‘der Nibelungen Ring’, claiming ‘Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947012462949">Carpenter, 1981</xref>: 306).</p>
<p>In most respects, the blend underlying the Ring is merely a special case of the OES. Power is a special case of a Purpose (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>), and a ring is a special case of an object. However, the blend representing Power as a Ring is more complicated than the simple representation of Power as an Object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>). The Power as Ring blend is no longer a unidirectional metaphor, because the Ring has a physical presence, such as its appearance, weight, as well as other properties not literally attributable to abstract power. These qualities are projected from Input Space 1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>. Crucially, the light weight of an ordinary ring is not projected. Rather, the Ring has a physical weight, courtesy of Input 1, but the value of this weight is felt as unusually heavy by many characters. This heavy value is projected from Input 2 and represents the responsibility associated with bearing the Ring.</p>

<title>5 The burden of responsibility</title>
<p>In the entire <italic>LotR</italic> trilogy, not one evil character finds power to be a ‘burden’, to be ‘heavy’ or a ‘weight’. In contrast, the trilogy contains 51 instances of good characters feeling burdened by power.</p>
<p>The Ring is the ‘burden’ of power and responsibility most central to the <italic>LotR</italic> story. Descriptions of the Ring’s ‘weight’ either indicate a psychological ‘weight’ (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>) or a ‘weight’ with a physical component (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>). The first mention of the Ring’s weight occurs when Frodo reasons that the ring Bombadil returns to him is ‘the same Ring’, ‘for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in his hand’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 185). Already the Ring seems to have a physical weight that can be felt in the hand. Most references to the Ring’s weight focus on the psychological aspect of its weight, as when Elrond calls it ‘a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another’, statements which could refer exclusively to the responsibility associated with the Ring, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>, and not the additional physical weight indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref> (<italic>FotR</italic>: 354–355).</p>
<p>The physical as well as psychological ‘weight’ of the Ring, for Frodo and other good characters, becomes increasingly clear as the trilogy progresses. <italic>FotR</italic> contains only one unambiguous instance of the blend shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>. When Frodo looks into the Mirror of Galadriel, ‘The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 471). The Ring becomes an increasingly physical burden as Frodo approaches Mordor. This is made clear near the end of <italic>TT</italic>, when Frodo ‘felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 300). Presumably, an ‘actual weight’ has a physical component, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>, in addition to the psychological component indicated in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>It seems that the characters of <italic>LotR</italic>, at least, believe in the physical weight of the Ring. Frodo frequently suffers physical effects from bearing the Ring, such as when the Eye of Mordor seeks him: (<italic>FotR</italic>: 471). Sam, too, believes in the Ring’s physical weight, which he senses when he thinks that Frodo is dead and temporarily takes up the Ring: ‘And then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great stone had been strung on him’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 434). Sam also removes physical encumbrances from Frodo to help offset the ‘burden’ of the Ring, demonstrating his belief that the Ring inflicts a physical strain (<italic>RotK</italic>: 263). Sam, unable to help Frodo with the psychological burden of the Ring, can only help offset the physical portion of its weight.</p>
<p>However, the weight of the Ring is never <italic>merely</italic> physical. Without the blend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref> and the projection of ‘Responsibility (Great)’ to the blended space, there is no reason for a small ring to be heavy. The weight of the Ring depends on this structure in Input 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>. This dependence is apparent in the physics of the Ring, and in the reactions of characters both good and evil who lack a sense of Responsibility (Great), such as Gollum and Tom Bombadil.</p>
<p>Since the Ring is only ‘heavy’ in the blended space, it lacks some of the properties of objects that are literally heavy. For example, it does not participate in the normal physics of weight, such as the additive nature of multiple weights. These exist only in Input 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>) and are not projected to the blend. When Sam lifts Frodo, who is carrying the Ring, Sam ‘expected to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed Ring. But it was not so’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 268). Frodo retains responsibility for the Ring, and this responsibility is not passed on to Sam via the physical action of carrying, so Sam feels no more than the weight of Frodo’s body and the normal insignificant weight of a ring.</p>
<p>Characters who, for various reasons, lack a sense of responsibility, also do not feel the extra ‘weight’ of the Ring as projected from Input 2. Even Gollum, warped and psychologically shattered by the Ring, never seems to have found it a ‘burden’ in all the years in which he bore it. Though the Ring caused him great suffering and he both ‘hated it and loved it’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 87), it was not heavy. The Power as Ring blend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that this is because Gollum felt no responsibility towards others in the use or ownership of the Ring.</p>
<p>Tom Bombadil, though not evil, feels no responsibility and so is not encumbered by the Ring, spinning it in the air like a toy and ‘seeming to make … light of’ it (<italic>FotR</italic>: 185). On the other hand, Tom differs from the evil characters in that he makes no attempt to keep the ring. The target-domain interpretation of Tom’s reaction to the Ring seems clear: responsibility (weight) comes only with power (here, the Ring). There is no evil in refusing both power and responsibility. To Bombadil, power, even the ownership of the land on which he lives, ‘would indeed be a burden’, Goldberry recounts (<italic>FotR</italic>: 174). Tom therefore subscribes to the same version of the OES metaphor as the ‘good’ characters in <italic>LotR</italic>, in that he conceptualizes power as a burden. Unlike them, however, Tom rejects this burden and the weight that accompanies it.</p>
<p>Power as a Ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>) predicts that neither Gollum nor Tom Bombadil will feel the ‘weight’ of the Ring, since neither character feels a responsibility to society. Without this element in the Input 2, only the normal inconsequential weight of a ring is projected to the blended space from Input 1. This is similar to the case of Sam carrying Frodo, though here Sam’s lack of responsibility is more transitory. Instead of generally lacking an obligation to use the Ring responsibly, Sam is spared this responsibility because he is not currently the Ring-bearer. Only someone with responsibility for the Ring feels its psychological and physical weight.</p>
<p>When honourable characters in <italic>LotR</italic> feel ‘burdened’ by powers other than the Ring, the burden is only psychological, not physical, as in the simpler blend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>. The latter blend pervades <italic>LotR</italic> alongside Power as a Ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>), complementing and reinforcing the inferences about power and responsibility generated by Power as a Ring. For instance, Gandalf describes the leadership of the coming Age as a ‘burden’, telling Aragorn, ‘The burden must lie now upon you and your kindred’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 308). Seemingly smaller tasks, such as Aragorn’s guardianship of Frodo, may also be weighty; in this case, ‘the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him’ to guard Frodo (<italic>FotR</italic>: 477). Decisions are especially ‘weighty’ for Tolkien’s good characters, such as when ‘the burden is laid on’ Frodo to decide whether to break the Fellowship, and he remarks that ‘the burden is heavy’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 512–513); or when Faramir recounts his recent actions and decisions to his father King Denethor, saying, ‘I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement was thrust on me’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 103–104). In these cases, however, there is no indication that responsibility is felt as a physical weight; it is a purely psychological one, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Neither does a sense of responsibility increase the weight of other physical burdens in the way that it does the weight of the Ring. Responsible characters are not more bothered by physical encumbrances than evil or irresponsible ones. Throughout the trilogy, all the Fellowship wear heavy packs, weapons and armour, but these do not feature much in the story nor appear to irritate good characters more than evil ones. In fact, Gimli the Dwarf (at every stage an honourable and responsible character) brags about his own carrying power, saying that when men may falter, ‘a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 506). Only the Ring itself ‘weighs’ both physically and psychically on responsible characters. Otherwise, physical burdens have only a physical weight and responsibilities have only a psychological ‘weight’.</p>

<title>6 Gardeners and thieves</title>
<p>The ‘weight’ of power is not the only mapping in the OES that varies depending on the characters involved. The manner in which a Power/Object is ‘acquired’ is equally variable, though this distinction is tied less to a sense of responsibility and more directly to the characters’ ethical stance. In Tolkien’s version of the OES metaphor, evil characters and forces tend to ‘seize’ power by force, or ‘steal’ it by trickery (13 of 17 instances of these metaphoric mappings involved evil powers); whereas good characters tend to become powerful via ‘gifts’, ‘inheriting’ or even ‘cultivating’ power as one would a garden (15 of 21 examples involved good powers).</p>
<p>The importance of the means by which power is ‘acquired’ is, as in most cases of the OES in <italic>LotR</italic>, most evident in the Ring. Every potential or actual Ring-bearer is peculiarly obsessed with the manner in which the Ring is obtained or lost. Gollum, for instance, murders his companion in order to steal the Ring, and yet he ‘called the Ring his “birthday present”, and he stuck to that’, as Gandalf relates (<italic>FotR</italic>: 89). When Bilbo finds the Ring on the ground – a relatively neutral manner of acquisition – Bilbo claims it was a ‘present’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 34–35), a more elevated means of acquisition than the reality, and Gollum considers Bilbo a ‘thief’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 327), a less legitimate means of acquisition.</p>
<p>Frodo, it might be argued, is judged the most appropriate Ring-bearer at the Council of Elrond in part because he has inherited the Ring from Bilbo. Despite the legitimacy of this acquisition, Frodo later becomes defensive of the Ring, in the manner of the other Ring-bearers. At the end of <italic>TT</italic>, Sam reluctantly takes the Ring from Frodo’s unconscious body, believing Frodo to be dead. When Sam then offers the Ring back to Frodo, he cries out, ‘snatching the Ring and chain from Sam’s hands’ and calling him a ‘thief’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 230).</p>
<p>These delusions stretch back to Isildur, the first Ring-bearer, who takes the Ring by force from Sauron. Isildur legitimizes this acquisition by calling the Ring ‘weregild’ for his father and brother, who died at Sauron’s hand (<italic>FotR</italic>: 320) and says that the Ring is ‘precious to me, though I buy it with great pain’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 332). Isildur describes the Ring as a purchase or a compensatory payment for past wrongs, though he gave nothing in exchange for the Ring, nor was it given to him in payment.</p>
<p>The Ring deludes even non-bearers as to the way in which it has been, or can be, acquired. Before Boromir attempts to steal the Ring from Frodo by force, he says ‘It is a gift’, echoing the assertions of Gollum and Bilbo under the Ring’s influence (<italic>FotR</italic>: 515). Clearly, the manner in which the Ring is obtained is of great importance. The Ring is able to corrupt the minds of bearers to believe that it was obtained by legitimate means, and that the Ring itself is consequently good rather than evil. The Ring is ‘of all the works of Sauron, the only fair’, Isildur recounts, thereby showing the influence of the Ring that ultimately leads to his downfall (<italic>FotR</italic>: 332).</p>
<p>As in the case of ‘weight’, the Ring has much in common with other powers in <italic>LotR</italic> in terms of the manner in which these powers are ‘acquired’. Stealing (<italic>RotK</italic>: 158), seizing (<italic>RotK</italic>: 139), and even taking (<italic>FotR</italic>: 328; <italic>FotR</italic>: 517; <italic>RotK</italic>: 29) are strategies of the enemy, as when Sauron is ‘taking shape and power again’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 328). Taking by force is facilitated by a longer reach. This is expressed as Control is Reach in the blend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figure 2</xref>. Just as greater reach allows more objects to be grasped (in Input 1), greater control over individuals and events allows more purposes to be fulfilled (in Input 2). Reach is more relevant in non-consensual taking or stealing than in unopposed forms of object acquisition – say, raising vegetables or inheriting keepsakes – with the implication that ‘long arms’ and ‘long reach’ tend to be attributed more to evil individuals than to good ones in <italic>LotR</italic>. Sauron’s arm, hand, and even fingers are described as ‘long’, as in the previously mentioned example, ‘…victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched out his hand to seize it. But his arm was long’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 139); or as when Pippin ‘thought of the long fingers of the Shadow: of the Orcs in the woods and the mountains …’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 43).</p>
<p>On the other hand, admirable characters and forces tend towards more peaceable means of ‘acquiring’ powers and abilities. Many good characters (n = 21), but few evil ones (n = 9) are ‘given’ powers and abilities. The Ents, for example, received a ‘great gift’, the power of speech, from the Elves (<italic>TT</italic>: 95); Boromir speculates as to whether Aragorn has ‘inherited … the sinews of the Kings of Men’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 351); Gandalf sees from afar with ‘the sight that was given to him’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 161); and Aragorn, seeing the sick to be healed, says, ‘Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 170). Often, these come with the understanding that they will be passed on to others, or used for good. This is perhaps most evident in Galadriel’s gift to Sam, consisting of a box of earth from Galadriel’s orchard and a <italic>mallorn</italic> seed. This gift is a blend of a physical object and a power, as is the Ring itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">Figure 3</xref>): the soil is a physical substance that grants the power of supernatural plant growth. Near the end of the trilogy, when the hobbits return to find the Shire ravaged, Frodo recommends to Sam: ‘Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, Sam … and then use the gift to help your work and better it’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 374). Sam already ‘has’ gardening abilities of his own, and both his previously ‘possessed’ and newly ‘given’ abilities are intended to benefit others. Sam recognizes this when he says, ‘I’m sure the Lady would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 374). When good powers are ‘given’, they are without exception intended to be employed for good, and for the benefit of others as well as oneself.</p>
<p>Good powers and abilities are in fact often grown like plants without involving any type of gift exchange. ‘There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit’, Tolkien writes, ‘waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 194). The courage is not a ‘gift’; it instead is grown by the individual who then ‘possesses’ it. The same is true of other attributes, such as when ‘Health and hope grew strong in’ the hobbits in Rivendell (<italic>FotR</italic>: 358). Cultivation does not necessarily happen within an individual; it may also be ‘grown’ externally, such as when Théodan tells his riders, ‘though you fight upon an alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own forever’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 135). In the most complex metaphor of this type, Gandalf says one must spend the present ‘uprooting the evil in the fields we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 190). In this case, the ‘clean earth’ will presumably produce all kinds of good effects, whatever goals they may strive to achieve.</p>
<p>The only instances of good characters obtaining power illicitly, such as by trapping, deceiving or stealing, are found in accusations by characters who are themselves corrupted or deceived. Frodo’s accusation of Sam as a ‘thief’ has already been mentioned. In addition, Denethor accuses Gandalf of trying to ‘use’ him as a ‘tool’, of ‘stealing half my son’s love’, and conspiring to ‘steal’ his knights’ loyalty so that they ‘rob me wholly of my son at last’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 158); and Saruman accuses Frodo of having ‘robbed my revenge of its sweetness’ so that he must go forth ‘in debt to your mercy’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 369). These accusations by corrupted or deceived characters in <italic>LotR</italic> are the only instances in the trilogy of good characters metaphorically ‘taking’ or ‘stealing’ either the Ring or other types of power.</p>
<p>In general, responsible characters feel the ‘weight’ of the Ring and other powers, and ‘obtain’ the Ring or other powers as gifts, inheritances, or harvests. Evil characters, while not ‘burdened’ by the Ring or other powers, tend to ‘obtain’ these powers by violent or deceitful means. The pervasiveness of these trends in <italic>LotR</italic> serves to distinguish the good from the bad in the world of Middle-earth. Particularly, the reflection of the trends of ‘weight’ and ‘giving/taking’ in powers other than the Ring reinforces the theme of the Ring as a test of characters, who prove themselves by either bearing the weight of the Ring or by stealing it through treachery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963947012462949">
<title>7 Objects, plants and animals</title>
<p>Good effects, according to Gandalf’s quotation given earlier, may be cultivated in tilled earth. Evil, however, is not grown, but is instead seized like a valuable object. This distinction is related to a more general theme in <italic>LotR</italic>, by which good is associated with plants, and evil with animal vermin and manmade artefacts. Most of the metaphors of these types are purely image metaphors, such as when Goldberry is called ‘a sunlit flower’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 189). Other metaphors combine image metaphor and the Location Event-Structure metaphor, such as when armies are compared to ‘tides’, which may both visually resemble the sweep of an army and have the destructive power of an army. A few instances do not involve image metaphor at all, as when Gandalf warns that ‘Saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in’, meaning that Saruman’s evil dealings with Sauron will cause him mental pain – The Mind is a Body – and he will be unable to break free and pursue his other goals – Location Event-Structure metaphor – (<italic>TT</italic>: 261). In comparing good and evil in <italic>LotR</italic>, the choice of metaphor type is less revealing than the representation of good and evil powers as plants, animals or objects. In the foregoing example, the ‘vice’ is a special case of an Obstacle in the Location Event-Structure metaphor and a Cause of Pain in The Mind is a Body, but more relevantly, it is a manmade inanimate object, as opposed to a plant or animal. Metaphoric artificial ‘objects’ such as the vice tend to be evil rather than good.</p>
<p>Overall, plants tended to image-metaphorically describe good characters (11 of 13 examples), especially men as trees (<italic>TT</italic>: 34, 168, 219, 341), with Galadriel once described as a ‘tree in flower’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 365). The description of warriors as trees is likely to have been inspired by the Norse kenning tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947012462949">Jónsson, 1985</xref>), and yet Tolkien – unlike the Norse literary authors – applies tree image metaphors only to good characters. In the trilogy, only Galadriel and Goldberry are described as flowers, both via image metaphors with special reference to their slenderness. Sam describes Galadriel as ‘Sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 365), and Goldberry is called ‘small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky’ (<italic>FotR</italic>: 189).</p>
<p>The metaphors discussed in this section are frequently expressed as similes, as is typical of image metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012462949">Sullivan, 2007</xref>). Similes are here considered metaphoric, since their interpretation depends on the same conceptual structures as metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947012462949">Lakoff and Turner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012462949">Sullivan, 2007</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012462949">Pragglejaz Group, 2007</xref>: 32). Though the semantic differences between ‘metaphors’ and ‘similes’ (i.e. differences in meaning related to the presence or absence of <italic>like</italic>, in English) are undeniable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947012462949">Chiappe and Kennedy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947012462949">Glucksberg and Keysar, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947012462949">1993</xref>), these distinctions are not deemed relevant to the contrasts discussed here. Indicating that Galadriel is ‘like a great tree’ involves the same metaphor as ‘Galadriel is a great tree’ – in both cases Galadriel is image-metaphorically described as a plant.</p>
<p>When evil forces are described as organic life-forms, they are not flowers or trees but pests: vermin and destroyers of plants. Orcs, Uruk-hai and the armies of evil are termed ‘rats’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 221; <italic>TT</italic>: 228; <italic>TT</italic>: 220); or ‘swarming’ insects such as ‘beetles’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 110), ‘flies’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 186) or ‘ants’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 174). Non-animal pestilences also represent evil, such as poisons (<italic>TT</italic>: 160; <italic>RotK</italic>: 319), or the ‘great camps of tents’ that ‘sprouted, like a foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered city …’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 116). In one of the rare instances in which evil is described as a plant, it is a weed, an undefined type of vegetable pest, when Gandalf refers to ‘uprooting the evil in the fields we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 190). However, evil is more often a pestilential animal (n = 48), such as a rat or insect, than a plant (n = 2) or a fungus/disease (n = 16).</p>
<p>Animals in general are more associated with evil than with good (48 evil vs. 27 good examples). This imbalance can mostly be attributed to a few favourite animal metaphors for creatures of evil, such as ‘rats’, as already noted, or ‘snakes’, an epithet used to describe many of the major villains of <italic>LotR</italic>, including the Nazgul (<italic>FotR</italic>: 317; <italic>TT</italic>: 400), Orcs (<italic>FotR</italic>: 422; <italic>TT</italic>: 422; <italic>RotK</italic>: 224), Saruman (<italic>TT</italic>: 237; <italic>RotK</italic>: 319), Wormtongue (<italic>TT</italic>: 159), Mordor’s Messenger (<italic>FotR</italic>: 317) and Gollum (<italic>TT</italic>: 426). Gollum, in fact, seems particularly animalistic, and is compared to a cat (<italic>TT</italic>: 377), dog (<italic>TT</italic>: 306), eel (<italic>TT</italic>: 377), fish (<italic>FotR</italic>: 497), fox (<italic>FotR</italic>: 497), frog (<italic>TT</italic>: 283; <italic>TT</italic>: 427), grasshopper (<italic>TT</italic>: 283), hedgehog (<italic>TT</italic>: 377), insect (<italic>TT</italic>: 321), maggot (<italic>FotR</italic>: 85), mouse (<italic>TT</italic>: 280) and spider (<italic>TT</italic>: 278, 411). Most animals, then – and especially those considered vermin – tend to describe evil beings. This suggests that it is only plants, and not living beings in general, that are imagistically compared to good individuals and groups in <italic>LotR</italic>.</p>
<p>Both good and evil are described as forces of nature, such as tides (<italic>TT</italic>: 69, 131; <italic>Rotk</italic>: 87,136), wind (<italic>TT</italic>: 168, 184, 187, 256, 220), sea (<italic>TT</italic>: 175, 293; <italic>RotK</italic>: 206) stones (<italic>FotR</italic>: 333; <italic>TT</italic>: 127, 152, 217, 394; <italic>RotK</italic>: 57, 157, 208, 274), stars (<italic>FotR</italic>: 260, 299; <italic>TT</italic>: 418; <italic>RotK</italic>: 139), and storms (<italic>TT</italic>: 95, 128, 149, 151, 167, 171, 216, 221, 242, 256, 384, 401; <italic>RotK</italic>: 24, 75, 97, 207, 245). Of these 63 metaphors, 28 refer to the forces of good, 25 to evil, and 6 to neutral forces, a relatively even breakdown. Unsurprisingly, evil forces are more associated with destructive natural phenomena, particularly those damaging to plants and crops, such as storms (13 of 18 instances); whereas good forces are more often described as less destructive natural objects, such as stones (6 of 8 instances), or harmless beautiful phenomena, such as stars (3 of 4 instances). Taken as a whole, inorganic natural objects and phenomena seem neutral in <italic>LotR</italic>, and take part in metaphors describing good and evil forces alike.</p>
<p>Man-made objects tell a completely different story. Tolkien sets these up in opposition to living beings, especially plants, and represents evil forces and characters as artificial objects or manufactured materials (10 of 12 instances are evil). The source domains of these metaphors are devices and materials of the level of technology assumed in Middle-earth. Presumably comparisons to more advanced machinery would detract from the world-building and timelessness of the work. Nevertheless, any kind of machinery is depicted negatively. Treebeard’s description of Saruman exemplifies this perspective, when he says that Saruman ‘has a mind of metal and wheels; he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 96). Saruman has met his match in Sauron, and as Gandalf puts it, ‘will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 261). Gandalf also calls Saruman ‘the spider in a steel web’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 260), suggesting that if Saruman is a predatory animal, then Sauron is an animal-machine hybrid that weaves steel webs – presumably a more sinister combination than a mere natural spider. This hybrid recurs, such as when Sauron ‘had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel’ (<italic>RotK</italic>: 206), as an animal with steel components, or when Orcs’ tireless motion is described as ‘tough thick legs going up and down … as if they were made of wire and horn’ (<italic>TT</italic>: 69). If both animals and artificial objects are mapped onto evil beings, then presumably the most dreadful combination is an animal built of or including mechanical components. Unsurprisingly, none of these hybrids are mapped onto good characters or forces, which are not typically represented either as animals or as artificial objects.</p>

<title>8 Conclusion</title>
<p>The One Ring is only the most obvious of a set of metaphors that test characters’ ‘quality’ in <italic>LotR</italic>. Certainly, characters’ reaction to the Ring gives definitive insight into their moral nature. We do not know, until Boromir tries to steal the Ring, that he cannot be trusted; nor do we know that his brother Faramir is trustworthy until he lets the Ring go. Throughout the trilogy, Frodo offers the Ring to characters such as Gandalf and Galadriel, and their refusal proves that they can be trusted without reservations. Good characters bear the Ring as a burden, whereas only the evil try to take it.</p>
<p>However, the Ring is just one of many such tests of character in <italic>LotR</italic>. In both the OES and Power as a Ring blends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947012462949">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963947012462949">3</xref>), weight maps onto responsibility. Characters that metaphorically feel authority and power as a ‘burden’ demonstrate that they are responsible individuals, whether this ‘weight’ belongs to the Ring or to another source of power. Those that do not feel this weight may either lack power over others, in which case they are ‘carrying’ nothing, as in the case of Tom Bombadil; or far more often, the characters are evil and seek power without responsibility. Tolkien indicates this distinction subtly but consistently in both the OES and Ring blends.</p>
<p>Object transfer, along with object weight, figures in both the OES and the Ring blends. Characters in <italic>LotR</italic> are fixated on the manner in which the Ring is transferred, scheming, lying, and even calling it a ‘birthday present’ instead of the result of theft and murder. Characters repeatedly want to think of it as a ‘gift’, as if acquiring it in a legitimate manner makes the Ring good rather than evil. Though these characters are lying to themselves, their obsession is well founded, insofar as the manner in which power is ‘obtained’ in <italic>LotR</italic> does serve to distinguish good from evil. Ominous powers are constantly striving for power, stealing or seizing it, even lengthening their ‘reach’ in order to bring more power within their grasp. Good power is ‘obtained’ peacefully: it is inherited, given, or grown organically.</p>
<p>This special case of the OES in which powers and abilities are ‘grown’ is noteworthy partly in that it reflects the division between the metaphoric mapping of objects and plants in <italic>LotR</italic>. It is not coincidence that the Ring is an artificial thing. It has some animalistic qualities, devouring and seducing its bearers, but it remains a manmade object. Tolkien’s metaphors in general give a less preferential place to artificial objects, drawing on these as metaphoric source domains primarily for the description of evil. Plants, on the other hand, are overwhelmingly associated with good and utilized as source domains in metaphoric descriptions of elves, warriors, and benevolent beauties. Plants sustain life, and the peaceful cultivation of crops is in Tolkien’s model the complete antithesis of obtaining inedible objects by force.</p>
<p>For exactly the same reasons that the Ring is a test of responsibility and moral character, then, other powers and abilities also test these qualities. In the version of the OES in <italic>LotR</italic>, weight maps onto responsibility, and giving and stealing map respectively onto moral and immoral power. The OES and Power as a Ring are identical in this respect. The significance of the Ring, and its role as a test of character, is thereby subtly reinforced throughout the trilogy by matched mappings in the OES and Power as a Ring.</p>
<p>The consistency of these repeated metaphors contributes to the internal logic of Tolkien’s Middle-earth and intensifies the affect of the One Ring. From the beginning of the trilogy, we are presented with metaphors for power that prepare us for the inexorable challenge of the Ring. Even minor abilities and positions of authority in Middle-earth must be ‘given’, ‘cultivated’ or otherwise handled according to moral rules. Hundreds of these metaphors establish the moral rules of Tolkien’s world and prepare us for the moment when Frodo stands with the Ring over the Crack of Doom, when no doubt remains as to Frodo’s evil fate if he keeps the Ring. The coherent construction of a distinctive metaphoric theme in <italic>LotR</italic> arguably adds to the believability of Middle-earth, the epic quality of its good and evil forces, and above all, the emotional intensity of Frodo’s struggle with the Ring over the course of the trilogy.</p>
