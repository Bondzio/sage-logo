Davies has produced a well-argued and well-reasoned discussion of the rise of network governance theory in the 1980s and 1990s and its diffusion into neo-liberal and Third Way political projects. The book represents the culmination of many years of scholarship, and it is an excellent read. It is definitely one of the best syntheses of network governance currently in the market. The issues being discussed here matter; in a context of austerity governance, underpinned by crude characterisations of bureaucratic illegitimacy and inefficiency, there is no better time to reflect on what the state has become and how it can best be understood. Davies’ call for a wider deployment of Gramscian dialectics and ways of approaching contemporary governance problems has much appeal. His critique of the claims made for network governance is powerful, as is his conclusion; that such theories act as a cover for the wider rolling-out of neo-liberal governance. It is perhaps little surprise that this period of networked or liquid modernity has seen some of the biggest transfers of wealth to elite groups in human history.</p><p>And yet, despite these real strengths some of the discussion in the book already feels a little dated. This is perhaps a reflection of the speed with which the realities it discusses are changing. Whatever the reason, I was left with a nagging doubt that the critique of governance theories is perhaps overplayed here and there seems to be a tension at the heart of the discussion. On one hand, it rightly criticises network-based concepts for overplaying the death of government and the conversion of modern hierarchies and nation-states into what Beck famously termed ‘zombie’ categories. As the discussion demonstrates, these structures are very much alive and with us. Crude understandings of the transformation that privilege change over continuity are doomed to fail. On the other hand, I would also argue that Davies’ approach understates the long-term effects of these ways of thinking on the structures of the state. Decades of state modernisation and the relentless promotion of what the United Nations and World Bank term ‘good governance’ agendas have begun to create new network-based political realities. In countries across the European Union, there has been a systematic corrosion of government control of welfare state systems. This, as Davies contends, has little to do with a wider empowerment agenda or the devolution of decision-making and control to community groups or nongovernmental organisations. Instead, it represents a government-led agenda to redefine the <italic>raison d’etre</italic> of the state and to privatise the services and assets that states have traditionally provided. The belief that government bureaucracies are out-dated, lack legitimacy, and are unable to manage the new complexities of globalisation becomes a self-fulfilling discursive orthodoxy. Davies hints at the importance of privatisation by stating this in his conclusions without really outlining its wider implications for the arguments he is developing.</p><p>This raises a wider set of questions over the changing nature of capitalism that are not engaged with here but are critical to understandings of contemporary governance. Authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612465387">Levi-Faur and Gilad (2004)</xref> have charted the rise of what they term the ‘regulatory state’ and ‘regulatory capitalism’ or a context in which there is ‘increased delegation to business and professional self-regulation and to civil society, to intra-national and international networks of regulatory experts, and increased regulation of the state by the state, much of it regulation through and for competition’ (p. 11). The emergence of regulatory capitalism explains the apparent paradox despite decades of neo-liberalism states ‘spending ever higher proportions of [their] budgets on regulation’ (Braithwaite, 2008: p. xi). This is particularly surprising given that ‘the rise of neo-liberalism was supposed to result in deregulation, the retreat of the state, and the triumph of markets and business interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465387">Jordana and Levi-Faur, 2005</xref>: p. 10). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465387">Braithwaite (1999)</xref>, this means that ‘not only political science is an anachronism, but public law as something separate from private law and private self-interest is equally so’ (p. 90).</p><p>In this understanding of contemporary capitalism, state bureaucracies and hierarchies have not become zombies, but regulators and managers overseeing the emergence of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612465387">Cutler (2002</xref>) terms private international regimes. Little is mentioned in Davies’ book on the rise of international investment funds, global limited liability partnerships, the power of the Big 4 accountancy firms, and/or the role of other corporations who are increasingly taking on the functions once monopolised by the state. In the context of austerity, governments are opening up state systems to private investors at an ever-increasing rate. It is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465387">Harvey (2003</xref>) terms as a process of accumulation by dispossession, organised and implemented by reforming governments and, as Davies suggests, legitimated by network theories that claim that privatisation is a logical response to new social and economic realities. The result, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612465387">Murphy (2011</xref>) contends, is that new forms of elitism have been established in which powerful private sector investors benefit by ‘securing irrevocable contractual claims over taxation revenues that they will manage henceforth in their own private companies which they claim will undertake the tasks of the state so much better than the state could do itself’ (p. 30).</p><p>The rise of powerful corporations similarly challenges some of the foundational understandings of contemporary governance and state theory outlined in the book. If such bodies are able to shape regulatory environments and state reforms to meet their own interests then where does this leave traditional assumptions about the democratic state and the role of governments? In the United Kingdom, for example, the long-term ownership and the management of large sections of the welfare state, from hospitals to roads, have been contracted out to global investors. The Private Finance Initiative in which private companies design, build, operate, and manage assets has reached an unparalleled scale, with the UK Treasury facing over £300b of contractual repayments to private companies over the next 30–35 years (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465387">Raco, 2013</xref>). In the UK Budget Statement of 2012, it was made clear that the future welfare infrastructure would be funded, to an even greater degree, by international finance, with the state’s role being converted into that of an ‘intelligent client’ that negotiates, manages, and enforces contracts. Similar policy trends are occurring in the European Union, North America, Australasia, and much of the Global South. The result, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612465387">Murphy (2011</xref>) argues, is that for private investors, the world’s most profitable business opportunities are now to be found in acquiring long-term, relatively low-risk, state-backed contracts that once obtained, provide monopoly income. These companies want to be shielded from public scrutiny and democratic accountability, meaning that their involvement comes at what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612465387">Levi-Faur (2011</xref>) terms a ‘liberty cost’.</p><p>The implications for government and governance are profound. If policy-makers and their constituents no longer have the power to affect change because hierarchies have been disempowered then what is the purpose of a political process founded on deliberation, elections, and the implementation of policy manifestoes? Moreover, where does this leave the so-called Good Governance agenda and its promises of enhanced devolution, localism, and community ownership? In a context where decisions are increasingly taken by elite contract negotiators, including global lawyers, accountants, and high level state bureaucrats, what role is left for other social and political interests? Once acquired under contract, it is not uncommon for state assets to be commodified and sold and resold for enormous profits by private companies. This, in turn, generates new governance complexities as it fractures and rescales asset ownership and shifts power and accountability to the global scale.</p><p>Elsewhere, I have termed this process as one of the hyper-pluralisation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612465387">Raco, in press</xref>), but in more practical terms, it means that across the European Union and elsewhere investment companies with banal names such as Semperian Plc. or Innisfree Investments have surreptitiously become key players and owners of welfare state assets and services, yet remain very much ‘off the radar’, when it comes to the critical scrutiny of academics and policy analysts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612465387">Crouch (2011</xref>) recently noted, orthodox theories of government and governance have been blind to the emergence of giant corporate monopolies and their control of state systems and this is a view that is increasingly shared by commentators on the political left and right (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8a-2043820612465387">Morton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612465387">Norman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>So, despite Davies’ impassioned appeal to reject the claim that there has been a transformation from government to governance, I would argue that there <italic>has</italic>, in fact, been a shift, but not in the way that network theorists imagined. In many instances, it is not too much government that is the problem but <italic>too little</italic>. If this is accepted then some of the limitations of the network governance theories laid out in Davies’ book would be given additional weight. It could be argued that in some instances, the existence or creation of stronger state bureaucracies may <italic>enhance </italic>the democratic accountability of welfare services and the state to publics, rather than detract from it. Bureaucracies can, if made accountable and responsive, act as important guarantors of individual and collective freedoms in ways that echo some of the rhetoric of the post-traditional governance agenda (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612465387">Du Gay, 2000</xref>). Moreover, if government bodies are empowered to take on greater responsibilities, then this can enhance their democratic legitimacy as what they choose to do, or to ignore, <italic>matters </italic>in policy terms. Nothing undermines this legitimacy more than signing away powers and obligations and devolving them to private organisations to manage and deliver on the state’s behalf.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612465387"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braithwaite</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1999</year>) <article-title>Accountability and governance under the new regulatory state</article-title>. <source>Australian Journal of Public Administration</source> <volume>58</volume>: <fpage>90</fpage>–<lpage>97</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr1a-2043820612465387"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braithwaite</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2008</year>) <source>Regulatory Capitalism: How it Works, Ideas for Making it Work Better</source>. <publisher-loc>Cheltenham, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Edward Elgar</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612465387"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crouch</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <source>The Strange Non-death of Neo-liberalism</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Polity Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612465387"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cutler</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2002</year>) <article-title>Private international regimes and interfirm competition</article-title>.
