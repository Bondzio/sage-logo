<abstract>
<p>Extant research suggests that gang membership is a relatively brief experience for youth who get involved with such groups. The length of gang membership, however, has been found to increase the probability of problematic outcomes in both the short term and into early adulthood. Given the risks associated with stable gang membership, the current study adds to the limited research on factors associated with relatively long periods of membership in youth gangs. Using panel data from 140 self-reported gang members derived from a school-based evaluation study, the current analysis examines whether features of youth gangs, the reasons youth provide for joining gangs, the respondents’ place in the gang, along with involvement in violent behaviors after onset of gang membership are systematically associated with the length of gang careers. Results suggest that joining gangs for protection, increased victimization after initial gang involvement, and greater involvement in violent delinquency are significantly associated with stable gang membership. Youth who join a gang at older ages also report staying in gangs longer than average. Having joined a gang to make money, however, was significantly related with desisting from gang involvement within 1 year. Potential reasons for such findings are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A common misconception related to youth gang members is that those who join gangs <italic>must</italic> remain in them for a significant period of time, even life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986212458196">Howell, 2007</xref>). Studies have shown, however, that most juveniles who identify themselves as gang members report that their membership in the group was less than 4 years, with most youth reporting a tenure of 1 year or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458196">Gatti, Tremblay, Vitaro, &amp; McDuff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458196">Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Esbensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, Smith, &amp; Tobin, 2003</xref>). Recent evidence presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn, Ward, Thornberry, Lizotte, and Chu (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde and Esbensen (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458196">2012</xref>), however, yet again highlights the deleterious short (e.g., decreased social bonds; increased violent behavior) and longer term effects (e.g., precocious transitions, unemployment) of prolonged gang membership, suggesting that identifying correlates of stable gang membership may help in distinguishing between transient and stable gang members so that targeted services can help to limit these unwanted outcomes. While there is limited research on the correlates of continued gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz, Sweeten, &amp; Piquero, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>), sample limitations hamper our ability to generalize from these findings. This study attempts to add to this literature by identifying features of youth gangs and their members that can help distinguish adolescents who are more likely to remain in gangs for longer periods of time than is typical of such youth.</p>
<p>The current study utilizes panel data to examine factors related to continued gang involvement. Unlike previous studies that have examined the ability of traditional risk factors for joining a gang to predict continued gang involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>) or respondent initial “embeddedness” in the gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al., 2012</xref>), we explore the organizational characteristics of the gang, the motivations youth described for initially joining the gang, involvement in delinquency and victimization, along with common demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, sex) to determine if such factors impact tenure in a gang. Specifically, we use a pooled cross-sectional design drawn from five waves of panel data collected as part of the National Evaluation of the Gang Resistance Education and Training program (G.R.E.A.T.), which was collected from 1996 to 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458196">Esbensen, Osgood, Taylor, Petersen, &amp; Freng, 2001</xref>) to examine the likelihood of youth reporting gang involvement over consecutive survey periods. This longitudinal design answers a call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458196">Krohn and Thornberry (2008)</xref> to use panel methods in the study of gangs, allowing for the establishment of time order in observed relationships.</p>

<title>Gang Membership in the Life Course</title>
<p>Much like the literature on crime and delinquency in the life course more generally, where a disproportionate amount of scientific study has focused on the initiation of deviant activities, research on gang members has focused on the risk factors associated with initial gang involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458196">Krohn &amp; Thornberry, 2008</xref>). Factors associated with either staying in the gang or leaving, however, have not been studied systematically (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458196">Klein &amp; Maxson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986212458196">Pyrooz &amp; Decker, 2011</xref>) even though ample evidence suggests that the average length of time spent in a gang is roughly a year or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458196">Gatti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde &amp; Esbensen, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458196">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458196">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). The processes associated with this decision, however, might not be similar to those associated with onset, as has been discussed with regard to crime and delinquency more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986212458196">Uggen &amp; Piliavin, 1998</xref>). That is, the risk factors associated with initially joining a gang might not impact the decision to remain gang involved over time.</p>
<p>Risk factors for gang membership generally fall in five domains: individual, family, peer, school, and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458196">Esbensen, Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Freng, 2009</xref>). While each dimension has been studied independently, and there is a large degree of overlap in risk factors associated with criminality and gang membership, researchers have found that the more risk factors a juvenile possesses, the more likely they are to join a gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458196">Klein &amp; Maxson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458196">Hill, Howell, Hawkins, &amp; Battin-Pearson, 1999</xref>). For instance, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al. (2001)</xref> suggested that while risk factors associated with individuals, neighborhoods, family, school, and peer groups were associated with a heightened probability of gang involvement, they concluded that the most important fact is that “risk factors add up” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>, p. 3). That is, youth in the study who experienced a high amount of risk (those with seven or more risk factors) were 13 times more likely than low-risk youth (respondents with zero or one risk factor) to join a gang. Even those with medium-risk (youth with 4-6 risk factors) were five times more likely to join a gang than the low-risk respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>). Overall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458196">Esbensen and colleagues (2009)</xref> summarized this literature by stating that “cumulative risk is clearly concentrated for gang-involved youths” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458196">Esbensen et al., 2009</xref>, p. 321).</p>
<p>While these studies provide a compelling look into why adolescents may choose to join a gang, the few studies that examined how these same risk factors relate to the <italic>duration</italic> of gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>) suggest that the same factors that may “push” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458196">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>) youth into the gang provide little discriminant validity in predicting those most likely to leave the gang after a short period of time. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill and colleagues’ (2001)</xref> study of Seattle youth suggested that the only risk factor significantly associated with stable gang membership was early signs of aggression and violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry and colleagues (2003)</xref> replicated this finding, while also suggesting that extreme poverty may also be associated with membership stability. Although it is imperative to understand risk factors that predict gang membership, gang research needs further exploration into the factors associated with gang member retention and desistance by moving beyond the traditional risk factor approach. Understanding this process is important because of the potential effects of longer gang membership on social networks and the potential for these effects to accumulate over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458196">Caspi, Elder, &amp; Bem, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458196">Caspi and colleagues (1987)</xref> describe cumulative continuity as a reciprocal relationship in which “maladaptive behaviors increasingly channel [people] into environments that perpetuate those behaviors; [maladaptive behaviors] are sustained by the progressive accumulation of their own consequences” (p. 308). In the contexts of youth gangs, cumulative continuity can work to sever social bonds that have the potential to provide resources to gang members. For example, school teachers, community leaders, or athletic coaches who might invest in a youth may choose not to do so on learning they are gang involved. Furthermore, even if youth leave their gang and attempt to repair prosocial ties, others are likely to retain their view of the individual, and thus interactions with others may remain consistent based on past labels associated with the youth (e.g., gang member). In a situation similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al. (2011)</xref>, damage to these social networks may lead to the situation in which youth can no longer access valuable resources, which can have substantial consequences on the life course trajectories of such youth. Krohn et al. argue that access to social capital in childhood, particularly in developing human capital, has a substantial impact on adult outcomes. This highlights the importance of understanding if longer exposure to gang membership works to compound damage to social networks and the inability of youth to access social capital associated with gang membership.</p>
<p>Drawing on both life course criminology and the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458196">Hagan (1993)</xref>, who demonstrated the consequences of weakened ties to mainstream social networks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al. (2012)</xref> examined how “embeddedness” in a gang affected the average duration of involvement. Their study sample used formally identified, adjudicated, serious felony offenders to determine if level of embeddedness in a gang at the baseline interview was associated with prolonged involvement in the group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al. (2012)</xref> found that higher levels of embeddedness in a gang were associated with longer terms of association with gangs, and suggested that the connections to more prosocial networks that are attenuated when youth become highly involved in gang activity likely resulted in an inability to access needed sources of social and human capital.</p>
<p>Recent evidence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde and Esbensen (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458196">2012</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn and colleagues (2011)</xref> empirically demonstrated the short- and long-term consequences of gang membership as applied to the very issues postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al. (2012)</xref>. In the short term, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde and Esbensen (2011)</xref> found that the very same risk factors that placed youth at risk for gang membership were further attenuated after youth became involved in these groups. For instance, youth who were relatively disconnected from school before gang onset, became even less committed to their studies after entering the group, which placed them at risk for failure or dropout, and thus the loss of a valuable source of social and human capital. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458196">Melde and Esbensen (2012)</xref> found that the heightened level of violence found in active gang members dissipated after youth left the gang, and thus continued involvement in the gang was associated with elevated levels of crime and delinquency more generally, but especially involvement in violence.</p>
<p>Similar to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458196">Caspi and colleagues (1987)</xref> and the propositions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry and colleagues (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al. (2011)</xref> found that prolonged gang membership in early adolescence led to deleterious outcomes in late adolescence and early adulthood. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al. (2011)</xref> found that prolonged gang membership in early adolescence increased the probability of “precocious transitions” in late adolescence, including leaving home early, cohabitation, teen parenthood, and dropping out of school. These off-age transitions then impacted both financial and familial problems in early adulthood, which ultimately increased the probability of involvement in street crime and/or arrest in early adulthood. Overall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that “the longer the adolescent stayed in the gang, the more disruption he or she experienced during emerging adulthood and in adulthood itself” (p. 1016). This was in spite of the fact that most youth in the study were in the gang for less than 2 years, thus highlighting the necessity of identifying youth at-risk for continued gang involvement.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>The current study explores whether gang organization, role centrality, reasons for joining a gang, and involvement in violent delinquency and victimization are systematically correlated with stable gang membership. Given that preexisting risk factors have fared poorly in discriminating between transient and stable gang members, with the exception of early aggressive and violent behavior, we instead examine subjective reasons for joining gangs and facets of the gang experience (i.e., things that happen after gang onset) to determine if such factors fare better in this task. Next we will briefly introduce these constructs and describe our hypotheses as they relate to stable gang membership.</p>
<sec id="section4-1043986212458196">
<title>Gang Role Centrality</title>
<p>As was discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz and colleagues (2012)</xref>, the gang experience of youth is heterogeneous. That is, just as not all gang members are alike, the experiences of individuals while in the gang are not constant. Evidence suggests that gang members can take on many different roles in the gang, with some playing far more central roles in the overall existence of the gang than others. Gang members are sometimes entitled president, vice president, prime minister, or war counselor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1966</xref>, p. 14), and sometimes leaders and regulars, associates, wannabes or recruits, and veterans or old gangsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1995</xref>, p. 84). These roles can be categorized as core members, in which the members are more involved, as opposed to fringe members, which fluctuate in terms of their activities and involvement with the gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458196">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1995</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458196">Vigil (1988)</xref> describes different roles that gang members may take, and the characteristics that are attached to these roles. For example, “regular members” join at early ages and participate on a regular basis with gang activities, while “peripheral members” have inconsistent participation in the gang, “temporary members” are those whose involvement in the gang may terminate at any time, and the “situational members” have episodic involvement with the gang. Many studies report that leadership roles are assigned to those members who are the best fighters or athletes, those who have the most problematic backgrounds, those most involved in criminal activity, or those who know the most about gangs in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986212458196">Hagedorn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458196">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458196">Vigil, 1988</xref>). Given this research, we hypothesize that those adolescents who report that they have more central roles in their gangs will be more likely to stay in the gang for longer periods of time than those adolescents who report more “fringe-type” roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043986212458196">
<title>Gang Organization</title>
<p>Research on the organizational capacity of youth gangs highlights the heterogeneous nature of these groups. For the most part, research suggests that gangs are not very organized units (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986212458196">Howell, 2007</xref>). There is a common misconception related to gangs with regard to the organizational capacity of these groups, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986212458196">Felson (2006)</xref> suggests is by design. That is, gangs often purvey a message of organization and internal structure that emphasizes the dedication needed to be in the gang, and the ability of the gang to control its members and (perhaps more importantly) those around them through rules and role expectations that set clear boundaries. In fact, gangs have produced documents (e.g., the Latin King Bible, laws) that detail these organizational features and group rules, and many have concocted severe ritualized initiation rituals to produce tight-knit social bonds among members; a common tactic among many groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458196">Aronson &amp; Mills, 1959</xref>). The actual organizational capacity of gangs is likely highly variable, but to the extent that groups maintain and use organizational features, such as initiation rituals, meetings, and rules, we would expect the probability of gang member stability to increase systematically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043986212458196">
<title>Reasons for Joining the Gang</title>
<p>Reasons that juveniles give for joining gangs vary dramatically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458196">Decker and Van Winkle (1996)</xref> provide a framework for understanding the motivation to join gangs in their discussion of the “pushes” (“an external force compelling gang membership” p. 65) and “pulls” (“forces that attract individuals to gangs” p. 65) that lead to the decision to join. The most common pushes for joining a gang are the need for protection and following in the footsteps of family or friends (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458196">Vigil, 1988</xref>). Common pull factors are the ability to make money and acquire status, while others have reported similar motivations such as having the opportunity to hang out, or fit in, with peers with similar interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986212458196">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458196">Spergel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While research is rather ambivalent about many of these factors as they relate to stable gang involvement, ample evidence suggests that gangs are typically unable to either protect their members or supply enough money making opportunities to overcome the hazards associated with black market activities (e.g., dealing drugs). For example, results have shown that gang-involved adolescents have an <italic>increased</italic> risk of victimization after joining a gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986212458196">Childs, Cochran, &amp; Gibson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986212458196">DeLisi, Barnes, Beaver, &amp; Gibson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458196">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986212458196">Taylor, Freng, Esbensen, &amp; Peterson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458196">Taylor, Peterson, Esbensen, &amp; Freng, 2007</xref>). The hypothesis in this study, then, is that adolescents who join gangs in hopes of reducing their violent victimization (i.e., for protection) will most likely remain in the gang for shorter periods of time than those who join for familial reasons or peer-related reasons due to the likelihood of increased victimization.</p>
<p>From a monetary perspective, research suggests that gang membership is unlikely to offer any substantial monetary rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458196">Papachristos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458196">Venkatesh, 1999</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458196">Papachristos (2005)</xref> suggests that gang members typically make roughly US$50 per day by selling drugs. Given the dangers associated with dealing drugs—or any other illegal activity for that matter—such as the possibility of being arrested, robbed, or assaulted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458196">Venkatesh (1999)</xref> suggested that the promises of monetary rewards are often not realized by gang youth, and thus stable gang membership is unlikely if money was a primary driving force in the decision to join. Furthermore, research in behavioral economics suggests that the tournament style of economic gain described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458196">Venkatesh (1999)</xref>, where most gang members make far less money than what they expected, will erode the ability of the social factors that push or pull youth into gangs to play a primary role in maintaining control over their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458196">Ariely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458196">Heyman &amp; Ariely, 2004</xref>). That is, when monetary norms enter an otherwise social relationship the relationship as a whole takes on the character of a monetary market, and effort is dictated by the perceived appropriateness of earnings. Given the low probability of making substantial amounts of money, we hypothesize that those who join gangs to make money will not remain in such groups for an extended period of time.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Data for the current study come from the longitudinal portion of the national evaluation of the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program (G.R.E.A.T.) conducted in the 1990s, which included more than 2,000 students nested within 22 schools across six cites in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458196">Esbensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458196">Esbensen et al., 2001</xref>). While the overall purpose of the original study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the school-based program, the data includes prospective information on a number of theoretical and policy-related constructs. For a more thorough description of the data and sampling strategy, please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458196">Esbensen and colleagues (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>The current study focuses on the correlates of stable gang membership, and thus we limit our sample to those respondents who both reported gang membership at some point during the study and who took part in the next wave of data collection. We placed this limitation on our usable sample given previous reports using the G.R.E.A.T. data that demonstrated the transient nature of gang membership in this sample, with gang membership lasting, on average, only one data point (reviewed in greater detail below). Furthermore, to be confident that students remained in the gang across more than one wave, and thus could be considered relatively stable gang members, they needed to provide data on their membership status at the subsequent wave of data collection. This restriction resulted in a sample of 140 self-reported gang members. Thirty-three respondents who were involved in the longitudinal portion of the study and reported gang membership on at least one occasion were eliminated from the study due to a lack of follow-up data. Attrition analysis suggest that there are no significant differences between the analysis sample and those omitted on factors such as sex, treatment status, and mean involvement in violent delinquency across the study. The analysis sample was, however, slightly more likely to include Hispanic/Latino respondents, and less likely to include non-Hispanic/White youth than their overall representation in the gang sample. The demographic breakdown of this group of respondents is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458196">Table 1</xref>. Overall, 59% of the sample is male, and the racial and ethnic makeup of the sample is rather diverse, with 26% of respondents reporting being White, 19% Black, 36% Hispanic, and 19% report some other race/ethnicity. The mean age is 12.91 years old, with a standard deviation of .89.</p>

<p>Our dependent variable is a dichotomous indicator of whether or not respondents reported gang membership across two consecutive waves of data collection. Gang membership was measured through the use of self-reports by respondents, the validity of which was discussed in great detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458196">Esbensen and colleagues (2001)</xref> using data from the same evaluation.

Overall, the number of gang members declined across time, and 57.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 81) of those in the study only reported gang membership at one wave. To be considered a stable gang member youth had to report gang membership at two consecutive waves of data collection, and 59 (42.1%) respondents fit this description.</p>

<title>Gang centrality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458196">Esbensen (2002)</xref> used a five-concentric-ring response scale, resembling a target, in the student survey to determine how central each respondent was to their respective gang, with 1 equal to the center of the gang, and 5 equal to the most outside or peripheral member. This measure, along with all other measures, except for change in violent victimization (described below), was taken at the initial wave of self-reported gang involvement. The mean place in the gang was 2.14, with a standard deviation of 1.69.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043986212458196">
<title>Gang organization</title>
<p>The organizational characteristics of the gang were assessed through a variety score drawn from seven dichotomous variables representing whether the gang had initiation rites, established leaders; regular meetings, specific rules; specific roles for members, roles for each age group, and specific symbols and/or colors. The range for this variable was zero to seven, with a mean of 4.39 and a standard deviation of 2.28.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043986212458196">
<title>Reasons for joining</title>
<p>Eight reasons for joining the gang were assessed in the analysis, each of which was measured dichotomously. Respondents were asked if they joined the gang for fun, for protection, because a friend was in the gang, because a sibling was in the gang, because they were forced to join, to get respect, to make money, and to fit in. The most commonly reported reason for joining for this sample was because a friend was in the gang (36%), while the least commonly reported reason was that they were forced to join (7%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043986212458196">
<title>Increased victimization</title>
<p>Because many youth report joining a gang for protection from the threat of violent victimization, we created a dichotomous violent victimization change score. This change score reflects whether or not the frequency of violent victimization taken at the follow-up survey was greater than that taken at the initial report of gang membership. Unlike previous examinations of the effect of gang membership on violent victimization, this figure represents the lagged effect of gang membership on violent victimization, not the difference in violent victimization between pre- and postgang exposure, as the current study is an examination of the continuation of gang activity. This measure was based on the sum of three items (i.e., how many times in the last 6 months have you “been hit by someone trying to hurt you”; “had someone use a weapon or force to get money or things from you”; and “been attacked by someone with a weapon or by someone trying to seriously hurt or kill you”) measured at the time of initial gang involvement and the subsequent wave of data collection. Overall, 19% of the respondents reported increased violent victimization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043986212458196">
<title>Violent delinquency</title>
<p>Involvement in violent delinquency was measured at the time of initial gang involvement and represents the variety of violent delinquency items involved in by each respondent. The items that comprise this index include carrying hidden weapons for protection, hitting others with the idea of hurting them, attacking others with a weapon, using a weapon or force to get money or thing from people, involvement in gang fights, and having shot at someone. Responses ranged from zero to six, and the overall sample mean was just over two items (mean = 2.14; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.77).</p>

<sec id="section16-1043986212458196">
<title>Analysis Strategy</title>
<p>To examine the relationships between our constructs of interest and the stability of gang membership, we use both bivariate and multivariate techniques. At the bivariate level we examine the associations using either chi-square analyses or independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests depending on the distribution of the independent variable. We also use a pooled cross-sectional logistic regression model, where each predictor variable is measured at the initial report of gang membership—with the exception of change in violent victimization—and the dependent variable is our dichotomous measure indicating whether or not the respondents continued their gang involvement at the subsequent wave. We also included a dummy variable for each wave of data collection to help control for unobserved differences in the likelihood of stable gang membership across waves—Wave 1 serves as the reference category. Given our limited sample size,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043986212458196">1</xref></sup> we use a <italic>p</italic> value of .10 for determining statistical significance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1043986212458196" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>At the bivariate level, five factors were associated with stable gang membership. Contrary to our hypothesis, stable gang members reported being more peripheral in their gangs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) than did the transient members. Only one of the reasons youth reported for joining a gang was significantly related to the stability of gang membership, as 42% of stable gang members reported protection as one of their motivating factors, whereas only 27% of unstable members reported this as a factor. Change in actual victimization was also counter to our hypothesis, as youth who remained gang involved were more likely to report an increase in overall violent victimization (29%) as compared to unstable gang youth (12%). Consistent with expectations, however, respondents in more organized gangs had a higher probability of remaining gang involved across waves. Finally, as expected, those youth who reported greater involvement in violent delinquency at their baseline gang survey were significantly more likely to remain in a gang at the following survey period (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>
<p>Results of our logistic regression (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043986212458196">table 3</xref>) differed slightly from the previously discussed bivariate associations. First, age at initial gang membership was positively associated with stable gang membership (<italic>b</italic> = .586, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Again, gang organization was significantly associated with stable gang membership (<italic>b</italic> = .250, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), where a one-unit increase in gang organization was associated with a 29% increase in the probability of stable gang membership. Interestingly, both joining for protection (<italic>b</italic> = .998, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and an increase in victimization frequency (<italic>b</italic> = 1.470, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) were positively associated with stable gang membership. While nonsignificant in the bivariate model, yet consistent with our hypothesis, joining a gang to earn money was significantly associated with having left the gang prior to the next wave of data collection (<italic>b</italic> = −1.189, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Finally, consistent with both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry and colleagues (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al. (2001)</xref>, involvement in more violent activity appears to be associated with a higher probability of stable gang membership (<italic>b</italic> = .312, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), as a one-unit increase in violent delinquency variety is associated with a 37% increase in the probability of continued gang involvement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Extant research suggests that longer periods of gang membership can have significant consequences for youth, both in the short term (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde &amp; Esbensen, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458196">2012</xref>) and into early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al., 2011</xref>). However, little research has examined factors associated with stable gang membership. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458196">Thornberry and colleagues (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458196">Hill et al. (2001)</xref> suggests that the risk factors associated with joining gangs are not particularly useful in predicting continued gang involvement. Such a conclusion may not be surprising, given that the risk factors associated with initial gang involvement are not likely to be alleviated through gang membership and, if anything, may be exacerbated through such associations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458196">Melde &amp; Esbensen, 2011</xref>). Further research on the factors associated with stable gang membership is important, however, so policy can be directed at youth most likely to remain in a gang for extended periods of time, to prevent the detrimental effects of prolonged membership in street gangs on life course outcomes (e.g., arrest, unemployment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458196">Krohn et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As an alternative to examining more traditional risk factors for initial gang involvement in the prediction of stable membership, we examined factors youth reported to be associated with their decision to join a gang, characteristics of the gang itself, as well as behaviors associated with gang membership. Several of these factors were systematically associated with the duration of gang involvement in our sample of school-aged youth. Contrary to expectations, youth who reported joining a gang for protection were more likely to report gang membership in the following wave despite literature that suggests that these youth experience increased rates of victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458196">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>). This finding may be the result of several different factors. First, youth may be able to neutralize the negative aspects of victimization if they are socially rewarded for their involvement in gang-related victimizations, consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986212458196">Melde, Taylor, and Esbensen (2009)</xref> who found gang membership reduced fear of crime in spite of an increase in actual victimization. For instance, youth may gain a valued reputation within the gang for demonstrating “nerve” when faced with violent altercations, increasing their willingness to accept such negative externalities of membership. Second, because of the summary nature of the data, where youth are asked about a host of victimizations that occurred over the prior 6 months, this finding may be a byproduct of a gang member’s longer tenure in the gang, and thus exposure to high risk situations. Because the G.R.E.A.T. data is only able to periodically capture summary data from youth, those who report stable gang membership may have a longer period of exposure to the high risk gang environment than those youth who report having left the gang. The tenure of these short-term gang youth may vary from 1 day, at the shortest, to just under 1 year, making it impossible to develop a comparable rate (e.g., daily or weekly rate of violent victimization during period of gang activity) of victimization between stable and short-term gang youth using this particular data source.</p>
<p>The structure and capacity of a youth gang may also play a large role in the duration of association by its members. The findings that stable gang members reported belonging to more organized gangs and reported entering the gang at a later age as well as that youth who reported joining to make money were more likely to leave a gang all offer some level of support for this idea. A more organized gang may be more capable of coercing longer membership, maintaining member interest, developing stronger social ties between members, or fulfilling the social needs of the youth.</p>
<p>Second, work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458196">Levitt and Venkatesh (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458196">Venkatesh (1999)</xref> suggests that most street gangs do not have the capacity to offer lucrative financial rewards for their members, and thus most youth will not experience significant material gains as a result of membership. This might explain why youth in our sample who reported joining a gang to make money were more apt to leave the gang after one wave, as these youth likely turned from their gang when they learned that it could not fulfill their monetary needs and/or desires. Research on the incompatibility of financial (i.e., monetary) and social markets by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458196">Heyman and Ariely (2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458196">Ariely, 2008</xref>) may also help explain the relatively short duration of gang membership for youth who join these groups in search of money. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458196">Heyman and Ariely (2004)</xref>, when financial and social markets are combined, the behavioral outcomes of these exchanges resemble market exchanges, where individuals will base their overall view of the relationship on the satisfaction they derived from the financial exchange. That is, even if the social needs of youth were fulfilled by the gang, financial concerns would become the primary issue in the satisfaction of youth with their group membership. The failure to fulfill the financial needs of youth might therefore lead them to leave a gang, regardless of the gang’s capacity to fulfill the social needs of the youth. The capacity for gangs to fulfill needs may also suggest why older youth who reported entering gangs were more likely to remain in them. Perhaps these youth were able to make a more informed decision about what they could realistically expect from the gang before joining. These youth may have had access to better information about gang life and possess a better understanding of the needs that gangs can and cannot fulfill.</p>
<p>The concept of criminal embeddedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458196">Hagan, 1993</xref>) may offer insight into why youth who reported higher rates of delinquency on joining a gang were more likely to remain in the group (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458196">Pyrooz et al., 2012</xref>). The notion of criminal embeddedness suggests that youth may lack alternative prosocial networks to fulfill their social and monetary needs. While such networks may act in ways that pull youth out of gangs, involvement in violence may thwart such activity by those capable of doing so. For instance, teachers, coaches, and even same-age peers may be reluctant to associate with youth who have a violent reputation, for fear of the potential for negative consequences. Given the lack of available resources to help pull such youth from gangs, violent youth may resort to their gang for continued social support, even if the patronage received in gangs is flawed.</p>
<p>Together, these findings offer insight into factors that may be used to identify youth most at risk of stable gang membership. The role of violence in the lives of youth involved in gangs is highlighted in the current study where youth, who joined a gang for protection were violently victimized at a growing rate, and who were involved in a relatively wide range of violent behaviors, were more likely to remain in a gang than other youth. Parents, schools, and communities would be wise to systematically monitor individual involvement in violence (e.g., school-based violence monitoring system), both as offenders and victims, to identify youth particularly prone to be involved in such incidents, as such behavior may signal a propensity for initial and ongoing gang membership. The importance of local intelligence on the structure and characteristics of local gangs is also highlighted, whereby youth identified to be involved in more structured/organized gangs can be targeted for services.</p>
<p>Current findings also identify a factor that might be used in promoting gang member desistance. Given the general inability of street gangs to provide significant monetary rewards for members, this fact can be introduced and reinforced with youth in their early stages of gang membership. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986212458196">Heyman and Ariely (2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458196">Ariely, 2008</xref>) demonstrated, when financial market norms are introduced into social situations, norms associated with monetary exchanges have a tendency to dominate the relationship. If gang members can be reminded that the risks associated with gang membership are great relative to the average financial returns associated with common money making activities (e.g., US$50/week according to Papachristos, 2008), this message may resonate in a manner that will overshadow the social forces involved with group membership.</p>
