<p>Historically, many advances in the management of vascular trauma were discovered in the area of combat, which leads to a host of vascular injuries and thus a variety of approaches. Early methods for controlling hemorrhage were described by the Egyptians dating all the way back to 1600 BC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212453094">1</xref></sup> A variety of styptics have been used over the centuries to cauterize vessels including lead sulfate, copper sulfate, and zinc sulfate materials, but it was really the advance in understanding the difference between venous bleeding and arterial bleeding that led Galen, the famous Greek physician from the second century, to advise ligature for arterial injuries. Unfortunately, this approach really did not catch on for over a thousand years, when Jerome of Brunswick detailed in a textbook the technique of ligation of vessels in gunshot wounds. Obviously surgical technique has advanced dramatically over the years, with the development of techniques for direct arterial repair, anastomotic repairs, and now minimally invasive techniques for arterial procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212453094">2</xref></sup> The importance of these advances is evident in the huge domain of vascular surgery and trauma—a domain that encompasses many procedures including elective vascular operations, elective and emergent aortic operations for occlusive or aneurysmal disease, and the broad category of vascular trauma whether in civilian or combat conditions.</p>
<p>Throughout this development period, it has become apparent that management of the vascular injury is only successful with appropriate management of the bleeding associated with the injury, and the concomitant sequelae. The more we learn about transfusion medicine, the more we understand the risks associated with administration of blood products, highlighting the importance of a rational approach to transfusion therapy.</p>
<p>It is with these concepts in mind that we designed this issue of <italic>SCVA</italic> to detail various aspects of vascular trauma and blood product management. This collection of articles covers everything from the basic science aspect of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, to vascular surgical approaches for the trauma patient, and 3 articles covering various aspects of transfusion medicine. The first article, Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury: From Basic Science to Clinical Bedside, by Frank et al, explores the current understanding of myocardial ischemia, oxygen delivery, and reperfusion injury in a format highlighting the importance of understanding the basic science behind the clinical injury pattern. Dr Stovall et al have authored an article, “Perioperative Management of Peripheral Vascular Trauma,” detailing the surgical approach to the vascular surgical patient including concepts in perioperative management. Dr Sawyer et al have provided an article, “Trauma and Thrombelastography: How Changes in the Understanding of Coagulopathy, Testing, and Hospital Systems Have Changed One Group’s Practice,” highlighting new applications for point of care testing in trauma medicine and provide detail into the use of Rapid TEG in coagulopathy of trauma. Dr Edlestein has provided a well-written article—“Blood Product Storage: Does Age Really Matter?”—exploring the issues surrounding age of blood products and has highlighted the numerous trails looking into this important topic. Finally, an article by Dr Chandler et al, “The US Military Experience With Fresh Whole Blood During the Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,” provides a unique perspective on the use of whole blood developed from the experience in the US armed service in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>For the Educational Forum, we explore a different topic altogether in our Roundtable Discussion, where I have gathered a panel of experts to discuss the case-based management of the patient with an implantable cardiac device in the setting of noncardiac surgery. This is a topic that frequently comes up in the operating rooms and at educational conferences nationwide, especially with the recent release of the practice guidelines for implantable devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453094">3</xref></sup> This case discussion will illustrate the main practice points needed to manage these complicated patients. I hope that you enjoy this issue and thank all the authors who have provided such fine articles.</p>
