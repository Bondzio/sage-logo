<title>Test Description</title>
<p>The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282912467756">Wechsler, 2011</xref>), published by Pearson, is a newly updated abbreviated measure of cognitive intelligence designed for individuals 6 to 90 years of age. Primarily used in clinical, psychoeducational, and research settings, the WASI-II was developed to quickly and accurately estimate cognitive intelligence when administration of a full battery is not feasible or necessary.</p>
<p>The WASI-II is classified as a Level C measure, and can be administered and interpreted by individuals with a doctorate degree in psychology or a related discipline. Although the Examiner’s Manual states that the WASI-II can be administered by individuals with a bachelor’s degree under appropriate supervision due to the ease of administration, it is important to note that ideally the same person would administer and interpret the results of the measure, preferably an individual with appropriate training and certification (e.g., an individual with master’s or doctoral training). Administration time is approximately 30 min for the four-subtest form or 15 min for the two-subtest form.</p>
<p>The WASI-II kit includes an Examiner’s Manual, 25 Record Forms, Stimulus Book, and nine red and white Block Design cubes. The manual is well laid out, beginning with a detailed history of the WASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282912467756">Wechsler, 1999</xref>) and development of the WASI-II, an overview of the WASI-II tasks, details about the administration and scoring of the measure, interpretation of results, and psychometric properties.</p>
<sec id="section2-0734282912467756">
<title>Measure Development</title>
<p>Development of the WASI-II occurred over a 3-year period that incorporated an extensive literature review, expert advice, market research, and examiner surveys to ensure technical excellence and reliability. The primary goals of revision were to improve user-friendliness and psychometric properties, and to further enhance links between the WASI-II and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282912467756">Wechsler, 2008</xref>) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282912467756">Wechsler, 2003</xref>). The manual states that the WASI-II subtests each contain several new items based upon a comprehensive review of common and current responses. Administration rules were modified to be simplified and in alignment with the WAIS-IV and WISC-IV. Reversal and discontinue rules were reduced and/or simplified to decrease administration time. Items of low and high difficulty were added to each subtest to enhance the evaluation of intelligence in the extremely low (i.e., 40-60) and very superior (i.e., 130-160) ranges. In addition, the WASI-II was designed so that subtest scores can be substituted for the corresponding subtests on the WAIS-IV and WISC-IV, thereby reducing redundancy and administration time when a more comprehensive assessment of intelligence is warranted.</p>

<title>Administration and Scoring</title>
<sec id="section4-0734282912467756">
<title>General Description and Makeup</title>
<p>The WASI-II consists of four subtests, selected as those with the highest factor loadings on <italic>g</italic>, or general intelligence. Specifically, Vocabulary and Similarities form the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) while Block Design and Matrix Reasoning form the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), which replace the Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ) and Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ) from the original WASI, respectively. In addition, all four subtests are combined to form the Full-Scale IQ-4 Subtests (FSIQ-4) while Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning are combined to form the Full-Scale IQ-2 Subtests (FSIQ-2). It is important to note that, although there are some similarities between the WASI-II, WISC-IV, and WAIS-IV test items (e.g., some of the Block Design items are similar in design), all sample and test items on the subtests of the WASI-II are unique from their counterparts in the WISC-IV and WAIS-IV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734282912467756">
<title>Administration</title>
<p>The WASI-II subtests are to be administered in the order presented below, unless exceptional circumstances based on clinical need dictate a different sequence. As with all Wechsler measures, the WASI-II utilizes specific start and stop points for examinees of specific ages. In addition, reversal and discontinue rules direct the examiner to administer items preceding the indicated start point if an examinee is unsuccessful on a requisite number of initial consecutive items or cease subtest administration, respectively. Only Block Design is timed, and timing contributes to the scoring as outlined below.</p>
<sec id="section6-0734282912467756">
<title>Block Design</title>
<p>Block Design evaluates analysis and synthesis of visual stimuli, nonverbal concept formation, fluid intelligence, visual perception and organization, and visual-motor coordination. It consists of 13 tasks during which two-dimensional red-and-white geometric designs are presented in the Stimulus Book. Examinees attempt to re-create each design using the top of the cubes. Differential start points are indicated for examinees aged 6 to 8 years or 9 to 90 years and examiners provide initial modeled examples in addition to the picture in the Stimulus Book. Each item has a specified time limit, and examinees are awarded points for successful re-creation of the design on the first (two points) or second (one point) attempt for items 1 to 4, or between four and seven points based upon quickness of completion for items 5 to 13. The subtest is discontinued after two consecutive failures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734282912467756">
<title>Vocabulary</title>
<p>Vocabulary measures an examinee’s word knowledge, verbal concept formation, fund of knowledge, crystallized intelligence, and degree of language development. It consists of 31 items, including 3 initial picture items. Examinees are required to verbally define and/or describe a word or concept that is orally presented to them by the examiner (9-90 year old examinees are also provided the Stimulus Book which presents each word in a written format). All examinees begin with item four, and reverse back to the pictured items if necessary. Scoring for each item is done on a zero-, one-, or two-point basis according to the general scoring principles outlined in the manual. In addition, the manual outlines specific zero or one point responses to be queried by the examiner to garner additional detail or clarity. The subtest is discontinued after three consecutive failures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734282912467756">
<title>Matrix Reasoning</title>
<p>Matrix Reasoning measures fluid and visual intelligence, spatial ability, and perceptual organization. It consists of 30 visually-depicted incomplete matrices presented in the Stimulus Book. Examinees are required to view each incomplete matrix and choose one item from a selection of five options at the bottom of each page that correctly completes the matrix. Each correct item receives one point. Differential start points are indicated for examinees aged 6 to 8 years or 9 to 90 years. The subtest is discontinued after three consecutive failures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0734282912467756">
<title>Similarities</title>
<p>Similarities measures an examinee’s verbal concept formation, crystallized intelligence, abstract reasoning, associative and categorical thinking, and verbal expression. It consists of 24 items, including 3 initial picture items. Examinees are required to verbally describe the relationship between two objects or concepts presented orally by the examiner. Six to eight year olds begin with the three initial pictured items in which they select one pictured item from a selection of four that fits within the same semantic category (e.g., vehicles) as two sample items (e.g., a car and a truck). Nine to ninety year old examinees begin with the orally presented items. Scoring for each item is done on a zero-, one-, or two-point basis according to the general scoring principles outlined in the manual. The manual also outlines specific zero or one point responses to be queried by the examiner to garner additional detail or clarity. The subtest is discontinued after three consecutive failures.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734282912467756">
<title>Scoring</title>
<p>Scoring guidelines and examples are provided for all tasks in the manual. It is important that examiners are familiar with these guidelines to adequately establish reversal and discontinue rules correctly.</p>
<p>Subtest raw scores are converted to T-scores by way of tables in the manual. T-scores are then converted to either FSIQ-4 (when all four subtests are administered) or FSIQ-2 (when only Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning are administered) standard scores, percentiles, and age equivalents.</p>

<title>Technical Adequacy</title>
<sec id="section12-0734282912467756">
<title>Test Standardization</title>
<p>This standardization sample consisted of 2,300 examinees, unique from the WISC-IV and WAIS-IV samples and consistent with the representative proportion of the population based on age, sex, race/ethnicity (including Whites, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Other racial groups), educational level, and geographic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734282912467756">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2008</xref>). The sample included appropriate representation from children with special education classifications or special groups such as individuals with traumatic brain injury, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, learning disorder, and various levels of cognitive impairment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0734282912467756">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>The authors provide a thorough explanation and analysis of the reliability and validity estimates of the WASI-II, supported by detailed tables providing clear numbers to support their findings. All reported values are based on U.S. norms.</p>
<sec id="section14-0734282912467756">
<title>Internal consistency</title>
<p>Internal consistency was measured utilizing the spit-half method. Regarding the child sample (6-16 years), the average reliability coefficients for the subtest scores ranged from good (.87) to excellent (.91) while the average reliability coefficients for the VCI, PRI, FSIQ-4, and FSIQ-2 composites were excellent at .94, .92, .96, and .93, respectively. Regarding the adult sample (17-90 years), the average reliability coefficients for the subtest scores were excellent, ranging from .90 to .92 while the average reliability coefficients for the VCI, PRI, FSIQ-4, and FSIQ-2 composites were excellent at .95, .94, .97, and .94, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0734282912467756">
<title>Test–retest stability</title>
<p>Test–retest stability was obtained via Pearson’s product–moment correlation by administering the measure twice within a 12 to 88 day interval to 215 participants in four age bands (6-11, 12-16, 17-54, and 55-90). Overall results for the child sample indicate acceptable (.79) to excellent (.90) stability coefficients for the subtests and good (.87) to excellent (.95) coefficients for the composites. Overall results for the adult sample indicate good (.83) to excellent (.94) stability coefficients for the subtests and excellent (.90-.96) coefficients for the composites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0734282912467756">
<title>Interrater reliability</title>
<p>All protocols from the standardization sample were independently scored by two scorers. As scoring for Block Design and Matrix Reasoning is relatively objective, interrater agreement was high (.98-.99). As scoring for Vocabulary and Similarities requires greater judgment, a representative selection of 60 cases from the standardization sample were selected and scored by four independent scorers. Results indicated excellent (.94-.95) reliability for these subtests.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0734282912467756">
<title>Validity</title>
<p>The WASI-II is intended to provide a good estimate of intelligence and to be similar to the WAIS-IV and WISC-IV. Confirmation of this alignment was done through a thorough examination of test content, internal structure, correlations with other tests, and special group studies.</p>
<sec id="section18-0734282912467756">
<title>Internal structure</title>
<p>Strong interrelationships among all subtests, as well as composites, provide strong support for the validity of the WASI-II. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the two VCI subtests and two PRI subtests each assess a unique factor, described by the test developers as verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning abilities. As the WASI-II has a limited number of subtests, exploratory factor analysis was additionally completed on data from WASI-II/WISC-IV and WASI-II/WAIS-IV correlation studies. Converging results from both the factor analyses support the test structure of the WASI-II.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0734282912467756">
<title>Concurrent validity</title>
<p>The relationships among WASI-II scores and scores on other measures of intellectual ability and achievement were evaluated. Overall, WASI-II scores were highly correlated with scores on instruments purported to measure similar constructs. Correlations between the WASI-II and the original WASI, WISC-IV, and WAIS-IV were acceptable (0.71) to excellent (0.92).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0734282912467756">
<title>Special group studies</title>
<p>Test-criterion relationships are also provided based on special group studies, which provide further evidence of validity. A sample of individuals with mild or moderate intellectual disability obtained scores commensurate with their previous diagnosis, providing evidence for the usefulness of the WASI-II with such individuals. Similarly, individuals identified as gifted achieved results commensurate with that identification. Individuals with ADHD obtained scores equivalent to a matched control group indicating that that group is not disadvantaged by the WASI-II. Individuals with Reading Disorder obtained lower scores on Vocabulary while individuals with Mathematics Disorder obtained lower scores on Matrix Reasoning, indicating that the abilities evaluated by these subtests are related to the sample’s learning challenges. Finally, individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury obtained scores approximately 6.4 to 8.7 points lower that a matched control group, indicating that this population experiences impairment in general cognitive functioning.</p>

<title>Commentary and Recommendations</title>
<p>The WASI-II has several features that make it a measure of choice for the brief evaluation of intelligence. It has a strong historical background in the Wechsler tradition and is suitable for clinical and research applications. It is normed on a large and representative sample and is appropriate for a broad age range. It has both four and two subtest options, providing examiners with the option when selecting a brief measure of intelligence. The ceiling and floor of each subtest has been extended, allowing for enhanced evaluation of intelligence at the upper and lower ends. The administration instructions and discontinue and reversal rules have been simplified and reduced. It is strongly linked to both the WISC-IV and WAIS-IV, allowing for substitution of subtest scores with those more comprehensive measures. Moreover, it has been linked to measures of achievement, allowing for comparisons between measures.</p>
<p>Despite these attributes, the WASI-II is not without its limitations. The manual correctly acknowledges that the reduced administration time of the WASI-II results in reduced clinical accuracy as compared to more comprehensive measures of intelligence such as the WISC-IV or WAIS-IV. In this same vein, the WASI-II does not include an evaluation of working memory or processing speed, two important aspects of cognitive functioning known to contribute to overall intelligence. Finally, the developers indicate that, as a brief measure of intelligence, results from the WASI-II should not be used to make a diagnosis or educational placement decisions, but that the WISC-IV or WAIS-IV are more appropriate.</p>
<p>Overall, the WASI-II is an economical and easy-to-administer brief intelligence measure. Its simple administration, quick administration time, and broad age range make it a measure of choice when time is limited. Although the measure does present with limitations, including reduced clinical accuracy and restricted evaluation of general intelligence, it remains a useful and economical tool for both research and clinical work.</p>
