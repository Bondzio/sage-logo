<abstract>
<p>In the centuries following the Enlightenment, scientific and technological developments gave ‘modern people’ an unprecedented ability to understand, predict and control the natural world. This has brought health and social benefits unimaginable to our ancestors and sets us apart from all previous generations. Yet there is a wide-ranging body of evidence that suggests that modernity is now in decline, largely because its methods and mindset are increasingly recognized as unsustainable. Problems are manifest in the emergence of new public health epidemics such as obesity and addictive behaviours, the loss of well-being and increase in anxiety and depression in affluent society, and the persistence of ever-widening health and social inequalities at national and global levels. Still larger problems now confront us, such as climate change, peak oil and the loss of biodiversity, all of which are linked to the ‘modern’ way of life. We are potentially faced with the collapse of certain aspects of modern society: we are certainly faced with the prospect of inevitable change. While the broad public health community has an important role to play in developing workable solutions to such daunting problems, we argue that some profound changes will be needed in order for us to cope successfully. No blueprints for dealing with change exist, which means that we will need to learn our way into the future. In this paper we take a perspective on the role and nature of the future practitioner in public health and health promotion. We argue that future practitioners will need to develop new ways of thinking, being and doing; new perspectives and new forms of understanding the world. We believe our discipline – and people generally – to be capable of such development, as insights from multiple sources tell us that human nature is malleable, not fixed. We use this analysis to trace, as examples, the imagined lives of five women living in different eras over the course of history in a Western society, and the emergence of different mindsets or worldviews, as the social, economic and cultural context changes. Post-modern analysts might insist that we have no basis for making value judgements between such different worldviews. In this paper, however, we argue that future practitioners should be empathetic to different views <italic>and</italic> willing to move beyond them, as necessary. We will need to learn and develop in ways that are compatible with our intrinsic needs as human beings and the needs of our ecosystem. We conclude by suggesting just some of the supportive processes of change needed in mapping out a more sustainable future for the public health community.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We have made the case elsewhere for a new wave of development in public health and health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911412217">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911412217">2</xref></sup> This case is based on a set of arguments which, taken together, suggest that there is a gulf between the ‘modern’ mindset (which public health shares with many other disciplines and institutions) and the forms of understanding (of thinking, doing and being) that practitioners will need to develop in order to cope with, and thrive in, the emerging future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911412217">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911412217">4</xref></sup> We briefly rehearse those arguments here.</p>
<p>A number of crucial ‘changes of age’ in human history have been catalysed by resource and population pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911412217">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911412217">6</xref></sup> To cope, our ancestors developed new outer worlds (social structure, economy, ecology and culture) and inner worlds (belief systems, values, motivations and consciousness). The modern age also followed this pattern but – uniquely – modernity has also differentiated and separated what Plato called ‘the true’ (the domain of factual, objective knowledge, or science), ‘the good’ (the domain of ethics and morality) and ‘the beautiful’ (the domain of aesthetics and artistic expression).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911412217">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911412217">8</xref></sup> This differentiation allowed each domain to pursue its own fruitful and separate path. In particular, following the Enlightenment, scientific and technological developments have given ‘modern people’ an unprecedented ability to understand the nature of the natural world, predict the course of natural events and control many of these. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the domain of science has been elevated above the others and this has brought health and social benefits unimaginable to our ancestors. The ‘understand, predict, and control’ ability and mindset arguably sets us apart from all previous generations in our own history.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the methods and mindsets that were successful in the early period of modernity (and the differentiation and effective separation of key dimensions of human experience) now appear subject to diminishing returns and even adverse effects, in Western society and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911412217">9</xref></sup> Despite the multiple and manifest benefits of modernity, we face the emergence of new ‘epidemics’ like obesity and other forms of addictive behaviour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911412217">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913911412217">11</xref></sup> together with a loss of well-being,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911412217">12</xref></sup> rising rates of depression and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913911412217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913911412217">14</xref></sup> and widening inequalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913911412217">15</xref></sup> The tools of modernity – and the mindset that is based on principles of understand, predict and control – have proven inadequate to the challenge of tackling such ‘dis-eases’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913911412217">16</xref></sup> As yet, there is little evidence of new forms of thinking or practice in response;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913911412217">17</xref></sup> denial, resistance and passive forms of adaptation are much in evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757913911412217">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757913911412217">19</xref></sup> In addition, global threats with the potential for massive effects on many lives, now loom large: climate change,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757913911412217">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757913911412217">21</xref></sup> peak oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757913911412217">22</xref></sup> and resource depletion, among others.</p>
<p>In sum, we suggest that modernity itself is now in decline because its methods and mindset are increasingly recognized as unsustainable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913911412217">23</xref></sup> This means that humanity faces another change of age, one that will need to be accompanied by workable solutions if we are to avoid the collapse of certain aspects of our civilization: what we now understand as the ‘modern’ lifestyle, will inevitably change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757913911412217">24</xref></sup> While the broad public health community has an important role to play in developing such solutions, we argue that some profound changes will be needed in order for us to learn our way into the future. In particular, we suggest that the future practitioner will need to develop new ways of thinking, being and doing, new perspectives and new forms of understanding the world. An important point to bear in mind is that we are capable of such development: insights from multiple academic disciplines tell us that human nature is malleable, not fixed. Humans have changed at various times in the past, in response to changing conditions and emerging knowledge, and can do so again. The following sections explore these ideas.</p>

<title>Developing a Sense of Perspective</title>
<p>We create our worldviews through the millions of encounters we have with the world each day. Most children growing up in a particular culture learn to pick up those ‘signals’ that possess more meaning and significance than others. This is how we acquire language, social skills, observational abilities and cultural competence. This process is reinforced and maintained in adulthood, creating a dynamic through which individuals in a particular culture sustain and reproduce that culture. This works well in comparatively stable conditions, when people are growing up and living in a society that has fixed roles and traditions and certain ways of knowing and being. Through this process each culture generates its own distinct worldview. The future public health practitioner will need to understand how different worldviews are profoundly influential in shaping the ways in which all of us understand and act in the world.</p>

<title>Developing a Different Relationship with Time</title>
<p>Modernity encourages us to site our experience of time in an uncertain present, regretting much of the past and fearful for the future. A different relationship with time would help us to live in the moment, without blanking out past or future, and able to appreciate ‘the now’ as the instant, the season, the historical era and the geological time. The Yoho National Park is situated high in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Yoho is the Cree word for awe and this is an awesome place: snow-capped peaks, vast glaciers, blue and emerald green lakes, and dark, silent pine forests. In the middle of the park is a protected area, the Burgess Shale, where fossils from the Cambrian period have been preserved in exquisite detail. The site of the Burgess Shale fossils is a useful place to gain a sense of the immensity of time. The fossils were laid down in a tropical sea bed 530 million years ago during a period when life on earth exploded in number, diversity and complexity. What is almost unique about this fossil find is that the soft parts of many creatures have been preserved because of the unusual set of circumstances that governed this particular process. A whole ecosystem of sea-dwelling organisms has been preserved and many of the animals do not fit into current taxonomies. This community of organisms constitutes a stage in the life of a past so remote, it daunts comprehension.</p>
<p>In thinking about our relationship with time, it is useful to employ the well- recognized device of conceptualizing the 4.5 billion years of the earth’s history as a single calendar year. The organisms from the Cambrian explosion of life did not appear until the autumn and the dinosaurs came at Christmas. All of human history is crammed into just a few moments before midnight on New Year’s Eve. The vast majority of organisms that were alive at the time that the Burgess Shale creatures existed are now extinct – the eventual fate of almost all species. The tropical ocean floor in which they lived has been moved by plate tectonics (moving at a similar speed to the growth of a human nail) and folded into the Rocky Mountains we see today. Holding in mind an awareness of the vast timescales and extraordinary processes involved in places like the Burgess Shale gives a sense of the different relationship with and perspective on time that the future public health practitioner will need.</p>

<title>Increasing Complexity Leads to changes in Worldview/Mindset</title>
<p>The issues outlined above can be used to consider the unfolding of human societies, where various transitions have generated changes of worldview or mindset, over time. These changes in mindset have not always been experienced as an explicitly conscious process. To help us articulate a future public health and move beyond modernity, we consider below how the (imagined) lives of five different women (Magda, Martha, Marion, Mary and Mel) change over time. For the sake of continuity with the arguments made in our introduction about the nature of modernity in Western society (its benefits and emerging problems), these examples are based in a Western historical timeframe (and located in Scotland, to be precise). However, the lives imagined here also reflect the development and unfolding of increasing levels of complexity that occur in all human society, across economic, structural, cultural and psychological dimensions of life.</p>
<p>As a hunter gatherer living 10,000 years ago, <italic>Magda</italic>’s consciousness is profoundly different from those of us who live in the modern world. Magda lives with a magical worldview in which all things (people, plants, inanimate objects) are imbued with spirit. Magda fears and reveres spiritual forces; she perceives illness as caused by moral failure or the intervention of the spirit world. Social structures are based on the family and are normally matriarchal. The extended family group shares a close-knit culture and identity, with religious practices that hold powerful meanings for those who participate. This world is very different from the modern mindset. Magda’s world came to an end as populations grew, areas for hunting and foraging became subject to competition from invaders (who may have held different worldviews) and technologies that allowed new ways of living were developed.</p>
<p><italic>Martha</italic>, in a Pictish settlement 2,000 years ago, has much in common with Magda. She still has an undifferentiated worldview; by this, we mean that she does not distinguish between the good (what is right), the true (what is real) and the beautiful. However, her inner world and the complex world of symbols and imagery that she shares with those around her have changed substantially since Magda’s time. The move to agriculture, albeit partial, has changed many daily routines and relationships, as has developments in technology – the invention of the wheel, forms of irrigation and techniques for forging bronze then, later, iron, to name only some of the most significant. Society has become patriarchal and hierarchical: kings and priests emerge, and social organization is needed to harvest, store and protect crops, often through slavery. Settled living and greater command of the natural world creates a very different inner and outer world to the one that Magda inhabited.</p>
<p>By the 14th century in Europe, where <italic>Marion</italic> lives in a medieval, feudal economy, the inner and outer worlds of society had changed again. Marion’s inner world is dominated by Christian (Catholic) symbols and ideas. Marion’s sense of morality, of what is ‘right’, comes from the Church and its teachings. The Church shapes her culture, while the feudal system determines the economy and social hierarchy. Marion’s world came to a close because the population grew; each new generation slowly and then more rapidly increased, and the main fuel supply (wood) dwindled. Adaptive responses led to the search for other fuel sources, which also needed the development of invasive technologies, new forms of mechanical equipment and innovative forms of transport for delivery to more distant locations. Seafaring Europeans ‘discovered’ the New World, subjugated its indigenous populations and began the long, slow process we now recognize as ‘globalization’: the dominance of one particular worldview.</p>
<p><italic>Mary</italic>, in the 19th century, represents one of the first generations to live in a world where scientific understandings of life are becoming acceptable. Mary attends church but, in thoughtful moments, wonders how the Bible can be both ‘true’ and compatible with new discoveries of the world. Like others of her time, Mary experiences stirrings of independent thought and the conviction that people need to make up their own minds about what is right and wrong. At the same time, Mary’s sense of the aesthetic has opportunities to develop and diversify. She loves singing in church but is also entertained by the popular songs of the music hall. She reads her Bible but also enjoys the new novels. In Mary’s world, that which is understood as ‘true’ (the scientific), ‘good’ (the ethical) and ‘beautiful’ (the aesthetic) have become differentiated, but are less constrained by the hegemonic forces of the medieval world, such as religious beliefs and feudal systems.</p>
<p>Over one hundred years later, <italic>Mel</italic> works as a social worker for Fife Council in Scotland. In her time, modernity’s great advance – the differentiation of the scientific, ethical and aesthetic spheres – has morphed into something less positive. Science has expanded its influence enormously, with concomitant benefits in many domains of life, not least medicine. In some instances, however, faith in science has morphed into an ideology best called ‘scientism’. Under scientism, what really matters is that which is known empirically, can be supported by evidence, can be counted or measured and, above all, can be shown to be value for money. Concerns about evidence and value for money are important, but can cause problems when taken too far. Even though she cannot easily articulate a critique of scientism and modernism, Mel feels the force of this change. She experiences the impacts of scientism, individualism, materialism and consumerism in her day-to-day life. Individualism, materialism and consumerism are ‘normal’ parts of life.</p>
<p>There was a time in her workplace when the pace was slower and there was more time for people. Targets did not dictate all priorities and there was more flexibility to respond to clients’ individual needs. Workers took pride in serving the public and absenteeism was low. Now, members of staff feel like cogs in a factory machine; reorganizations occur almost every year and people feel alienated from their roles and those they purport to help. Some resent the people they are trying to help because they will not cooperate in programmes that management is measuring, using ‘metrics’ as the sole means of determining success. Many workers feel stressed and unhappy and absenteeism is rising.</p>
<p>The point of the above examples of differing worldviews within the history of just one form of society is to suggest that human nature is not fixed; rather, humans are able, when obliged by life conditions, to respond and adapt to their environment by constructing new, more complex, conceptual models of the world that allow them to handle new problems and plan for new priorities. We have argued that each age is characterized by an inner world that acts as an organizing principle, expressed through self-propagating ideas, habits or cultural practices. These make the outer world but they, in their turn, influence the inner world. The objective world of structures, resources and economies interacts with this complex dynamic; new technologies, energy regimes, economic models and class hierarchies arise out of inner worlds and cultures but also help to create and mould them.</p>
<p>The worldview that first emerged in hunter gatherer Magda’s time was instinctive and orientated to survival. The groups were small and close knit, so the reach of empathic concern for other people was limited by this lack of wider awareness. So, the sense of self was conceptualized through this group and expressed only to meet imperative needs through instincts. This worldview can be seen today in a few surviving traditional cultures and certain cults or sects within modern society. For the worldview that arose in early agriculturalist Martha’s time, the tribe was the key circle of empathy and mutual support, while those outside this circle could be subject to violence without sense of guilt or shame. We see a similar worldview today in, for example, gang culture and the rise of neo-Nazi organizations.</p>
<p>The worldview that characterized Marion’s era, the Middle Ages is, perhaps, a little more familiar. Those who were formerly regarded as ‘other’ can now be assimilated by a worldview characterized, in the West, by the emergence of a more complex sense of individual identity and the sense of spiritual community provided by Roman Catholicism. This is the world of authoritarian religion, which is absolutist (in the sense that it seeks to control all aspects of life) and demands obedience to codes, laws and rules; it is these that dictate morality. Religious belief requires self-sacrifice; reward comes through obedience to rightful authority in a purposeful way. This worldview still persists in various religious movements today.</p>
<p>Mary’s worldview is that of Western modernity; it developed with the scientific and industrial revolutions. This is a rationalistic worldview, where the self is expressed calculatedly, to reach goals and objectives. The circle of empathic involvement has increased by virtue of travel, improved communications and greater awareness of diversity. However, empathic concerns for others still have limits and tend not to extend to nature.</p>
<p>Mel’s period sees the emergence of a late (or post-)modern Western worldview that is relativistic in its understanding of morality, art and science. This worldview is more accepting of diversity and more egalitarian than those that preceded it: empathic concern for others is now much wider and extends to peoples across the globe and to the biosphere (i.e. through ecological concerns). We see many manifestations of this worldview today. This, we believe, is the mindset that characterizes many people in public health, which is positive. But is it enough?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757913911412217">
<title>Is there an Emerging Worldview?</title>
<p>The problem with the worldviews that have dominated the history of the West (and, more recently, the ‘developed’ North of the globe) is that they conceptualize the world as a place made especially for humans and a place without limits: our task is to subdue and exploit the earth. This perspective arose out of a synthesis of the Christian creationist theology and the rationalistic ideas of the Enlightenment. Many in Western society have viewed this synthesis as progress and compared themselves favourably with other forms of society, where peoples with different (i.e. non-scientific and non-rational) belief systems were often categorized as ‘primitive’, even delusional.</p>
<p>An important point is that social and behavioural scientists argue that none of us can experience ‘reality’ direct;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757913911412217">25</xref></sup> our understandings are mediated by and constructed from our own interpretations of what we perceive, and our experience. As a result, each of us exists in a personal world of meaning that can be at risk from inconvenient truths. To ensure that we are not overwhelmed by the uncertainty inherent in living in a world we can never truly know, we may choose to shut such truths out. Many of us face this dilemma, which is why the issues discussed in this paper, although perhaps unusual within a public health journal, are so important. Many of the worldviews briefly described above can be observed in contemporary life. The fundamental difficulty with each of these is that that they believe themselves to be ‘right’, to the exclusion of others. While this is certainly the case with authoritarian religion and narrow forms of rationalism, it is also applicable to the contemporary pluralistic, relativistic worldview, which views its own non-judgemental perspective as more valid than others. We believe that more is needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913911412217">
<title>From Separation to Integration</title>
<p>In the transition that faces us now, we need to address four major separations that afflict our lives. We are separated from nature and this has led to the ecological crisis. We are separated from each other and that creates conflict and damaging forms of individualism and selfishness. We are separated from ourselves in that we tend not to be in touch with our own sense of purpose. Finally, the materialistic, objectivist conception of our world and ourselves is robbing us of a subjective connection with what might best be called ‘spirit’. While these are sweeping generalizations – and in reality people are more complex and nuanced – no one we know seems completely immune to these separations.</p>
<p>Addressing the separations (with nature, each other, self and spirit) calls for a process of integration, growth and assimilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757913911412217">26</xref></sup> This will be difficult because modernity has been so successful in objectifying our everyday discourse, to the extent that it can be difficult to speak freely about questions of the inner life, contemplation and meditation. Even so, we suggest that we all need to undertake this process of integration as a way to outgrow our present problems. We need to value the past and appreciate how it shapes our way of seeing the world. We need to accept that there are different worldviews apart from our own, relish such distinctions, and freely discuss with others that which we hold to be good, beautiful and true in life. A commitment to ‘emergence’ means that the worldview of the future public health will come from the dynamic relationship between our inner and outer worlds, one that recognizes the complexity involved in developing new emerging ways of thinking, being and doing. Those who wish to move beyond the weaknesses of the post-modern perspective will need awareness of how each worldview has unfolded over time and across contexts. They will also need to be aware that these worldviews are all present in our society today.</p>
<p>However, unlike post-modernist analyses that insist that we have no basis for making value judgements between different worldviews, the future practitioner will need to be empathetic to each <italic>and</italic> aware of the need to move beyond these, and into an inner and outer world that is compatible with our needs as human beings and the needs of our ecosystem. So, the self-aware and reflective practitioner will need to work with multiple mindsets, including what is best in all worldviews, but transcending them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757913911412217">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757913911412217">27</xref></sup> We can do this best not by saying that there are no criteria with which to make judgements; rather, we can take a perspective on all worldviews that is respectful, critical and enables us to develop a deeper consciousness of the world around us and greater empathy for others.</p>
<p>In one sense, this is simply an integral part of human nature. An increasingly deep level of consciousness and a wider circle of empathy is part of healthy development in each individual as he or she grows from infancy to adulthood. The infant will, if healthy, outgrow this phase of development to become a toddler, a child, an adolescent, a young adult and so on. Each stage transcends and includes the stage before. Failure to navigate one of the stages of development can have severe consequences later. So, society needs to ensure that there are effective means to ensure that all children pass safely through all stages, and that adults are also supported as they make their own transitions in life.</p>
<p>The need for this support flows from an explicit recognition that it is part of our human nature to traverse many stages of development from birth to death: the process is lifelong. Family, kinship groups and the broader society, through a variety of structures like schools, workplaces and clubs, have historically provided these support structures. In the past, religious beliefs and institutions also played important roles. It is commonplace to observe that many of these supports have been eroded. What we need now are ways to rebuild some of what we have lost and the inventiveness to create new structures, where appropriate.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Practitioners in public health and health promotion have a vital role to play in all our futures, but development is needed. The future practitioner will need to be capable of transcending and including rationalist and post-modern perspectives, and able to expand his or her circle of empathy for others. She or he will be integral in thought and action and seek to work in institutions where such values are honoured. Future practitioners will also need to be assisted and sustained in their work in terms of process, culture, and environment:</p>

<list-item><p>Second, they will need a ‘plausibility structure’ – i.e. a set of ideas within a coherent worldview (a culture, in other words) that makes sense of them. We hope this paper, among others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911412217">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911412217">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913911412217">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913911412217">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757913911412217">28</xref></sup> contributes towards such a cultural shift.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, they will need an environment of supportive and emergent institutions (‘emergent’ in the sense of being able to respond to and evolve in changing contexts, rather than formally planned). The nature of this environment will be explored further in a forthcoming paper.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, future practitioners will also want to participate in the creation of their learning and their development process, the cultural shift in personal and professional ideas and values, and the emergent qualities of their working environment. This paper has begun the process of mapping out a more sustainable future for public health but much more work will be needed to flesh out the daunting practicalities of achieving such transformational change. We invite others to join with and further this debate.</p>
