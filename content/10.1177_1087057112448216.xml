<abstract>
<p>One of the objectives of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Biodefense Program is to identify or develop broad-spectrum antimicrobials for use against bioterrorism pathogens and emerging infectious agents. As a part of that program, our institution has screened the 10 000-compound MyriaScreen Diversity Collection of high-purity druglike compounds against three NIAID category A and one category B priority pathogens in an effort to identify potential compound classes for further drug development. The effective use of a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute–based high-throughput screening (HTS) 96-well–based format allowed for the identification of 49 compounds that had in vitro activity against all four pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentration values of ≤16 µg/mL. Adaptation of the HTS process was necessary to conduct the work in higher-level containment, in this case, biosafety level 3. Examination of chemical scaffolds shared by some of the 49 compounds and assessment of available chemical databases indicates that several may represent broad-spectrum antimicrobials whose activity is based on novel mechanisms of action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As summarized in a recent report, emerging infectious diseases (EID) represent an important and growing burden to global economies and public health; their emergence is likely to be driven by factors associated with social, environmental, and ecological factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112448216">1</xref></sup> In their report, the authors reveal various interesting factors about global patterns of EIDs between 1940 and 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112448216">1</xref></sup> In general, EID events have risen significantly, with 54.3% of those events being caused by bacteria, and a large proportion of those are drug resistant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112448216">1</xref></sup> In addition, they observed that most EID events are caused by zoonotic pathogens, and 71.8% of those were caused by pathogens of wildlife origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112448216">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biological terrorism is also a significant consideration with regard to global economies and public health, as demonstrated by the 2001 anthrax letters. Various studies have predicted that the economic impact of a biological attack with such agents as <italic>Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis</italic>, and <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> could be in the billion dollar range, with human deaths approaching millions, depending on the amount of agent used and the population exposed to that agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112448216">2</xref></sup> Antimicrobial drug resistance is a significant intrinsic health issue that continues to increase in importance as more emerging strains of bacteria threaten human health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112448216">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057112448216"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057112448216">5</xref></sup> The World Health Organization considers antimicrobial resistance as one of the three greatest threats to human health. As such, they declared antimicrobial resistance the focus of World Health Day 2011 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2011">www.who.int/world-health-day/2011</ext-link>). Equally important is the limited pipeline of new antimicrobial candidates that is necessary to combat this global dilemma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057112448216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112448216">7</xref></sup> Increasingly, pharmaceutical companies are showing less interest in antibacterial discovery and development; this makes society even more vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112448216">8</xref></sup> Because of these threats, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is using the entire spectrum of biodefense resources to partner with other federal agencies and industry to develop a pipeline that “runs from bench to bedside” to combat these dread diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057112448216">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to address some of these major health issues by developing and using high-throughput screening (HTS) capabilities for screening compounds in upper-level biocontainment against biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) category A and B agents. Several of the methods had to be adapted because of certain constraints placed on laboratory personnel working in BSL-3 biocontainment facilities. In addition, electronic database management tools had to be developed to capture and assess resulting HTS data that were obtained under conditions requiring biosafety, biosecurity, and confidentiality constraints. These efforts were funded through NIAID contract HHSN266200400004I/N01-AI-40004 awarded to our institution from 2003 to 2011; the screening reported here took place from 2006 to 2010. It is our intent to assist NIAID in its research agenda of developing new and/or improved antimicrobials to combat emerging pathogens, potential biological threat agents, and drug-resistant bacterial strains. It is also our intent to share this information with the scientific community. The Center for Veterinary Health Sciences at Oklahoma State University is a veterinary school with more than half a century experience working with zoonotic diseases. This expertise will greatly improve our ability to address these issues, particularly because the four select agents that were evaluated in this study represent four important zoonotic pathogens, causing such diseases as anthrax, plague, tularemia, and brucellosis.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1087057112448216">
<title>Bacterial Strains</title>
<p>The following bacterial strains were used in the HTS process. <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> Ames (NR-411), <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> Colorado 92 (NR-641), and <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> Schu S4 (NR-643) were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA), NIAID, National Institutes of Health (NIH). <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> 2308 was obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Animal Disease Center. Quality control strains <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> 29213 and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 25922 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087057112448216">
<title>Quality Control for Bacterial Strains</title>
<p>Test strains were replaced annually with fresh isolates, and the old and new strains were evaluated phenotypically using the Biolog Gen II Identification System (Biolog, Hayward, CA) and genotypically by extraction of DNA and profiling using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify a specific species as well as markers that differentiate individual strains or loci whose products are known to participate in virulence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112448216">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057112448216"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057112448216"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057112448216"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057112448216">14</xref></sup> DNA was extracted with the Promega Maxwell 16 automated genomic DNA extraction and purification kits and instrument (Promega, Madison, WI). Real-time PCR analysis was conducted with SYBR green using a Cepheid Smart Cycler II system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087057112448216">
<title>Microdilution Broth Screening Assay</title>
<p>A 96-well format broth microdilution assay,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112448216">15</xref></sup> developed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112448216">16</xref></sup> was used to evaluate initial inhibition by each compound and subsequently to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each agent that inhibited at the initial screening concentration of 16 µg/mL. Additional plates with appropriate quality control (QC) test strains and QC antimicrobials were included with each assay to verify appropriate CLSI MIC ranges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057112448216">17</xref></sup> The assay uses AlamarBlue dye reduction (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to assess the MIC for all of the agents except <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, for which a noncolorimetric assay is required because of color interference with the media supplement. Drug plates were prepared with a Biomek 2000 Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) to ensure reproducibility and accuracy. The Biomek 2000 used for drug plate preparation was housed in a Baker biosafety cabinet (BSC) to guarantee sterility. Inoculation of drug plates with bacteria was carried out in a BSL-3 facility using another Biomek 2000 housed in a Baker BioPROtect II BSC. Both of the Baker BSCs were specially designed to house Biomek 2000 units. Personnel conducting the screening wore approved personal protection equipment (PPE), which consisted of KleenGuard A60 protective coveralls with boots (Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, GA), double gloves, and a powered air purifying respirator with HEPA filters (3M, St. Paul, MN).</p>
<p>Initial screening of all 10 000 compounds against three of the four pathogens was conducted at a concentration of 16 µg/mL; each compound was assayed once in duplicate. Total final volume of drug and medium was 100 µL per well. Sterility, color, and growth control wells were included in each 96-well plate. After screening the first 480 compounds, it was noted that the hit rate for <italic>F. tularensis</italic> was disproportionate to the other pathogens (i.e., 45% versus 1%−5%). As a result, the initial screening concentration for <italic>F. tularensis</italic> was changed from 16 to 8 µg/mL. At that time, all 480 were repeated at the 8 µg/mL concentration, and those results are reported here. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations were then performed on all compounds showing inhibition at the initial screening concentration using a twofold dilution series ranging from 0.0625 to 16 µg/mL. MIC determinations were performed twice in duplicate (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Commercial antimicrobials for QC plates were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Serologicals Proteins, Inc. (Kankakee, IL), and Mediatech (Manassas, VA).</p>
<p>Test compounds and commercial antimicrobials were prepared at the appropriate concentrations in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB; Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) and then aliquoted into 96-well plates for <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>. AlamarBlue (Invitrogen; 10% vol/vol) was added to wells prior to inoculation. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> requires the addition of 2% Isovitalex (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lake, NJ) to CAMHB. Because this causes interference with AlamarBlue (Invitrogen), the dye was not used in assays with this organism. As recommended by CLSI, Brucella broth was used with the <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> strain. Because AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) is stable for only 24-h incubation and <italic>B. abortus</italic> requires 48-h incubation, AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added 24 h after infection for that organism.</p>
<p>Inoculations with select agents were carried out in a BSL-3 facility. Appropriate wells were inoculated with ≈5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL colony forming units (CFU), which resulted from a 1:20 dilution of an inoculum equivalent to 0.5 McFarland units (≈1–1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU). This was confirmed by plating an appropriate dilution onto solid medium. QC drugs and strains used for each organism were as follows: <italic>B. anthracis</italic> (penicillin PEN, doxycycline DX, ciprofloxacin CIP), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922; <italic>F. tularensis</italic> (gentamicin GEN, CIP, DX), <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 and <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922; <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (GEN, DX, chloramphenicol CHL), <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922; <italic>B. abortus</italic> (CIP, tetracycline TET, rifampin RIF), <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 and <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922. Plates were read spectrophotometrically in an AD340a Beckman plate reader (Beckman-Coulter) programmed to subtract the absorbance at 600 nm from that at 570 nm; the MICs are reported as the lowest drug concentrations yielding a differential absorbance of zero or less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112448216">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057112448216">18</xref></sup> In the case of <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, absorbance was read at 600 nm, and the MIC was reported as the lowest drug concentration that inhibited visible growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087057112448216">
<title>MIC Evaluation with Commercial Antimicrobials</title>
<p>The four select agents were tested against 30 commercially available antimicrobials to obtain MIC values for each. As with the diversity collection, the MIC evaluations of each antimicrobial were performed twice in duplicate (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Likewise, each set of evaluations included a plate containing QC drugs and bacterial strains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1087057112448216">
<title>Diversity Collection</title>
<p>The MyriaScreen Diversity Collection was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The collection was produced by collaboration between TimTec, Inc. (Newark, DE) and Sigma-Aldrich. Their compounds were filtered with TimTec’s proprietary software to obtain a pool of more than 300 000 TimTec and Sigma-Aldrich compounds on the basis of diversity. Additional filters were set to consider molecular weight (120–500), cLogP, H-acceptor, H-donors, and rotatable bonds (Sigma-Aldrich). The selection was refined by removing compounds that were overly represented or not well suited for medicinal chemistry follow-up (Sigma-Aldrich). The MyriaScreen “is composed of 10 000 high-purity screening compounds handpicked to maximize chemical diversity while maintaining drug-likeness” (Sigma-Aldrich). The collection is set up to be interactive with HTS (e.g., shipped in 96-well plates containing individual tubes ready for manipulation with systems such as the Biomek 2000), and the compounds are dissolved in DMSO. For screening purposes, it was necessary to determine the effect of DMSO on the viability of each bacterial pathogen to ensure that inhibitory observations were due to the compound and not the DMSO. This consideration was one of the issues that went into the decision for the initial screening concentrations used. In preliminary experiments, we determined that for <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic>, the DMSO began to affect viability at 2% to 4% (vol/vol). For <italic>F. tularensis</italic> and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, the DMSO began to affect viability at &gt;1%. As a result, assays were run at a DMSO concentration of 0.8% for all organisms except <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, in which case 0.4% DMSO was used. Prior to preparation of drug-screening plates, each MyriaScreen compound was assigned an individual OSU number to maintain a blind study in which personnel were not aware of which compounds were being assayed at any one time. Drug plates were prepared for initial screening then stored at −80 °C until being transferred to the BSL-3 facility for inoculation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087057112448216">
<title>Data Management</title>
<p>The assays that we have described in this article, both the colorimetric for <italic>B. anthracis, Y. pestis</italic>, and <italic>B. abortus</italic> and turbidimetric for <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, function by determining whether or not there is growth in a well. Any growth in a test compound (TC) or growth control (GC) well is considered a positive result; growth in a sterility control (SC) well indicates that there is potentially contamination, and the assay should be repeated. Growth is defined for the colorimetric assay as an A<sub>570</sub>–A<sub>600</sub> value of &gt;0. For the turbidimetric assay, a value greater than a cutoff value was considered growth. The cutoff value was determined as GC<sub>mean</sub> – ((GC<sub>mean</sub> – SC<sub>mean)</sub> × 70%), where GC<sub>mean</sub> = the mean absorbance (A<sub>600</sub>) value of the GC wells and SC<sub>mean</sub> = the mean absorbance (A<sub>600</sub>) value of SC wells. As described in the text, all plates contained positive and negative control wells to ensure the validity of results in test wells.</p>
<p>Data were copied directly from a plate reader into a Microsoft (MS; Redmond, WA) Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheets were designed to automatically determine initial hits or calculate MIC values depending on the type of experiment. The spreadsheets would also check for skipped wells and assess the control wells on the plate. If there was a discrepancy in the calculated values, raw data were examined for anomalies. In cases in which questionable results remained, the assay was repeated. Resulting data were transferred to an MS Access database for compilation and reporting.</p>
<p>MDL ISIS/Base 2.55 SP4 (Symyx Technologies, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) was used to manage and categorize the chemical frameworks. ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.02.1076 (Cambridge, MA) was used for assigning chemical scaffolding (frameworks) and obtaining chemical names and property information. SciFinder (CAS, American Chemical Society, Columbus, OH) was used to search for pertinent information regarding the compounds identified in the HTS process. All data were collected, stored, and maintained on a secure access hard drive accessible by authorized personnel from offices and biocontainment laboratories involved in the study.</p>

<sec id="section10-1087057112448216">
<title>Adaption of HTS Procedures for BSL-3 Containment</title>
<p>Because of the safety and security nature of a number of biodefense and emerging infectious disease category A, B, and C priority pathogens, these agents can be studied only in BSL-3 containment facilities. As a result, automation of drug screening for these types of pathogens had to be developed in such a way as to overcome issues such as limited specialized space with appropriate physical barriers, higher maintenance and operation costs, regulatory issues, rules, permits necessary to conduct such work, and background checks for individuals working with or around select agents as well as personnel involved with critical equipment maintenance and IT services. Other issues include the need for special PPE, containment of equipment, annual required maintenance and training, security monitoring devices for limited-access laboratories, video surveillance, key card access, and security-capable computer systems and authorized IT personnel.</p>
<p>Precautions had to be implemented to ensure safety during inoculation and analysis of the assays performed in biocontainment. After 96-well plates had been inoculated with the pathogen, the sterile plastic lids were replaced, and the plates were placed in gas-permeable plastic bags with metal closures and incubated at appropriate temperatures. Following incubation, plates were transferred from the incubator to the BSC, where the lids were removed and a sterile seal was securely applied prior to spectrophotometric assessment in a plate reader.</p>
<p>The assays developed here have worked very well with issues involving BSL-3 containment operations. For learning purposes, personnel were initially trained on a Biomek 2000 housed in a BSC within a BSL-1 laboratory. Because no infectious agents are used, personnel can be trained on the instrument and learn robotic programming techniques without the need for PPE. That training can then be continued on the Biomek 2000 (Beckman) housed in the BSL-3 facility, where the inoculations and plate readings take place. This facilitates the training process by reducing the stress and difficulty of having to learn the procedure initially in a BSL-3 setting while suited up in PPE.</p>

<sec id="section11-1087057112448216">
<title>Real-Time PCR of Bacterial Strains Used in the Screening Process</title>
<p>As a part of the screening program, all of the bacterial strains used in the process were replaced with freshly propagated stocks annually. At that time, the DNA was extracted from both the old and new stocks and genetically profiled by real-time PCR by amplification of fragments of targets based on (1) specificity to a given bacterial species, (2) involvement in virulence, and (3) involvement in drug resistance as necessary. The amplified target fragments are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. An example of data resulting from the real-time PCR genotyping assay is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112448216"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> using <italic>B. anthracis</italic> cultures. These procedures were necessary to ensure genetic purity of each strain throughout the screening process. Use of the Promega Maxwell 16 (Promega) proved to be ideal for DNA extraction because it is small enough to be housed within a BSC and can be used to extract up to 16 samples at one time. All extracted DNA samples had to be streaked on appropriate medium and incubated for 48 h to ensure that no viable bacteria were present prior to the disinfected vials being transferred to a BSL-1 biocontainment facility for PCR evaluations.</p>

<title>Data Mining for Potential MOA</title>
<p>MDL ISIS/Base 2.55 SP4 (Symyx Technologies) and ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0.2.1076 (CambridgeSoft) software were used to analyze the accumulated data files for the compounds that inhibited all four select agent pathogens. In particular, common scaffolds (chemical frameworks) were examined based on each inhibitor. Further analyses revealed that some of the compounds that inhibited all four pathogens did so at varying levels of inhibition. As examples, two clusters will be discussed here to elucidate our methods.</p>
<p>A group of thiophen/carboxamide compounds was extrapolated from the database for further examination based on two compounds from the 49 that inhibited all four pathogens, compounds ST005324 (plate 10 well H1) and ST016021(plate 37 well F11). A substructure search of the MyriaScreen SD file with ISIS Base using the thiophen/carboxamide scaffold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>) resulted in the detection of four other derivatives that shared this common scaffold and that had varying degrees of inhibition for some but not all of the four select agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). In all, 132 compounds were identified in the database with the thiophen/carboxamide scaffold substructure search. Compounds ST005226 (plate 10 well D10), ST006747 (plate 16 well A11), and ST015518 (plate 37 well F08) inhibited three of the select agents, and compound ST026452 (plate 60 well E09) inhibited only two of the select agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). This variation in inhibitory capacity suggests that the bacterial MOA for these compounds might be a specific target rather than a general mechanism and that they would be amenable to further chemical derivatization to improve inhibitory properties. A search with SciFinder (CAS Division of the American Chemical Society, Chemical Abstracts Service, Columbus, OH) revealed information that indicates this group of compounds represents a class of reverse transcriptase– associated ribonuclease H1 activity inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057112448216">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057112448216">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>Using this information, we have examined the potential for these compounds to inhibit this target by cloning and expressing the recombinant RNaseH1 proteins from each of the four bacterial strains tested. Initial studies using a previously reported assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057112448216">21</xref></sup> with the two most potent thiophene/carboxamides (ST016021 and ST005324; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>) revealed marginal inhibition at 10 µM, which increased to almost complete inhibition at 100 µM (data not shown). These studies are ongoing.</p>
<p>The second cluster of inhibitors to be selected was a group of benzenesulfonamides represented by compound R536628 (plate 70 well F06). A substructure search using the benzenesulfonamide scaffold revealed a series of structurally similar inhibitors that showed varying degrees of inhibition to the four select agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). In all, 726 compounds were identified in the MyriaScreen database that contained the benzenesulfonamide scaffold. Six of those were selected based on their structural similarity and ability to inhibit one or more of the select agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). Although R536628 was able to inhibit all four select agents, five were not inhibitory for <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and showed only limited inhibition to <italic>B. abortus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087057112448216"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). Again, this variation in inhibitory capabilities within this class of structurally similar compounds suggests that the MOA for these compounds might be a bacterial target amenable to drug development. A search using SciFinder resulted in bibliographic information regarding benzenesulfonamides showing activity against methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and vancomycin-resistant <italic>Entercoccus</italic> (VRE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087057112448216">22</xref></sup> The sulfonamide scaffold at first appearance suggests that they are acting similar to other sulfonamides that have inhibitory properties toward a key enzyme in the folate pathway, dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087057112448216">23</xref></sup> However, this particular collection lacks the amino group on the benzenesulfonyl moiety that is found on the sulfonamides that inhibit DHPS (e.g., sulfamethoxazole, sulfanilamide, and sulfadiazine). In an attempt to determine an MOA for these benzenesulfonamides, we examined their activity against recombinant DHPS from <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, an enzyme previously studied by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087057112448216">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087057112448216">25</xref></sup> We were not able to show any inhibitory activity for this enzyme, despite inhibition of the organism, and thus concluded that DHPS inhibition is not likely the MOA for these compounds (data not shown). We have also assessed the phenotypic effect of one of the benzene sulfonamides using the phenotype microarray system (Biolog), which provided an inconclusive MOA and indicated it is not likely acting against DHPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087057112448216">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are generally two major approaches used to screen diversity collections such as the MyriaScreen collection for lead antimicrobials. One involves the use of individual “targets” (e.g., enzymes), and the other involves the use of whole cells (e.g., bacteria). Toward the end of the 1980s through the 1990s, HTS efforts were generally focused on faster screening of small-molecule libraries using genomics and combinatorial chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087057112448216">27</xref></sup> A large number of those projects used HTS that involved the use of individual targets such as receptors, kinases, and other enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087057112448216">27</xref></sup> Limited success was reported for more than 60 different targets from about 34 companies using target-based HTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057112448216">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057112448216">29</xref></sup> For discussion purposes, we will examine the results from one of those companies.</p>
<p>After the first complete bacterial genome was reported in 1995, several companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, moved back into the area of antibacterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup> In a review published in 2007, they reported their results regarding the evaluation of 300 genes and 70 HTS campaigns over a 7-year period from 1995 to 2001 using the company’s collection, which consisted of 260 000 to 530 000 compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup> Essentially, of 67 HTS campaigns involving numerous and varied bacterial targets and 3 HTS campaigns involving whole-cell assays using <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, only 16 HTS campaigns gave rise to hits, and only 5 of those resulted in leads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup> One of the problems observed in the process was that some of the hits obtained with target screening were later found to be nonspecifically toxic to both mammalian and bacterial cells, usually because of indiscriminate disruption of the cell membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup> Other leads lacked broad-spectrum activity (i.e., limited activity against a suitable range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative agents).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup> One of their conclusions was that “whole-cell assays are favoured for finding a lead compound that has a modicum of antibacterial activity, but biochemical assays and genetic studies are vital to determine the MOA of these leads.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112448216">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our HTS was designed with whole-cell assays. The reasoning was in part based on results from HTS studies such as those reported by GlaxoSmithKline (i.e., initial hits could be obtained knowing that they were able to penetrate the whole cell and cause inhibition). Our drug-screening panel used one strain that is Gram-positive and three that are Gram-negative, so that our results could also demonstrate broad-spectrum activity. Further studies will be necessary to determine MOAs so that continued drug development will be possible. Our initial screening concentration of 16 µg/mL was based on two critical parameters. First, this concentration helped to eliminate the problems of DMSO toxicity observed at higher concentrations with some of the pathogens (discussed in the Materials and Methods section). Second, we wanted to use an initial concentration that was not too restrictive and allowed for identification of potential groups of inhibitors that showed a range of activity, including no activity. We felt that this would eventually allow us to identify compound series that might be more amenable to further drug development once the MOA was determined and molecular modeling and medicinal chemistry could come into play.</p>
<p>An examination of the 49 MyriaScreen compounds that inhibited all four of the select agent pathogens using SciFinder revealed some interesting compound classes such as the two discussed here, the thiophen/carboxamide and benzenesulfonamide groups. Although the precise MOA is not known at this time, we can speculate that the MOA for the thiophen/carboxamide inhibitors may be a bacterial RNase H, and the series could possibly be amenable to further drug development. In the case of the benzenesulfonamide inhibitors, it is unlikely that the MOA is DHPS, but the MOA may be another enzyme in the folate pathway. Further studies are necessary to make these determinations. Although compounds were identified that inhibited only one or more of the select agents (see <bold>Supplemental Data</bold>), we focused on those that inhibited all four because of NIAID’s interest in developing broad-spectrum inhibitors.</p>
<p>Of the 49 inhibitors identified, several are probably nonspecific inhibitors (e.g., biocides) based on information derived from SciFinder. These would not be useful for further specific drug development. Similar searches using SciFinder for a number of the 49 inhibitors did not produce any information; therefore, we have no leads regarding their MOA at this time. Perhaps the use of more extensive library searching services could produce additional information for these compounds. However, the NIH contract budget did not allow for the licensing cost of those databases. Some of the inhibitors identified in our screening were found to represent known antimicrobials such as R462438 (plate 63, well F03; quinolones) and ST044514 (plate 12, well H11, quinolones) (<bold>Table S3</bold>), as well as ST024737 (plate 53, well B07, trimethoprim), ST024740 (plate 53, well D07, sulfamethoxazole), ST007538 (plate 18, well G10, sulfamethoxydiazine), and ST007537 (plate 18, well F10, sulfamethoxypyridazine) (<bold>Supplemental Data</bold>). This information was not known until after the screening results were completed and chemical names and SciFinder information were being assessed. The complete set of results for the HTS of the 10 000 compounds is presented as <bold>Supplemental Data</bold>. This is done so that other researchers can make use of this information by helping them to identify possible groupings of compounds that share common scaffolding. They may also be able to identify compounds similar to ones they have in their own collections and use this to make a decision on pursuing their own compounds for further drug development. It is advised that one should obtain a copy of the MyriaScreen SD file from Sigma-Aldrich to make full use of this information by using data management software such as MDL ISIS/Base.
