<abstract>
<p>This study described the prevalence and risk factors for nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPD) among injection drug users (IDUs) recruited at syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in California. Interviews were conducted with 1,586 IDUs recruited from 24 SEPs across three annual cross-sections between 2001 and 2003. Any NMPD use in the past 6 months was reported by 17% of the sample. Factors independently associated with depressant use include recent participation in a drug treatment program, recent injection of heroin, and frequency of injection. Factors independently associated with opioid use include frequency of injection and history of incarceration. NMPD depressant use increased the odds of a nonfatal overdose in the past year. The authors’ findings represent a first step toward creating an epidemiologic profile of NMPD use that may be useful for targeting the implementation of interventions that are effective in reducing overdoses, a significant cause of mortality among IDUs worldwide.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that nonmedical prescription drug (NMPD) use has increased among the general population in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456015">McCabe, Cranford, &amp; West, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456015">Zacny et al., 2003</xref>). NMPD use can range from noncompliant use to abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456015">Sees, Di Marino, Ruediger, Sweeney, &amp; Shiffman, 2005</xref>) and typically refers to the use of a prescription drug not prescribed for the person by a physician and used solely for its psychoactive purpose to “get high” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456015">Novak &amp; Ball, 2006</xref>). Although data are available on NMPD use for the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456015">Becker, Sullivan, Tetrault, Desai, &amp; Fiellin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456015">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456015">Kroutil et al., 2006</xref>), there is little research on the prevalence, risk factors, and health outcomes of NMPD use among drug-using populations. The past-year prevalence for any prescription drug abuse, defined as use of a specific class of drug more than 12 times, was 35% among individuals who also met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456015">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria for past-year illicit drug use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456015">McCabe et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study of NMPD use among 213 Ketamine injectors found that approximately 56% reported using opioids such as Vicodin and Demerol, 47% reported using benzodiazepines, 33% reported using stimulants, and 15% reported using barbiturates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456015">Lankenau et al., 2007</xref>). Although antidepressants represent a small piece of the prescription drug misuse issue in the United States due to their lesser potential for abuse and dependence, previous research has shown that 24% of injection drug users (IDUs) used nonprescription antidepressants that were not prescribed for them in conjunction with other drugs such as heroin (64%), methadone (52%), and benzodiazepines (50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456015">S. M. Darke &amp; Ross, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, or additional opiates increases the likelihood of nonfatal and fatal overdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456015">Seal et al., 2001</xref>). Risk for overdose is heightened following a period of opioid abstinence or reduced opioid use, such as during incarceration or participation in a drug treatment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456015">Wakeman, Bowman, McKenzie, Jeronimo, &amp; Rich, 2009</xref>). Drug overdose currently surpasses HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C virus as the single greatest cause of mortality among IDUs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456015">Sporer, 2003</xref>). Nonfatal overdose is also a significant cause of morbidity due to cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456015">Warner-Smith, Darke, &amp; Day, 2002</xref>). Surveillance data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network show that 30% of the 1.3 million drug-related emergency room visits involved only illicit drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456015">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2006</xref>). Studies show the proportion of IDUs reporting at least one nonfatal overdose in their lifetime was 48% in San Francisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456015">Seal et al., 2001</xref>); 41% in Baltimore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456015">Pollini, McCall, Mehta, Vlahov, &amp; Strathdee, 1999</xref>); 58% in Vancouver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456015">Milloy et al., 2008</xref>); 68% in Sydney, Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456015">S. Darke, Williamson, Ross, Mills, &amp; Havard, 2007</xref>); and 38% in London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456015">Powis et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The aims of our study are to present empirical data on NMPD use among IDUs and to examine risk factors associated with this type of drug use. First, we describe the prevalence and risk factors associated with NMPD use among IDUs in a statewide sample of syringe exchange program (SEP) clients in California. Second, we examine the relationship between NMPD use and 12-month history of nonfatal overdose in the same sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022042612456015" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected from the California SEP (CalSEP) study, the methods of which have been reported in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456015">Bluthenthal, Anderson, Flynn, &amp; Kral, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612456015">Kral, Anderson, Flynn, &amp; Bluthenthal, 2004</xref>). The CalSEP study sampled clients from 24 SEPs in 16 California counties across three annual cross-sections. Counties ranged in size from a low of 62,500 residents (Mendocino, 2003) to a high of 6,359,500 residents (Los Angeles, 2003). A cross-section of 21 to 25 SEP clients was sampled from each of the 24 SEPs annually from 2001 to 2003 for a total sample size of 1,586. Each SEP was sampled three separate times, with the exception of 4 SEPs (2 in Los Angeles, and 1 each in Humboldt and Sonoma counties), which were only sampled twice.</p>
<p>SEP clients were approached by research staff and were eligible if they reported injecting drugs in the past 30 days. Due to negative prior experience with research studies that attempted to randomize eligible study participants at their program, SEPs and the research team decided to use convenience sampling. For SEPs that operated more than one site, recruitment of participants was proportional to the number of clients each of its sites served relative to the overall SEP. To participate in the study, participants had to be 18 years of age or older and self-report inject illicit drugs at least once in the last 30 days. Self-report injection was verified by physical inspection of injection sites. After eligibility was determined and informed consent was obtained, each participant was interviewed by a trained research interviewer/HIV counselor in a private space such as a car, a separate room, or a nearby bench.</p>
<p>Interviews lasted 30 to 45 min and elicited information about demographics, socioeconomic status, illicit prescription, nonprescription drug use history and practices, access to health care and drug treatment, overdose, and HIV-related risk behaviors such as sharing of injection paraphernalia and sexual behavior. Standard risk behavior assessments used among IDU populations since the early 1990s were used in the study instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456015">Dowling-Guyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456015">Needle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456015">Weatherby et al., 1994</xref>). Answers were entered by interviewers into the Questionnaire Development System (QDS, NOVA Research Inc., Bethesda, MD) software program on laptop computers to reduce the likelihood of data entry errors by coordinating skip patterns and running consistency and validity checks. After the interview, each participant received HIV risk reduction counseling, an oral HIV test, and referrals to social and medical services specific to the county where the research was being conducted. Each participant was paid US$10 for participating in the study. HIV test results and follow-up counseling were scheduled for 1 to 2 weeks later in the same location where the interviews and HIV testing had taken place. Study methods were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the RAND Corporation, University of California Davis, and the University of California San Francisco.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse classification of prescription drugs with abuse potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456015">National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2005</xref>) was used to sort prescription drug responses into three major classes of drugs—depressants (e.g., valium and barbiturates), opioids (e.g., percocet and oxycontin), and stimulants (e.g., dexedrine and ritalin). To ascertain information about NMPD use, participants were asked the following questions: “Have you used any other drugs, not counting prescription (prescribed) drugs, in the last 6 months? (Yes or No),” and for those who responded “Yes,” we asked, “What other drugs did you use most in the last 6 months? Please specify.” These open-ended responses were coded to identify the types of prescription drugs, if any, that were mentioned. Respondents who reported the use of any prescription drugs were coded as yes; all others were classified as “no.” If respondents indicated “yes” to using any nonprescribed prescription drugs, this was classified as NMPD use. The goal of the CalSEP study was not specific to studying NMPD use and therefore no further efforts were made to ascertain key information about frequency of use, acquisition of drugs, or specific brand names.</p>
<p>Six-month depressant and opioid use was compared with individual sociodemographics, drug-related behaviors, and selected health outcomes using Pearson’s chi-square test of association. All variables significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in bivariate analysis were entered into two separate multivariate logistic regression models to identify variables independently associated with depressant use and opioid use. Only statistically significant variables were retained in the models (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A third model was created to identify whether NMPD was independently associated with nonfatal overdose in the past 12 months. Each NMPD variable was forced into the model, whereas potentially confounding variables were only retained if they were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Nearly one third of the sample was female and one half was homeless (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612456015">Table 1</xref> here). Any NMPD use was reported by 17% of IDUs in our sample. Overall, 10% of the sample reported using depressants in the past 6 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612456015">Table 2</xref>). Opioid use other than heroin was reported by 10% of the sample. Among participants who reported NMPD use, only 20% reported the use of opioids and depressants. No participants reported the NMPD use of stimulants. In all, 13% of our sample reported a nonfatal overdose in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Bivariate results of selected variables associated with NMPD opioid and depressant use are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612456015">Table 2</xref>. Characteristics associated with the use of opioids and the use of depressants include race/ethnicity, number of total injections in the past 30 days, income in the past 30 days, and speedball injection in the past 6 months. We observed several notable differences between variables associated with the two types of NMPD use. Opioid use was significantly higher among IDUs with a history of incarceration in jail for more than 5 consecutive days in the past 2 years compared with IDUs without such history of incarceration. A history of injecting heroin in the past 6 months was significantly associated with depressant use.</p>
<p>We constructed three multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors independently associated with depressant use, opioid use, and nonfatal overdose. Multivariate models show that characteristics independently associated with depressant use included participation in a drug treatment program during the past 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.1, 2.3]), injection of heroin in the past 6 months (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI = [1.2, 3.2]), and injecting 30 times or more in the past 30 days (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = [1.3, 3.5]). Furthermore, African Americans and Latinos had lower odds of using depressants as compared with Whites (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI = [0.15, 0.49] and AOR = 0.38; 95% CI = [0.23, 0.63], respectively). Factors independently associated with opioid use included injection 30 times or more in the past 30 days (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = [1.1, 2.6]) and history of any jail time for more than 5 days in the past 2 years (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = [1.1, 2.1]). African Americans and Latinos had lower odds of using opioids than Whites (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI = [0.19, 0.57] and AOR = 0.24; 95% CI = [0.13, 0.45], respectively).</p>
<p>NMPD depressant use was independently associated with overdose (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = [1.1, 2.6]), after controlling for confounding variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612456015">Table 3</xref>). NMPD opioid use was not associated with overdose. Additional factors associated with overdose include injection of heroin in the past 6 months, injection of methamphetamine in the past 6 months, alcohol use in the past 30 days, current homelessness, and race/ethnicity. Compared with White IDUs, African Americans and Latinos had lower odds of experiencing a nonfatal overdose in the past year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study documented a higher prevalence of NMPD use among IDUs (17%) recruited at SEPs in California compared with the general population of the U.S. adults aged 26 or older (2.2%). However, compared with adults with a documented illicit drug use disorder, the prevalence of NMPD use among IDUs in our study is much lower (17% vs. 35%, compared with adults with a documented illicit drug disorder.</p>
<p>The two classes of drugs, depressants and opioids, were more frequently used by White IDUs compared with African Americans and Latinos. It is possible that lower diagnostic rates of depressive and anxiety disorders among Latinos and African Americans translate into reduced availability of prescription drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456015">Simpson, Krishnan, Kunik, &amp; Ruiz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456015">Wells, Koike, &amp; Sherbourne, 2001</xref>). Racial/ethnic differences in prevalence of use may not be attributed to differences in availability but social, cultural, or other reasons that have not been sufficiently explored. Refinement of our measurement of NMPD use, including sources of drug acquisition, motivations for use, frequency of use, and misuse of legitimately prescribed drugs, would allow for a more in-depth exploration of NMPD use among IDUs as well as why racial/ethnic disparities persist across categories of depressant and opioid use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456015">Boyd &amp; McCabe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional risk factors in common for NMPD use of depressants and opioids were total injections of any drugs in the past 30 days. Concurrent NMPD use and injection of street drugs (heroin, methamphetamines) may help explain the increase in risk for overdose that we observed in our sample of IDUs. Depressant use was strongly associated with recent nonfatal drug overdose. In addition to depressant use, other significant factors independently associated with overdose include homelessness and alcohol intake. Homelessness may reduce the presence of a stable and supportive social network to intervene before the onset of an overdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456015">Fast, Small, Wood, &amp; Kerr, 2009</xref>). The percentage of nonfatal overdose increased linearly with every quartile of alcohol use. IDUs with a history of alcohol intake for more than 17 days of the past 30 had twice the odds of reporting a nonfatal overdose in the past year. It is worthwhile to note that 19% of our sample (data not shown) reported drinking alcohol every day in a 30-day period. Intensified harm reduction efforts focused on concurrent alcohol use might result in fewer overdoses among IDUs. Unfortunately, we were unable to account for other diverse factors that contribute to overdose, including recent history of incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456015">Binswanger et al., 2007</xref>) and injection location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456015">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>). More research on the complex relationships between NMPD use and overdose is warranted.</p>
<p>Results should be viewed in light of several methodological limitations. In the current study, participants had to name the drugs that they used most in the last 12 months, which rests entirely on participant recall and knowledge of the drugs they used. Lankenau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456015">Lankenau et al., 2007</xref>) used structured questions to assess prescription drug use among 213 Ketamine injectors and provided participants with a list of 25 prescription drugs and asked whether each drug had been used nonmedically. We are probably underestimating prevalence in this study due to our focus on misuse of drugs that were not prescribed directly to them. Although a limitation, it is worth noting that among this sample of IDUs, stimulant use is not a preferred type of prescription drug for nonmedical use. However, unpublished data from a study of IDUs in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles provide comparable estimates of nonmedical prescription use of sedatives (21.5%) and barbiturates (3.4%) in a 30-day period (Bluthenthal &amp; Kral, personal communication, July 3, 2011).</p>
<p>Our study was also limited by the use of self-reported data for most variables; however, test–retest reliability and validity for study key study measures (i.e., HIV risk, drug use characteristics) have been found to be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456015">Dowling-Guyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456015">Needle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456015">Weatherby et al., 1994</xref>). We also used a cross-sectional sample that does not permit causal inferences. Finally, the sample was not selected at random, making it susceptible to selection biases.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provides some preliminary data on the prevalence and risk factors for NMPD use among a large sample of IDUs. Our findings represent a first step toward creating an epidemiologic profile of NMPD use that may be useful for targeting the implementation of existing interventions that are effective in reducing overdoses. Further research can expand this epidemiologic profile of NMPD by exploring the frequency of NMPD use, sources of prescription drug acquisition, and social context of the poly drug use that may increase risk for overdose.</p>
