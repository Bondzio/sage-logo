<abstract>
<p>The inclusion of the elderly in the digital era could positively impact their social and economic welfare. However, their level of Internet use is relatively low in Spain compared to other sectors of the population. The present study aims to explain the Internet use in this segment, capturing the heterogeneity across gender in the technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 492 individuals over 50 years old has been analyzed using the multigroup approach of structural equations models. The results show that although TAM is suitable for studying the phenomenon, it is necessary to consider how the gender gap in the Internet use development is real for seniors. Contrary to previous results that pointed to a greater importance of the ease of use for women than men among Internet users, male elders seem to perceive more usefulness due to higher levels of ease of use than woman. This ease of use is also better explained by the level of enjoyment for males. All these results point to unique gender differences for older adults in their Internet use.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to be a major driver of economic and social modernization. In 2008, European companies have devoted 20% of their investment to ICTs and the sector accounts for 26% of overall research expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439312473421">European Commission, 2008</xref>). Spain is the fifth country in the European ranking of Internet usage, after Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439312473421">European Commission Information Society and Media, 2010</xref>). However, the level of Internet acceptance is not balanced across all the strata of the Spanish population. Regarding age, older adults present a lower use of computers and Internet compared with younger segments of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439312473421">Instituto Nacional de Estadística [INE], 2012</xref>). Specifically, men and women in the older category show different percentages of use, 31% and 19%, respectively. This value has been increasing since 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439312473421">European Commission Information Society and Media, 2010</xref>). Previsions point to an elder world population—people over 60 will reach the 2,000 million in 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894439312473421">United Nations, 2011</xref>)—and place Spain as the oldest country in Europe with 30% of Spaniards in this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894439312473421">Puyol Antolín &amp; Abellán García, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Elderly persons represent a segment that must confront the use of new technologies at this point of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894439312473421">Peacock &amp; Künemund, 2007</xref>). Their inclusion in the digital era could positively impact their social and economic welfare (Aldrige, 2004) and on their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894439312473421">Nahm &amp; Resnick, 2001</xref>). The Internet can contribute to the creation of an active senior population, decreasing the rate of marginalization and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439312473421">Hill, Beynon-Davies, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). However, companies and public institutions have systematically forgotten elderly persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439312473421">Eastman &amp; Iyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0894439312473421">Trocchia &amp; Janda, 2000</xref>), though they are an increasing and interesting group of consumers that has recently been claiming for the use of ICTs.</p>
<p>In general, the interest in elderly persons is increasing, not only for academics who are describing new challenges for marketing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439312473421">Lambert-Pandraud &amp; Laurent, 2010</xref>) but also for political forces in Europe which are focusing their efforts on this segment. For instance, 2012 was designated as the European year for active ageing and solidarity between generations, with the IT services being one of the priorities. Indeed, the acceptance behavior and the use of the Internet by older users is receiving growing attention from the economic, social, and political viewpoints, setting the reduction of the digital divide in this population as a common goal. We have found many examples of public policies in Spain and Europe such as the <italic>Plan Avanza1-2005 </italic>and <italic>Avanza2-2011</italic> (Advance plans), and the Initiative i2010.</p>
<p>However, previous studies about the elderly using Internet have not yet been conclusive about the process leading to their Internet use. The aim of this work is to advance in the study of the Internet use by elderly persons. To do so, we specifically study the technology acceptance model (TAM) applied to the Internet, capturing the heterogeneity of the older population in the Internet use model across genders. TAM explains and predicts how an individual decides to adopt a new technology. Based on the theory of reasoned action (TRA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439312473421">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439312473421">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439312473421">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>), the model has been extensively used, tested, and refined for the adoption of many technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894439312473421">Sun &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894439312473421">Yousafzai, Foxall, and Pallister, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894439312473421">2007b</xref>). However, it is necessary to understand that the older population is more heterogeneous than any other population group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439312473421">Hooyman &amp; Kiyak, 2005</xref>). In the present study, the heterogeneity of this segment has been described by analyzing gender differences in the acceptance model of Internet use. The results describe the need for a new TAM conception for elderly persons. This new conception considers the partial mediator role of perceived usefulness, behavior intention, and ease of use and shows how enjoyment affects the perceived ease of use for males more intensively than females. Similarly, we find a stronger effect of the perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness for males than females. Our findings highlight how the perceived ease of use is a key variable in the understanding of the heterogeneity of elders with respect to the Internet use emergence.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. First, we introduce the Internet use process for elderly persons describing the variables considered in the model. Second, we propose and justify a single hypothesis about the moderator role of gender in TAM for elders. Third, the analysis and results are shown. Finally, the article concludes with the exposition of the discussion, and the limitations and considerations for further research.</p>

<title>The Internet Use and the Elderly Person</title>
<p>The use of computers and Internet present many advantages for seniors. It has a positive effect on their autonomy and cognition-related issues, preventing people from cognitive decline and improving autonomy and everyday functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894439312473421">Slegers, van Boxtel, &amp; Jolles, 2012</xref>). But access alone will not result in optimal benefits from online information. Successful Internet users must possess skills for searching, navigating, sorting, filtering, and utilizing Internet information. These skills may be lacking in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439312473421">Cresci, Yarandi, &amp; Morrell, 2010</xref>). It is not only the age that impedes the use of Internet, but rather the lack of user experience. This is generally manifested in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439312473421">Hernández, Jiménez, &amp; Martín, 2011</xref>). On average, elderly persons today are healthier, better educated, and wealthier compared to earlier cohorts; yet, the Internet diffusion advances more swiftly than the online skills of senior citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894439312473421">Peacock &amp; Künemund, 2007</xref>). At this moment of time, it is not clear whether older adults will be active participants in the online community. This is the reason why some researchers are focusing their efforts on the elderly using Internet. Some authors have studied the drivers of the Internet use by the elderly by analyzing variables such as attitude, innovation, demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439312473421">Eastman &amp; Iyer, 2004</xref>), nostalgia proneness, innovativeness, and risk aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894439312473421">Reisenwitz, Iyer, Kuhlmeier, &amp; Eastman, 2007</xref>), health, leisure, recreation participation and leadership, and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439312473421">Koopman-Boyden &amp; Reid, 2009</xref>) or the prevalent reasons for not using the Internet (Peacock &amp; Künemud, 2007). Nevertheless, few studies confront the emergence of the use. The use finally generates the experience required to overcome the barriers to the Internet as a process in which different perceptions about the Internet play an important role (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439312473421">Kim, 2008</xref> for a review of older adults’ computer learning and Internet usage). For instance, McCloskey, (2006) identifies key variables in the process, proposing a model in which age, trust, ease of use, and usefulness explain the level of participation in e-commerce by older consumers. However, the basis for this study is that the elderly have already used the Internet.</p>
<p>Some authors point out the positive effect of attitudes on Internet use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439312473421">Iyer and Eastman (2006)</xref> propose a scale to measure attitudes and apply it in the elderly frame. They conclude that those seniors who have more positive attitudes toward the Internet are more likely to use it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894439312473421">Nayak, Priest, and White (2010)</xref> complete the study of attitudes in the Internet use by applying the TAM to the level of seniors’ Internet usage. These authors conclude that the attitude toward the Internet use and the health status influence both the activity level and the total time using the Internet. Gender in this study showed a significant impact on the activity level of use, but Nayak et al. exclusively analyze the direct effects of the TAM’s variables and demographics on the use (measured in terms of the total time in hours and the activity level). Conclusions about how these attitudes appear, indicating the mediator role of the TAM’s variables in the use emergence, are not shown in the article mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding the Internet use, the study of the Internet engagement by the elderly has been also addressed, though using a qualitative approach. This is the case of the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439312473421">Hill, Beynon-Davies, and Williams (2008)</xref>. These authors identified the perceptions of various factors, including practical value, relevance, and affordability as indicators of the nature of attitudes toward Internet engagement.</p>
<p>The studies mentioned show how the Internet use by the elderly had been addressed without a clear focus on the perceptions involved in the process of use emergence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439312473421">Chung, Park, Wang, Fulk, and McLaughlin (2010)</xref> analyze differences in perceptions of online community participation among nonusers. Nonetheless, in this approach they do not specifically analyze how the Internet use appears in elderly persons. They collect a heterogeneous sample in terms of age in which only 70 of the 248 individuals interviewed were older than 55. This is a sample of elders that cannot be treated as representative of the grey market but could be good enough to capture age differences. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010)</xref> use the TAM as a framework to study the process of Internet adoption by older adults. However, simple direct effects on Internet use intention and Internet adoption are shown in this study without discussing the mediator role of each variable of the TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439312473421">Arning &amp; Ziefle, 2007</xref>) and the possibilities for the moderation of age and gender in the complete TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0894439312473421">
<title>Technology Acceptance Model</title>
<p>TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439312473421">Davis, 1986</xref>) has been used as the leading framework to explain and predict how individuals accept a new technology. TAM predicts that users embrace a new technology when their perceptions of ease of use and the usefulness of technology are positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439312473421">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439312473421">Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw, 1989</xref>). Since then, several revisions and expansions have developed the original model. The most popular developments have been TAM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>) and TAM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The model enfolds three key variables: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and the potential users’ behavioral intention (BI) to adopt the technology in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439312473421">Chung, Park, Wang, Fulk, &amp; McLaughlin, 2010</xref>). A meta-analysis has shown the robustness of paths from PEOU to PU and from PU to BI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894439312473421">Sun &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>). The model also includes external and antecedent factors affecting two key variables: PEOU and PU. During the past two decades, more than 70 different variables have been proposed as antecedents of PEOU and PU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894439312473421">Yousafzai et al., 2007a</xref>). The evolution and summaries of previous empirical findings are well presented in a meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894439312473421">Lee, Kozar, and Larsen (2003)</xref>. However, the TAM has been tested with little attention to moderating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894439312473421">Sun &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894439312473421">Yousafzai et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894439312473421">2007b</xref>). Our study adopts the four main constructs from the original TAM model: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), the potential users’ behavioral intention (BI), and usage behavior (USE) constructs. The original TAM has been improved in TAM2 and TAM3. In this research, we use the concept Result Demonstrability (RES) from TAM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). This is defined as the degree to which an individual believes that the results of using a system are tangible, observable, and communicable. RES acts as an important antecedent of PU. Insofar as it is related to the perception of the elderly about the benefits of being online to develop Internet use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439312473421">Eastman &amp; Iyer, 2004</xref>), it appears as an important factor in the Internet use process. Finally, the perceived enjoyment (ENJ) has been adopted from TAM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008</xref>). This is defined as the extent to which the activity of using a specific system is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right, aside from any performance consequences resulting from system use. The ENJ can be considered an antecedent of the PEOU and is identified as a key element in the emergence of Internet use in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439312473421">McCloskey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan &amp; Jordan-Marsh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our aim in this article is to understand the Internet use by the elderly. This can be considered as one of the most heterogeneous groups in the market. This is the reason why we propose the relationships among the TAM’s factors as the baseline model to analyze the Internet use emergence in the segment of the elderly, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312473421">Figure 1</xref>. We study the heterogeneity of this stratum considering the moderator role of gender, as we discuss in the following section.</p>

<title>The Moderator Role of Gender</title>
<p>Although some studies call for the need to collect data on potential moderators and criticize the lack of analysis of moderating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439312473421">Adams, Nelson, &amp; Todd, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439312473421">Agarwal &amp; Karahanna, 2000</xref>), research employing the TAM has rarely included moderators or treated potential moderators as antecedents of use without a characterization of the real differences across the natural groups that can be identified using demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894439312473421">Nayak, Priest, &amp; White, 2010</xref>). Few studies have incorporated moderators and found a significant role of moderating factors in the TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439312473421">Gefen &amp; Straub, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894439312473421">Sun &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894439312473421">Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Moderators that have been suggested but remain largely untested include individual factors (e.g., gender, age, experience, intellectual capacity, and cultural background) and technology factors (e.g., purpose and complexity and organizational factors such as voluntariness and profession). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894439312473421">Sun and Zhang (2006)</xref> explained that the inclusion of moderators could improve the explanatory power of the model and overcome the inconsistencies in the relationships between the key variables shown in previous studies.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439312473421">Gefen and Straub (1997)</xref> consider that although technology such as electronic mail may be used to a similar extent by both males and females, their perception of the service is different. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0894439312473421">Zhang (2009)</xref> also analyzes the influence of gender on the two key variables of the TAM (usefulness and ease of use) and ratifies the greater effect of these variables considering gender differences. Men tend to be more task-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894439312473421">Minton &amp; Schneider, 1980</xref>), systems-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439312473421">Baron-Cohen, 2004</xref>), and willing to take risks than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894439312473421">Powell &amp; Ansic, 1997</xref>). In line with the task-orientation difference, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894439312473421">Venkatesh and Morris (2000)</xref> find that men’s decisions to use a computer system were more influenced by the perceived usefulness than in the case of women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894439312473421">Rodgers and Harris (2003)</xref> have found men to be more satisfied with online shopping than women and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439312473421">McCloskey (2006)</xref> proposes that there may be differences in the motivation, duration, and enjoyment as electronic consumers across genders.</p>
<p>Empirical findings about the moderator role of gender in the TAM are not conclusive for older adults. In the specific frame of the elderly, older women have been identified as the less knowledgeable group regarding security hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439312473421">Grimes, Hough, Mazur, &amp; Signorella, 2010</xref>) and recent research has found no statistically differences between males and females with regard to Internet use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894439312473421">Shin, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010)</xref> argue that older men can be considered more motivated to perceive usefulness while older women could be more influenced by ease of use. These are process factors expecting a stronger relationship between PU and BI and PU on Internet adoption by males than by females and a stronger relationship between the perceived ease of use and the use intention by female than by male seniors. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010)</xref> did not find empirical support for their propositions about the moderator role of gender.</p>
<p>How gender moderates the effect of the TAM factors on Internet use would provide a good lens for examining the different decision-making mechanisms between men and women in the grey population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan &amp; Jordan-Marsh, 2010</xref>). In general, the moderator role of gender depends on the level of acceptance of the technology: When the penetration and acceptance of technologies increases, the moderator effect of gender diminishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894439312473421">Zhou, Dai, &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>). Also gender-derived differences can be considered extremely slight in a sample of individuals with prior experience of the IT under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439312473421">Hernández et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, and considering the low level of Internet penetration for elderly persons, we expect to find a moderator effect of gender on the TAM in this segment. This means that the relationship between the factors proposed in the baseline model under study would present differences in terms of intensity across genders.</p>
<p>The cognitive process of older adults is totally different from other groups of the population and no conclusive results have been supported in previous studies of gender differences in seniors. Adding to this the consideration that women and men use different socially constructed cognitive structures to encode and process information and the level of acceptance of Internet in the older segment being low, we expect that gender will play a moderator role on the TAM factors’ relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894439312473421">Ping, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894439312473421">Zhou, Dai, &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>), as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312473421">Figure 1</xref>.<list list-type="simple">

<title>Data</title>
<p>Our survey was constructed considering established measures of TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Bala 2008</xref>) adapted to the context of our proposed model. Specifically, the measure of USE has been extracted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439312473421">Kwon and Wen (2010)</xref>. All items were anchored on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), except for sociodemographics and other variables related to the use of the computer and the Internet. To eliminate possible ambiguities in the questionnaire, it was piloted using seven older adult volunteers from “the Classroom Experience” at the University.</p>
<p>One requirement to be enrolled in the program of the Classroom Experience is to be a minimum of 50 years old. Previous research has shown different minimum levels for the age to study the adoption of ICTs of elderly persons and their online behavior. Since there is not a clear definition of the age to consider a person in the group of elderly persons, in our research we use the limit mentioned following the previous works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439312473421">Lee (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439312473421">Czaja, Lee, Nair, and Sharit (2008)</xref>.

Data were collected using a survey conducted during the teaching hours of the classroom experience in which the collaboration of the students of the four levels of the program was required. These multidisciplinary studies include courses in arts and humanities, science, health science, social science and law, engineering, and architecture. Data collection was conducted during the moths of March and April 2011. Finally, we collected 492 complete questionnaires. The final composition of the sample is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439312473421">Table 1</xref>. Although the sample cannot be considered as representative of the population insofar as convenience samples often rely on voluntary participation to obtain data, our sample is diverse.

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p>Considering gender, the sample was split into two groups. Group 1, males, was made up of 168 individuals, and the Group 2 of 324 females. Differences across groups in terms of means and covariance matrices were tested and the scales proposed were validated evaluating configural and metric invariance across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894439312473421">Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998</xref>). To do so, we ran different multigroup analyses using the structural equation models software EQS. The resulting measurement model is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312473421">Table 2</xref>. Convergent validity was tested. As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312473421">Table 2</xref>, all standardized loading factors presented values over 0.6 and the model fit of the measurement model can be considered acceptable. Discriminant validity was tested using two different approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439312473421">Bagozzi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439312473421">Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we calculated the confidence intervals for correlations using their standard errors (in brackets in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312473421">Table 2</xref>). None of the intervals included the value 1. Additionally, we ran one second measurement model constraining correlations equal to 1 for each group. The results of the lagrange multiplier (LM) test showed the need to relax these constraints and there were significant differences in terms of model fit between the constrained and the unconstrained model (χ<sup>2</sup> difference = 1,548.769; <italic>df</italic> difference = 35; <italic>p </italic>value &lt; .001). Consequently, we can conclude that concepts included in the model present discriminant validity. Once the measurement model had been evaluated, we continue showing the results for the hypothesis posited.</p>
<p>In the model proposed, RES and PEOU act as antecedents of PU, ENJ affects PEOU and PEOU and PU determine BI exclusively, being BI the only antecedent of USE (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312473421">Figure 1</xref>). In other words, a critical assumption of the TAM is that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness fully mediate the influence of external variables on the USE emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439312473421">Arning &amp; Ziefle, 2007</xref>). In this point, we question if the mediator role of these variables is pure or if there are direct effects not considered a priori that could improve the model fit. Complementary mediation is tested in this analysis (if both the mediated and the direct effect exist and point in the same direction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0894439312473421">Zhao, Lynch, &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). Results show how all the factors involved in the model presented significant and direct relationships with some other factors (direct relationships identified are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439312473421">Figure 2</xref>). The inclusion of these effects improved the model fit—using the LM test estimations as an orientation—with the exception of two relationships: PU with USE and RES with BI (model fit indices for the model originally proposed: χ<sup>2</sup> = 1,505.425, <italic>df</italic> =385, <italic>p </italic>value &lt; .001; Satorra-Bentler χ<sup>2</sup> = 807.280; <italic>p </italic>value &lt; .001; Robust comparative fit index (CFI) = .901; robust root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .067.

The decrease in the χ<sup>2</sup> value including the direct and significant effects identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439312473421">Figure 2</xref>) improved the model fit, thus showing the partial moderation of the variables under question.

<title>Discussion, Limitations, and Further Research</title>
<p>Consumers’ age has been traditionally considered an important basis for market segmentation. However, the identification of a homogeneous elderly group of consumers is a difficult task insofar as elderly persons show a differential sensitivity in processing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439312473421">Cole &amp; Houston, 1987</xref>). This is manifested in a high heterogeneity in this stratum of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894439312473421">Phillips &amp; Sternthal, 1977</xref>).

For instance, age has a significant impact on the number of information sources they use, the number of brands they consider, presents a stronger change aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439312473421">Lambert-Pandraud, Laurent, &amp; Lapersonne, 2005</xref>) and is negatively associated with the perceived ease of use of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894439312473421">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2006</xref>). When age increases, the innovativeness decreases with long-known options tending to be preferred instead of seeking out novel information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439312473421">Lambert-Pandraud &amp; Laurent, 2010</xref>). Technology anxiety also increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894439312473421">Meuter, Ostrom, Bitner, &amp; Roundtree, 2003</xref>). Yet, older adults might already appreciate the potential usefulness of the Internet. If marketers have been successful in getting older consumers to overcome perceptions about difficulty and cost, those elderly with positive experiences will have reinforced the relative value of using the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894439312473421">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this work was to better understand the heterogeneity of this stratum of the population when they confront the Internet use, by applying the TAM for elderly persons. There are few previous studies in this sense and none of them puts into question the mediator role of the TAM’s factors for elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439312473421">Arning &amp; Ziefle, 2007</xref>) analyzing differences across gender. In this vein, our study can be considered as a step further in the understanding of the Internet use by the elderly. Results show how this segment develops its Internet use in a more complicated way than has been considered in previous studies of TAM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439312473421">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439312473421">Cresci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan &amp; Jordan-Marsh, 2010</xref>). Specifically, BI is not the single driver of USE, RES, and ENJOY and PEOU also have a direct and positive effect on USE. In the same way, PU and PEOU also receive an effect from ENJ and RES, respectively. Finally, BI receives a direct and positive effect from ENJ. All these relationships highlight the important role played by RES and ENJOY on the USE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894439312473421">Table 3</xref>). The identified effect of PU on Internet use in the elderly population is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010)</xref>. In the cell phone adoption by older people, direct effects of PEOU on USE and ENJOY on PU were also significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439312473421">Conci, Pianesi, &amp; Zancanaro, 2009</xref>). However, none of these studies considered the specific role of RES nor analyzed the moderator role of gender on all the relationships proposed in the classical TAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312473421">Figure 1</xref>) neither in the TAM for elders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439312473421">Figure 2</xref>). While classical approaches consider BI the main factor affecting USE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008</xref>), the role of RES and ENJ seem to be different in the case of elderly persons. They act as drivers, not only as they contribute to the emergence of PU, PEOU, and BI but also because they directly affect USE. Elderly persons present different cognitive processes and consequently it seems reasonable for them to have different paths to develop an intention to use the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894439312473421">Slegers et al., 2012</xref>). Elders often do not realize how much their abilities have changed and how gradually the adaptation to a technology has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439312473421">Hough &amp; Kobylansky, 2009</xref>). To develop specific offers for the elderly on the Internet, the differences in the human capabilities and perceptions that most affect successful use must first be understood. In this sense, our results support the idea that new solutions must be based on design principles, mainly in joy of use, perceived ease of use, result demonstrability and, to a lesser extent, usefulness. These are aspects to be included in an offer that must be properly communicated to this segment.</p>

<p>The identification of groups of elders presenting differences in the Internet use could refine the strategies to overcome the barriers to the Internet and highlight an appropriate offer for this segment. With this idea in mind, in our analysis we capture the heterogeneity across elders controlling gender differences using multisample analysis. The results show more intense relationships between ENJ and PEOU and PEOU and PU for the male sample. These results are to some extent consistent with previous analysis. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439312473421">Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010)</xref> found out, there is not empirical support for gender differences in the relationships between PU and BI and between the perceived ease of use and the use intention. However, contrary to previous results, PEOU seems to play an important role in capturing differences across genders: A more enjoyable experience would lead to a higher PEOU for males than females which would finally develop a higher perception of usefulness. Both PU and PEOU are key variables in the behavioral intention emergence and the perceived ease of use directly and indirectly provokes higher values of use.</p>
<p>It is important to remark that the TAM presents differences across gender in the senior segment inconsistent with previous results. Our results point to unique gender differences in this segment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439312473421">Illie, Van Slyke, and Lou (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894439312473421">Ong and Lai (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439312473421">Chinyamurindi and Low (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894439312473421">Riquelme and Ríos (2010)</xref> found a stronger relationship for women than men between PEOU and PU. They argue that men’s rate of self-efficacy/computer self-efficacy is higher than women’s and consequently they expected, and their results finally supported the relationship between these two variables to be stronger for females than males. The lower computer self-efficacy for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894439312473421">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000</xref>) and the stronger effect of ease of use to compensate it cannot be concluded for elders. In this case, the Internet application being easier to use might be more valued as useful to men and perceived as easier if it is enjoyable. There is an age when changes in behavioral responses occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894439312473421">Phillips &amp; Sternthal, 1977</xref>). In this change, the tendency of female consumers to be more cautious than males can become stronger due to the cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439312473421">Lambert-Pandraud et al., 2005</xref>). This provokes a lack of trust for women that could affect the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439312473421">McCloskey, 2006</xref>) and probably the relationship between them. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894439312473421">Slegers, van Boxtel, and Jolles (2012)</xref> conclude that older adults tend to use their computers more for playing games, thus suggesting the need to include a more enjoyable experience in order to motivate elderly persons to overcome the barriers of their learning disabilities. Further research must focus on the important role of ease of use for seniors and if other variables such as psychological age and, health perception, in addition to self-efficacy and the level of caution—not only demographics—could explain the role of ease of use to show different patterns across segments of seniors. The role played by ease of use seems to be determinant in the understanding of differences in Internet use and it appears as a powerful variable to show the heterogeneity of this stratum.</p>
<p>As a consequence, offers and programs and even new product development (NPD) processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894439312473421">Reddi &amp; Moon, 2012</xref>) may consider differences in terms of gender and age of users. Specifically, those designed for men over 50 could seek to describe an easy and enjoyable experience in order to be successful in the market and to really bring elderly persons into the Internet era.</p>
<p>At this point, we want to remark some limitations referring to our work. First, data have been collected in a Mediterranean country where the differences in relation to new technologies and elderly persons from Anglo-Saxon countries could significantly affect the TAM. No cultural variables had been taken into account in the current work. In addition, in order to simplify the questionnaire, we did not include other measures that could be interesting in the study of the Technology acceptance, such as personality traits that have shown a strong relationship with gender differences in consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439312473421">Michael &amp; Todd, 2012</xref>). We are aware that integrating personality constructs into models of consumer psychology, demographics, and other individual differences with respect to the phenomena of elderly persons could be clarified. Elder consumers tend to maintain and repeat behaviors and decline innovativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439312473421">Lambert-Pandraud &amp; Laurent, 2010</xref>). Further research could, therefore, include measures of the previous experience of elders with computer and Internet applications—word processors, Internet browsers, e-mail, games, calculating, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894439312473421">Slegers et al., 2012</xref>). This would make it possible to differentiate between less and more experienced users and establish their relationship with gender.</p>
<p>Given the difficulty of surveying elderly persons, we decided to contact those we had at our disposal, and they also constitute, to some extent, the most active part of the elderly population as they are enrolled in a course at the University. This affects the results and hence they must be considered as a first approach in the understanding of the elderly.</p>
<p>For a long time, the study of elderly persons mainly belonged to the areas of geriatrics, gerontology, medicine, psychology, or sociology. We expect new studies to emerge that will focus on this currently growing population. We really wish to make a strong appeal for more public policies and specific programs in order to bring elderly persons into the new era.</p>
