<p>This issue of <italic>International Social Work</italic> contains seven papers from colleagues drawing on work across four continents. Although the authors are from diverse settings and explore a variety of specific issues, all seven papers included in this issue focus on the issue of culture and cultural diversity as they pertain to social work education and practice.</p>
<p>The issue opens with a paper from Kieran O’Donoghue and Ming-sum Tsui on social work supervision. The authors review the development of supervision in New Zealand, arguing that it has established a professional culture encompassing a plurality of approaches and widespread diversity. The paper reinforces the complexity of cultural dynamics in social work practice and is relevant for ongoing debates about the role of clinical supervision in an era of managerialism.</p>
<p>The second paper in the issue, a brief note by Susan Lord, offers an essay on international collaboration in social work. She argues that in the context of globalization, all social workers are engaged in international social work to some extent. She illustrates the benefits of international collaboration in social work education through the example of an African student studying in the US and outlines how this experience has helped her to challenge insularity of concept and practice in the social work classroom.</p>
<p>Next, Huang Yunong and Zhang Xiong further respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811429899">Gray (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811429899">Gray and Coates’ (2010)</xref> responses to a previous article in ISW on indigenization of social work (Huang and Zhang, 2010). They urge a degree of caution in dichotomous division of ‘western’ and ‘indigenous’ discourses in social work. They argue that proponents of indigenization in social work have tended to neglect the different social, historical and political systems between western and indigenous societies which, they suggest, may block indigenous people from pursuing liberation and freedom.</p>
<p>In the fourth paper of the issue, Patrick Leung, Monit Cheung and Venus Tsui present the results of a survey of depressive symptoms and help-seeking behaviours in a group of Asian Indians living in the USA. The findings suggest that service providers need a better understanding of the cultural practices, belief systems and attitudes of Asian Indians if they are to make their services more accessible and relevant to the needs of this group of service users.</p>
<p>Monit Cheung and Elena Delavega go on to explore the use of poverty reduction policies from around the globe, with specific reference to the use of child savings accounts. Identifying some of the main features of this approach they discuss its relevance for the US, arguing for the establishment of a national child savings account policy in which social workers should take a leading strategic position.</p>
<p>Next, Yahya El-Lahib and Samantha Wehbi discuss immigration and disability in Canada. They argue that disabled people are disadvantaged in the immigration system and provide a practice illustration. They suggest that social workers should become more actively involved in the disability rights movement as a way of lobbying for policy change. They call for social workers, in particular those who work with the migration and asylum system, to be more highly politicised in order to challenge such inequalities.</p>
<p>In the final paper of the issue, Ronald Hall takes up the issue of Islamic spirituality as a fundamental issue for Western social workers’ practice. He argues that the application of Islamic spirituality is necessary as a practice resource for social work with Muslim populations in the West who may not respond to traditional methods of social work intervention.</p>
