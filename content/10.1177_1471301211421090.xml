<abstract>
<p>Despite steadfast interest in the use of arts therapies (ATs) with individuals who have dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), a systematic review of the literature has not been conducted. This paper aims to critique this evidence base, including music, visual arts, drama, and dance/movement therapies between the years 1990 and 2010, and make suggestions on how it can be strengthened. The review addresses four questions: (1) What is the focus of the empirical base on using AT with persons who have DAT? (2) (How) have these studies been designed and evaluated? (3) What findings are reported? (4) What does this tell us about the potential of AT for enriching the lives of people with dementia? This analysis reveals that systematically designed, documented, and evaluated AT studies are scarce. Information on research design, operational concepts, measurement tools, and methods of evaluation/analysis are vague, if provided. Disagreement exists about the utilization of theoretical concepts and measurement/evaluation tools. The evidence base is further divided between studies focusing on the ‘product’ versus the ‘process’ of art. Shortcomings in dementia-specific research include a paucity of accounts from participants, failure to extend therapies to individuals in the early stages, a lack of application to those living at home, and often superficial attention to the meaningful aspects of <italic>doing</italic> art. Models investigating subjective well-being, or ‘enrichment,’ rather than objectively measured biomedical approaches privileging the management of deficits, would expand the evidence base and help ensure that those with dementia receive the services <italic>they want</italic>, since strictly allopathic methodologies will continue to fall short of adequately evaluating what are deeply idiosyncratic psychosocial issues.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421090"><title>Background</title>
<p>Historically, research on the dementias focused almost exclusively on ‘cause and cure’ efforts to locate etiology and to alleviate the presumed stresses associated with the so-called ‘caregiver burden.’ Since the mid-1990s, pioneering social scientists have been using qualitative, interview-based research to disseminate narratives of life with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this, and the steady surge of autobiographies depicting the experiences of individuals living with dementia, subjective experiences continue to be marginalized. Although this trend is beginning to reverse, political attention, scientific efforts, and research funding remain focused on biomedical answers/solutions, such as pathology and pharmacological treatments, rather than more nuanced person-centered approaches emphasizing subjective meaning and well-being. Biomedical assumptions that it is impossible to ascertain the views of people with AD have resulted in a paucity of subjective accounts and over-emphasis on issues of prevention and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421090">Downs, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421090">2000</xref>), rather than exploring what is preserved or the (non-biological) causes of the losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421090">Bender &amp; Cheston, 1997</xref>) and areas for potential enrichment. Contemporary social science research, however, has clearly demonstrated diagnosed individuals’ enduring ability to meaningfully interact, despite stigma resulting from (perceived) inability to navigate their social worlds according to normative expectations of interaction. In particular, one study found that 77.5% of seniors with cognitive impairment were ‘interviewable’ and could answer questions about their quality of life, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1471301211421090">Mozley et al. (1999)</xref>. Subjective accounts of people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) highlight an ability and willingness to be involved in their health care and a general eagerness to be treated as equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421090">Beard, Knauss, &amp; Moyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421090">Halpern, Ly, Elkin-Frankston, &amp; O'Connor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Innovative social science research on the role of ‘artworks’ in the lives of women with breast cancer demonstrates ‘the potential for change regarding the representation of illness, the aim of collective critiques relating to medicine, the chance to redefine the relationship of the individual to social institutions, and strategies for survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1471301211421090">Radley &amp; Bell, 2007</xref>, p. 386). Related studies advocate that we move beyond biomedical frameworks privileging some illness narratives over others, since both ‘heroes’ and ‘victims’ are socially marginalized in a health-based society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421090">Gray, Sinding, &amp; Fitch, 2001</xref>). Accordingly, art interventions are necessary in order to ‘help create a social context in which ill people will be better supported and less subject to unnecessary suffering’ (p. 246), or excess disability. The symbolic language of art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1471301211421090">Stoll, 2005</xref>) and the role of ‘creativity’ in helping people make sense of biographical disruptions caused by illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421090">Daykin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421090">Daykin, McClean, &amp; Bunt, 2007</xref>) are also highlighted. Such acknowledgement of the social impact of art is crucial in order to understand the social psychology of dementia.</p>
<p>Dementia specialists have also begun asking how more nuanced understandings of life with DAT can be obtained, including the design of more meaningful, responsive services. This involves various alternative, non-pharmacological<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211421090">1</xref></sup> approaches to improving ‘quality of life’ for diagnosed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1471301211421090">Hendry &amp; McVittie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1471301211421090">Lipe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1471301211421090">Scholzel-Dorenbos et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1471301211421090">Thorgrimsen et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to existing research on the ‘loss of self’ and ‘caregiver burden’ presumed to accompany the diagnosis, the positive aspects of both living with Alzheimer's and being the loved one of someone with the condition are also being examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421090">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421090">Beard, Knauss &amp; Moyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421090">Cohen, Colantonio, &amp; Vernich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1471301211421090">Holst &amp; Hallberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1471301211421090">McIntyre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1471301211421090">Roff et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike outcome-based models focused on modifiable variables, such as physical and mental exercise and clinical scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1471301211421090">Prohaska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1471301211421090">Saunders &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-1471301211421090">Van de Winckel, Feys, &amp; De Weerdt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1471301211421090">Wilcox et al., 2009</xref>), much of the non-pharmacological research explores the use of the arts with persons who have dementia.</p>

These reviews reveal a lack of methodological consensus within the arts therapy (AT) literature on conceptual definitions, study design, measurement, and evaluation, especially with participants who have dementia. The focus of most interventions is on the reduction of so-called behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs), through objectively administered clinical scales, rather than self-reports and quality-of-life factors. None of the reviews reveal a focus on ‘enrichment’ or subjective well-being as an outcome of AT interventions. Furthermore, disagreement exists on whether to include and how to operationalize quality of life. The evidence base for evaluating AT activities is generally poorly documented, demonstrating that the vast majority of empirical findings cannot be replicated and/or validated. This is true whether the focus is on clinical outcomes or subjective variables.</p>
<p>Proponents of AT have tried to justify these shortcomings by acknowledging both internal and external factors. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421090">Berrol (2000)</xref>, traditional scientific research methods are often inappropriate for understanding some ATs, yet ‘the recent trend towards more “rigorous” research designs that measure a few precisely defined quantitative outcomes [comes] at the cost of a narrower appreciation of the [qualitative, subjective] impacts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>, p. 431). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1471301211421090">Meekums (2010)</xref> posits that AT researchers tend to either outright reject experimental models on principle or acquiesce to the inappropriate basic research paradigm rather than using the skills they have (e.g. observation, in-depth interviewing, allowing ‘not-knowingness,’ engaging with the creative process, and embodying narratives) to advance the field. Arguably, these factors negatively impact (the quality and quantity of) the AT evidence base.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of this literature review is to address the following questions: (1) What is the focus of existing research on using AT with individuals who have DAT? (2) (How) have these studies been designed and evaluated? (3) What findings are reported? (4) What does this tell us about the potential of AT for enriching the lives of people with dementia in particular? This paper augments previous reviews by synthesizing the evidence base on AT, including findings and limitations. This will allow recommendations to be made about improving existing studies and promising areas for future inquiry. The article will conclude by examining how these studies impact quality dementia care, including potential for enriching everyday life.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211421090" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This literature review synthesizes the existing research on art-based therapies for persons with DAT, including approaches aiming not to simply ‘manage’ dementia symptoms, but to enrich the lives of persons living with it. In 2008 (June), searches were conducted in various electronic databases, including PubMed, SocAbstracts, PsychInfo, MedLine, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Review, using ‘art-, music-, drama-, dance- therapy’ and then combined with ‘review’ or ‘dementia’ and ‘Alzheimer's,’ for the years 1990 through 2008. In 2010 (April), an additional search performed on the same databases from 2008 to 2010 yielded another 21 articles. A total of 134 (<italic>N</italic> = 134) articles from the two searches were (quasi-)empirical studies related to DAT, including a few seminal pieces published before 1990. Twenty-six of these papers were reviews of AT use, including 14 with DAT-diagnosed individuals. These two areas comprise the bulk of evidence upon which this review is made. Key reviews of AT and seminal pieces were read first. The target articles were then read and reviewed with attention to research design/methods (qualitative versus quantitative; study length; measurement intervals), populations enrolled (DAT or other; late- versus early-stage AD), study settings utilized (residential versus home based), intervention(s) used (art modality; established or new program), outcome(s) measured (clinical scales versus well-being or quality-of-life variables), methods of analysis/evaluation (e.g. ‘proxy’ or ‘person with dementia;’ systematic versus anecdotal), and findings (impact, if any; short- versus long-term changes; barriers/facilitators).</p>
<p>Art interventions include seemingly endless areas of inquiry, including dance/movement, music, drama, visual arts, and combination art therapies, as well as activities such as gardening, physical and mental exercise, aromatherapy, Montessori programs, and social outings. Although all of these have potential for providing ‘enrichment,’ this review covers mainly music (MT), visual arts (VAT), drama (DT), and dance/movement (DMT) therapies, as these methods are the most well-established.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1471301211421090">2</xref></sup> Within the literature, AT appears to be defined simultaneously as: (1) creative and enriching activities of self-expression without words or a priori assumptions about how the final product will turn out; and (2) a potential avenue for occupying people's time with the intended outcome of managing behaviors deemed undesirable by in/formal providers of care. These seemingly dissonant views can be traced back to founders of the field, who envisioned AT as <italic>both</italic> ‘a viable treatment method and a modality for self-understanding, emotional change and personal growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1471301211421090">Malchiodi, 2006</xref>, p. 2). This contradiction between traditional AT values of not focusing on the end result (i.e. being process oriented; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211421090">Hannemann, 2006</xref>), being ‘failure free,’ and ‘go[ing] beyond keeping people with dementia busy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421090">Basting, 2001</xref>, p. 17) and the typical outcome-oriented focus of managing the BPSDs has fragmented the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421090"><title>Findings</title>
<p>To identify what is known about existing efforts at enriching the lives of individuals with dementia through the use of ATs, this section will outline the empirical literature on the most common ATs currently being practiced. Particular attention will be paid to the study design, methods of evaluation, and findings of these interventions. A final emphasis will be on what these studies tell us about potential for using such interventions with DAT-diagnosed individuals, including how to strengthen and support current efforts.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421090"><title>Art therapy: therapy or activity?</title>
<p>Within the general AT literature, a crucial distinction is made between therapy and activity, that is, whether the objectives focus on treatment outcomes, such as reduction of symptoms and/or behavioral improvements, or the process of art as a leisure activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1471301211421090">Killick and Allan (1999b)</xref> suggest that most arts in dementia (should) fall into the latter category, thus ‘generating a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction’ (p. 35). In this sense, they call for art as activity rather than clinical therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1471301211421090">3</xref></sup> Other authors position creativity itself as therapeutic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421090">Casson, 1994</xref>), emphasizing AT's potential for non-verbal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1471301211421090">Odell-Miller, Hughes, &amp; Westacott, 2006</xref>) and for empowerment through treating the whole person rather than the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211421090">Hirsch &amp; Meckes, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>AT studies employ variables, such as social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421090">Dibbell-Hope, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421090">Gray et al., 2001</xref>) and ‘aliveness,’ as key measures of the impact of art on those with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1471301211421090">O'Callaghan &amp; McDermott, 2004</xref>) or chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1471301211421090">Mavely &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>). Additional in-the-moment benefits include the ‘emancipatory potential’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1471301211421090">Radley &amp; Bell, 2007</xref>) of artworks. Studies by Reynolds and colleagues on using visual arts with cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1471301211421090">Reynolds &amp; Lim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1471301211421090">Reynolds, Lim, &amp; Prior, 2008</xref>) and art-making processes with women who have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1471301211421090">Reynolds &amp; Vivat, 2006</xref>) are also inspiring examples of the benefits of art as a process. Using narrative accounts, women with CFS were encouraged to engage in art-making as a leisure activity rather than as psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1471301211421090">Reynolds &amp; Vivat, 2006</xref>) and women with cancer were helped to ‘resist the master status of cancer’ and maintain self-identity and worth, relationships, control, and engagement through art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1471301211421090">Reynolds &amp; Lim, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of dementia, the majority of studies focus on the treatment potential for managing undesirable symptoms (BPSDs). Noteworthy exceptions stress AT's potential for ‘enrichment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421090">Coaten, 2001</xref>) or ‘empowerment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>) and for offering ‘hope,’ ‘healing,’ and ‘growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1471301211421090">Johnson &amp; Sullivan-Marx, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>). Accordingly, immediate effects, such as ‘quality moments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>) and expressions of sadness and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1471301211421090">Waller, 1999</xref>), are valuable outcomes. Ultimately, all people with dementia can be ‘given voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1471301211421090">Jonas-Simpson &amp; Mitchell, 2005</xref>), ‘reached,’ and ‘enriched’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1471301211421090">Norberg, Melin, &amp; Asplund, 2003</xref>) if we address the ‘disability gap’ between their ability and activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421090">Gigliotti, Jarrott, &amp; Yorgason, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1471301211421090"><title>Art therapy: interventions</title>
<p>The arts have long been utilized for promoting not only general relaxation and wellness, but also hope, healing, and increased quality of life. AT use with targeted populations has been extensively researched, including with children, seniors, nursing home residents, hospital patients, inmates, the chronically and/or terminally ill, people with physical or developmental disabilities, and individuals with specific ailments.</p>
<p>Many studies on the utilization of AT for individuals with dementia focus more on serving the needs of in/formal carers by alleviating ‘disruptive’ behaviors than on enriching the lives of diagnosed individuals themselves. That is, much of the literature base related to dementia employs AT for outcome-based reasons (i.e. behavior modification, symptom reduction) rather than for personal enrichment of participants. This quantitative, product-oriented emphasis is true of the larger research base on AT as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1471301211421090">Saunders &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>), even when this contradicts core skill sets and principles of therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1471301211421090">Meekums, 2010</xref>). This paper will therefore highlight those projects devoted to the use of AT as a process of meaningful activity for individuals.</p>
<p>The majority of dementia-related studies reviewed reflect the shortcomings of the larger AT literature: they are not based on rigorous, or clearly articulated, research designs. Studies used very small cross-sectional samples and were rarely informed by either theoretical frameworks or evidence-based practices (EBPs) or included controlled populations in the experimental sense. Most research was conducted with persons in the advanced stages of dementia living in skilled nursing facilities. Although Dementia Care Mapping (DCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1471301211421090">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1471301211421090">4</xref></sup> a systematic method for evaluation based on the perspectives of persons with dementia, was used in a few remarkable studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421090">Brooker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421090">Chung, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211421090">Holmes, Knights, Dean, Hodkinson, &amp; Hopkins, 2006</xref>), most measurements/evaluations were based on clinical scales, loosely defined observations by facility staff, and/or determined via proxy reports from in/formal care providers, despite the empirical establishment that persons with dementia can evaluate their own quality of life and satisfaction with specific activities and of the established effectiveness of tools, such as DCM. Very few studies examined process variables concerning subjective satisfaction or quality of life; instead, the emphasis was on biomedical outcomes, through various clinical scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), or Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), despite reports that multiple measures of treatment efficacy are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1471301211421090">Ledger &amp; Baker, 2007</xref>) and that the most effective assessments incorporate objective measures and subjective accounts, such as participant interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421090">Betts, 2006</xref>). The trend towards more rigorous designs aimed at measuring precisely defined quantitative outcomes fails to capture the nuances of qualitative measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the literature on ATs, MT is by far the most common modality (with some seminal studies dating back to the 1970s), but research on visual art, drama, and dance/movement therapies also exist. Each type will be outlined individually and then comparisons will be made among all studies reviewed.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421090"><title>Music therapy</title>
<p>MT is employed in many different health and social settings and includes a diverse range of practices. As the most common form of AT, MT has the largest evidence base to demonstrate its efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421090">Gerdner, 2005</xref>), which primarily focuses on reducing behaviors labeled problematic or enhancing those deemed desirable by care providers and clinicians. One study comparing different types of music activities revealed that the highest responses from persons with AD are observed during movement, then rhythm, and lastly singing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421090">Hanson, Gfeller, Woodworth, Swanson, &amp; Garand, 1996</xref>), suggesting that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ music activity for individuals with DAT. Recent literature reviews highlight the clinical focus of research on MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421090">Aigen, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421090">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421090">Crowe &amp; Scovel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1471301211421090">Lou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1471301211421090">Pelletier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1471301211421090">Sherratt et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1471301211421090">Sung &amp; Chang, 2005</xref>), with decreased agitation being the most common outcome tested. General behavioral improvements are also sought. The specific goals of MT, however, include reductions in agitation and apathy, disruptive vocalizations, or wandering behaviors and increases in reality orientation, attention span, and socialization/social skills. Improvements in specific areas of cognitive functioning, such as language or memory recall, motor skills/activity, and bathing cooperation, are also emphasized.</p>
<p>These studies generally report significant reductions in the BPSDs, though these decreases are not sustained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211421090">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211421090">Jennings &amp; Vance, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1471301211421090">Ledger &amp; Baker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1471301211421090">Raglio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1471301211421090">Svandottis &amp; Snaedal, 2006</xref>). Others show improvements on clinical measurements (such as the MMSE, CMAI, CDR, or GDS,) but no effect on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-1471301211421090">Van de Winckel et al., 2004</xref>). Two studies devised their own measurement tools, the Musical Therapy Assessment Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421090">Glynn, 1992</xref>) and the Residual Music Skills Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1471301211421090">York, 1994</xref>), to assess the effects of MT on behavioral symptoms, but neither has been cited subsequently. Most research either did not use tools to assess the impact of MT or does not disclose those employed.</p>
<p>None of the studies include participant accounts or self-evaluations of the programs. A review of the literature argues that the vast majority of studies on MT tend to adopt a medicalized understanding of the actions of individuals with dementia, looking at the effects of music on how people behave in certain situations, or their ‘symptoms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1471301211421090">Killick &amp; Allan, 1999b</xref>), rather than the pleasure experienced while participating in MT. A more positive, if marginal, assumption in the literature, however, posits that music can offer opportunities for non-verbal communication to persons who are not able to use words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421090">Aldridge, 1998</xref>). A few studies discuss personal benefits, such as improving quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421090">Aldridge &amp; Aldridge, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421090">Butterfield-Whitcomb, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421090">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1471301211421090">Lipe, 1991</xref>) and adapting to nursing home placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1471301211421090">Kydd, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although most research focuses on art as ‘therapy,’ music as an activity rather than an intervention was specifically discussed by some pioneering authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421090">Butterfield-Whitcomb, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421090">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421090">Gerdner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211421090">Johnson, Lahey, &amp; Shore, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1471301211421090">Killick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1471301211421090">McCloskey, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1471301211421090">Perrin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1471301211421090">Threadgold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1471301211421090">Walker, 1996</xref>). Based mostly in small-group settings, music is accordingly considered to empower participants and stimulate conversation, interaction, and meaningful activity. One particularly noteworthy study proposes an interactive tool to promote active engagement, enjoyment, empowerment, and musical creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1471301211421090">Riley, Alm, &amp; Newell, 2009</xref>). These ‘person-centered’ approaches highlight the intimate nature of music and recommend that individual preferences should be taken into consideration. The few studies emphasizing engagement and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211421090">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1471301211421090">Sherratt, Thornton &amp; Hatton, 2004b</xref>) address subjective experience, provide a more holistic view, and take personality and history into account when promoting ‘pleasure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421090">Gerdner, 2005</xref>) as espoused by the late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1471301211421090">Thomas Kitwood in his vision of ‘personhood’ (1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1471301211421090">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>). One author suggests that ‘the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic environment should be thought of as a way of life, a primary goal of the facility, not an activity’ to keep residents busy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421090">Butterfield-Whitcomb, 1994</xref>, p. 69).</p>
<p>The large evidence base on MT provides promising data on the potential benefit of art in the lives of persons with dementia. Unfortunately, this is not the dominant way in which MT is utilized within the field. Most studies focus on biomedical products, such as reducing and managing symptoms, rather than person-centered outcomes, such as enrichment. The MT literature could benefit from more and better studies that include process-oriented approaches, quality-of-life variables, and self-reports.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1471301211421090"><title>Visual arts therapies</title>
<p>Visual arts, such as drawing and painting, are the next most common AT modality in the literature. The visual arts are discussed in terms of application in ‘diagnosis and assessment, promoting non-verbal communication, enhancing opportunities for reminiscence, its application to sensory stimulation and enjoyment, and finally in strengthening the individual's sense of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1471301211421090">Killick &amp; Allan, 1999a</xref>, p. 33). Despite tendencies to analyze artwork within a biomedical understanding of dementia and assumptions about correlations between output and the degree of cognitive impairment, persons with dementia are generally perceived more positively than those within MT, and artwork is seen as assisting them with rediscovering obscured abilities and self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1471301211421090">Kahn-Denis, 1997</xref>), including ‘promoting wisdom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1471301211421090">Shore, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies did, however, operationalize art as clinical therapy rather than leisurely activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421090">Couch (1997)</xref> uses mandala drawings interpreted within a ‘stage model’ of dementia, based on assumptions of impending incompetence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1471301211421090">Kim, Kang, and Kim (2009a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1471301211421090">Kim, Betts, Kim, and Kang (2009b)</xref> utilize statistical models of mandala drawings to estimate the severity of dementia. Others use drawing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1471301211421090">Seifert, 2000</xref>) as ‘an outlet for tension and frustration’ assumed to accompany dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211421090">Kamar, 1997</xref>, pp. 120–121).</p>
<p>In contrast, perhaps the most promising VAT project reports that 80% of participants express pleasure<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1471301211421090">5</xref></sup> in the Memories in the Making© program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1471301211421090">Rentz, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1471301211421090">6</xref></sup> The Greater Cincinnati Chapter Well-Being Observation Tool©, a seven-domain measure of well-being, subsequently reported that individuals demonstrate greater sustained attention, pleasure, self-esteem, and normalcy in the Memories in the Making© program compared to activities at a traditional adult day center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>). Two other commendable studies that involve participant subjective experiences in the project's evaluation include assembling cut paper to offer ‘meaningful activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>) and making pottery to improve psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421090">Doric-Henry, 1997</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211421090">Johnson et al. (1992)</xref> explore the role of art activities in groups based on psychodynamic concepts, they explicitly acknowledge the need for understanding subjective realities of persons with dementia, including the ‘meaning’/‘value’ AT can add to the lives of individuals residing in Special Care Units for AD. This approach departs from the dominant clinical model by aiming to validate feelings rather than stressing normative reality through efforts to improve `quality of life <italic>for the moment</italic> (p. 275; emphasis added\in original)'.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that interaction is essential in AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1471301211421090">Newell-Walker, 2002</xref>), including for fostering the ‘healing power of art’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421090">Espinel, 1996</xref>) and for helping to encourage ‘self expression through the visual arts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, drawing can be a useful channel of communication, regardless of disease severity, since even persons with advanced dementia can complete self-portraits, for example, upon request (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1471301211421090">Kahn-Denis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1471301211421090">Lev-Wiesel &amp; Hirshenzon-Segev, 2003</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that technology can help promote engagement in therapeutic creative activities, such as painting and drawing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1471301211421090">Mihailidis et al., 2010</xref>) or multimedia biographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421090">Damianakis, Crete-Nishihata, Smith, Baecker, &amp; Marziali, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, artwork is a visual reminder that persons with dementia can still accomplish and learn new things, despite limited mobility or cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1471301211421090">Johnson &amp; Sullivan-Marx, 2006</xref>, p. 312), and without any prior experience, thus helping others see beyond limitations to their strengths and beauty (p. 316). Furthermore, ‘the universal reason for using art with this population seems to be the sensual, evocative nature of the art medium itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1471301211421090">Kahn-Denis, 1997</xref>, p. 198).</p>
<p>Unlike MT, the meaningful role VAT can play in the lives of individuals with dementia is highlighted in numerous studies. Similar to MT, however, the predominant focus is on using visual arts as a part of a treatment regimen, with improvements in clinical scores and perceived problematic behaviors, rather than to provide individuals with meaningful activities and social interaction. The potential of VAT for providing non-verbal communication and in-the-moment communication is clear.</p>

<p>Studies on DT are less common and the benefits/outcomes of DT are far less focused on quantifiable clinical measurements than the literature on music or visual arts. Storytelling or reminiscence activities are purported to have numerous positive psychological health benefits for seniors in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1471301211421090">McKee et al., 2005</xref>), including increased well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1471301211421090">Snow, Damico, &amp; Tanguay, 2003</xref>).

One noteworthy project used direct accounts of participants with Borderline Personality Disorder to evaluate the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421090">Dent-Brown &amp; Wang, 2006</xref>) and another positioned women with metastatic breast cancer as ‘fully human’ by allowing them to ‘reclaim their compromised ability to give back to the world’ through participation in a theatre production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421090">Gray et al., 2001</xref>, p. 246).</p>
<p>A review of ‘life story’ interventions reported three areas of focus within DAT studies: (1) to raise self-esteem and self-integration; (2) to improve life quality; and (3) to change behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>, p. 431), and found disparate aims and intervention forms as well as methodologies. Additional interests within DAT-specific studies include increased well-being, stimulation, and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421090">Basting, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421090">Casson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1471301211421090">Thorgrimsen, Schweitzer, &amp; Orrell, 2002</xref>), the performing of meaningful activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421090">Basting, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1471301211421090">Killick, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1471301211421090">2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1471301211421090">2003</xref>), and the promotion of healthy cognitive aging through ‘active experiencing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1471301211421090">Noice &amp; Noice, 2006</xref>). In particular, attention is paid to how DT can empower people with dementia by promoting activity; that is, the desired outcome is the ‘quality moments’ resulting from activities such as mime, storytelling, role-play, object work, movement and music, and games and play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘Memories’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211421090">Jenny &amp; Oropeza, 1993</xref>) utilizes various mediums to support self-expression and emphasize the <italic>process</italic> of creation for persons with AD. This method of storytelling assumes that we can learn from people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421090">Banks-Wallace, 2002</xref>). Similarly, the Timeslips© program generates fictional stories based on group stream of consciousness rather than relying on direct recall. Findings demonstrate improved communication skills and staff–resident relationships in skilled nursing settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421090">Basting, 2001</xref>). Additional studies suggest greater increases in well-being with reminiscence therapy than goal-directed group activities or unstructured time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421090">Brooker &amp; Duce, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1471301211421090">Killick &amp; Allan, 2000</xref>). Overall outcomes include increased communication/interaction and improved understanding of non-verbal forms of storytelling, such as reminiscence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421090">Byres, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211421090">Gersie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1471301211421090">Martin &amp; Stepath, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1471301211421090">Thorgrimsen et al., 2002</xref>). Another commendable effort advocates spontaneity (as the source of ‘self’) to enhance personhood as they ‘search into and co-create with, to discover meaning and make contact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421090">Casson, 1994</xref>, p. 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1471301211421090">Wilkinson, Srikumar, Shaw, and Orrell (1998)</xref>, one of the few evaluations on DT, focus on the subjective experiences rather than improving cognition or reducing behavioral symptoms to improve quality of life through stimulating social skills, independence, self-esteem, and self-belief.</p>
<p>Clearly, the research that has been done on DT with DAT populations is far less medicalized than that on music and/or visual arts. That is, DT is focused more on the communicative potential of performance than the clinical outcomes associated with art as (psycho)therapy approaches. The process-oriented nature and empowerment potential of this modality make noteworthy advances to the field of AT.</p>

A fewinspired authors suggest using circle dancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211421090">Jerrome, 1999</xref>) or social dance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1471301211421090">Palo-Bengtsson &amp; Ekman, 1997</xref>) to encourage a sense of community.</p>
<p>This literature suggests that expression of non-verbal communication is a primary benefit of DMT, advocating that any ‘lost skills of ordinary conversation’ can be rediscovered. In contrast to the default medical model focused on communication limitations, group dance therapy sessions show that movement can be used to substitute or support speech, as well as to express thoughts, memories, and emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1471301211421090">Nystrom &amp; Lauritzen, 2005</xref>). By assuming that people with dementia are capable of meaningful interactions, the joint construction of communication is emphasized. Thus, rather than privileging the spoken language, contextual barriers and facilitators are revealed.</p>
<p>In particular, DMT has been reported to encourage the traditional role of Japanese elders as narrators of culture by stimulating reminiscence and life review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421090">Arakawa-Davies, 1997</xref>). Such discussions of improved quality of life and emphasis on the process rather than specific techniques or outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421090">Coaten, 2001</xref>) suggest that DMT is concerned with the immediate enjoyment of participants, or ‘enrichment,’ rather than focusing on the product of the therapy. Further, ‘the fact that pleasure may be fleeting or transitory does not negate its value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211421090">Gibson, 1994</xref>, p. 53), explicitly illustrates the ‘undiminished possibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421090">Allan &amp; Killick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1471301211421090">Killick &amp; Allan, 2000</xref>) of persons with dementia.</p>
<p>Like DT, DMT is far less biomedical than MT/VAT and highlights the many positive benefits that often transpire throughout the <italic>process of</italic> performance. Most importantly, this modality emphasizes quality of life, encouraging a sense of community, and the ability of people with dementia to meaningfully interact – which is secondary if addressed at all in the other ATs reviewed here.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1471301211421090"><title>Mixed or miscellaneous art therapy</title>
<p>There are various dementia-specific mixed interventions or miscellaneous ATs worth noting. These include doll therapy, alternative methods of reminiscence/storytelling, ‘multisensory’ experiences, and combination therapies. Despite considerable variation among these studies, the ‘therapeutic’ versus ‘processual’ emphasis is present.</p>
<p>Until recently, doll therapy was employed inconsistently and very little empirical data existed. Doll therapy is currently suggested primarily for management of difficult behaviors, such as agitation, distress, social withdrawal, or communication difficulties, but arguably impacts well-being also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211421090">James, MacKenzie, &amp; Mukaetova-Landiska, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211421090">James, Reichelt, Morse, Mackenzie, &amp; Mukaetova-Ladinska, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1471301211421090">Mayers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1471301211421090">Moore, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1471301211421090">Tamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1471301211421090">Verity, 2006</xref>). When used as a tool for reminiscence, dolls have been found to help ‘develop a therapeutic bond, influence pro-social behaviours, provide sensory stimulation and enhance communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211421090">James et al., 2006</xref>, p. 1093), despite predominantly being used for reduction of BPSDs, or outcome-based objectives.</p>
<p>Alternative methods of reminiscence or storytelling specifically highlight the potential for providing pleasure to participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1471301211421090">Mills &amp; Coleman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1471301211421090">Rentz, 1995</xref>). Studies include the use of items such as stickers to tell stories when verbal means of communication are otherwise compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421090">Chaudhury, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1471301211421090">Seifert &amp; Baker, 1998</xref>). One seminal piece demonstrates the use of AT with music to stimulate reminiscence, enhance pride and dignity, minimize personal loss, strengthen sense of self, reduce social isolation, and improve communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1471301211421090">Wald, 1983</xref>). Reminiscence following Tai Chi sessions ‘facilitated thinking that was focused and insightful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211421090">Gibb, Morris, &amp; Gleisberg, 1997</xref>, p. 198). Simulated presence, the playing of past memories via video audiotapes, was found to be effective in both enhancing well-being and decreasing BPSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421090">Camberg, Woods, &amp; Ooi, 1999</xref>). Another study used a similar method, ‘multimedia biography,’ to stimulate reminiscing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421090">Damianakis et al., 2009</xref>). Basic photographs were also employed as ‘retrospective evidence’ to help ‘tell the story’ of a forgetful woman's hospital stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1471301211421090">Radley &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>). These alternative approaches are decidedly process oriented.</p>
<p>In discussing the ‘multiple pathways to self,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211421090">Jensen (1997)</xref> focuses on remaining strengths through a ‘multisensory art experience’ combining art activity with music and movement to show how borrowing from various methods can ‘increase sense of self and preserve uniqueness’ (p. 178) through promoting long-term memory and enhancing communication. One experimental study using repeated measures of drawing, painting, music, and puzzle exercises reports increased happiness, recall, and awareness in the music group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1471301211421090">Lord &amp; Garner, 1993</xref>). Another discusses improvements in quality of life and the ‘empowerment possibilities’ of combinations of art, drama, and dance movement therapies, but also focuses on products such as changes in ‘lifestyle patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-1471301211421090">Zeltzer, Stanley, Melo, &amp; LaPorte, 2003</xref>). A combination song, poetry, writing, and singing program anecdotally notes benefits of the program, such as providing pleasure and improving group cohesion and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1471301211421090">Silber &amp; Hes, 1995</xref>), but gives few details on the outcomes measured or evaluation techniques. Other general art therapies talk about the process of art making as ‘offering pleasurable, engaging and meaningful self-expression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211421090">Harlan, 1990</xref>, p. 103). The effects of group music with movement interventions and music with video programs demonstrate how such combination therapies could be part of the daily care routines to improve the quality of life of individuals with DAT who are institutionalized or attend day care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1471301211421090">Olsen, Hutchings, &amp; Ehrenkrantz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-1471301211421090">Sung, Chang, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). Programs involving persons with advanced dementia demonstrate that reactions to various art-based activities, including music, touch, and object presentation, ‘make contact’ with participants in meaningful ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421090">Bober, McLellan, McBee, &amp; Westreich, 2002</xref>), which can be measured without any technical apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1471301211421090">Norberg et al., 2003</xref>). The systematic evaluation of two combination interventions reports engagement, stimulation, and easily assessable activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1471301211421090">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>). Optimistically, the two longitudinal, controlled studies discovered report subtle, pronounced, and durable positive effects of combination art, music, and dance therapies across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1471301211421090">Rusted, Sheppard, &amp; Waller, 2006</xref>) and talk about enjoyment and fulfillment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1471301211421090">Seifert &amp; Baker, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, these were both ‘therapy’-based approaches that focused on functional assessment or how AT can increase mood and cognition rather than ‘activity’-based processual variables, and neither used any self-reports or quality-of-life measurements.</p>
<p>Like MT/VAT, the emphasis of many mixed or miscellaneous ATs is on clinical outcomes. Some innovative programs combining multiple areas or alternative methods, however, demonstrate the potential for empowerment and pleasure <italic>for the moment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>) that is more typical of dance and drama/movement therapies. Such process-oriented programs provide good examples of the vast promise of ATs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421090"><title>Activity-based interventions</title>
<p>The meaning of activity for people with dementia is generally not well understood due to a lack of research on how individuals with dementia perceive their involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1471301211421090">Phinney, Chaudhury, &amp; O'Connor, 2007</xref>). In trying to understand what constitutes meaningful activity, efforts must be made to situate present experiences within the context of the past in order to sustain a sense of continuity for persons with dementia (p. 392). When personal experiences are accounted for, results demonstrate how people with mild to moderate dementia find their lives to be meaningful through doing (p. 390).</p>
<p>The seminal project on activity-based models for persons with dementia, led by Dawn Brooker and Rosemary Woolley, focuses on ‘enriching opportunities.’ Based on assumptions that persons with dementia are able and entitled to enjoy life, the model involves the use of a ‘locksmith,’ who is charged with unlocking participants’ potential for well-being. Despite acknowledging ‘weak evidence’ of the efficacy of activity-based interventions, ‘seeing someone light up with delight when engaged in an activity that has meaning for them, indicated that this is a worthwhile endeavor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421090">Brooker &amp; Woolley, 2007</xref>, p. 375). Focus group data were used to understand subjective experiences of the project, as well as barriers and facilitators to an ‘enriched life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421090">Brooker &amp; Woolley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421090">Brooker, Woolley, &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). The main goal of the program is that individualized, simple, and fun activities transpire every day. In an editorial evaluating the program, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-1471301211421090">Vernooij-dassen (2007)</xref> highlights that meaningful activities for persons with dementia are strikingly similar to those reported by anyone else. That is, ‘the activities of persons with dementia become meaningful through feelings of pleasure and involvement, a sense of connection and belonging, and a sense of autonomy and self-identity’ (p. 379). Another innovative example of the use of art activities with persons who have DAT states the goal of being ‘pleasurable and meaningful’ for participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>As countless studies have demonstrated, however, individuals with dementia in long-term care settings spend the majority of their time doing passive rather than engaging activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421090">Chung, 2004</xref>). This supports declarations by Brooker, Kitwood, Phinney and colleagues that ‘context matters’ when understanding what constitutes meaningful activity. Although ‘process’ is emphasized over outcome, the rather grim results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421090">Chung's (2004)</xref> study suggest low expectations of engagement, not to mention enrichment, for persons with dementia, especially in residential settings.</p>
<p>These studies highlight the need for implementing more activities and in a wider range of settings, such as private homes. The activity-based interventions are far more process oriented in nature than the specific modalities of AT, such as MT, VAT, DT, and DMT. The emphasis on subjective experiences of enrichment is particularly promising.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1471301211421090"><title>Conclusions/recommendations</title>
<p>This article evaluates the literature on AT and makes suggestions for how it can be improved. Despite an impressive interest in and commitment to AT, important gaps in the evidence base and its use with individuals who have dementia, in particular, echo the shortcomings identified in previous reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1471301211421090">Killick &amp; Allan, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1471301211421090">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1471301211421090">Marshall &amp; Hutchingson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1471301211421090">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1471301211421090">Vink et al., 2003</xref>). The most noteworthy empirical weaknesses of AT studies include: (1) inadequate elucidation of study design, including description of activities and methods utilized; (2) poor or unspecified, if any, measurement tools; (3) over-emphasis on clinical outcomes; and (4) lack of systematic analysis of data. Crucial substantive omissions within the dementia-specific work include: (1) lack of accounts from persons with dementia (self-reports); (2) failure to tailor therapies to persons in the early stages (versus late-stage models and programs); (3) inadequate attention to persons with dementia living at home (versus skilled nursing facilities); and (4) focus on product versus process (or quality-of-life variables). These shortcomings mirror those of the larger AT base, despite the unique needs of this population. Both DAT-specific studies and the general evidence base demonstrate fragmentation among AT practitioners. These divisions within the field and empirical limitations are arguably due to assumptions that art and science are mutually exclusive, when in fact they are ‘mutually enhancing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421090">Berrol, 2000</xref>), and the resultant haphazard dismissal of qualitative assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>). As elicited elsewhere:
<disp-quote>
<p>The radical challenge to dance movement therapists as to all arts therapists is to develop a more integrated professional identity as artists and scientists; without this dual identity, there is a tendency to adopt a Cartesian split position in opposition to science, risking further marginalization and the effective disappearance of the AT professions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1471301211421090">Meekums, 2010</xref>, p. 40)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others argue that such discord obfuscates a theoretical base, since ‘when it is used as a projective tool, it loses the value of the process and of the context of art making…and when it focuses only on process, it loses the value of an analytical and projective theory,’ and instead advocate a ‘multilayered model’ of AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1471301211421090">Huss, 2009</xref>, p. 154).</p>
<p>Few adequately controlled, systematic, evidence-based studies conducted on the use of art, drama, dance/movement, or music therapies in persons with dementia were discovered. Only a handful of studies were informed by conceptual frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421090">Couch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211421090">Gerdner &amp; Swanson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421090">Hanson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211421090">Jensen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1471301211421090">Rentz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421090">Thomas, Heitman, &amp; Alexander, 1997</xref>). Rather, theoretical perspectives were often used in lieu of models being explicitly tested. Furthermore, longitudinal, controlled studies were rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1471301211421090">Rusted et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1471301211421090">Seifert &amp; Baker, 2002</xref>). Although recent comparisons with recreational activities do suggest that benefits/outcomes of art therapies include a subtle, more pronounced, and durable positive effect across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1471301211421090">Rusted et al., 2006</xref>), failures to elucidate study design prevent meaningful comparisons from being made. Measurement tools are inconsistently used across studies and AT modalities and data are either ‘therapy-based’ outcomes or so lacking of details to appear anecdotal. Recent studies reveal strengths and weaknesses of existing objective AT assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421090">Betts, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the efficacy of projective techniques and art-based instruments were found to be questionable, due primarily to problems of measurement validity and reliability. There is also no consensus on how to evaluate ‘quality of life’ or whether to include self-reports as a measurement tool, despite the latter being established as a necessary part of valid and reliable assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421090">Betts, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There is an overt bias toward clinical outcomes such as the reduction of BPSDs, which represents an overly medicalized and carer-focused position. Unfortunately, ‘stage models’ of dementia dominate over more ‘person-centered’ approaches. Overall, few studies used the word ‘fun’ when talking about activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421090">Brooker &amp; Woolley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421090">Duignan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1471301211421090">Mavely &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>). Although pleasure, enrichment, and meaning are discussed by some (drama and dance/movement therapies were most likely to focus on process variables), the majority of research on AT does not or does so only superficially. MTs and VATs, which are the most common mediums, were disproportionately outcome oriented. General disagreement exists among and between modalities in terms of objectives sought and methods used. Comprehensive analyses of data and evaluations of studies were rarely performed. As a result of these empirical shortcomings, there is little room for replication of even the most promising results. The findings of this review support the recent argument that arts-based therapies need to be brought ‘in from the scientific cold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421090">Burton, 2009</xref>). Since both positive behavioral changes and increased well-being/quality of life are laudable efforts, critical art therapists call for meeting the demand for more rigor through qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1471301211421090">Moos &amp; Bjorn, 2006</xref>), including phenomenological models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421090">Berrol, 2000</xref>) and attention to cultural, gender, and ethnic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1471301211421090">Marshall &amp; Hutchingson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Substantively, further weaknesses in two areas compromise the quality of the dementia-related studies reviewed here. Firstly, it is well established that many people with dementia are willing and able to speak on their behalf, particularly about subjective experiences and satisfaction with various activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1471301211421090">Knauss &amp; Moyer (2006)</xref> make a compelling call for incorporation of their perspectives in the care practices and decisions related to them, yet only a few studies utilize self-reports from participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421090">Doric-Henry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211421090">Johnson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1471301211421090">Wilkinson et al., 1998</xref>). Articles written by or from the perspective of people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421090">Beard, Knauss &amp; Moyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1471301211421090">Truscott, 2004</xref>) make commendable efforts to outline activities for enrichment and options for adapting ‘leisure and creative activities’ to various levels of cognitive functioning, respectively. In these accounts, persons with dementia again appear strikingly similar to the rest of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-1471301211421090">Vernooij-dassen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, despite clinical innovations allowing for much earlier diagnoses and the fact that people with dementia themselves remark that involvement in activities is beneficial even in the earliest stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1471301211421090">Knauss &amp; Moyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-1471301211421090">Sterin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1471301211421090">Truscott, 2004</xref>), ATs are typically considered in the context of residential facilities, where participants tend to be in the later stages. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1471301211421090">Phinney et al. (2007)</xref> make an important contribution by examining meaningful activities for persons with dementia within the context of their homes and the Enriching Opportunities© model acknowledges that different barriers exist when trying to translate the ‘potential’ from skilled nursing homes to community-based living, such as private homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421090">Brooker &amp; Woolley, 2007</xref>), these studies are exceptional in their attention to community-based individuals with dementia, despite the fact that the majority of persons so diagnosed in fact live at home (two-thirds, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1471301211421090">Marshall &amp; Hutchingson, 2001</xref>). Although many of these ATs, particularly those that are ‘person centered’ and focus on meaningful activity rather than clinical outcomes exclusively, can in theory be utilized in the privacy of one's home, few studies address the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1471301211421090">Truscott, 2004</xref>) or are tested outside of skilled nursing facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-1471301211421090">Sung &amp; Chang, 2005</xref>). Notable exceptions include studies conducted in multiple settings simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421090">Christie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421090">Hanson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1471301211421090">Sterrit &amp; Pokorny, 1994</xref>) and one reported that the <italic>process</italic> of group drawing exercises could also be used at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211421090">Kamar, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As with the larger field of AT, far more carefully designed and implemented studies need to be conducted on the use of ATs with persons who have dementia, including use of first-person accounts (i.e. self-reports of satisfaction with and meaning of the activities under study), the incorporation of persons in the early stages (i.e. ‘stage’ appropriate modifications), application in various settings (e.g. private homes, senior centers, etc.), and an emphasis on process rather than simply outcome measures (e.g. quality-of-life and ‘enjoyment’ measures versus clinical scales). Although gains may be small and only temporary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1471301211421090">Shore, 1997</xref>) and long-term positive results have not been demonstrated, this need not deter the use of activities for persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1471301211421090">Marshall &amp; Hutchingson, 2001</xref>) if art is in fact a way of life, rather than just an activity to occupy people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421090">Butterfield-Whitcomb, 1994</xref>). Models that support goals of enrichment as defined by diagnosed individuals themselves rather than biomedical approaches emphasizing the management of deficits would prove particularly beneficial to the research base on AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421090">Bryant, Corbett, &amp; Kutner, 2001</xref>), while simultaneously advancing person-centered care and potentially improving quality of life – <italic>for the moment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421090">Batson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211421090">Johnson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1471301211421090">Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been established elsewhere that diagnosed individuals are calling for a reframing of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1471301211421090">Knauss &amp; Moyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-1471301211421090">Sterin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1471301211421090">Truscott, 2004</xref>) by demonstrating how they manage their disability and enjoy life through the performance of various life-enriching activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421090">Beard, Knauss, &amp; Moyer, 2009</xref>). That is, when people are allowed to <italic>live with</italic> dementia, rather than exclusively fight against it, the condition becomes a ‘manageable disability’ rather than a (social) death sentence. Together, the process-oriented AT studies reported here highlight how those interacting with persons who have dementia can (and should) suspend <italic>our own</italic> expectations rather than enforce normative, solely outcomes-based, AT interventions onto them. More investment into process-oriented interventions using research methods that can appropriately track such variables as quality of life and subjective well-being, both of which have recognized measurement and evaluation tools that could be utilized and/or adapted to use with persons who have dementia, are needed.</p>
<p>Those of us with deep personal and professional commitments to helping people with dementia receive the services <italic>they want</italic> must forge ahead in these efforts, for strictly biomedical measures will continue to fall short of adequately evaluating what are deeply psychosocial, idiosyncratic, and experiential issues. In order to diminish the ‘disability gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421090">Gigliotti et al., 2004</xref>) and cultivate the ‘emancipatory potential’ of artworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1471301211421090">Radley &amp; Bell, 2007</xref>), more and better research on the role of AT in the lives of all persons, particularly those with DAT, must be conducted.</p>

<p>I would like to extend sincere gratitude to Jenny Knauss and Don Moyer, whose creative use of various art forms in their own lives led to this undertaking. When I met Jenny, who had recently been diagnosed with early-stage AD, she was spending countless hours at the Chicago Art Institute sketching and viewing the exhibits. By bringing the topic to my attention, they encouraged me to contribute to this much-needed dialogue and yet again aided in advancing the field. Deirdre Guthrie, from the University of Illinois Chicago, was an invaluable part of the search and review process for the bulk of the initial articles.</p>
