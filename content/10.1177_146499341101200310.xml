<p>Tackling the mystery of economic development is a difficult task because it requires the asking of many relevant questions. This book by Professor Colin White indicates how far we have gone in answering these questions.</p>
<p>The clearest distinction between the growth theory of the 1960s and modern growth theory is that in recent research, more attention is paid to empirical implications and to the relationship between theory and data. Much of this empirical research involves applications of neoclassical growth hypothesis.</p>
<p>Other empirical analyses are more directly related to recent theories of endogenous growth, including the role of increasing returns, research and development, human capital or the diffusion of knowledge. (Perhaps in this part of the book, some discussions on the relationships between environment and growth could be interesting and necessary.) The initial wave of research did not really introduce a theory of technological change, in which economic growth could go on indefinitely, because returns to investment in a broad class of capital goods (which include human capital) do not necessarily diminish as economies develop. Spillovers of knowledge across producers and external benefits from human capital are parts of this process, but only because they help to avoid the tendency for diminishing returns to the accumulation of capital.</p>
<p>The inception of modern economic development is considered to be one of the most important problems in economics. Colin White distils the conclusions from an extensive number of issues, including economics, economic history and business and management, exploring economic theory, demonstrating limitations and highlighting alternative approaches. Particular attention is paid to the appropriate role of innovative entrepreneurs and of government, especially to three case studies: the Malthusian Trap, the meaning of the Industrial Revolution and the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A fundamental part of the book is linked to a discussion on the Malthusian Trap, which is closely analyzed, and mainly because of its relationship with Industrial Revolution. An interesting discussion is introduced on neoclassical economics which have ignored the resources input into economic development, largely because of the resource-saving nature of modern technology.</p>
<p>The neoclassical model spells out the mechanisms by which a diffusion of modern economic development could occur. It is a market-based one, in which the role of the government is to provide an underpinning for efficient market operation. According to White, there is a direct imitation, the main motivating factors being profit and competition. The removal of barriers to the free flow of ideas, commodities and factors of production integrates world markets and encourages free movement through the market, which by placing resources where they make the highest return accelerates the convergence of economies.</p>
<p>The Malthusian Trap is introduced in the narrative of economic development not only because of the magnitude of neoclassical economic analysis and the relevance of Malthus’ work, but also by the significance of some more recent works by Meadows. Especially appropriate in this book is the analysis on externalities which might result, for example, from global warming or from the decline in birth rates. In spite of the fact that externalities are certainly taken into account and analyzed in the book, it would be useful to have some specific discussions on causality relationships between growth and more specific environmental or technological externalities.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most remarkable analytic narratives of the recent past involves the failed experiment with Communism, as it was played out in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Although the failure of the Soviet experiment and the problems of transition are clearly discussed in the book, perhaps the strength of empirical analysis could have been improved with some further description on data sources and analytical methodologies.</p>
<p>This work considers that there is at present no satisfactory explanation of the inception of modern economic development, and that most of the works are centred on different aspects of theory and empirical research. The book realizes the need to integrate the two approaches, moving beyond the proximate causes of economic theory to review the role in an analytic narrative of significant ultimate causes – geography, risk environments, human capital and institutions – and finally proves to be a stimulating work for those researchers interested in alternative methodologies for economic analysis, and very specially in economic development.</p>
