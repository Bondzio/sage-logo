<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Blood glucose management in the inpatient setting has been shown to be crucial to patient outcomes. As the evidence develops to determine best clinical practices for achieving inpatient glycemic goals, the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health has implemented a streamlined multidisciplinary approach to managing blood glucose levels for hospitalized patients. The purpose of this article is to describe the blood glucose management service at the Clinical Center.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The blood glucose management service has established a consistent plan of care for diabetes management that has gained acceptance among staff and patients and improved safety and patient outcomes. This plan of care has been applied across various nursing units that serve patient populations on clinical research trials investigating common and rare diseases and treating patients from the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>Blood glucose management in the inpatient setting has been shown to be crucial to patient outcomes. In 2001, a study enrolling critically ill patients with hyperglycemia showed that intensive insulin therapy decreased infection rates, length of stay, and cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711430355">1</xref></sup> Studies published in 2004 and 2006 suggested that insulin therapy is important for hospitalized patients, especially the critically ill.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711430355">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711430355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711430355">4</xref></sup> More recently, studies have raised some questions regarding the ideal blood glucose targets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711430355">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711430355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711430355">7</xref></sup> since overaggressive glycemic control was associated with excess inpatient morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711430355">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711430355">9</xref></sup> In view of these conflicting reports, in 2009 the American Diabetes Association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711430355">10</xref></sup> set new blood glucose targets for the hospitalized patient with hyperglycemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721711430355">11</xref></sup> The current target for critically ill inpatients is 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L). For noncritically ill patients, there is limited evidence; however, the current recommendation for premeal blood glucose target is less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and random blood glucose levels of less than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). An ideal treatment regimen minimizes hypoglycemic events and considers comorbid conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711430355">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A model utilizing a blood glucose team and insulin protocols has shown benefit. In one study, a nurse-led team reduced length of stay in a large teaching hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721711430355">13</xref></sup> In another study, a team comprising an endocrinologist and a diabetes nurse educator showed decreased length of stay in a short-stay unit, without an increase in readmission to the hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721711430355">14</xref></sup> In a study conducted in a tertiary care center, identification of hyperglycemia in the postoperative period and intravenous and subcutaneous insulin administration protocols directed by a glucose management service demonstrated a decrease in mean blood glucose and an increase in the number of values in the clinically acceptable range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721711430355">15</xref></sup> In this study, the glucose management team included an advanced practice nurse, a physician assistant, an attending endocrinologist, an endocrinology fellow, and an administrator. A dietitian and diabetes educator was added as needed.</p>
<p>In addition to the literature supporting the benefits of inpatient glycemic teams, measures to evaluate inpatient glycemic management are needed. A large academic medical center developed a standardized objective measure of the quality of inpatient glycemic management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711430355">16</xref></sup> The Quality Hyperglycemic score represents a single value from 0 to 100, incorporating elements of glycemic management influenced by all team members. The scoring system rewards (1) the maintenance of blood glucose levels in or near the normal range and (2) adherence to the hospital policy on the use of bedside glucose meters but penalizes frequent hypoglycemic episodes and severe hyperglycemic excursions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711430355">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Description of the Institution</title>
<p>The Clinical Center is home to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural clinical research program. Located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, the Clinical Center has 240 inpatient beds and 82 day hospital stations, as well as an ambulatory care facility that houses 15 outpatient clinics. There are neither emergency rooms nor obstetrical services available. Every patient is participating in a protocol to receive care at the Clinical Center. Patients of all ages are referred from physicians or self-referred throughout the United States as well as abroad.</p>
<p>The NIH interinstitute endocrine training program (IETP) is an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–accredited fellowship program. The 3-year fellowship provides clinical and research experience. The first year is predominantly clinical, with the fellows providing clinical care to patients participating in protocols from 3 institutes (National Institute of Digestive Diseases, Diabetes, and Kidney; National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development; and the National Institute of Dental and Cranial Facial Disorders). The second- and third-year endocrine fellows are assigned to the endocrine consult service in addition to their research responsibilities. Endocrine consults may be ordered for any patient participating in a clinical research protocol within the NIH Clinical Center, and the majority of endocrine consultation requests are related to patients with hyperglycemia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721711430355">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In the past, the NIH Clinical Center provided discontinuous diabetes management to patients because of divergent views and varied levels of expertise regarding diabetes management among attending physicians and house staff. The process for rotating medical staff for endocrinology contributed to the lack of continuity. The training fellows rotated to the endocrine consult service every 2 weeks, and the attending physicians rotated every month. Blood glucose data were not uniformly charted in the medical record in a consistent manner or location, and consultation time was often spent trying to retrieve glycemic data rather than providing essential treatment advice in caring for and managing the patient’s hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>NIH patients with hyperglycemia had inconsistent glycemic management and widely varying medical regimens to treat the hyperglycemia, which depended on the fellow’s and the attending physician’s personal practice. Other problems included the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0145721711430355" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Treatment plan communication was difficult because consult notes were handwritten and not always legible or accessible in the medical record during subsequent visits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diabetes educators worked alone with very little multidisciplinary support. For instance, when a patient needed a regimen change, many logistical issues interfered with finding a physician to write the orders. The patient also spent a great deal of time waiting for a senior physician to review his or her case and approve the revised plan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients who also needed financial and insurance assistance did not have a social worker who was familiar with resources available to patients with diabetes. Additionally, patients come not only from the United States but around the world to participate in clinical research protocols, and economic needs and ability to obtain resources necessary for blood glucose management are quite complex.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite processes put into place by nurses to provide the needed care, many patients received disjointed care that lacked quality outcomes.</p>
<p>In 2002 the head of the endocrine consult service requested the services of other staff members to support fellows in the training program. A nurse practitioner board certified in advanced diabetes management began to assist the training fellows with education related to diabetes management and logistical assistance by gathering information pertaining to the consults. Additionally, the Clinical Center Nursing Department supported the education of a clinical nurse specialist to become a certified diabetes educator to assist with inpatient diabetes patient education. The culmination of this work was the formation of a multidisciplinary group to provide blood glucose management for insulin-requiring NIH Clinical Center inpatients with diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721711430355">
<title>Description of Team Design</title>
<p>The team name is the Blood Glucose Management Service (BGMS), and the team’s goal is to assume total responsibility for management of all blood glucose–associated issues for inpatients referred to the BGMS. This team differs from a consult service at the NIH Clinical Center in that team members write orders for both insulin and blood glucose monitoring instead of just making recommendations to the primary team regarding insulin dosing. This reduces delays in communication and delays in implementation of the new insulin order. Once the primary team refers a patient to the BGMS, the service becomes responsible for managing every aspect of insulin therapy (writing orders and developing a plan of care for diabetes management). The team also tracks all errors relating to diabetes management, with the goal to prevent mistakes resulting from multiple persons writing potentially conflicting orders.</p>
<p>A senior attending endocrinologist serves as the team leader for the blood glucose management team. Staff members from nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, and social work services who were interested in working with patients with diabetes were recruited to provide multidisciplinary outcome-driven care. The BGMS team consists of 3 nurses (one a certified diabetes educator), a nurse practitioner (board certified in advanced diabetes management), a registered dietitian, a clinical pharmacist (also a certified diabetes educator), a social worker (as needed), senior physicians, and the IETP endocrine fellows who rotate every 2 weeks. The team’s dietitian provides medical nutrition therapy. The pharmacist provides additional medication review for each patient. The diabetes educators, nurse practitioner, and pharmacist are each assigned a patient care unit to serve as the BGMS “ambassador.” They round daily on their assigned patients to gather data from the primary team on any planned medical changes, to obtain patient input, and to identify any symptoms of hypo- or hyperglycemia that occurred over the preceding 24 hours. In addition, the ambassadors provide the patient and/or family with verbal and written discharge instructions and teach the staff as needed. The endocrine fellow takes call while on service, writes the initial on-service note in the medical record, and develops each patient’s initial plan of care. The senior attending physician provides clinical expertise, teaches team members, and works with the primary care team if issues arise in patient management.</p>
<p>To refer a patient to the BGMS, the primary care team orders an official consult in the institution’s electronic medical record system. Once the order is written, a BGMS team member will see the patient within 24 hours. The initial patient evaluation, including a thorough history and physical examination, is conducted by the IETP fellow. At afternoon rounds, the IETP fellow gives a detailed report of the new referral to the team. The referral is then assigned a BGMS ambassador, who completes all subsequent visits to provide the daily patient report and become the liaison between the patient care team and the BGMS. The IETP fellow sees the patient as the need arises according to the ambassador’s recommendation throughout the inpatient stay. The IETP fellow communicates with the primary team as needed to discuss management issues.</p>
<p>Since January 2007, the BGMS has met daily to review each patient’s blood glucose readings and other factors that can influence glycemia (eg, drugs, food intake, activity, concurrent illness, and laboratory values). The team reviews the electronic medical record, and a member provides a report about each patient’s relevant history from the previous 24 hours, laboratory results, and plan of care. During the daily BGMS rounds, the ambassadors give a complete patient report of the information obtained during walking rounds, then the IETP fellow states a plan of action (eg, maintain the current insulin dose, suggest a decrease or an increase, change the insulin formulation or dose timing). All BGMS team members then discuss the regimen before reaching a consensus on the final plan of care for each patient. To ensure that every team member is actively involved, the BGMS multidisciplinary team agreed that each member shares responsibility for any untoward event resulting from insulin management. New or updated orders and a structured consult note are then written in an electronic medical record in the NIH’s Clinical Research Information System. Immediately after rounds, the ambassadors relay the conclusions discussed during rounds to staff, the patient, and the referring team. Unit nurses provide feedback to the BGMS team if insulin orders are unclear or if patient needs require unusual dosing schedules.</p>
<p>Before enrolling the first patient, the BGMS team developed an electronic flow sheet that shows blood glucose results, insulin doses administered, and any glycemia-related symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721711430355">Figure 1</xref>). The data can be pulled into a BGMS daily note. The flow sheet provides an efficient method to review data through graphs and structured notes. Two laptops and LCD projectors were purchased to display each patient’s electronic medical record in real time during daily afternoon rounds. One laptop is used to display data, and the other is used to edit, renew, or discontinue orders. A program-specific pager was purchased so that the primary care team had a designated pager number for communication with the BGMS team.</p>

</fig>
<p>To ensure continuous coverage, on-call service is rotated biweekly among the endocrine fellows. Each fellow on call has a backup staff member assigned from the BGMS primary group of the attending physician, nurses, nurse practitioner, and pharmacist. The on-call list is created a month in advance and covers an entire month. Contact information of the current endocrine consultant on call, the backup primary BGMS staff member, and the ambassador staff is available for all Clinical Center staff to view in the Clinical Research Information System medical record.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721711430355">
<title>Institutional Acceptance</title>
<p>Institutional acceptance consisted of a 2-part process: the first was to gain acceptance of this new service idea from the Medical Executive Committee; the second was to communicate to the clinical staff and advertise the existence of the new service within the NIH Clinical Center.</p>
<p>The senior attending physician leader presented the BGMS team plan to the Medical Executive Committee for its endorsement. In addition, presentations were given to primary team physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician’s assistants to discuss the unique service provided by the BGMS. It was important to communicate that insulin-requiring inpatients referred to the BGMS would have all of their insulin orders written exclusively by the BGMS team and that the BGMS would provide continuous monitoring of blood glucose trends and insulin regimen adjustments. The BGMS was implemented slowly, 1 unit at a time, to allow for staff education. As the BGMS team began to see patients on each unit, the value of the service was communicated through interdisciplinary dialogue. Practitioners and nurses began to recommend the service to their colleagues, increasing the BGMS census.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145721711430355">
<title>How the Service Works on 1 Unit</title>
<p>The BGMS follows inpatients on every unit except the intensive care unit—specifically, general medical- surgical, metabolic, neurology, oncology, stem cell transplant, pediatrics, infectious diseases, and behavioral health. The ambassador for a unit spends about an hour per day reviewing the electronic medical record of assigned patients (average, 3 patients each day) and speaking to the assigned nurse and patient about blood glucose trends, diet, and scheduled procedures. At times the ambassador contacts the primary team to discuss management plans. The daily team meeting to discuss current BGMS patients takes 1 hour to complete. The entire team discusses the plan of care, and the IETP fellow enters or changes the orders. Before discharge, the ambassador provides diabetes self-management education. The team standardized the teaching materials to use—namely, the NIH Clinical Center’s <italic>Patient Education: Giving a Subcutaneous Injection</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721711430355">17</xref></sup> handout, the BGMS patient education handout (with topics such as monitoring and sick day management), and <italic>Your Guide to Diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2</italic>, from the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721711430355">18</xref></sup> These materials are shared with the patient’s assigned nurse for reinforcement of education.</p>
<p>Comprehensive insulin order templates were developed to streamline the CPOE (computerized prescriber order entry) within the electronic medical record. Insulin order sets combined the scheduled dose (standing or meal bolus) with the correction dose and assigned a scheduled administration time, instead of being on an as-needed basis. See Appendix for insulin regimen frequently used by BGMS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721711430355">
<title>Performance Improvement</title>
<p>After starting the BGMS, the service is now routinely consulted for patients readmitted for care, and the team’s input is sought during outpatient visits. Shortly after initiating the BGMS, several trends in medication errors became evident, including missed dose, wrong dose, unclear orders, and lack of communication with the BGMS about changes in patient status. Causes were often related to the nursing staff’s discomfort administering the high insulin doses required by some insulin resistant patients or administering modified insulin doses to fasting patients. Commonly, nurses would hold insulin when the BGMS team had ordered it to be given. When the service does encounter such errors, the diabetes educators provide case-based education. Once the staff began to anticipate the BGMS routines, the number of medication errors fell from 0.054 per patient day in 2007 to 0.024 per patient day in 2009 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721711430355">Table 1</xref>). The number of patients followed by the BGMS also increased from 2007 to 2009. By following the number of insulin dosing errors, problems can be identified and corrected promptly. For example, in 2010, the medication error occurrence rate on 1 patient care unit spiked due to a 20% increase in staff turnover. In February, the unit’s error rate was 0.10 occurrences per patient day. The BGMS ambassador for that unit worked with unit leadership to provide feedback and education individually and in groups about medication errors, and the error rate decreased to 0.0 occurrences per patient day by July.</p>

<p>The NIH Clinical Center does not admit or discharge patients on the basis of clinical reasons but rather on protocol timelines and activities. This does not allow for the comparison of length of stay, as used in previous reports. The BGMS team has been evaluating the usability of data per patient related to number of events at target blood glucose range, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>The gradual implementation of the BGMS gave the service members an opportunity to spend time with inpatient unit staff and provide education on all aspects of diabetes management, including insulin resistance and steroid-induced diabetes. Each BGMS ambassador also attended the primary team’s rounds and quality assurance meetings to receive feedback and answer questions. As patients are discharged, the IETP fellows follow the patient in outpatient clinic for continued diabetes management. The implementation of continuous care reduces the risk of hypoglycemia when patients are tapered off of steroids as an outpatient, and it improves care when patients are readmitted to the hospital. Other improvements included creating a structured note in the electronic medical record to foster communication between the BGMS and the primary care team.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The BGMS continues to grow with increased referrals in 2011 and with new locations seeking the team’s input (ie, the intensive care unit is now considering the BGMS). Advantages of the BGMS are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721711430355">Table 2</xref>. In a teaching/research institution, providing a structured approach to glucose management improves clarity of insulin orders and reduces medication errors. This multidisciplinary, data-driven care delivery model serves to improve patient outcomes. The certified diabetes educators in this service have been instrumental in the design, implementation, and improvement of this service.</p>

<label>Appendix</label>
<p>One of the insulin regimens employed by the Blood Glucose Management Service team for inpatients is regular U-100 insulin, given subcutaneously and divided over 3 meals and at bedtime. This regimen is for inpatients with fluctuating meal patterns and rapidly changing steroid doses. The regimen includes a standing amount of insulin plus correction dose to meet the patient’s target blood glucose range. By dividing the dose, the action of the regular insulin allows for some background insulin on board at all times and for peak action to correspond with meal intake. If the patient has never used insulin before, then a weight-based dosing scheme is used (0.3-0.5 U/kg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721711430355">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721711430355">20</xref></sup> The majority of the insulin is given during the day with only 20% of the total daily dose given at bedtime. This regimen can be easily adapted for patients whose oral intake can be quite sporadic (eg, fasting for required testing, nausea) or for those changing steroid use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721711430355">21</xref></sup> Patients taking glucocorticoids often have elevated postprandial glucose and insulin resistance. The recommended insulin to target postprandial hyperglycemia is short-acting regular insulin given with meals. The dose is based on patient’s weight, calories consumed, and meal pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721711430355">21</xref></sup> The total daily dose of regular insulin is divided over breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime with a correction scale using the 1500 rule. The total daily dose in the previous 24 hours, including the standing amount and correction, is used to make adjustments for the next 24 hours. By using regular insulin with meals and at bedtime, we are combining the need for basal and nutritional insulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721711430355">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721711430355">20</xref></sup> with the one standing amount. One disadvantage of using regular insulin is the possibility of stacking the insulin and creating a hypoglycemic event. Nurses caring for patients on this regimen are counseled to keep 4 hours in between insulin doses and to delay scheduled dose if patient ate the previous meal late. For severely hyperglycemic patients, an intravenous insulin infusion is an option. Target ranges for blood glucose are individualized on the basis of the patient’s condition. In general, the Blood Glucose Management Service strives to achieve glycemic targets of less than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) before a meal or at bedtime. For some patients, glycemic targets may be more or less stringent on the basis of age, prognosis, and comorbid illnesses.</p>
