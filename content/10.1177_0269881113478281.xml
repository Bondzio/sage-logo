<abstract>
<p>Second-generation antipsychotics, which have become the standard drug therapies for schizophrenia, are known to have a serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor blocking effect in addition to a dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor blocking effect. However, although chlorpromazine (CPZ) has a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor blocking effect and has the profile of a second-generation antipsychotic in vitro, it loses this pharmacological profile in vivo. In order to elucidate the differences between the in vivo and in vitro pharmacological characteristics of CPZ, we used a radioreceptor assay to measure the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of CPZ and five major metabolites of CPZ, and compared the results to the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of risperidone, zotepine, perospirone, the major metabolites of each of these drugs, and olanzapine, bromperidol, and haloperidol. The subjects were 182 patients who had received diagnoses of schizophrenia based on the DSM-IV criteria. The results revealed that CPZ exhibited little anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity, regardless of the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity level, and that none of the metabolites possessed anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity. However, both the parent compounds and the metabolites of each of the second-generation antipsychotics possessed both anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity. This clarified that, unlike second-generation antipsychotics, the reason CPZ loses its second-generation antipsychotic profiles in vivo is because it does not have any metabolites that possess anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Second-generation antipsychotics, which have become the standard drug therapies for schizophrenia, were introduced to the clinical setting in Japan in 1996, starting with risperidone. Second-generation antipsychotics are also held to possess a serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonistic effect and to act on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonist nerves extending from the raphe nuclei to the corpus striatum, promoting the release of dopamine from the corpus striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881113478281">Bersani et al., 1990</xref>). Second-generation antipsychotics are therefore superior to first-generation antipsychotics in their effectiveness at improving negative symptoms, and they are also known to result in fewer drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). These are the major features of second-generation antipsychotics. There is a comparison of evidence of the size effects of positive and negative symptoms in the meta-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881113478281">Leucht et al. (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>The clinical features of second-generation antipsychotics derive from the balance achieved in vivo between their anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and their anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity. Whether or not the in vitro pharmacological characteristics of a second-generation antipsychotic are maintained in vivo is an important factor in determining whether or not clinical efficacy will be achieved.</p>
<p>Blonanserin (2-(4-ethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocycloocta[b]pyridine) is a novel second-generation antipsychotic that was synthesized in Japan, and introduced to the clinical setting in 2008 and that possesses pharmacological features such as a high level of affinity for both dopamine D<sub>2</sub> (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub>=0.142 nM) and serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub>=0.812 nM) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113478281">Ochi et al., 2005</xref>). We measured the in vivo plasma anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and plasma anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of blonanserin using a radioreceptor assay method, and were able to clarify that blonanserin has the same pharmacological characteristics in vivo as a second-generation antipsychotic has in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113478281">Suzuki and Gen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Chlorpromazine (CPZ), although classified as a first-generation antipsychotic, possesses affinity both for dopamine D<sub>2</sub> (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub>=363 nM) receptors and also serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub>=8.3 nM) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113478281">Needham et al., 1996</xref>) in vitro, and in this respect has the profile of a second-generation antipsychotic. However, it loses this pharmacological profile in vivo. We previously hypothesized that the differences between the in vivo and in vitro pharmacological characteristics of chlorpromazine are due to the fact that it does not have any metabolites with anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113478281">Gen et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to verify this hypothesis, we used a radioreceptor assay to measure the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of bromperidol, haloperidol, CPZ and five major metabolites of CPZ that possess comparatively potent anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity (nor<sub>1</sub>-CPZ, nor<sub>2</sub>-CPZ, 7-OH CPZ, 7-OH nor<sub>1</sub>-CPZ, and 7-OH nor<sub>2</sub>-CPZ) and bromperidol, haloperidol, and then compared these activities to those of the second-generation antipsychotics risperidone, zotepine, and perospirone, the major metabolites thereof, and olanzapine.</p>

<title>Measurement of plasma anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity by radioreceptor assay</title>
<p>The radioreceptor assay was performed according to the procedure we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113478281">Suzuki and Gen, 2010</xref>). Caudates were dissected from calf brain at a local slaughter house and immediately placed in an ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. Tissue was homogenized within 15 min of dissection in 20 volumes of buffer in a glass homogenizer with a teflon piston 10 strokes up and down at 1000 g. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was washed with 20 volumes of buffer and resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, with 5 mM Na-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1.1 mM L-ascorbic acid. Aliquots (2.5 mL) of this suspension (crude homogenate) were stored at −80°C until used for the radioreceptor assay. A 2.5 mL aliquot of crude homogenate was thawed, diluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, to which 5 mM Na-EDTA and 1.1 mM L-ascorbic acid were added. On the day of measurement, the receptor tissue was immediately thawed and diluted with a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) containing 5 mM Na-EDTA and 1.1 mM L-ascorbic acid, homogenized with a Polytron PT10 (5.0, 60) (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland), and used as the membrane preparation. For the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity measurement system, 0.3 mL of 0.1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-spiperone, 0.3 mL of membrane preparation, 0.15 mL of patient plasma, and 0.15 mL of a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) containing 5.0 mM Na-EDTA and 1.0-mM L-ascorbic acid and 60 mM NaCl were used; 1 μM butaclamol was used as the replacement agent for obtaining non-specific binding. For the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity measurement system, 0.2 mL of 4.0 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-ketanserin, 0.4 mL of the membrane preparation, 0.2 mL of patient plasma, and 0.2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) were used; 200 μM spiperone was used as the replacement agent for obtaining non-specific binding. The samples for the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity measurement system were incubated for 15 min at 37°C, and the samples for the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity measurement system were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After incubation, they were immediately subjected to vacuum filtration using a Whatman GF/B filter (Tokyo, Japan) and washed three times with 4 mL of Tris-HCl buffer. The GF/B filter was transferred to a 20 mL polyethylene scintillation vial, 8 mL of xylene diphenyloxazole was added, and the <sup>3</sup>H radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Alok LSC-5100, Tokyo, Japan). For the plasma anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity, the inhibition rate was calculated based on the percentage of [<sup>3</sup>H]-spiperone and [<sup>3</sup>H]-ketanserin that had bound to the membrane preparation (total minus non-specific binding) and was replaced by major metabolites of each drug in plasma in vitro, via comparison to a pre-prepared risperidone reference curve. For each metabolite, we measured the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of metabolites of known concentrations to prepare anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity calibration curves, and then used these calibration curves to prepare IC<sub>50</sub> (half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration) values. The intra-assay and inter-assay precision of the plasma anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity measurement systems in this radioreceptor assay was within 10% (coefficient of variation) in both cases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, the use of positron emission tomography (PET) to measure the cranial nerve receptor occupancy rate has come to hold an important place in antipsychotic drug assessment. The significance of this study is therefore discussed in light of the imaging of antipsychotics in studies in humans.</p>
<p>PET plays an important role in the pharmacological assessment of the clinical dosages of antipsychotics. The dosages of antipsychotics that are used correlate to the intracranial D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rates, and a relationship has also been reported between the intracranial D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rate and clinical efficacy and side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881113478281">Nordstrom et al., 1993</xref>). It has been reported that, with antipsychotics, efficacy is achieved when the striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rate is 60% or higher, and that EPS occur when the occupancy rate exceeds 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881113478281">Farde et al., 1998</xref>). It has therefore become possible to predict the optimal dosages of antipsychotics. Regarding the relationship between clinical efficacy and the receptor occupancy rate, although the limbic dopamine system should properly be monitored as a measurement site, due to measurement precision limitations consideration should be given to using the striate body as a measurement site instead.</p>
<p>PET measurements of intracranial D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rates have revealed that a low affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptor binding and rapid dissociation are characteristics of second-generation antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881113478281">Kapur et al., 2001</xref>). However, among the second-generation antipsychotics, risperidone binds more strongly than endogenous dopamine, and even with single dosing results in D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade lasting at least 24 h. Olanzapine also dissociates from D<sub>2</sub> receptors slowly, and it is therefore necessary to keep in mind that this concept cannot be applied to all second-generation antipsychotics.</p>
<p>According to a meta-analysis of several PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies by Stone and colleagues, striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptor inhibition plays a larger role in EPS onset than in therapeutic efficacy. It was inferred that temporal cortex D<sub>2</sub> receptors are the receptors that are more closely associated with antipsychotic efficacy. In short, it is highly likely that the key to finding the right balance between antipsychotic efficacy and EPS involves the temporal cortex and striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rates which are directly affected by antipsychotic drug dosages, and should therefore be used as the basis for dose-finding. On the other hand, there was no evidence for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> blockade involvement in antipsychotic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113478281">Stone et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors act to inhibit dopamine neurons. It is believed that dopamine neuron activity is increased, and EPS controlled, when second-generation antipsychotics disinhibit this action.</p>
<p>We studied the relationship between the plasma concentration of blonanserin and its plasma anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity/anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity ratio and the emergence of EPS, and found that, although primarily the plasma concentration correlates to the onset of EPS, the incidence of EPS may be lower when the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity is greater than the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881113478281">Suzuki and Gen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The above findings show that most second-generation antipsychotics have a relatively strong affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, and that it is certain that this has some effect on the neurotransmitter system.</p>
<p>Generally in the clinical setting, not only is it expensive but also it is difficult to perform PET or SPECT measurements for individual patients. It is therefore common for in vitro receptor binding capacity to be used as an indicator of the pharmacological characteristics of drugs in the clinical setting. One reported characteristic of second-generation antipsychotics in terms of their in vitro receptor binding affinity is that their binding affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors is relatively higher than their binding affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113478281">Meltzer, 1989</xref>). The D<sub>2</sub> receptor binding capacity and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding capacity are therefore often focused on as indicators for determining the differences in the pharmacological characteristics of first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. In the clinical setting, except for a few drugs, most second-generation antipsychotics have more potent anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> effects than anti-D<sub>2</sub> effects. On the other hand, CPZ, a first-generation antipsychotic, has the pharmacological characteristics in vitro of a second-generation antipsychotic.</p>
<p>When an antipsychotic medication is taken, the pharmacological characteristics that the parent compound exhibits in vitro are not manifested unchanged in vivo. The pharmacological characteristics that are exhibited in vivo are determined by the sum of the activities exhibited by the parent compound and the metabolites. Since the number and potency of activity of the metabolites and the relative proportions of the concentrations of the parent compound and the metabolites vary depending on the drug, it is necessary to investigate the in vivo pharmacological characteristics of each drug.</p>
<p>Therefore, to clarify whether or not the in vitro receptor binding capacity of each drug retained in vivo may have clinical utility, we used a radioreceptor assay method in this study which makes it possible to measure the sum total of the receptor activity values of the parent compound and each metabolite.</p>
<p>CPZ is known to be metabolized into at least 20 different metabolites through multiple metabolic pathways, including hydroxylation, demethylation, and sulfation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881113478281">Usdin, 1978</xref>). Although the affinities of CPZ and its metabolites for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors have not been elucidated, there have been reports on their affinities for D<sub>2</sub> receptors, alpha-1 receptors, and muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881113478281">Cohen et al., 1979</xref>). We therefore measured the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity and the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity of the five major metabolites that, according to this report, possess comparatively potent anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity. The results of our research show that, based on the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity IC<sub>50</sub> values for each of the metabolites, all of them possess anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity. However, based on their anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> IC<sub>50</sub> values, none of them possess anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity. In our study, anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity was low in the CPZ treatment group regardless of the level of anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity. These results confirm that the reason CPZ the parent compound loses its comparatively potent in vitro anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity in vivo is because it has no metabolites that possess anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity.</p>
<p>As in the results that have been obtained from previous research, bromperidol and haloperidol had much stronger binding affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptors than for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113478281">Roth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113478281">Schotte et al., 1995</xref>) and, as in the results of the imaging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113478281">Kapur and Remington, 1996</xref>), which showed that the brain D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rate was extremely high at clinical doses, the mean S/D ratio was 0 for each drug. Therefore, the absence of observed anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity in vivo in this study shows that bromperidol and haloperidol are pharmacologically similar to first-generation antipsychotics in that they exhibit strong anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity in vivo as well as in vitro.</p>
<p>The primary metabolic pathway of risperidone is hydroxylation, and risperidone’s primary metabolite is 9-hydroxy risperidone (9-OH risperidone). Furthermore, it has been reported that, in a steady state, 9-OH risperidone, is present in higher concentrations in the blood than the parent compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113478281">Morishima, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Zotepine is known to be metabolized by multiple pathways in vivo into multiple metabolites. The primary metabolic pathways are hydroxylation and demethylation, resulting in 3-hydroxy zotepine (3-OH zotepine), 2-hydroxy zotepine (2-OH zotepine) and norzotepine.</p>
<p>Perospirone, the pharmacological action of which includes dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor-blocking action as well as serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor-blocking action, was introduced in 2001 as the first second-generation antipsychotic in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113478281">Ishigooka, 2001</xref>). Perospirone is metabolized in vivo primarily by cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4 into the active metabolite ID-15036 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113478281">Fujimoto et al., 1997</xref>). The steady-state ID-15036 blood concentration has been reported to be approximately 10 times the blood concentration of the parent compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881113478281">Gen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Olanzapine is known to be metabolized into nine metabolites via five metabolic pathways in vivo. The primary metabolites are the 10-N glucuronide and 4-N-desmethyl olanzapine, both of which are known to possess extremely weak anti-D<sub>2</sub> and anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113478281">Calligaro et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, the steady-state blood concentration of the parent compound has been reported to be approximately 2.5 times the blood concentration of the 10-N glucuronide and approximately three times the blood concentration of 4-N-desmethyl olanzapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113478281">Kassahun et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As in the results that have been obtained from previous research, risperidone, zotepine, perospirone and olanzapine had much stronger binding affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors than for D<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113478281">Ishibashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113478281">Roth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113478281">Schotte et al., 1995</xref>) and, as in the results of the imaging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881113478281">Kuroki et al., 2008</xref>), which showed that, at clinical doses, the brain 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor occupancy rate is higher than the D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy rate, the mean S/D ratio for each was not less than 1.0. Therefore, the fact that the anti-5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activity was greater than the anti-D<sub>2</sub> activity in vivo in this study shows that the second-generation antipsychotic pharmacological characteristics of these drugs manifest similarly in vivo as in vitro.</p>
<p>Since the receptor binding capacity in vitro is often used as one measure for ascertaining the pharmacological characteristics of each drug in the clinical setting, it may be clinically useful to clarify whether or not the pharmacological characteristics of each drug in vitro are retained in vivo. However, there are limitations to determining the pharmacological characteristics of antipsychotic drugs only on the basis of the S/D ratio in vivo. It is therefore believed that a more comprehensive understanding needs to be obtained regarding the pharmacological characteristics of antipsychotic drugs, an understanding based not only on the in vivo S/D ratio, but also on the D<sub>2</sub> receptor dissociation rate.</p>
