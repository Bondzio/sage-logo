<p>In this concise and convincing book, Mignon Duffy uses an in-depth analysis of census data to draw the history of paid care work in the United States from 1900 to 2007. She defines the field of care work broadly, analyzing and comparing multiple occupations (including non-interactive jobs) in health, education, domestic work, and other sectors. Throughout, she is concerned with tracing the links among the demographic characteristics of workers, the degree of relationality in the job, and other features of the work such as pay, working conditions, and symbolic value, as well as with illuminating the racial-ethnic and economic inequalities that mark the field of caring labor.</p>
<p>Duffy writes against two prominent narratives about contemporary caring labor and its relationship to markets. The first is that the market has replaced work previously done by family members. In fact, she points out, “families who can afford to have been exchanging money for care for centuries” (p. 130); that is, paying for care is not new. Furthermore, she argues that what is paid for—care work itself—has changed significantly.</p>
<p>The second narrative she engages, which is related, is the idea that that “serfdom saved the women’s movement”—that is, that work formerly done on an unpaid basis by female family members has been replaced, as those women have left the home for professional jobs, by the (under)paid labor of women of color, thus creating racial-ethnic and class inequalities and potentially a “new low-wage servant class” (p. 135, citing Mona Harrington). Duffy suggests that this claim is also overly simplistic, because racial-ethnic inequalities have long characterized paid reproductive labor, and because this idea ignores the diversity of the care work sector and the ways in which inequalities are produced within it.</p>
<p>To flesh out these arguments in specific chapters, Duffy combines an original longitudinal analysis of census data focusing on the prevalence and demographic composition of several occupations with occupational histories synthesized from secondary sources. In several chapters Duffy details the rise of “expert” care work, primarily that of doctors, nurses, child care workers, teachers, social workers, and psychologists. She shows how these occupations developed in terms of the gender, race, and foreign-born status of their occupants, as well as the degree of relationality of the work. Some “nurturant” care occupations (so denoted because they involve interactive and intimate relationships) were initially majority female and remain so, as men have not entered these occupations in significant numbers. Others, which were originally majority male, have become more feminized. These jobs include doctor, secondary school teacher, and psychologist. It is notable, though not coincidental, that these occupations have usually also started paying less and offering less autonomy.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, Duffy shows how two common ideas—(1) that certain jobs inherently involve nurture and (2) that women are especially well suited to provide it—came about in large part because of women’s own efforts to enter particular labor markets (e.g., teachers) or professionalize their work (e.g., nurses), which led them to frame nurture as a skill especially associated with women. Thus essentialist ideas about women’s capabilities, which have come to be associated with jobs that pay less and/or are less prestigious, were actually part of a move toward increasing their labor market options as well as status and material rewards.</p>
<p>These efforts also contributed to symbolic and material divisions between “nurturing” jobs and “menial” jobs, such as those between nurses and hospital aides as nurses tried to monopolize the provision of nurture. Yet workers in both these categories (and many others) have seen the nurturing elements squeezed out of their official job descriptions as these are increasingly rationalized in the era of cost reduction. Thus the nurturant elements of work are increasingly undervalued (symbolically and financially) as well as being associated with women.</p>
<p>Duffy’s historical discussion certainly supports her argument that this is not just a straightforward story of outsourcing formerly unpaid care work. This view matters because it operates against the simplistic nostalgia for the “good old days” of uncommodified care that sometimes marks the literature, and because it highlights the multiplicity of types of work that constitute caring labor.</p>
<p>However, her second claim, disputing the idea that a “new servant class” has not “saved the women’s movement,” is less convincing. Duffy shows in the chapter on domestic service that neither this type of paid work nor its class and racial-ethnic inequalities are new; but those are not sufficient arguments against the idea that the availability of women (usually women of color and/or immigrants) willing to do domestic labor has made it possible both for wealthier women to enter the labor force and, especially, for those women’s husbands to avoid domestic labor.</p>
<p>Duffy also makes a significant contribution by defining paid care work broadly, bringing together “nurturant” care work with domestic work and invisible, low-wage service work in cafeterias, laundries, and cleaning services. The chapter on “dirty work” illuminates the presence of men in this sector as well as of workers of color and immigrants in higher proportion than in expert care work. Thinking beyond particular occupations and assumptions about what constitutes this labor allows for a more comprehensive and generative conceptualization of the care sector and for a better understanding of the inequalities within it, as Duffy argues.</p>
<p>However, the incorporation of low-wage work raises other questions about why certain kinds of service work are characterized as being in the care sector while others are not. Duffy cites (and seems to agree with) Pat Armstrong and others who claim that the jobs of these workers in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes are somehow socially more important than those of workers doing the same jobs in other places, such as corporate cafeterias, hotel laundries, or any building that requires janitorial services. This perspective is troubling, because it implies that “care sector” workers should perhaps make more money or have better working conditions than those in the non-care sector doing the same jobs. This does not open a useful way to address the low wages and problematic working conditions faced by these workers.</p>
<p>It also is a variant of the common (if often implicit) practice of defining “care work” as that which seems socially necessary, while “service work” is that which is less important and, when interactive, assumed to be inauthentic rather than genuinely nurturant. Solving this problem is not the point of Duffy’s book, of course, but she could have further developed these definitional questions, including the issue of domestic labor. By the same token, it would have been interesting for Duffy to reflect on the way census and other occupational categories themselves shape and constrain our thinking about caring labor.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a strong study, which provides a useful and nuanced overview of occupations and how they have changed on a number of critical dimensions, and contributes theoretically by challenging simple formulations and critiques of the field.</p>
