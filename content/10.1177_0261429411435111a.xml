<p>Cognitive developmental science offers essential perspectives on human development and is a major intellectual endeavour because it enables us to more fully understand the processes and influences that impinge on key aspects of neuroscience, perception, cognition, and language.</p>
<p>This new text is superbly organized and supplies cutting-edge research, theories, and analysis. Each chapter reflects on the current state of the field in cognitive development with an introduction as a forward organizer; a brief overview of the specific field; a concluding chapter summary; and relevant and current references for further reading. Readers will be delighted with the text’s online resources, website features, glossary of key terms and concepts, and hotlinks to journal articles.</p>
<p>Part 1 presents the foundations of developmental science – the concepts and theories of human development, the interaction between culture and development, and an analysis of research design and measurement.</p>
<p>Part 2 examines developmental neuroscience, psychophysiology, and genetics; physical and motor development; perceptual development; cognitive development; and language development.</p>
<p>
<italic>Cognitive Development </italic>provides excellent reading for both graduate and postgraduate study. The book has a wealth of notable contributors and has been extremely well organized so that the reader can select appropriate chapters according to a particular interest or can absorb the complexity of the whole current approach of developmental cognitive science.</p>
<p>The book is indeed a library of resources, and makes a superb reference book in itself, as well as indicating avenues for further reading and research.</p>
