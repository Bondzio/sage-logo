<p>How are contexts made and narrated? This article addresses the question of how to identify relevant contexts for understanding a work of natural history, in this case <italic>The First Natural History of Norway</italic>, published in two volumes in 1752 and 1753. In addition to offering a rich and complex description of Norwegian nature, this historical work serves as an important source for investigating the ways in which nature was perceived in the kingdom of Denmark-Norway in the middle of the eighteenth century. Nature was manifold, serving as a source of aesthetic pleasure, economic gain, religious reverence, and political power. It is argued that to understand the different natures presented in this book, we need to relate them to more than one context. But how do we determine the relevant contexts? The approach explored in this article is to read the book closely in search of the specific audiences that are addressed. By focusing on the ways audiences are addressed, it is argued, we can make better historical accounts of how natures are conceived and change in relation to different contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In June 1748, the newly appointed Danish bishop of the Bergen diocese, Erik Pontoppidan, arrived in Bergen on the west coast of Norway, the town which was to become his place of residence for six years. Pontoppidan’s job was to oversee the clergymen and parish clerks, churches, schools, and poor houses, as well as to deal with a wide range of civil administrative tasks. Through his many visitation journeys within his diocese (which covered most of the west coast of southern Norway), Pontoppidan collected observations and specimens. After three summers of traveling from parish to parish, he had collected enough material to write a natural history of the entire country, which contained, according to the book’s subtitle, “A particular and accurate Account of the Temperature of the Air, the different Soils, Waters, Vegetables, Metals, Minerals, Stones, Beasts, Birds, and Fishes; together with the Dispositions, Customs, and Manner of Living of the Inhabitants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243912439759">1</xref>
</sup>). Four years after having arrived in Norway, Pontoppidan had published the first part of a two-volume natural history of Norway, and the second volume was also already drafted. In addition to performing his administrative and clerical tasks, he had thus written the first natural history of the kingdom. Furthermore, again according to the subtitle, the book was “Interspersed with Physiological Notes from eminent Writers, and Transactions of Academies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>). This illustrated, 800-page work on Norwegian nature was immediately translated into German (published in two volumes in 1753 and 1754) and English (published in 1755).</p>
<p>The reason I have chosen this first natural history of Norway as a research object is my interest in popular nature—that is, public nature. I am interested in how nature comes into being as a collective object, as well as how and to what degree “science” participates in the making of such a collective object. “Science” in our modern understanding of the word did not exist in the middle of the eighteenth century, but was used as a term covering a wide range of systematic enquiries, from theology to mathematics, from church history to physics. In Denmark-Norway, the term was <italic>Viden-skaber</italic> covering the same topics and practices as the German <italic>Wissenschaften</italic>. The claim here is that systematic enquiries like Pontoppidan’s work contributed to bringing different kinds of nature into being. While these natures have also played important roles in later accounts of Norwegian nature, my main purpose here is to identify the different versions of Norwegian nature that were in play in this work. The motivation for seeking out these different versions of nature is to develop our understanding of how perceptions of nature change historically in highly complex but significant ways that are difficult to grasp if we insist on the singularity of nature.</p>
<p>Pontoppidan’s book is one of the first texts to make Norwegian nature into a coherent and manageable entity, immediately connecting Norway and nature in the title. The title of the work invites a reading of the book as a history where a particular Norwegian nature is to be presented. The subtitle indicates, however, a division of this nature into many different categories that encompass the particular entities that can be found in Norway—air and soils, beasts and birds. The very notion of natural history signifies just this: a thorough description of particulars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912439759">Pomata and Sirasi 2005</xref> for the development of the term <italic>historia</italic>). The title also implies that the book takes part in a collective “scientific” endeavor presenting academically approved facts in the form of notes from well-reputed scholars. Pontoppidan takes part in making nature into a collective entity by relating it to a political territory and a collective group of people, but his own book belies the existence of one unified nature, as I will show.</p>
<p>As a natural history work from the eighteenth century, this book has been regarded as off the track of the main road of natural history, due both to its physico-theological arguments and the credulity of its author when it comes to monsters of land and sea. “Pontoppidan . . . has been universally hailed and quoted by the rest of the world as the Munchausen of his day, and a very wholesale dealer in gratuitous and absolute falsehood,” and early nineteenth-century article exclaimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243912439759">An 1826</xref>, 181 ). Recent volumes dealing with early modern natural history have given us a new conception of this kind of literature. Natural histories as Pontoppidan’s are regarded as part of the cultures of knowing nature, and both physico-theologists and credulous men and women are seen as important participants in these cultures (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243912439759">Jardine, Secord, and Spary 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243912439759">Smith and Findlen 2002</xref>). Building upon this work, I would like to understand Pontoppidan’s text in the context of its time, but in this article my chief aim is to query what exactly that might mean.</p>
<p>There are clear historical reasons why Pontoppidan’s book appeared at this time and place and with this particular content. Such historical reasons are referred to as context. Context, which is a metaphor derived from the activity of weaving, is what makes up the fabric of history—the political, social, and cultural conditions that historians seek out when trying to describe and explain events. These are also the threads that make up our narratives, the tools of historians. Thus, deciding upon the right context is the arduous job of a historian. This quest entails, however, a circular logic where context is both the precondition and the product of our work: we look for contexts and we construct the contexts we use to explain. The context is performed in our narratives, but the context is also what we look for and what we map.</p>
<p>The metaphors for identifying patterns and mapping contexts as though they were simply “out there,” waiting to be detected, imply topologies which have been questioned from different disciplinary perspectives in recent decades. Specifically, I draw inspiration from versions of Science and Technology Studies (STS) that insist that contexts are made and brought into being by different actors. The term “enactment,” as it has been developed by Annemarie Mol, is useful for understanding how entities are brought into being together with their different descriptions and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243912439759">Mol 2002</xref>). This approach implies a rejection of looking for explanations and realities separated from the events and objects that one wants to understand, to favor instead a search for how these phenomena are simultaneously brought into being. In other words, the task is to identify the heterogeneous sets of relations and pay attention to what is there—not as signs or portents of something infinitely bigger or more important or more real, some strong and decisive structure, but the words, peoples, and machines that are there—and attend to how they are enacted. This seems to me to be one of the core lessons to be learned from actor-network theory (and after) within STS (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243912439759">Latour 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243912439759">Law and Hassard 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243912439759">Law 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The concepts of “contexts” or “circumstances” have at different times and different places been employed in opposition to figural or allegorical readings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243912439759">Burke 2002</xref>). In this understanding, contexts imply situating something in “reality” rather than through figural interpretation. As such, contextualizing could be seen as a way of deciding upon one single reality. In accordance with recent STS research, I will propose that reading literally can also be a strategy for highlighting and bringing to the fore tensions and ambiguity, as well as simultaneous but not necessarily overlapping patterns (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243912439759">Haraway 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243912439759">Mol 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243912439759">Strathern 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243912439759">Verran 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Methodologically, I have thus read <italic>The Natural History of Norway</italic> looking for the relations made in the text, or in other words, reading with an eye on which contexts the book makes for itself. It is a literal reading, asking the text quite simply: what and whom do you address? Which threads are spun from the book toward something which comes into being as its context? In STS studies, ethnographic methods have been favored when the complexities of current medical, scientific, or technological practices are being investigated. This case is meant to investigate how these insights can be used to address historical phenomena, or more to the point, how these insights can be particularly fruitful when accounting for a historical object.</p>
<p>I will argue that Pontoppidan’s book enacts nature in multiple ways. While showing that Norwegian nature is multiplied throughout the book, I will also ask: what contexts does the book bring into being? Based on a close reading of the text, I will focus on four contexts that are tightly knit to the audiences the book addresses, namely the king, God, the marketplace, and the community of learned men (which Pontoppidan in line with his contemporaries refers to as the Republic of Letters). In describing how these contexts are brought forth in the text, I will show the multiple natures that the book brings into being in relation to each of these contexts. Thus in reading the book in this way, I encounter different natures that partly overlap and are partly connected (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243912439759">Mol 2002</xref>). These tensions can be accessed through the different contexts the work sets for itself, contexts which will also be addressed as its conditions of possibility. By claiming that contexts and natures are brought into being in this book, my intention is not to say that this is the only site where such construction work is carried out. Pontoppidan’s text is only one among many phenomena which constructs the contexts of natures, but it is an important site for studying how these contexts are in making in the period. Rather than telling one coherent historical narrative which can give us an understanding of the text, its context, and the way it establishes nature, my ambition is to separate out different audiences, different natures, and different contexts. The four audiences/contexts/natures that are identified will be examined through four narratives which I present in four sections. At the end, I will discuss the versions of nature that I have found and point out how they might be connected.</p>
<p>Reading one book is not a sufficient method for investigating complex historical phenomena, and I regard this article as an experiment, not in reading only one book, but in insisting that the book is the best guide to its contexts. However, the basis for my claims comes from archival research, and unpublished material by and about Pontoppidan and his contemporaries.<sup>

</sup> Ponotoppidan’s Natural History has received limited scholarly attention, except for the recently published study by Simone Ochsner Goldscmidt who has done a close reading of the book inspired by New Historicism, carefully scrutinizing how knowledge is constituted through the use of sources and arguments, text organization, and paratexts and materiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243912439759">Goldschmidt 2012</xref>). Apart from this book, there are no comprehensive studies of Pontoppidan’s natural history, and studies of natural history writing elsewhere in Europe serve as useful comparative material. Working with this material, it has become important to me to try to figure out how I can account for the diversity and richness of the Natural History of Norway, and my attempt is thus to inquire whether the book can be seen as the best guide to the relevant contexts.</p>

<sec id="section3-0162243912439759">
<title>The King</title>
<p>Pontoppidan was born into a family of clergymen in Århus, Denmark in 1698. He received theological education as an orthodox Lutheran, was certificated as a clergyman, and experienced a pietistic conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1834</xref>). From a modest position as a vicar, he was summoned to become the Danish priest at the royal court. Pontoppidan, who earned the title of extraordinary professor in theology in 1738, was a prolific writer. He was closely connected to the king, his family and council, and he therefore knew the king’s ambitions of trying to spread true Lutheran Christianity and thus literacy to his subjects. As part of the ambitious scheme to educate the inhabitants of the kingdom in the right faith, confirmation was instituted as a prerequisite to being considered a subject of the realm (1736), a new catechism was introduced for obligatory use (by Pontoppidan in 1737), and compulsory schooling was introduced (1739).</p>
<p>Literature written in the absolutist monarchy in Denmark-Norway was directed upward toward a small, but powerful audience, namely the absolutist king of God’s grace as the model recipient (on the literary culture, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243912439759">Apelseth 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243912439759">Berge 1998</xref>), as well as the ministers of the country. In the eighteenth century, the king of Denmark-Norway governed a large territory that encompassed small colonies in India, some islands in West India, trading posts in Africa, and closer to home, Greenland, Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, the North German duchies—and Norway. The most populous territories were Denmark and Norway, hence the abbreviated form Denmark-Norway which was most often used for this conglomerate state. The uncontested center of the state was Copenhagen where the king resided and the ministries and the university were situated (for a general introduction, see Feldbæk 1998).</p>
<p>Pontoppidan’s natural history book was directed at the king and his council in Copenhagen. The eight-page dedication to Prime Minister Johan Ludvig Holstein opened quite simply with the words, “Gracious Lord, Always found and propitious patron” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>). Holstein, who had served as Pontoppidan’s patron during the latter’s service as a member of court and priest to the king, is praised as a true and pious lover of the useful sciences. However, Pontoppidan’s position while writing the Natural History of Norway was ambiguous. He had been priest to King Christian VI from 1735 until this king’s death in 1746. When Frederik V succeeded his father to the throne, Pontoppidan was appointed bishop in the Norwegian city of Bergen, an expulsion masked as a promotion, according to Pontoppidan’s biographer (Neiiendam 1933). Allegedly, it was Pontoppidan’s strong pietistic conviction that prompted the king to remove him from his court; however, Holstein was a powerful minister and a pietist with whom Pontoppidan maintained strong contact, including throughout the reign of Frederik V (who eventually called him back to Copenhagen after the <italic>Natural History</italic> was published).</p>
<p>He had risen to power as a spokesperson for the improvement-oriented reform politics the king was planning to implement in the state, a policy developed further by King Frederik V. In line with an ambition of systematically documenting the resources of the kingdom, Pontoppidan’s first natural history of Norway was a work of economics that showed the values of the Norwegian resources for the benefit of the king. “If physical knowlege [<italic>sic</italic>] be not, like godliness, <italic>profitable to all things</italic>, yet it is so to many, and in a certain degree to most things,” Pontoppidan wrote in the introduction to the first book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: v). To Pontoppidan, what he termed “natural knowledge” or “physical knowledge” was useful for the practice of law; it was also obviously useful for medicine. First and foremost, however, it was a science (<italic>Videnskab</italic>) that was useful for those who were going to educate others on the road to salvation. A theological candidate ought to study “physics,” Pontoppidan asserted, as well as metaphysical and logical topics, “These last not being so indispensably necessary and useful as the former,” argued Pontoppidan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: vi).</p>
<p>For priests who were summoned to a country parish, natural knowledge will “not only furnish them with many clear arguments, and edifying reflexions to themselves and their hearers,” argues Pontoppidan; “but it will besides prove a liberal amusement in their solitude; it will enable them, by much greater opportunities than the learned enjoy in towns, to make useful discoveries or improvements, from the products of nature, to the lasting benefit of their country, which it is their duty to promote” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: viii). Ambitiously, Pontoppidan also explained to the king’s administrative body about the importance of knowing Norway. “It is unquestionably more necessary for our young statesmen, to know Norway and Sweden, than to be able to decide which merits the preference, the Rhenish, Italian, French, or Spanish wines,” he argued echoing similar statements made in other European states, most notably Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: ix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243912439759">Koerner 1999</xref>, compare also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912439759">Withers 1999</xref> for England and Scotland).</p>
<p>Utility was thus the guiding principle of the book. Few, if any, of the stones, plants, birds, and animals were described without information about whether they could be useful in some way or another. Pontoppidan’s descriptions of many phenomena were indeed basic, yet the usefulness of these phenomena as resources was considered whenever possible. Whether the theme was vegetables, minerals, or fish, the various chapters opened with a consideration of how the resources were currently exploited, and what possible improvements could be considered. On a few occasions, the author seems to arrest himself in his utility-oriented approach; for example, in a description of gold and silver in Norwegian mountains, Pontoppidan notes, “However, my subject being rather the nature of things than the benefits of them . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I:180).</p>
<p>Utility was invoked in many forms in the eighteenth century. “The value that the naturalists poured into the parts of nature they studied so attentively was simultaneously moral, aesthetic, and economic,” writes historian of science Lorraine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243912439759">Daston (2004</xref>, 119). Daston goes on to note that the eighteenth-century word for “this compound of norms” was “utility” and that perhaps no other shibboleth was so often invoked in so many varied contexts. “Utility also permeated natural history, not only in the justifications of natural history as edifying or . . . profitable, but also in the habits of observation and the pleasures of attention that marked the <italic>naturaliste de profession</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243912439759">Daston 2004</xref>, 119). Pontoppidan was neither a naturalist by profession nor an attentive dilettante. His vocation derived from Christian enlightenment based on Lutheran pietism, his chief merit as an author being his ability to compile and process large amounts of texts and stories. Still the version of nature he presents is an economic asset to the king, a treasure house for the royal court and the ministries in Denmark to exploit and use. Utility is certainly a compound of norms in Pontoppidan’s work, but these norms are stressed and articulated differently—to some degree aesthetically, to a larger degree morally, certainly politically and indisputably economically. Even so, economy was a concept that could subsume some or all of the other norms, and it definitely subsumed the category of nature. In Pontoppidan’s work, nature was the most important aspect of economy.</p>
<p>Pontoppidan’s work was directed at the king and the bureaucracy. Thus he addressed the ruler with a description of a territory whose treasures were hidden, riches unknown. He was in line with proponents of cameralist doctrines in Northern Europe who took part in making cameralism—the art of ruling a territory well—into a university subject. The concept of economy had been transposed from denoting the household, and had increasingly been used polemically, since the late seventeenth century, to describe the divine management of creatures and of nature itself in different parts of Europe (see articles in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162243912439759">Schabas and Marchi 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162243912439759">Schaffer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243912439759">Tribe 1978</xref>). The cameralist doctrines developed in the German states and Scandinavia involved making an inventory of resources, deploying them for making the inhabitants happy, and reducing the import of goods and the export of precious metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7a-0162243912439759">Cooper 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243912439759">Koerner 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243912439759">Tribe 1978</xref>). It also involved developing a new language for describing the kingdoms. Good government had become dependent on describing and managing nature. Pontoppidan’s text was one of the very first in Denmark-Norway to knit together good government and natural resources within a published work. He was thereby doing the important work of inventing a language that made connections not only between inhabitants and morals in Norway and the king in Copenhagen but also between cows, grass and fish, the state, and the well-being of the kingdom’s inhabitants. These connections were hardly unique in contemporary Europe, but in Denmark-Norway the work paved the way for what has been termed a veritable wave of cameralist and economic publishing. In the years 1757-1764, Pontoppidan was the editor of <italic>Denmark and Norway’s Oeconomic Magazin</italic>, which was the first public forum for discussions of economics in the country and in 1759 he published <italic>Eutropii Philadelphi Oeconomiske Balance—</italic>giving an estimate of the natural and civil wealth of Denmark, according to its subtitle. Seen in this perspective, the <italic>Natural History of Norway</italic> was directed at the king who needed knowledge of nature to manage his household well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0162243912439759">
<title>God</title>
<p>Pontoppidan wrote his work to honor God, which is clearly indicated on the title page: “In the honour of the wise and almighty Creator, as well as for his reasonable Creatures for the opportunity for reflection.” In this absolutist monarchy, one honored God and the king, but in Pontoppidan’s natural history, God plays an especially prominent role. The first natural history of Norway reads like a sermon emphasizing that one can know God through the created world. The believer will have his belief strengthened by thorough knowledge of the physical world because all that is, is created by God, and thus by studying His work we can know Him better, we can read Pontoppidan saying. Two of the central tenets of Lutheran pietism were that true Christianity was there for everyone to experience through the reading of the Bible and that personal belief was the road to salvation. For Pontoppidan, the pietistic cause was not contrary to the study of nature. He explained that one could read the book of nature through using reason. Thus, science and natural knowledge were auxiliary to theology: “In the instructive book of nature are many leaves, which, hitherto, no mortal has thoroughly perused” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: iii). As the chief pietist ideologue of the state under the reign of Christian VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243912439759">Gilje and Rasmussen 2002</xref>, 316), Pontoppidan had played an important role in enforcing a moderate pietism on the country, damning dance and theater and praising schooling and rational education. In his natural history, God was never left out of sight.</p>
<p>In Pontoppidan’s book, the reader can find evidence of God’s existence and of His goodness. If nature seems merciless, one has to search for the reasons, that is, for God’s purpose. Then it will soon appear that there is a purpose for everything and that this purpose is good. “As one of my chief views in this work is,” says Pontoppidan, “according to my shallow knowledge and insight into the harmony of things, to shew that all the works of God are full of loving kindness, I must here observe that the moist and rainy weather, which prevails all over the western coast of Norway, but chiefly about Bergen, is excellently adapted to the necessities of the country, and in several respects contributes to its welfare” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, 26). God’s deeds are full of loving kindness, which Pontoppidan claims to prove scientifically and empirically.</p>
<p>This belief in a purposeful and provident nature was important for the physico-theology that Pontoppidan preached. In the latter part of the seventeenth and the first part of the eighteenth centuries, a long series of books which provided physico-theological proof of God’s existence were published in England and on the continent. Pontoppidan salutes William Derham for having set out the plan of physico-theology. The subtitle of Derham’s book <italic>Physico-theology</italic> defined it simply as “a demonstration of the being and attributes of God, from his works of creation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243912439759">Derham 1716</xref>). The work of creation was varied, and different authors emphasized different aspects of God’s work. The aspects mentioned by Pontoppidan were astro-theology, pyro-, and hydro-theology; bronto-theology; pitano-theology; acrido-theology; litho- and testaceo-theology, and so on. [theologies of the heavens, fire, water, thunder and lightning, locusts, stones, snails, and mussels] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: vii).</p>
<p>A specific set of ideas was manifest in this tradition (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243912439759">Philipp 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162243912439759">Stebbins 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162243912439759">
<italic>Theologische Realenzyklopädie </italic>1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243912439759">Ray 1691</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243912439759"> Derham 1716</xref>). First, physico-theology decreed that everything that is created is created with a purpose; nothing in nature is a result of chance or without a plan. Second, the assumption within this tradition was that nature is good, as also illustrated in Pontoppidan’s work. While earlier Christians sometimes tended to regard the earth as wreckage left after the deluge, or as “a small dirty planet” in Thomas Burnet’s words in his sacred theory of the earth from 1684, by the eighteenth century the earth had become a harmonious and balanced home for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243912439759">Porter 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243912439759">Nicolson [1959</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243912439759">] 1997</xref>). Third, people had a central place in physico-theology: it was every person’s duty to know the creation of God and to look after and improve it because the earth was considered to have been given to humans for their use. Fourth, according to physico-theology, the earth had a regularity and followed certain rules, not because it was governed by mathematical laws but because the earth was created by God.</p>
<p>All these elements of physico-theology were to be found in Pontoppidan’s work. God’s creation was the result of a plan: “If it be farther asked, how it is possible that nature can regulate herself by the necessities of the inhabitants, … I answer, that it is no miracle, but purely the result of the primary natural disposition of things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, 15). There are no miracles in this nature that God had created; rather it was perfectly planned from the beginning. The duty of the naturalist was to search out the rules whereby nature works, and these rules were not neutral but absolutely good as they were put in place by God.</p>
<p>Writing about the Norwegian terrain, Pontoppidan first considers the inconveniences caused by the mountains before he considers their advantages. The first benefit of mountains which he identifies is that they collect the clouds and dissolve them into rain, and since mountain water is more fertilizing than common rainwater, he contends that this makes the small peasant’s fields “fat and fertile.” Second, he suggests that “the mountainous countries may be considered as the store-houses or treasuries of providence . . . from whence [God] kindly dispenses . . . those metals and minerals, which have become so indispensable in human life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, 63). He also contends that the mountains afford shelter and defense. And finally, according to Pontoppidan, “these natural fortifications seem also to be an ornament and decoration to the country . . . In this respect our country affords the most delightful contrasts in the diversity of its prospects. And these most magnificent structures of the great architect of nature, raise and animate the mind of man, by inspiring him with the most agreeable and the most sublime sentiments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, 64).</p>
<p>Nature is in this text made for the benefit of man, it is beautiful, and provides people with happiness and joy. One can deduce how wisely everything is made from studying the fish in the sea. The fish that naturally breed below the North Pole, “seem instigated by the Creator to come forth into the wide ocean for the service of mankind, and as soon as that happens, toward the end of the year, the Whale, and his associates … stand ready to execute God’s decree, which is to hunt and terrify these small Fish, and to send them where they are wanted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, II: 103).</p>
<p>Pontoppidan’s natural history is thus a book about God’s creation, written to praise God and to prove his existence, and executed with the aid of reason and empirical investigation. This strictly Christian universe signifies a nature that is perfectly planned and harmonious. The mastermind behind it ensures both its benevolence and its rationality. In importing a law-abiding Newtonian nature as popularized in England to Norwegian territory, Pontoppidan’s book does astonishingly well, secured as the theory is by the uniformity of nature. Nevertheless, it is striking how the universal is translated into the specific Norwegian nature, allowing for a description of this particular part of God’s nature which proves to be just as good proof of God’s might as more cultivated landscapes of Europe. Divination works everywhere, and Pontoppidan manages to insert religious value into the barren Norwegian cliffs and the icy North Pole. This was in fact quite an accomplishment, hinging on the possibility of literally transposing English clergymen’s praise of the mountains onto other territories. This transposition was secured by the God who seems to be the same everywhere.</p>

<sec id="section5-0162243912439759">
<title>The Marketplace</title>
<p>Pontoppidan also offered his book to the market. This market focused on a specific commodity, namely natural history books. The emerging public sphere, in the form of an arena for the exchange of words, was a prerequisite for the flourishing natural historical book market. This book production was also connected to a market for collecting, exchanging, and talking about natural historical objects. Natural history was not an institutionalized discipline in Denmark-Norway as in most other European countries (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912439759">Allen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7a-0162243912439759">Cooper 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243912439759">Sparry 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243912439759">2000</xref>). Instead, natural history was a sport for those who had their means of living from other sources. Pontoppidan was part of a network of people who used their time to collect curiosities and natural objects, and the book market was tightly interwoven with trade in natural objects. Objects that used to have places of honor in the cabinets of curiosities of princes and nobles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were now becoming part of a broader bourgeois and upper-class culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243912439759">Smith and Findlen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912439759">Pomian 1990</xref>). Rare and unknown objects were pouring in from the New World, while native European treasures were also increasingly collected for both their exchange and exhibitionary value. This was a strongly commercialized culture, and the objects were admired as much for their high price as for their natural characteristics. Pontoppidan addressed this market on several occasions, as when he mentions the high price of the unicorn horn (before it was determined that it actually was a narwhale’s tusk). He also tells readers about the serpent, a young dragon with seven heads and necks, thick body and four legs, which he once saw in Hamburg. The price of this object, in its time plundered from Prague, was <italic>considerable </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, II: 37-38). This young dragon was known by naturalists throughout Europe as one of the last fabricated and fantastic animals considered real; significantly its price was its most important claim to fame (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243912439759">Findlen 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon leaving Copenhagen for Norway in 1748, Pontoppidan had sold half of his library as well as his manuscripts, natural objects, prints, and antiquities, which earned him a considerable sum of money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243912439759">Neiiendam 1930</xref>-1933, 142). In Norway, his collection soon increased again. In <italic>The Natural History of Norway,</italic> he stated that in his study he had a small collection “of naturals of Norway, such as stones, ores, fossils, sea-trees, corals, snails, muscles, uncommon birds, fishes, and the like” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: xvii). New objects were collected on his visitation journeys or sent by clergymen and correspondents from different parts of Norway. Pontoppidan obviously found his position as a superintendent of the Church useful for gaining access to curiosities from his diocese: a bishop was a receiver in a network of gifts—historically these were natural goods for his kitchen, now they were specimens for his cabinet (for the ways bishops could become collectors and naturalists through their church networks see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243912439759">Andersen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8a-0162243912439759">Brenna 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The market for books on natural history was also burgeoning around the mid-eighteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912439759">Allen 2001</xref>). To sell broadly, the books needed to have illustrations and they had to be written in the vernacular. Pontoppidan’s work was a book for this market, as it was written in Danish at a time when Latin and German were the languages of the learned community and Danish was the predominant language for religious books in Denmark-Norway. Pontoppidan’s text also addressed, however, an audience beyond the borders of the kingdom. Soon after its publication in Copenhagen, the book was published in both English and German. Pontoppidan addressed this foreign public, “I have endeavoured to rectify the erroneous idea which many, even among the learned, have, for want of better information, formed of several, in themselves very wonderful natural phænomena, here in Norway; such as a bottomless sea-abyss growing in the Moskoe-strom, penetrating quite thro’ the globe; of ducks growing on trees . . . and many other such things, which, some who have had no opportunity of enquiring further, or others who were not disposed to it, have received as undoubted facts. The reader will meet with many strange, singular, and unexpected things, here, but all of them strictly true. . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: vi).</p>
<p>While Pontoppidan had an ambition to tell the truth, he neither could nor would make Norway too common and plain. Instead, he retold the histories of those wonderful and strange phenomena and theories that earlier authors had brought forward (e.g., that Scylla and Charybdis were actually located in the north of Norway). After presenting pages of curious stories, he would conclude that they were not to be trusted; in this way he managed both to tell appealing stories and to challenge mythical images of Norway.</p>
<p>Pontoppidan’s work addresses an audience with money to buy illustrated and bound volumes for pleasurable reading. There is, however, no reason to conclude that Pontoppidan wrote his natural history for financial reasons. Yet his ability to draw on cultures of collecting, on natural histories and a craze for curiosities and the exotic was a prerequisite for getting the book published and translated into foreign languages. Pontoppidan’s book was instrumental in creating and opening up this market of the rare, the strange, and the exotic, where strange facts from Norwegian nature would be welcomed. Nature as related by Pontoppidan became a collectable rarity, a pleasurable pastime, and a treasure house of stories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162243912439759">
<title>The Republic of Letters</title>
<p>Finally, Pontoppidan published a book that expressed a strong conviction about the necessity, utility, and desirability of improving “natural knowledge,” a term which for him could encompass both natural philosophy and natural history. By arguing with notable academics and natural philosophers such as Newton, Descartes, and Leibniz, as well as a host of lesser known scholars, Pontoppidan’s text inserts itself into what he called the Republic of Letters, which was his term to denote a European-wide community of learned men. Our concern here is not whether this community upheld their ideals or whether it actually constituted a community; what is of importance is how Pontoppidan addresses a learned public which he assumes could appreciate the breadth of his learning, the novelty of his reports, the order of his thoughts, and the strength of his arguments. As stated on the title page, the book was “Interspersed with Physiological Notes from eminent Writers, and Transactions of Academies.” The awkwardness of this sentence aside, the author is clearly indicating here that he was a man who was knowledgeable about the books, most important journals, and debates in the community of the learned.</p>
<p>Like most other natural histories of the period, Pontoppidan’s was a natural history which heralded experience, improvements in knowledge, and enlightenment. Regardless of their differences, natural historians observed, described, and classified the visible world, paying particular attention to qualities such as color and form. It was this league of scholars to whom Pontoppidan addressed his text and footnotes. He emphasized recent progress in knowledge: “[T]he present times are blest with the happy advantage of all the important discoveries made in natural philosophy, since the commencement of this century, which are superior in number and merit to those of many preceding ages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: 3). “Improvement” was a key word in his portrayal of knowledge. In his view, the main contributors to the improvement of knowledge were learned societies, which also were responsible for communicating and making knowledge publicly available. Pontoppidan himself was among the founding fathers of the Danish Society of Sciences in Copenhagen in 1742, and he had published widely on Church history, and on antiquarianism, in addition to his devotional writings. These writings voiced his desire to communicate knowledge, to make knowledge travel, and to enlighten others. In an absolutist monarchy with a strict censorship, this bishop also insisted: “let no one imagine that a difference of opinion, decently delivered, will give me any offence, or trouble; the discovery of truth, is in this and every other respect, my chief end” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: xi). This is a statement which is hard to accept at face value. On two occasions, it was publicly known that Pontoppidan was willing to use his strong connections to the court to stop others from writing critically about his work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243912439759">Brenna 2009</xref>). In principle, however, this book was engaged in a free exchange of ideas and was open to critique. Pontoppidan suggested that thoughts and facts should be announced in the public realm and put on trial, which would lead to progress.</p>
<p>As a contribution to the field of natural knowledge, the purpose of the book was not to tell fables or excite the admiration of the reader, but rather to correct misconceptions and contribute to the coming of a new age. “I live in an age,” Pontoppidan states, “which not content with mere hypotheses, unsupported by proofs, requires that every fact or position, which is advanced as real, be at least demonstrated possible, and consonant to the nature of the things in question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>, I: xi). One significant problem was how to relate to the testimonies of others. It was impossible to rely wholly on one’s own experiences, even for Pontoppidan who traveled widely on his visitation journeys. Criteria for deciding whom to trust had to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912439759">Withers 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243912439759">Shapin 1994</xref>). Pontoppidan’s method was connected to his pietistic Lutheran insistence on the rationality of all humans. In Pontoppidan’s insistence that everyone could and should read the book of nature, one can hear an echo of the proclamation that everyone could and should read the Bible. However, there are differences between people’s knowledges, and the practice of establishing knowledge had to be adjusted to this. While his role as a bishop brought him into contact with the common people, and he appreciated the information they conveyed to him, these common people were not in themselves authoritative when it came to establishing facts about nature. “Their answers to my several questions, I afterwards examine with the ministers of the parishes, or some other person well acquainted with the country, and whatever I hear confirmed by several testimonies, or not controverted, or doubted of, I enter among my miscellaneous observations, and, at my return home, compare them with the descriptions of such countries, especially the mountaineous, or which are in any other respect analogous to Norway” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912439759">Withers 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243912439759">Shapin 1994</xref>). The last method of establishing the truth that Pontoppidan applies is based on reference to the natural objects in his own collection; they could furnish the reader with a visual record that was a warrant for truth.</p>
<p>As he evaluated his sources and thoroughly described the steps he followed in establishing knowledge, Pontoppidan thus proved to be a good man of knowledge. At certain times, however, stronger authorizations were necessary. The most circumstantial of these were to be found in the chapter on certain <italic>monstris marinis</italic>, or strange and uncommon sea animals (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>: II, Chapter VIII). Here Pontoppidan treads on uncertain ground, as he knew that his reputation as a natural historian might easily be destroyed when he insisted on the existence of these animals. By the mid-eighteenth century, many of the strange beings that had straddled earlier natural histories had been established as fanciful inventions and fables. One cannot be too incredulous, Pontoppidan states, also noting the danger of ignoring the truth by refusing to believe something unexpected or unusual when it is actually probable according to the laws of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>: II, 185). As Daston and Park note, as early as the end of the seventeenth century it had become the norm to include a new criterion for authentication in addition to the traditional and legalistic, namely the probability of the observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243912439759">Daston and Park 1998</xref>). This approach is also the most important tool for Pontoppidan in his discussion on the strange sea creatures, when he asks if it plausible that these seamen exist. His answer is yes, based on the fact that there are many creatures on land which have their parallel in the sea, such as sea horses, sea cows, and sea wolves. Since there are human-like animals on land, such as monkeys and “orangutans,” it is just as possible that they will exist in the sea.</p>
<p>Throughout his work, Pontoppidan thus negotiates the truths of nature. A crucial question is how he can ascertain the truth of his versions of nature. Through his “method,” that is, his way of reading, interrogating witnesses, and collecting natural objects as means of authentication, he established ways of convincing his readers of the veracity of his account. The work was directed to a learned and curious public that he invited to correct and expand upon the observations he had made. His authority also rested, however, upon his connection to God and the king, and these connections also helped ensure the authority of the text. As the Danish title indicates, the first natural history of Norway provides us with a trustworthy account of Norwegian nature because the well-connected Pontoppidan wrote it. But what is this nature?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162243912439759">
<title>Tensions among Natures</title>
<p>I started by asking whether we could say that the different contexts this work makes for itself also imply the enactment of different natures and whether nature was done in different ways. What I have been trying to show is that the book seems to enact a nature of the king, of God, of the marketplace, and the Republic of Letters. I have identified four narratives of nature that have connected Pontoppidan’s text to the different audiences it addresses. I have claimed that we encounter nature as a national entity and an economic resource. The king and his subjects can use this nature to produce food, to find export goods, and secure incomes. Nature is useful as a geographical and physical unit, which is united already in the title: the natural history of Norway. What are the relations to the nature of God? The economy of nature is an important part of the religious enactment of it. The divine economy of nature and the economic government of the king are so to say created for each other. Natural harmony and divine order were part and parcel of enlightened government of the territory, as Pontoppidan’s natural history sets out. That does not mean that they are necessarily the same. Divine harmony pertains to a nature created to perform certain tasks to fulfill God’s plans; it is directed toward a future, and it is also dependent on a source of action that one cannot know—the path of God is unknowable. The king’s plans were of course not public; still, the work of Pontoppidan alongside other economic treatises published during the 1750s was to lay the foundation for a rational government in which the resources were known and the kinds of actions necessary to utilize them were public. A rational nature was thus promoted by Pontoppidan’s book along with and intertwined with a nature which functioned as a sacred machine whose engine could not and should not ever be known.</p>
<p>The nature which Pontoppidan brought to the marketplace as a commodity is not necessarily opposed to these other natures. As a commodity, an account of natural history should be entertaining, and Pontoppidan’s stories indicate his desire to entertain. This nature thus attracts the attention of those with a sense for the bizarre and unexpected. Nature becomes an exotic asset of Norway, and this would of course give more return in a market for natural history as a commodity wrapped in paper or as curious specimens. Indeed, it would not be possible to enact a too oppositional nature within the rules of censorship, as the natures which were described by “atheists, deists, and materialists” were banned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162243912439759">3</xref>
</sup> Nonetheless, strange phenomena abounded on the pages of Pontoppidan’s work. They could be known rationally, but they were presented and reflected upon to a degree that was obviously important for making this an “entertaining”—to use his own words—piece of work. Delight was not only to be had by delving into the harmony of things ordinary, but by being told stories that could evoke sentiments—the bears tearing out baby boys from the wombs of females, the Kraken, a sea animal the size of an island, and swallows resting on the bottom of lakes. He fills pages with what he himself believes are fanciful descriptions of the phenomena. He might do this to correct erroneous beliefs about the nature of Norway, as he states, but the number of pages he uses for the descriptions belies this. This last point is important—that the exoticism involved also participates in an identification of a territory delineated as Norwegian.</p>
<p>The sciences, <italic>Videnskaberne</italic> in the broad German–Scandinavian sense of the term, enact nature differently. In terms of a natural history that addresses the Republic of Letters, Pontoppidan’s work reveals a strong desire to identify with a field of knowledge that is concerned with nature as an object of systematic investigation. Things are ordered in ways that are not always in accordance with the latest methods within the different fields, plants according to the alphabet, for example, a rather crude categorization system. However, this does not mean that Pontoppidan disapproves of or is unaware of other systems of classification. The chapters on animals are introduced with a discussion on different classification methods, where Linnaeus and Buffon are his main sources, and Pontoppidan chooses, as he claims Buffon does, to classify the animals according to their usefulness to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912439759">Pontoppidan 1755</xref>: II, 1-2). The book thus plays out a natural order that is open to different approaches and that can be ordered in a philosophical way, not always according to human usefulness, even if that is what it most often ends up being. Nonetheless, the emphasis on discussing and formulating different approaches shows his allegiance to rational discussion.</p>
<p>The tension between this nature and the marketplace nature is striking: whereas the curious stories tell of how people practice nature, how they live with and off nature, this science-nature is analytical in the sense that it divides the natural into different departments, into species, sorts, kinds, and things. This is a different nature from the utility-nature which is involved in the king’s government. There the fishing gear is more important than the color of the fish, the mining machines more important than the name of the minerals. Both the marketplace and the king are served a nature where humans, animals, and matter are interwoven and intertwined in histories that make them unthinkable without each other.</p>
<p>One effect of the many natures is that the book could serve different communities; it had an important <italic>Wirkungsgeschichte</italic> in varied realms. A genre of topographical literature which described in detail different places and regions of the country came into being in the wake of Pontoppidan’s natural historical work, and in this genre Pontoppidan’s book was to have a huge influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243912439759">Supphellen 1979</xref>). This genre was used by local state employees to prove their usefulness as citizens of the state and to help pave their way to promotion by the king (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243912439759">Supphellen 1979</xref>). Pontoppidan’s book also served as a travel guide for gentleman explorer–tourists of Norway well into the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243912439759">Clarke 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243912439759">Coxe 1975</xref>). The fact that it was available in English made for its international fame, as did its descriptions of curious animals. After having inspired sea monster poetry and fiction in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pontoppidan’s work is still cited as the first scientific description of sea monsters. In the Republic of Letters, the book made a name for Pontoppidan. Even if he was never proclaimed a great naturalist, Pontoppidan was recognized as the first to describe a number of birds, as for example the common guillemot. Theologically, other books by Pontoppidan, such as his Catechism from 1737 (still reprinted) and his textbook for holding sermons from 1757 (<italic>Collegium Pastorale Practicum</italic>), would have a much greater impact than his physico-theological approach. Yet within all these fields of knowledge, the various natures of Pontoppidan can be discerned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0162243912439759">
<title>Conclusions, Contexts, and Natures</title>
<p>Why these contexts? Why these natures? Historians of science often work to establish why one object comes into being, or rather they insist on the historical contingency of one particular object. Versions of actor-network theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243912439759">Law 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243912439759">Mol 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243912439759">Moser 2003</xref>) insist on the possibility of the simultaneous existence of more than one version of an object, which has inspired me to look for more than one nature enacted on the pages of Pontoppidan’s book. This approach depends on an openness to there being more than one context for the work. Talking about more than one nature and more than one context could be viewed as a cheap trick for not deciding which aspect of the social, political, and cultural context of Pontoppidan’s work is important—and what nature was made to be. There are, however, strong reasons for insisting on more than one fabric, on threads that do not always make up discernible patterns and that do not always come together in the same fabric, even if they are there in the same book. The reason for this strategy relates to the complexity of historical change. Like the cherished genre of “period rooms” in museums, a “period culture” or a “period nature” would be static and ghostlike. A “period room” represents one version of how a culture might look like at one particular time in history. Works of art, furniture, household utensils, and architecture are assembled in the one, accepted version of a culture’s way of life. While period rooms can be good pedagogic tools for conveying a sense of how things once were different from today, they are less useful for providing an understanding of the complexities of culture, nature, human–nature relationships, and of how historical changes come about. Identifying different enactments of nature is not a means of explaining change, but this is a way of showing that what nature is connected to is vital for understanding what it is and how it may change. Although these connections may be multifaceted and difficult to discern, they may appear literally in the same work.</p>
<p>The tools I have used to establish Pontoppidan’s natures are four narratives where the audiences that were addressed provide the connections to the contexts which are viewed as important. My claim is that an analysis which stresses different types of connections draws attention to the power relations involved in describing nature. The different contexts that enact natures in Pontoppidan’s book are fraught with power: the power of the king, the literati, religion, and the marketplace. My attempt to disentangle these contexts and the way natures are enacted differently in relation to them is also a way of highlighting the contested nature of nature. Pontoppidan’s book enacts nature in different ways that do not always fit easily together, and the ways they do not fit have been important for later versions of Norwegian nature. Insisting that these natures are not one, but many, also opens for the possibility of understanding the different contexts that made some natures politically powerful, while others were relegated to different territories inhabited by, for example, women, farmers, bears, and sea serpents. These territories and creatures are all there in Pontoppidan’s text, but their territories are made exotic or marginal in later versions of these natures.</p>

<p>The Danish volumes appeared in 1752 and 1753, the English and German translations in 1755. In this article, I will refer to the English 1755 edition, which accounts for the awkwardness of some of the English spelling and vocabulary in my quotes. As the English version is a text of two volumes in one book I will refer to them as I and II.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan’s Visitation Protocols are in The National Archives Central Office in Oslo, material related to his stay in Bergen is found in The Regional State Archives in Bergen, and further documents are found in the Manuscript Department at the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. The best account of his life and work is Neiiendam 1930-1933, a two-volume biography.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan was exempted from censorship as a bishop of Bergen, which meant that he would not need an <italic>imprimateur</italic> from the University in Copenhagen. This was of course contingent on his ability to perform self-censorship.</p>
