<p>In our postmodern times, one common lament from theologians concerns the low theological literacy of lay Christians. Of them all, the biggest may be that of the Trinity. The subject is of utmost importance for defining Christian orthodoxy, yet its understanding and relevance for most believers seldom goes beyond affirming that ‘God is one, yet exists in three persons’. Perhaps some fault may lie in the way that most theologians have explained the Trinity in systematic or abstract terms such as perichoresis, filioque, and so on.</p>
<p>Damon So, however, takes a unique approach, by narration, of a running commentary of the Gospels, to show how the Triune Godhead is revealed in the Son ‘who holds the promise of delivering people from their plight’ (p. 9) of war, starvation, sickness, poverty, etc. By understanding the life and works of Jesus in the context of the Trinity, ‘readers may catch a glimpse of the unique person of Jesus Christ . . . and so come to a trusting knowledge of his Father, who provides the ultimate security and foundation for living a life of freedom, peace and inter-personal love’ (p. 9).</p>
<p>The Forgotten Jesus comprises six chapters – an introduction, followed by sections on Jesus’ manifesto of liberation at Nazareth (chapter 2), his liberating teachings (chapter 3), the radical, unconditional love of God in action to liberate (chapter 4), Jesus’ journey with needy humanity to the end (chapter 5) and the Trinity, the Kingdom of God and human society (chapter 6). Several appendices conclude the book on aspects of Jesus’ lordship, servanthood, suffering, love, perseverance and resurrection.</p>
<p>The book discusses many existential concerns that beset humanity and how they are engaged by God’s mission in the Son’s radical obedience to the Father, led by the Spirit. For example, a model for a stable personhood and self is rooted in Jesus’ perfect obedience in his contentment as the Son of God with respect to the Father’s love (pp. 131, 140–141). Because Jesus’ being and personhood is intertwined with others in the Godhead, humans should anchor their self-identity as beings-in-relation to God first. When people recognize that they are first loved by God in their personal selves and find identity with other beings-in-relation in the Godhead, it leads to a doing that flows from a stable being that is content in one’s own personal identity.</p>
<p>So’s triune God loves, bears and suffers with the pain, suffering, evil and injustice of humanity. He is a God who incarnates himself through Jesus. By dwelling among us and identifying with us to show the Father’s love, Jesus reveals the true heart of the Trinity. However, it was an identification that did not corrupt him towards sin. Rather, Jesus confronted individual and structural sins. Here the Trinity in action is found in the life of Jesus attacking systematic sins of his society, in prayer and trust in the Spirit to direct him to people or power structures (p. 221). Through this, one sees that the entire Godhead is with us and for us through Jesus who shows this in our existential concerns (pp. 112, 168).</p>
<p>The book has many strengths. A narrative approach of the Trinity through Jesus’ life is a creative contribution to trinitarian studies that deserves praise. It is reader-friendly to lay persons; footnotes are sparing and used mainly to explain background items. Absent are many academic prose that may intimidate. So’s background as an NT scholar also shines when providing insights such as Bethlehem’s demographics during Jesus’ birth (p. 113), the marginal social status of shepherds (p. 110), women and children (p. 91) or the social significance of John’s water baptism (pp. 118, 122).</p>
<p>Many important aspects of the Trinity such as perichoresis (p. 120), unity and diversity in the Godhead (p. 135), hierarchy and equality of personhood (pp. 225–226), community and individuality (p. 227) are unpacked through the lens of Jesus’ life. However, the implication of the filioque and subordinationism in human relationships is hardly treated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265378812451093">1</xref></sup> In light of So’s emphasis on the Trinity to engage social issues such as broken relationships, disease, famine, war, etc., the issue of power relationships between genders requires more elaboration than their brief mentions on pages 220 and 224.</p>
<p>The book’s chapter headings are a nod to Leonardo Boff, Jürgen Moltmann and John Zizioulas’ ideas. For readers whose appetite has been whetted towards more serious treatises on the Trinity, an annotated bibliography of such writers and others on trinitarian readings would have been beneficial. Alternatively, one can consult So’s earlier academic monograph, <italic>Jesus’ Revelation of His Father: A narrative-conceptual study of the Trinity</italic> with special reference to Karl Barth, where many academic references can be found.</p>
<p>To this reader, So’s running commentary at times seems long in reading. For lay audiences, smaller bite-sized portions, more personal stories and illustrations would have made the book less academic given its purpose. Another book on the Trinity, Stephen Seamands’ In the Image of God accommodates itself better to lay readers in this way. As it stands, The Forgotten Jesus resembles more of an academic-lite text.</p>
<p>However it is viewed, the book reminds us that Jesus did not just do ministry alone, but in deep koinonia with the Father and Spirit – a salutary reminder that God desires not lone rangers in ministry, but as a communion of loving persons in engagement with a fragmented, postmodern and broken world we live in.</p>
