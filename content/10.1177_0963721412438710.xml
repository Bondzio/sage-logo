<abstract>
<p>Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with a wide array of poor health outcomes. Nonetheless, some low-SES individuals maintain good physical health despite facing recurrent, severe adversities in life. This article describes a “shift-and-persist” model that explains why that is. The model states that in the midst of adversity, some low-SES children find role models who teach them to trust others, to better regulate their emotions, and to focus on their futures. Over a lifetime, these low-SES individuals may develop an approach to life that prioritizes <italic>shifting</italic> (accepting stress for what it is and adapting oneself to it) in combination with <italic>persisting</italic> (enduring life challenges by holding on to meaning and optimism). This combination of shifting and persisting strategies mitigates physiological responses to the barrage of stressors confronted by low-SES individuals and forestalls pathogenic sequelae that lead to chronic disease. Identifying health-relevant protective qualities that naturally occur in some low-SES individuals represents one important approach for improving the health of those who confront a lifetime of disadvantages.</p>

<p>One of the most pervasive and striking social factors to influence physical health is low socioeconomic status (SES). For example, by age 25, individuals from the lowest SES group are expected to live 6 years less than those from the highest SES group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721412438710">Braveman, Cubbin, Egerter, Williams, &amp; Pamuk, 2010</xref>). The effects of low SES persist across a variety of diseases and countries (both with and without universal health care; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963721412438710">Adler, Boyce, Chesney, Folkman, &amp; Syme, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721412438710">Chen, Matthews, &amp; Boyce, 2002</xref>). Differences by SES in health outcomes—termed <italic>health disparities</italic>—have become a topic of widespread concern among practitioners, policy makers, and scientists alike. For example, Healthy People 2020, a statement of national health objectives developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, lists the elimination of health disparities as one of its overarching goals (www .healthypeople.gov). And in 2000, an act of the U.S. Congress established a new center at the National Institutes of Health charged with developing a plan to eliminate health disparities through scientific research.</p>
<p>Research has documented a variety of factors that contribute to health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963721412438710">Adler &amp; Rehkopf, 2008</xref>). These include both psychosocial factors, such as stress, negative emotions, and poor health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963721412438710">Adler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963721412438710">Matthews, Gallo, &amp; Taylor, 2010</xref>), and physical environmental factors, such as neighborhood built environments (e.g., environments without spaces for walking or exercise) and environmental exposures (e.g., to pollutants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963721412438710">Diez Roux &amp; Mair, 2010</xref>) that are both detrimental to health and more common in low-SES environments than in high-SES environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721412438710">Evans, 2004</xref>). In addition, researchers have documented that the factors that contribute to health disparities occur not only at the individual level (e.g., psychological perceptions of lack of control; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963721412438710">Marmot, Bosma, Hemingway, Brunner, &amp; Stansfeld, 1997</xref>), but also at the level of the family (e.g., conflictual family environments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963721412438710">Repetti, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2002</xref>) and the neighborhood (e.g., exposure to violence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963721412438710">Wright &amp; Steinbach, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>And yet, despite this extensive research, eliminating health disparities has proven to be an intractable problem thus far. Why might this be? One reason might be that, for a variety of economic and political reasons, it has been difficult to provide low-SES families with the resources and skills necessary to ameliorate these adverse social and environmental conditions. An alternative approach would be to start by identifying low-SES individuals who exhibit good health outcomes and to ask why these individuals are able to stay healthy despite facing ongoing adversity. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the investigation of factors that already exist and are protective within a subgroup of low-SES individuals and that might, in theory, be protective for other low-SES individuals. In the remainder of this article, I describe the basis of such an approach and the evidence supporting it.</p>
<sec id="section1-0963721412438710">
<title>Resilience</title>
<p>The question of why some individuals do not get sick despite facing persistent and severe adversity is an intriguing one. This type of thriving has been labeled by other researchers as <italic>resilience</italic>—that is, adaptation in the presence of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963721412438710">Masten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963721412438710">Masten et al., 1988</xref>). In the developmental-psychopathology literature, a vast history of research has identified key factors at the level of the individual child (e.g., temperament, cognitive ability), the family (e.g., parental warmth, parents’ mental health), and the neighborhood (e.g., positive school environments) that buffer children facing adversity from behavioral problems and academic failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963721412438710">Luthar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963721412438710">Rutter, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963721412438710">Werner, 1995</xref>). In addition, there is a second source of resilience literature that focuses on factors that promote adaptation to traumatic or life-threatening events (e.g., cancer, terrorist attacks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963721412438710">Bonanno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963721412438710">Taylor, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>However, much of this literature has focused on psychological adaptation rather than the physical health consequences of adversity. When considering physical health outcomes, it is important to identify psychological characteristics that may influence physiological systems that have implications for disease. For example, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) become activated in response to many different types of stressors, releasing hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Repeated, prolonged exposure to these hormones can give rise to longer-term pathogenic processes, such as systemic inflammation and high blood pressure, that drive a variety of chronic diseases associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963721412438710">Schneiderman, Ironson, &amp; Siegel, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Shift-and-Persist Characteristics</title>
<p>What, then, are the psychological characteristics that can buffer low-SES individuals from detrimental health outcomes? In a recent theoretical paper, my colleague and I proposed that a constellation of characteristics we labeled “shift and persist” are particularly beneficial and presented preliminary evidence for this new model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721412438710">Chen &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963721412438710">Table 1</xref> for a summary of the key components of shift and persist. A lifetime of facing adversity with limited options leads those living in low-SES conditions to value the ability to adjust oneself in response to stressors through the use of emotion-regulation strategies such as reappraisals (<italic>shifting</italic>). At the same time, successful adaptation in this context entails enduring adversity with strength, finding meaning in difficult situations, and maintaining optimism in the face of adversity (<italic>persisting</italic>). This combination of approaches to dealing with adversity acutely reduces physiological responses to stressful situations and, over the long term, mitigates the progression of pathogenic processes leading to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Shifting involves adjusting oneself to the external environment—for instance, by reframing the meaning of a stressor so that it is perceived as being less threatening. Coping via efforts to regulate the self may be beneficial for low-SES individuals because it represents a good fit with the types of situations they often encounter. Empirical research has shown that when low-SES individuals make active efforts to control situations—the opposite of shifting—a physiological toll is exacted. For example, low-SES adults who are high on John Henryism (the tendency to use active coping efforts to deal with stressors that are largely uncontrollable) have higher blood pressure and a higher risk of hypertension than do low-SES individuals who are low on John Henryism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963721412438710">James, Strogatz, Wing, &amp; Ramsey, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>In one study, adults who were low in SES but high in perceived control were found to have profiles of self-reported health, acute health symptoms, and functional limitations that were similar to those of high-SES individuals and better than those of low-SES individuals with low perceived control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963721412438710">Lachman &amp; Weaver, 1998</xref>). Although this study did not distinguish between control in the form of efforts to control oneself and in the form of efforts to control one’s external environment, its patterns of results are consistent with the notion that certain types of control strategies can be beneficial for low-SES individuals.</p>
<p>Persisting involves enduring adversity with strength by finding meaning in difficult situations and maintaining optimism about the future. The search for meaning allows people to maintain hope, particularly when confronting adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963721412438710">Updegraff, Silver, &amp; Holman, 2008</xref>). Moreover, it has been found to have implications for health. For example, among individuals low in SES, higher purpose in life (which is similar to meaning in life) was associated with lower levels of IL-6, a marker of systemic inflammation that has been linked to cardiovascular disease. By contrast, purpose in life was not associated with IL-6 in high-SES adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963721412438710">Morozink, Friedman, Coe, &amp; Ryff, 2010</xref>). A similar pattern was found with respect to optimism about the future. Low-SES individuals with high levels of pessimism (in other words, low optimism) had higher ambulatory blood pressure and a higher likelihood of hypertension than did low-SES individuals with low levels of pessimism or high-SES individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721412438710">Grewen et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0963721412438710">
<title>Is the Combination of Shifting and Persisting Important for Health?</title>
<p>My colleagues and I argue that it is not the just one of these strategies in isolation but rather their combination that is critical—that is, for low-SES individuals, an approach that combines shifting oneself in response to stress with persisting with hopes for one’s future is more beneficial for physiological responses to stress than is either strategy on its own. This is because shift and persist is postulated to represent a good fit with the environmental constraints that often affect those low in SES. In contrast, among high-SES individuals, proactive coping efforts that are aimed at eliminating stressors may be more effective, given that high-SES individuals possess greater resources, on average than low-SES individuals do. Hence we use the label “shift and persist” to connote the fact that it is the combination of these strategies, rather than either one on its own, that is uniquely beneficial to health among those low in SES; moreover, this label serves to differentiate the shift-and-persist model from other theories that concern shifting or persisting but do not address the combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963721412438710">Ewart &amp; Jorgensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963721412438710">Heckhausen, Wrosch, &amp; Schulz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In two studies, we documented disease-related benefits of shift-and-persist strategies for individuals low in SES. In the first study, the childhood circumstances of a national sample of adults were assessed. We created an index of cumulative physiological risk (<italic>allostatic load</italic>) based on 24 different measures of risk across seven physiological systems. The use of shift-and-persist strategies (measured with questionnaires probing coping styles and future orientation) interacted to predict allostatic load among adults from low-childhood-SES backgrounds. Among these individuals, the combination of high levels of shifting and high levels of persisting was associated with the lowest allostatic-load scores. In contrast, there was no association between shift and persist and allostatic load among those from high-childhood-SES backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963721412438710">Chen, Miller, Lachman, Gruenewald, &amp; Seeman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In a second study, we investigated the effects of shift-and-persist characteristics in a clinical sample of children diagnosed with asthma. Among those low in SES, higher shift-and-persist scores were associated with lower levels of asthma inflammation. In addition, among low-SES children, higher shift-and-persist scores prospectively predicted less asthma-related impairment (i.e., fewer school absences, less rescue-inhaler use) six months later, controlling for baseline asthma-related impairment. In fact, low-SES children with high shift-and-persist scores displayed inflammatory and clinical profiles that were more similar to those of high-SES children than they were to low-SES children with low shift-and-persist scores. In contrast, shift and persist did not benefit high-SES children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963721412438710">Chen, Strunk, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the literature described above demonstrates that shift-and-persist strategies may ameliorate chronic-disease risk among low-SES individuals by delaying longer-term pathogenic processes such as allostatic load, as well as by improving clinically relevant disease outcomes. In contrast, no benefits of shift-and-persist strategies have been found among high-SES individuals.</p>

<title>Developmental Origins of Shift and Persist</title>
<p>Having described a set of strategies that help low-SES individuals to remain physically healthy under adverse circumstances, I next turn to the question of where these traits arise from. In particular, given the persistent day-to-day difficulties they face, why are some low-SES individuals better able to positively appraise stressful situations and find meaning in adversity than others?</p>
<p>My colleagues and I propose that the key to the development of shift-and-persist strategies early in life is the presence of role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721412438710">Chen &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>). In the midst of difficult life circumstances, role models allow low-SES children to develop the belief that other people can be trustworthy and dependable, which in turn shapes reappraisals of stressful situations. Role models also model adaptive emotional and behavioral responses to stressors, thereby teaching effective emotion-regulation strategies to children. Finally, they help orient youth toward their futures by promoting optimism and the search for meaning. A role model can be any individual who has a stable, regular presence in a child’s life and who serves as an attachment figure for that child (e.g., a parent, extended family member, or teacher).</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that the qualities role models provide to children—attachment and positive caregiving experiences—buffer against the physiological consequences of stress. For example, infants who are securely attached are less likely to show elevations in hormones such as cortisol during times of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963721412438710">Gunnar &amp; Donzella, 2002</xref>). Similarly, when children experience high maternal warmth, they do not exhibit the typical effects of poverty on allostatic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963721412438710">Evans, Kim, Ting, Tesher, &amp; Shannis, 2007</xref>). Children in foster care who had been maltreated and whose foster parents were taught positive parenting skills exhibited greater declines in cortisol than did maltreated children in foster care whose foster parents did not participate in the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963721412438710">Fisher, Gunnar, Chamberlain, &amp; Reid, 2000</xref>). Moreover, adults who grew up in low-SES households but experienced high levels of maternal warmth in childhood displayed reduced proinflammatory signaling patterns at the genomic level and decreased inflammatory responses following microbial challenge as adults, compared with those grew up in low-SES households with low maternal warmth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963721412438710">Chen, Miller, Kobor, &amp; Cole, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In one recent study, My colleagues and I conducted interviews about role models with healthy adolescents and assessed their SES, use of shift-and-persist strategies, and indicators of cardiovascular risk (i.e., systemic inflammation and cholesterol levels). To the extent that low-SES adolescents reported having role models who provided them with support and inspiration, their engagement of shift-and-persist strategies increased. High-SES adolescents showed no such pattern. In addition, among low-SES adolescents only, greater engagement of shift-and-persist strategies was associated with lower levels of IL-6 and lower cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721412438710">Chen, Lee, Cavey, Ho, &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the studies discussed above provide some intriguing findings suggesting that role models can diminish the effects of childhood adversity on pathogenic mechanisms that may lead to chronic disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963721412438710">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>In this paper, I have focused on one specific kind of life adversity: low SES. However, there are many other types of adversities (e.g., discrimination faced by minority groups, maltreatment in childhood, chronic illness) that are important to understand in their own right. For example, cultural values may lead to differences in the sets of factors that serve protective functions across different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721412438710">Buekens, Notzon, Kotelchuck, &amp; Wilcox, 2000</xref>). Hence, it will be important for future research to study the contributors to physical-health resilience in other groups to determine the extent to which overlapping versus different factors play protective roles.</p>
<p>In addition, it will be important for future research to delve more deeply into the developmental origins of shift and persist. We need a better understanding of when shift and persist develops, and how it evolves, across childhood. Future research is also needed to develop an understanding of the types of developmental contexts that are especially likely to promote shift and persist in children.</p>

<sec id="section6-0963721412438710">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have taken an underutilized approach to understanding health disparities by focusing on factors associated with good physical health in a low-SES context. The research conducted by our research group has demonstrated that for low-SES individuals, whose lives often entail recurrent and uncontrollable stressors, adapting by shifting oneself—accepting stress and engaging in emotion-regulation strategies such as reappraisals—acutely reduces the magnitude of physiological responses to stress and, over the longer term, slows down pathogenic disease processes. In addition, greater persistence—that is, enduring adversity with strength by holding on to meaning and optimism in life—is associated with more favorable cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune profiles among individuals low in SES. Over a lifetime, reductions in physiological responses to acute stressors may slow the progression of pathogenic processes for chronic diseases of aging that low SES normally sets in motion.</p>
<p>Understanding the specific psychosocial qualities that naturally contribute to physiological resilience among low-SES individuals represents one important approach for developing interventions aimed at reducing health disparities. If we can identify characteristics that promote positive physiological profiles and are already present in some low-SES individuals, it is plausible that we will be able to develop interventions to instill these characteristics in other low-SES individuals. While there are a variety of approaches that our society could take in order to reduce health disparities, efforts to promote shift and persist, together with efforts to provide basic resources, may help make a difference in improving the health of those confronting disadvantageous circumstances early in life.</p>
