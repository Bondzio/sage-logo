<abstract>
<p>Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IpsO) is an uncommon and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report a patient with SLE who presented with IpsO and biliary dilatation (megacholedochus). The co-manifestation of these two conditions in SLE is unusual and has been reported only twice previously. The patient responded well to immunosuppressive treatment. IpsO is a rare but recognized manifestation of SLE that may be the presenting manifestation of the systemic disease or occur more commonly during disease course. Early recognition of IpsO is necessary to institute appropriate medical treatment and to avoid inappropriate surgical intervention.</p>

<p>Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IpsO) is deﬁned as ineffective intestinal propulsion that occurs in the absence of mechanical or obstructive factors. Clinical features generally include abdominal distension, pain, nausea, vomiting and constipation with absence of bowel sounds. Radiographic signs show gaseous small bowel distension with air-ﬂuid levels. Most of the cases of IpsO are primary but association with connective-tissue diseases (CTDs) has been seen. Among CTDs, systemic sclerosis is the most common underlying disease. Fewer than 30 cases of IpsO in patients with SLE have been reported in the English literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312464091">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312464091">4</xref></sup> Though IpsO may occur worldwide, most of the cases reported are Asian women. Although two-thirds of the reported IpsO cases are associated with ureterohydronephrosis, association of IpsO and biliary dilatation (megacholedochus) has been described as co-manifesting with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in only two case reports previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312464091">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312464091">6</xref></sup> Herein we report a third case of SLE with concomitant IpsO and biliary dilatation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312464091" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 27-year-old female was admitted two years ago with fever, hemolytic anemia, vasculitic skin ulcers, alopecia and mononeuritis multiplex. SLE was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) positivity (speckled), low C3, C4 and high anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies. Direct Coombs test was positive and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) screen [immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] was negative. Extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) antibodies screen showed anti-Ro positivity. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. She was treated with high-dose steroid, monthly parenteral cyclophosphamide and oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. She went into remission and was initiated on maintenance azathioprine 100 mg daily. Steroid dose was gradually tapered and hydroxychloroquine was continued. She had never had arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss. She remained stable for two years and was in our regular follow-up.</p>
<p>This time, she was admitted with a history of severe colicky abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting and constipation for three days. There was no past history of cholecystitis, abdominal tuberculosis, abdominal surgery or endoscopic intervention. Her current medications were prednisolone 5 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily and azathioprine 100 mg daily. On examination, her vitals were stable; she looked sick but was fully oriented to time, place and person and was afebrile. Abdomen was tense, distended and diffusely tender. Bowel sounds were absent. No organomegaly or lump was felt. Per-rectal examination was unremarkable. There was no malar rash, oral ulcers, alopecia, myositis or arthritis suggestive of lupus activity. Investigations revealed high anti-dsDNA (104.2, normal &lt; 30 IU/ml), low C3 (52.8, normal 60–120 mg/dl) and C4 (11.4, normal 15–30 mg/dl). Her previous values (three months ago) for anti-dsDNA, C3 and C4 were 52.2 IU/ml, 69.8 mg/dl and 15.8 mg/dl, respectively. Her C- reactive protein level was 0.77 mg/dl (normal value &lt; 0.6 mg/dl). Anti-Ro antibody was positive whereas anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) and lupus anticoagulant were negative. Her total leukocyte count was 8900 cells/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312464091">3</xref></sup> with 32% lymphocytes, and platelet count was 2.82 × 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. There was no drop in platelet count as her previous visit platelet count was 2.54 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>. Urine routine and microscopy was normal with negative culture. Serum amylase was normal and potassium was low at 3.1 meq/l (normal 3.5–4.5 meq/l). Her liver function tests (serum albumin: 3.5 g/dl, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT): 48 U/l and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT): 26 U/l) and renal function (serum creatinine: 1.1 mg%) results were normal. X-ray of the abdomen erect and supine showed dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen disclosed dilated loops of the small bowel and thickening of the colon wall. No obvious obstruction could be visualized. Gall bladder was normal; however, dilatation of the biliary tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312464091">Figure 1</xref>) was noted along with minimal free fluid in abdomen. Features of gallstone ileus like air in biliary tract, cholecystenteric fistula, residual gallstone or stone in bowel lumen were not seen.

</fig></p>
<p>Bowel rest was instituted with placement of a nasogastric tube. Hypokalemia was corrected and hydration was maintained with intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition. In consultation with the surgical gastroenterology unit, CT enteroclysis was performed to rule out any obstruction of the small and large bowel. CT enteroclysis showed multiple dilated small bowel loops and diffuse circumferential colonic wall thickening with ‘Target’ appearance. No evidence of mechanical obstruction was seen. Again dilated intrahepatic biliary radicles were seen with presence of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312464091">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312464091">3</xref>). No evidence of any obstructive lesion was seen in the urinary tract. A diagnosis of IpsO was made. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) showed normal pH, ruling out renal tubular acidosis (RTA)-induced hypokalemia leading to paralytic ileus. Considering the clinical profile, dilatation of biliary tract, small bowel and ureter along with high anti-dsDNA, low C3/C4, the final diagnosis was SLE-related IpsO with biliary dilatation. We treated the patient with 500 mg of methylprednisolone pulse for three days. As she developed this complication on 100 mg of azathioprine maintenance, she was started on 500 mg biweekly cyclophosphamide pulse. Her abdominal distention resolved and bowel sounds returned within two days. Her symptoms resolved completely and she was gradually weaned to oral feeds by the next week of admission. Repeat X-ray abdomen erect and flat films showed no dilated loops and no air-fluid levels. She was discharged on 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily.

<p>Gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with SLE are common and occur in 50% of them, but only 2–30% of these are directly attributable to SLE, the rest being side effects of the medication or intercurrent diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312464091">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312464091">8</xref></sup> These include mesenteric vasculitis, pancreatitis, serositis, ischemic bowel disease, protein-losing enteropathy and less commonly motility disorders such as IpsO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312464091">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>IpsO is an uncommon complication of SLE and is characterized by ineffective intestinal propulsion with the presence of clinical features of intestinal obstruction without an identifiable organic obstructive lesion and an abdominal distension with a very sluggish or absent peristalsis. IpsO can be the first manifestation of SLE in some patients but it usually represents a complication, with small case series described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312464091">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312464091">4</xref></sup> It usually coincides with ureterohydronephrosis (reported in 66.7% cases by Mok et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312464091">1</xref></sup>) and/or interstitial cystitis and rarely with biliary dilatation (megacholedochus).</p>
<p>Our patient had biliary tract dilatation in addition to IpsO and ureterohydronephrosis. Biliary dilatation has been described in two cases previously where the diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Biliary dilatation can lead to complications like cholecystitis, cholangitis and generalized sepsis. However, in all three cases, including ours, none of these complications were observed and all three responded to immunosuppressive therapy. We believe that concurrent dilatation of more than one hollow viscera in a patient with SLE should lead to suspicion of generalized autoimmune smooth muscle/enteric nerve injury. Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312464091">6</xref></sup> defined the term generalized megaviscera of lupus (GML), which describes hollow visceral dilatation and dysfunction present concurrently in more than one organ system in a patient with SLE with IpsO. The female to male ratio is 8:1, and half of the cases described are Asian females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312464091">1</xref></sup>, like the case reported herein.</p>
<p>The etiology of IpsO is unknown, although several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the disorder of intestinal motility. The apparently high association of IpsO and ureterohydronephrosis suggests a possible common smooth muscle dysmotility, primary or secondary to either an immune-complex-mediated vasculitis or a common autoantibody targeted against the smooth muscle. There are no specific autoantibodies in IpsO but Mok et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312464091">1</xref></sup> reported the presence of anti-Ro in 83.3% (five out of six cases), and the same was detected in our patient too. Anti-Ro prevalence occurs in nearly 30% of inflammatory myositis and in up to 72% of anti-Jo-1 positive inflammatory myositis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312464091">10</xref></sup> However, inflammatory myositis is a disease of skeletal muscles and does not involve smooth muscles. Whether anti-Ro plays any pathological role in gut dysmotility is not known. Anti-proliferative cell nuclear antigen antibody (anti-PCNA) was also found to be more frequently detected than in lupus patients without IpsO in one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312464091">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>High-dose intravenous corticosteroids have been the mainstay of induction treatment. Almost all patients in the series reviewed responded readily to corticosteroid therapy. Early recognition of this condition and use of adequate doses of corticosteroid was emphasized by Miller et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312464091">12</xref></sup> who reported recurrent intraperitoneal adhesions complicating the clinical course in a lupus patient with IpsO as a result of delayed and suboptimal corticosteroid therapy. Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312464091">6</xref></sup> reported a patient with IpsO with advanced irreparable tissue destruction including myonecrosis, fibrosis and atrophy, resulting in failure of peristalsis to return despite treatment with high-dose pulse steroids, emphasizing that timely diagnosis and intervention is crucial in management. Both cyclophosphamide (pulse intravenous or oral) and azathioprine had been used as maintenance agents. The outcome appeared equally good. We used parenteral cyclophosphamide pulse in our patient as she developed IpsO while she was on 100 mg daily azathioprine maintenance. Antibiotics like erythromycin to diminish bacterial overgrowth or promotility drugs and occasionally octreotide are usually effective when they are associated with the immunosuppressive treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, IpsO may occur concomitantly with biliary dilatation and is a severe manifestation of SLE with a high mortality rate. A high index of suspicion for IpsO is essential for preventing inappropriate surgical intervention. Early recognition of the syndrome and prompt medical treatment are crucial.</p>
