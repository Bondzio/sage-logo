<abstract>
<p>Interferon-β (IFN-β) stabilizes the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Here we investigated the effect of serum from 15 IFN-β-1b-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients on the permeability read-outs of small solutes in an in vitro BBB model consisting of human brain microvascular endothelial cells in co-culture with rat astrocytes. The addition of sera from IFN-β-treated patients resulted in a significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced permeability as compared with untreated patients. Our findings show that sera from IFN-β-1b-treated MS patients have a stabilizing effect on the in vitro BBB. We suggest an unknown potentially pro-inflammatory factor in the serum of MS patients that may lead to a BBB dysfunction and can be modulated by IFN-β.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic demyelinating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511416837">1</xref></sup> The recruitment of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of MS.</p>
<p>Human recombinant interferon-β (IFN-β) preparations have been approved for treatment of relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511416837">2</xref></sup> It has been suggested that IFN-β is an anti-inflammatory modulator of the cytokine network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511416837">2</xref></sup> In addition, we have shown that IFN-β is able to directly stabilize the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511416837">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511416837">4</xref></sup> This finding is in line with MRI findings showing a reduction of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions early after onset of IFN-β treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511416837">5</xref></sup>

<title>Blood samples from patients and controls</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected from 15 clinically stable RRMS patients receiving IFN-β-1b (Betaferon™) for at least 6 months (range 6–97 months) and from 15 age- and sex-matched clinically stable patients without any immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy during the last 6 months. However, most of them have been on treatment before. Owing to the pharmacokinetic properties of IFN-β-1b blood samples were drawn at least 16 hours after the last injection of IFN-β-1b in the group of treated patients to exclude a direct effect of remaining IFN-β-1b in the serum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511416837">6</xref></sup> Age- and sex-matched 15 healthy volunteers were used as controls. All patients and controls gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethical committee. Serum was stored at –80°C.</p>
<p>Clinical parameters are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511416837">Table 1</xref>. Cranial Gd-enhanced MRI scans were performed within 2 weeks before or after blood sampling and were evaluated by a blinded neuroradiologist.</p>

<p>We used immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), a human cell line which had been established by Stins et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511416837">7</xref></sup> HBMECs from passages 25 to 28 were used.</p>
<p>We modified the in vitro BBB model of Cecchelli et al. by applying a co-culture of rat astrocytes with HBMECs instead of bovine brain capillary endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511416837">8</xref></sup> Primary astrocytes were prepared by forcing brain tissue from newborn rats through a nylon sieve. By growing HBMECs in co-culture with primary rat astrocytes we were able to achieve a barrier of the paracellular permeabilities across HBMEC monolayers in the same range as in vivo. Permeability assays were performed exactly as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511416837">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511416837">4</xref></sup> Values were measured in triplicates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Until now, no biomarker has been available before or early after initiation of therapy to predict whether a MS patient will benefit from IFN-β treatment or not. Such a biomarker would be of importance to choose the most appropriate treatment for individual patients.</p>
<p>Our explorative, proof-of-concept study addresses the question of whether this effect can also be observed by treating an in vitro BBB model with serum from patients on IFN-β treatment and should elucidate the usefulness of this approach as a future biomarker system. The rationale was based on the assumption that an unknown potentially pro-inflammatory factor in the serum of MS patients may lead to a BBB dysfunction, which can be modulated by IFN-β. Further studies are needed to determine the identity of this humoral factor.</p>
<p>We have chosen a BBB-based bioassay system, as the BBB is involved in an essential step of MS pathogenesis. The determination of high-titer neutralizing serum antibodies against IFN-β is a putative surrogate marker for IFN-β failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511416837">9</xref></sup> However, neutralizing antibodies against IFN-β occur only after many months of treatment. Theoretically, the application of a BBB-based bioassay system would allow the determination of patients who will not respond to IFN-β for other reasons than for the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies.</p>
<p>We used HBMECs to prevent xenogenic effects which might occur when applying endothelial cells derived from other species. HBMECs are an immortalized cell line and therefore relatively easy to handle. Moreover, the immortalized cells can be applied in a much more standardized fashion than assays which are based on primary cell cultures.</p>
<p>We suggest that after several evaluation steps, the in vitro BBB model is a possible candidate for a biomarker system for therapeutic effects of IFN-β.</p>
<p>The reduction of permeability and, thus, the stabilization of the BBB was most striking in IFN-β-1b-treated patients with a low number of lesions. This is in line with the concept of an enhanced treatment efficacy in early stages of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511416837">10</xref></sup> According to our hypothesis of a potentially pro-inflammatory serum factor leading to BBB dysfunction, one can speculate that MS patients with low lesion loads are relatively early in their disease courses and may possess a higher inflammatory potential in their serum. These early patients may respond best to IFN-β treatment as IFN-β may reduce inflammatory activity best. The most prominent reduction of the hypothesized BBB-opening molecule may therefore lead to the most prominent stabilization of the BBB during IFN-β treatment in patients with lower lesion loads.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated an in vitro BBB model, which is a promising tool to measure the treatment effect early after starting IFN-β therapy in MS patients. It should therefore be further evaluated and modified towards a biomarker system to determine the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-β in individual MS patients.</p>
