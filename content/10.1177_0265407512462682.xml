<abstract>
<p>This qualitative study explores young people’s perceptions of unfairness when involved in cross-border volunteering. It extends the theoretical understanding of volunteering, by adding to the notion of barriers of access, the idea that poor volunteer management may pose obstacles in the process of volunteering. The research indicates that the young people are not passive, but justice-sensitive when faced with situations perceived as unfair. It argues that volunteering is prone to the same patterns of responding to dissatisfaction that have been researched for employment. Yet, this article adds a fifth generic decision types for quitting, namely quitting as an ethically minded statement of disapproval. This demonstrates that the tendency to invariably position young people as “morally responsible” for dropping out is often limiting and reproduces structural intergenerational power. Ultimately, the article seeks to improve organizations’ knowledge on “what does not work,” for the purpose of advancing the ethical management of international volunteering.</p>

<p>There seems to be a growing and legitimate concern for the access barriers that prevent young people from volunteering. To some extent, this process integrates the idea that the entry into volunteering cancels out any preexisting challenges and volunteering is, in itself, a smooth process, further irreconcilable with the notion of barriers and, not to mention, unfairness. Programs and campaigns designed to encourage more young people to consider volunteering seem to be grounded on this logic. It goes without saying that the access barriers have been largely regarded as intrinsic to young people’s lives. However, as this article will demonstrate, like any other process involving young people (including formal education and employment), barriers exist before as well as during and (arguably) after volunteering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265407512462682">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Cross-border volunteering is a field that (although a long tradition does exist) expanded only lately. Thus, many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in this domain have a rather recent experience in the area. Traditionally, they tended to concentrate on recruitment, at the expense of retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney and Lucas, 2009</xref>). To some extent, this may explain why the focus on the barriers of access became a legitimate concern, whilst the notion of “barriers in the process” did not attract a comparative interest. From this perspective, a look into the barriers <italic>in the process</italic> touches on a rather insufficiently explored area.</p>
<p>What issues are responsible for volunteers’ perception of workplace (un)fairness? What types of responses emerge (if any) and what can they tell us about the notion of cross-border volunteering? The theme has been prompted by the input received from volunteers whilst carrying out another research on nonformal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512462682">Pantea, 2012a</xref>). During interviews, concern for the difficulties encountered during the process of volunteering and a general perception of unfairness emerged repeatedly. The recurrent accounts of such experiences strengthened the reliability of findings.</p>
<p>This article will concentrate on the disabling circumstances that interfere with the volunteering and are perceived as unjust. It relies exclusively on volunteers’ accounts and their reported “perceptions of unfairness.” This may be considered an unbalanced approach, as organizations’ perspectives are missing. Yet, the research is not interested in establishing “the truth” about volunteering (e.g., whether a volunteering program really is unethically managed, or whether the volunteers just suspect it). Instead, the article is interested in young people’s perspectives (partial as they may be) that have their own validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512462682">Punch, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Many cross-border volunteering experiences are, nevertheless, positive and rewarding. In this respect, the topic choice does not give justice to the richer experience of being a volunteer. However, the article aims to give due value to some of the young people’s silent anxieties and to open up a timely debate on ethical issues seen from volunteers’ perspectives. It also intends to have a broader function when drawing attention to challenges involved in cross-border volunteerism and to move their analysis from the informal networks, closer to the research area. The main understanding behind it is that the challenges young volunteers face in their daily work are also legitimate issues of academic, organizational and policy concern and they deserve a level of interest similar to the ones given to the barriers of access.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many of the issues being discussed may not apply to countries/organizations with more developed structures for volunteer recruitment and retention. However, the very notion that the barriers are not overcome once a young person begins volunteering may have a more general validity. Ultimately, the article seeks to improve the organizations’ knowledge on “what does not work,” for the purpose of improving the ethical management of international volunteering.</p>

<title>Previous research</title>
<p>An optimistic (educational, political, and lately, commercial) discourse argues that the international volunteering holds benefits for young people in their transitions to adulthood. Although the specific advantages of such experiences have not been thoroughly researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17b-0265407512462682">Kristensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpsons, 2004</xref>), it appears that intercultural learning and acquisition of soft skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462682">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>) are important “by products.” Besides, the credential inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512462682">Collins, 2000</xref>) that declines the value of university degrees renders volunteering a necessary ingredient for increasing employability (“normalization of volunteering” according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512462682">Holdsworth, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>At individual scale, cross-border volunteering is incorporated in the emerging youth lifestyles and is increasingly viewed as a “rite of passage to adulthood.” At a broader scale, it has been linked with the notion of “global citizenship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462682">Rovisco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512462682">Smith &amp; Laurie, 2010</xref>). Regardless the reasons, it is certain that cross-border volunteering became so much part and parcel of youth transitions that it created a demand for volunteering programs (see the controversies around the new industry of “voluntourism,” and also the stories of exploitation in some volunteering schemes<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265407512462682">2</xref>
</sup>).</p>
<p>Yet, despite gap years becoming increasingly profesionalised and incorporated in young people’s transition to adulthood, the research of this practice has only recently begun to open up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512462682">Raymond &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2004</xref>). Simpson, one of the most vocal academic voices on this issue, attributed the underdeveloped state of the evidence on cross-border volunteering<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265407512462682">3</xref>
</sup> to the commercial interests that authored a rhetoric that remained long unquestioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2004</xref>). The study of volunteering has long been tributary to a traditional understanding that prioritizes its benefits for the recipient of the activity and, potentially, for organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512462682">Ronel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512462682">Ronel et al., 2009</xref>). The idea that volunteers are “people with their own needs and aspirations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512462682">Hedley, 1992</xref>) is rather recent. Moreover, the notion that volunteering may involve personal, economic, and social costs is still tentative and rarely touched upon.</p>
<p>Barriers have mainly been discussed in terms of selective access (level of education, economic status, and disability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-0265407512462682">McBride &amp; Lough, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512462682">Sygall &amp; Lewis, 2006</xref>) and also race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512462682">Lough, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512462682">Peace Corps, 2007</xref>). The barriers involved when studying abroad did receive more critical assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17b-0265407512462682">Kristensen, 2004</xref>). However, there are very few research on volunteering that are grounded in the understanding that “the socialization process does not end as one joins the organization,” but on the contrary, the volunteer “continues to make sense, understand, learn, and change throughout the entire organizational experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512462682">Haski-Leventhal &amp; Bargal, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, organizations training manuals and guides do highlight the difficulties volunteers encounter during their practice.</p>
<p>Part of volunteers’ difficulties have been attributed to the shift from a model of volunteering based on seniority and commitment, to the “new volunteerism” that is more dynamic, episodic, task-based, with high turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512462682">Hustinx, 2010</xref>), and based on “loose connections” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0265407512462682">Wuthnow, 1998</xref>). When organizations continue to operate in the logic of previous volunteering model, the incongruous expectations may generate some tension and ethical dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512462682">Pantea, 2012a</xref>). In this context, it was argued that the organizations tend to focus excessively on recruitment, at the expense of investing resources and energies in the management and retention of volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney &amp; Lucas, 2009</xref>). To what extent this practice touches upon international, and not only local volunteering remains open to question.</p>
<p>In terms of the perceived difficulties, previous research pointed toward: (1) ambiguity resulting from discrepancies between volunteers’ own ideology and those of the organization; (2) frustration when the organization lacks the necessary resources for ongoing activity; (3) problems in coping with clients’ suffering; (4) a sense of being unable to help the clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512462682">Fischer &amp; Schaffer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512462682">Kulik, 2007</xref>). Volunteers’ experiences on the free rider problem and the resulting sense of injustice because of “being used” have also been noticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462682">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). The problem of organizations unethically attracting volunteers to “assume the additional burdens of holding office” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512462682">Pearce, 1993</xref>: 131) also emerged.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom at the level of organizations suggests that the best volunteers are the ones most prone to burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512462682">Barrymore, n.d</xref>.), however, not without organizations liability being involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney &amp; Lucas, 2009</xref>). Yet, burnout is a concept rather associated with employment (especially, in health professions and teaching). Its link with volunteering is being perceived as paradoxical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512462682">Kulik, 2007</xref>), because volunteering is performed out of “free will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407512462682">Wilson, 2000</xref>). Yet, there seems to be some evidence showing that the volunteering can generate burnout.</p>
<p>Thus, research shows that the long-term volunteering makes the costs more evident and people also feel, besides a higher level of organizational commitment and a strong role identity as volunteers, “a higher level of emotional exhaustion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407512462682">Vecina et al., 2010</xref>: 343). Similar research identified expressions of vulnerability, anxiety, depression, burnout and dissatisfaction among those volunteering for at-risk youth or in health care for long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512462682">Haski-Leventhal &amp; Bargal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512462682">Kulik, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More often, however, the causes of burnout have been considered rather inherent to the tasks or to the volunteers themselves (see, for instance, the emotional costs in the case of healthcare volunteering in AIDS, cancer, and mental health). Organizations’ liability in not providing the necessary level of training for dealing with emotionally harmful situations has been only tangentially tackled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512462682">Hawthorne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512462682">Nesbitt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512462682">Ross et al., 1999</xref>). Ultimately, it was only rarely that research looked into organizations as a locus of unfair treatment of volunteers. Organizations’ justice research in terms of volunteering (and not only employment) is a frontier that is only now beginning to open up.</p>
<p>For example, there are some studies on the potential sources of tension that lie in the relationships between paid staff and volunteers. While the issue entered the trade-union concerns about labor force replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512462682">Claxton-Oldfield et al., 2008</xref>), it remained a “sensitive and almost taboo issue” in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-0265407512462682">Handy et al., 2008</xref>: 90). In organizational practice, it was even argued that “the tensions that can exist between volunteers and employee co-workers remain one of the unpleasant secrets of non-profit organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512462682">Pearce, 1993</xref>: 142). Importantly, it may be that the job threat is “just one aspect in this very complex relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-0265407512462682">Kreutzer &amp; Jäger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512462682">Pearce, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>One tension generating difference between volunteers and the paid staff resides in the dissimilar work ethic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-0265407512462682">Kreutzer &amp; Jäger, 2010</xref>). Paid staff may employ work-avoidant strategies. Yet, volunteers can be dissatisfied if underutilized, as they may interpret this as a disregard of their time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462682">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407512462682">Vromen &amp; Collin, 2010</xref>). Also, it may be that the employees resent volunteers as they can choose the timing, the work to be done, and can avoid some of the “dirty work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462682">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, there is research that showed paid staff may have a problem with volunteers’ unreliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-0265407512462682">Kreutzer &amp; Jäger, 2010</xref>). Ultimately, youth volunteering is also an adult-mediated process. The intergenerational barriers inherent in human relationships may also be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25a-0265407512462682">Pantea, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Significantly, the above challenges have been researched mainly for the case of local volunteering. However, unlike local volunteers, cross-border volunteers “make a total commitment to another culture for a specific term, so that their contribution is not a solitary act or a voluntary donation of their time but rather a distinct period in that individual’s life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407512462682">Thomas, 2001</xref>: 22). International volunteering has been considered as an emerging (and expanding) pattern of youth volunteerism. Yet, it attracted research on selective themes, mostly related to issues of adaptation, cultural shock, and cultural imposition (see the research on Ameri Corps and Peace Corps in US, or the critical approach to gap year “industry” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies tended to focus on the (positive, but also, negative) influence of volunteers on home and host communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512462682">McBride et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512462682">Sherraden et al., 2008</xref>), on their main gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512462682">Hustinx, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512462682">Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407512462682">Thomas, 2001</xref>), and, of course, volunteers’ (moral) motivation. There is also mounting evidence on the class differences involved in international volunteering. Cross-national volunteering has rarely attracted enquiries on volunteers’ own difficulties, such as the sense of marginality, stress, and perception of unfairness. Vulnerable young people's wellbeing once in volunteering, has rarely been looked into.</p>
<p>When researched, the concerns on the ethical implications of international volunteering apply to volunteers themselves, as moral subjects animated by “good intentions,” but who may end up doing more harm than good. Critical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512462682">Illich, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2004</xref>) has pointed toward the issues of power, paternalism, and colonialism as inherent in international volunteering, and which may situate the international volunteer in a rather ingrate status in relationship with the locals, seen as “powerless receivers” of a help they did not ask for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512462682">Illich, 1968</xref>). Consequently, ethically minded international volunteers may need to solve personal dilemmas of this kind and to walk on a morally gray area in their local relationships.</p>

<title>Research aims and methodology</title>
<p>The current article aims to focus on the difficulties experienced by young people when volunteering. The broader question is what makes volunteering (still) difficult, when the barriers of access have been overcome? In particular, what are the issues responsible for young volunteers’ perception of workplace unfairness? What types of responses emerge (if any), and what can they tell us about the notion of cross-border volunteering?</p>
<p>Like any qualitative research, the present research does not aim at producing generalizable results, as many issues being discussed have rather local explanations. Nor it attempts to “prove” causalities and connections. However, the article aims to provide the level of description that would allow transferability in other social/institutional contexts. Primarily, the article explores whether the experiences of some cross-border volunteers in Romania can teach us anything about the difficulties involved in volunteering in a context of weakly developed organizational infrastructure. In this respect, the more modest ambition of the article is to raise questions and to open debates rather than to advance “findings.”</p>
<p>There were theoretical, ethical, and practical rationales for undertaking this research. First, a focus on challenges is capable of advancing our understanding of volunteering. Second, it is able to legitimize and bring young people’s concerns from a peripheral informal discourse to the center of academic concern. Third, the article aims to prompt a more practical debate on “what does not work” with regards to cross-border volunteering. The idea that volunteering “is a complex territory, with many questions not yet even asked, let alone resolved” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407512462682">Williamson, 2005</xref>: 7) sat in the background of this research.</p>
<p>The article is based on the in-depth interviews with 25 long-term international volunteers between 19 and 29 years old, active in Romania. Of them, 21 came from European Union and four are from other European countries. All were part of noncommercial and nonreligious programs that place high value on cross-cultural learning and acquisition of skills. They worked for more than 20 organizations, mostly in the area of community support and nonformal education. The duration of their stages ranged from 9 months to 1 year. Generally, their contractual obligations stipulated full time work, with periodic days off and short breaks, mainly for travel.</p>
<p>The majority of interviewed volunteers had a middle class background and were either university graduates or about to enroll in an undergraduate program. However, several experienced situations rendered them vulnerable in some way, such as living in single parent families or struggling with parental resistance to accept their long-term volunteering at the expense of starting a career. For some, volunteering abroad was a refugee from an insecure labor market and a time-out for solving personal and professional uncertainties. Overall, graduates hoped to increase their employment prospects, while those finishing high school saw volunteering as an opportunity for making informed educational choices. Many came at short notice, with a strong motivation to leave home. Two interviewed young people had volunteering careers behind, which included work in refugee camps or international experiences starting as early as 16 years of age. Four had previous contacts with Romania.</p>
<p>Interview duration was between 40 and 80 min. Those located at distance and those who completed their project were interviewed by telephone. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded successively in NVivo9. The discussion of findings is structured along the main categories that have been generated by successive coding. Data collection and interpretation greatly benefited from volunteers’ elaborate and critical perspectives on their experiences. Due to the sensitive nature of information, participants were ensured of anonymity and data protection.</p>
<p>Participants have been contacted through personal networks, Internet searches, and volunteers’ own references. Few organizations approached were supportive in mediating the contact with their volunteers. It is possible for the research to have a biased participation that overrepresented the most involved volunteers. Agreeing to take part in a research is, in itself, an expression of volunteering. Also, the fact that the article is concerned with intra-European voluntary-work may legitimize a reduction in emphasis from the debate on the (inherent) cultural bewilderment that the volunteers themselves may generate toward the difficulties they experience.</p>

<title>Research findings</title>
<p>The next two sections will analyze young people’s accounts of “unfairness” and their responses. Grounded in a constructivist understanding of the world, the analysis will prioritize young people’s views and will delimit itself from an inquiry into “what <italic>really</italic> goes wrong.” The first section will draw upon the main categories generated in data coding, namely: “volunteers’ perception of being instrumentalized for economic gains,” “perception of poor organizational commitment,” “burnout,” “perception of being subjected to illegitimate demands,” and “volunteering as an adult-dominated area.” The second part will be organized along the main types of responses, namely: (1) quitting; (2) staying and suffering in silence; (3) staying and seeking revenge; (4) talking to others inside the organization such as a mentor or employee; (5) complain to external authorities; and (6) talking to friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462682">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Accounts of “unfairness” when volunteering</title>
<p>Young volunteers often face difficulties in adapting that are inherent in an international experience. There is frequently a big gap between young people’s lives at home and the conditions of the project. While volunteers may have thorough information before going abroad, there are still issues to be negotiated or handled later. There are practical and subjective matters involved, but also more structural dilemmas that shape the perception of unfairness and the adaptation process:<disp-quote>
<p>In the interview, they said: it’s a village, life is difficult etc etc. Now, when something happens, they say: ‘we are in a village. Full stop’. (Ana, 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A recurrent theme in young volunteers’ accounts was their perception of being instrumentalized by their host organizations and the dissatisfaction with organizations’ actual involvement in the project: “<italic>I thought the project is about Roma, but here I see the organization is more concerned about how to receive more money from the EU</italic>” (Andreea, 27). This research came across the accounts of controversial or unethical behaviour from the part of organizations (e.g., volunteers being required to pay for basic supplies needed in their work, than wait for late reimbursements; working long hours for a private elite kindergarten instead of doing the work for a disadvantaged community, as initially stated; volunteers used as replacements for paid staff; organizations’ weak sensitivity to volunteers’ needs and expectations, perceptions of organizations’ weak accountability, and poor conflict management skills).</p>
<p>At times, reported discrepancies between the project description and the actual low level of organizational commitment seem to have more structural explanations. It may be that the organizations work under high pressure for funding. There is also a vested interest from the part of NGOs to incorporate a management culture in their style, structure, and processes (not necessarily related with efficiency). These processes may explain (but not morally justify) the disproportionate allocations of resources to administration or found rising and less to the activities close to NGOs’ mission (Brudney &amp; Lucas, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512462682">Ramanath, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In an economic pressure to survive, organizations may rely on volunteering placements in order to maintain their administrative costs. On the other hand, it must be said that the third sector reflects the level of instability/stability from the society as a whole. Issues like opportunism, little regard for principles, and the misuse of elusive regulations may explain both third sector’s problematic credibility and volunteers’ perception of being mistreated:<disp-quote>
<p>At times I feel all volunteers are here only to sustain the organizations, to give salaries, but not to achieve something. We feel like tools, items, numbers … For each volunteer there is some money received each month. Even if we don’t achieve anything, they still receive the project and the money […] But this is public money and they should be tracked somehow. (Cornelia, 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Interviews seem to indicate that young people need to walk in a gray area in situations where the notion of volunteering is not clearly understood and to negotiate their position in relationship to unreceptive organizations. There are mainly two types of resistance they have to face. One is related to their role in institutions that have not been used with the long-term volunteers and which feel that the potential observers may threaten their internal cohesion. The second one is related to the incongruity of values and may resonate existing debates on international volunteering as Western cultural imposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462682">Simpson, 2004</xref>). Such notions are being reactivated when “holders” of local, experiential knowledge are acting as “gatekeepers” and their preexistent assumptions are being challenged:<disp-quote>
<p>The school director in the community where we were working, kicked us out. She didn’t even want us to be in touch with the kids. Other teachers saw us as a resource. But not her. She might have been old and tired of making changes. We tried … there were many meetings with teachers, directors. “We’ll handle it! We’ll handle it!” But they didn’t do anything. In that school, 60-70% of children are Roma. She doesn’t really like them, and doesn’t want to do anything to help them […] If there were volunteers, they’d keep an eye on things […] There are no Romanian guys doing this. In the city, they don’t even know how to get into this community. I know. (Luca, 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, volunteers’ sense of exclusion outweighs the support received and they start experiencing a sense of marginality and unfairness. Instances of burnout may appear, as young people do not feel rewarded for their contribution and do not protect themselves from unexpected stressors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265407512462682">4</xref>
</sup> like the ones above. In order to manage such tensions, volunteers need a broader awareness at the social and political context of the host country. Conversely, young volunteers are left to find their way in sometimes insufficiently prepared environments with a background knowledge that is contextual and incomplete. The weak understanding of the structural social dynamics may, in fact, be responsible for volunteering processes that actually reinforce previous stereotypes and end up doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>It also seems, however, that the organizations that are in a position to mediate volunteers’ relationships in situations like the above, do not always have the expected level of involvement. Apparently, reasons may range from an interest not to lose fragile institutional partnership, to intentions of exposing volunteers to local “learning situations.” At worst, one may consider NGOs’ low interest in the project itself. Yet, it could be possible for organizations to remain uninvolved out of their poor competence in dealing with stakeholders holding conflicting beliefs. Good intentions need to be accompanied by knowledge and skills to act. The current article argues that one should not abandon the idea that organizations, just like the young international volunteers, may be willing but less prepared to deal with conflicting values in an ethically minded way.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that the causes of burnout can be both on the part of the volunteer and within the organization itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512462682">Hawthorne, 2002</xref>). Burnout emerges not only as a consequence of increased pressure but also as a dilution of perceived boundaries between private life and their status as volunteers. Indications of this dilemma (most often analyzed in the feminist literature on the labour market) have been introduced in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-0265407512462682">Kreutzer and Jäger (2010)</xref>. Interviewed volunteers also reported on these conflicting tensions. Some were generated by organizations’ (illegitimate) demands that were at odds with project description and initial expectations (such as limitations in deciding upon the daily timetable, days off, and vacations). Others were generated by a constant pressure to socialize with rather reluctant locals in order to overcome a persistent sense of exclusion: “<italic>And you start telling yourself: Aaaa, I have to try my best for them to like me! […] You need to talk with the host family willy-nilly. This is an effort, and not everybody may like this</italic>” (George, 24).</p>
<p>In a more diminutive manner, this article raises awareness on another neglected aspect, namely the particular situations faced by disadvantaged youths while volunteering. A definition of this social group is almost impossible and always contextual. A previous experience of state care, a disabling condition, or a minority status are situations that can put a young person at disadvantage. A more satisfactory approach is the one provided by Kristensen: “young people with fewer opportunities” constitute a population for whom a transnational experience may not suggest itself naturally […] fragile participants who are in need (of) extended support and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-0265407512462682">EU-CoE Youth Partnership, 2011</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Based on the limited qualitative data available, this research seems to indicate that young people in a disadvantaged position “at the baseline” seem to pay higher costs when faced with challenges like the above. While some organizations are making efforts to respond to the particular needs of disadvantaged volunteers, in other circumstances, there is rather poor sensitivity with regard to their particular situations. Thus, volunteering risks turning into a rather disempowering experience that reproduces their initial vulnerability:<disp-quote>
<p>There is this mental issue, because of family background … two of my colleagues struggle with it. The organization is not really doing a lot to involve these people in project. They don’t give up, either, as they don’t have other opportunities in their countries. They stay here, but gave up. They do not do much, they don’t learn Romanian language, cannot improve English, don’t interact […] They cannot digest the problems, have depression […] It’s Ok to treat people the same way, but some might need more help, they are more sensitive […] One of these colleagues had a kind of computer-addiction and he was afraid of social interaction. For 3 months he just sat on computer and his peer was doing the whole work. Now he told the NGO he will resign from January. I think the NGO is tacitly happy about this. (Teo, 27)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Besides, interviews seem to show that (like many other structured activities in young people’s lives), cross-border volunteering is also an adult-dominated area and, thus, is not free from generational and gender power dynamics. Perception on unfair treatment on the grounds of both age and gender seems to be an issue that deserves more attention:<disp-quote>
<p>My roommate … she’s 21. The coordinator doesn’t understand her a lot. He speaks in a different way than with me. This is my perception: he speaks like she was stupid. He is not polite … In my country we call it <italic>Machismo</italic> … (Corina, 26)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the next part will ask to what extent (if any) and in what ways, young people respond to what they perceive as “unreasonable treatment” when volunteering.</p>

<title>Volunteers’ responses: From quitting to “suffering in silence”</title>
<p>Volunteers are not passive in facing the challenges involved in their work. Reactions to situations perceived as unfair, emerge at different stages of the volunteering process and they may change in time. The scholarship on employment, where the topic received more considerate attention, identified six types of responses, namely: (1) quitting; (2) staying and suffering in silence; (3) staying and seeking revenge; (4) talking to others inside the organization such as a mentor or employee; (5) complaining to external authorities; and (6) talking to friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462682">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>). From the interviews, it seems that the volunteers’ deliberate responses to unfairness can be, in the main, integrated into the same categories.</p>
<p>
<italic>Quitting</italic> is an extreme response to unfairness both at the workplace and when volunteering. Literature distinguishes four generic decision types for quitting, namely: impulsive, comparison, preplanned, and conditional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512462682">Maertz &amp; Campion, 2004</xref>). While quitting from local volunteering may go without high costs for either organization, volunteer, and (arguably) clients, quitting from a long-term volunteering placement abroad is more complicated. The interviews revealed few but significant cases of quitting. Moreover, discussions indicated that quitting is a “presence <italic>in absentia</italic>” among cross-border volunteers, as most of them know or have heard of (previous) volunteers dropping out.</p>
<p>The conventional knowledge among organizations and decision makers at higher policy levels advises that the “international volunteering is not for everyone.” Indeed, reasons for dropping out may range from personal difficulties of coping with life away from home, to an insufficient understanding of commitment. Nevertheless, many changes occur in young people’s lives during the long-term volunteering projects abroad.</p>
<p>However, explanations of quitting among young volunteers should remain open to the idea of poor management inside host organizations. In this respect, young volunteers’ quitting does not always enter the established decision types discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512462682">Maertz and Campion (2004</xref>). The research points toward a fifth type that makes quitting a decision close to an “ethically-minded statement of disapproval.” This research identified a situation when, after unsuccessful attempts to signal various perceived injustices, six volunteers decided to quit. Previously, they carried out educational projects for the same organization and lived in different villages in a remote area:<disp-quote>
<p>We had problems and we left as a protest. There were ten of us and six left. There was a conflict … a volunteer got robbed in the house and the NGO didn’t help … They thought this would bring a bad reputation on the family. Everything was in the air, but not discussed … Then, we had strong discussions. Everything could have been avoided if they had asked for a record of the family. They robbed something before. The NGO said they couldn’t find another host. It was a small rural community, with very difficult conditions. (Ana, 25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The above group resignation was a complex attempt that puts the individuals’ values and the in-group trust to the test. Young people’s actions were their ultimate manifestations of voice in a situation experienced as unfair. Here, quitting is not an indication of a lack of interest or weak commitment, but an expression of dissent, grounded in one’s principles on how people and organizations should act. It is a moral statement for signaling perceived injustices, more than being a self-interested choice: “<italic>If six people leave, it’s important. It’s not about feeling bad about doing this; it’s about letting others see something might be wrong there and that needs to be checked</italic>”<italic> (Ana, 25). </italic>In this respect, “morally minded quitting” is not found among Maertz and Campion’s rather self-centered generic decision types.</p>
<p>Volunteers’ decisions are not free from broader structural constraints and preexistent vulnerabilities outside their control (e.g., the lack of support at home or inexistence of valid alternatives if leaving). Thus, when the situation is perceived to be unfair, the choice for the most disadvantaged volunteers is often “<italic>staying and suffering in silence</italic>” (the solution found by the remaining four volunteers from the above example). This should not be interpreted as a lack of reaction, but as the most appropriate solution at hand for dealing with a conflict between expectations and reality, and when the opportunity costs of quitting are taken into consideration:</p>
<p>Importantly, young people know how to separate different areas of their lives as volunteers and the different levels of workplace unfairness/fairness. Thus, one may be content with the project, with the relationship with clients and staff, but not with the living conditions or the other way around. They may negotiate constructive responses to dissatisfying situations, at the expense of inhibiting the expression of the resentments:<disp-quote>
<p>I’d advise an incoming volunteer to stay focused on the project and not mind the NGO. If things don’t go as expected … (Carla, 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A common response is for volunteers to <italic>privately share dissatisfaction</italic>, concerns, and doubts among the peers. It seems that information on the difficulties encountered by young people circulates rapidly in volunteers’ community. However, a shared assumption is that individual relationships with the organization are too important to jeopardize if addressing the external authorities. There is the perception that <italic>issuing a formal complaint</italic> may do more harm than good. Besides, there are also concerns that information will be handled unethically in the process, in an unconstructive manner or with administrative delays that render complaining useless for the volunteer.</p>
<p>Young people also seem aware of the intergenerational dynamics involved. For example, if the volunteers contact program authorities, it may be seen as an indication of them being unpredictable and unreliable. In the final analysis, the general sense seems to be that the overall costs of expressing disappointment might be too high in cross-border volunteering: “once one starts volunteering, it may be difficult to stop because stopping suggests that one made a mistake in deciding to volunteer. Under this escalation dynamic, it requires more conscious effort to stop volunteering than to continue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407512462682">Tschirhart et al., 2001</xref>: 425).</p>
<p>The research did not come across volunteers’ responses that may enter Jackson’s category of “<italic>staying and seeking revenge</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462682">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>). It may be that the interviews did not reach the level of confidence for this kind of information to surface. Yet, it seems that the volunteers may draw on subtler, escape routes and strategies of “everyday resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512462682">Scott, 1990</xref>). This is the case of David, a young man with a volunteering career behind:<disp-quote>
<p>This is volunteering, but I am investing one year of my life, I take it as a job, and I expect my boss takes it like a job as well. But once I see the boss doesn’t really care, I stop and ask myself why would I? So I start coming a bit later, also, and not investing so much. (David, 25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>“<italic>Talking to others inside the organization</italic>” is a solution many volunteers resort to. Often, problems are indeed sorted out this way. However, this mode of dealing with situations that are perceived as unfair can be a matter of organizational culture and may have its costs attached. This seems to be the situation that one young volunteer finds herself in. Anita’s main reason for disappointment is that she is filling the role of a full time job in a private kindergarten. When her tasks slowly move from being a teacher’s aide, to sole responsibility for children, she is questioning the job description and, ultimately, the very legitimacy of the volunteering project. The situation replicates much earlier research on volunteers feeling, “with some justification, that they have legal immunity from allegations of negligence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512462682">Oldham, 1979</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>One child fell and it seemed really serious. I was alone with the kids. The teacher didn’t do anything. I didn’t have responsibilities. They said: ‘Yes! You have’. But I don’t speak Hungarian, I don’t know where the hospital is … They said: “Noo, you’re afraid.” No, I’m not! It’s your company. Your businesses. (Anita, 23)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Anita’s sense of unfairness is shared in the group of four international volunteers. Although their disappointment extends during the entire year of stay, there are, still, many things that keep them in the program: from the benefits of a European health insurance, otherwise inaccessible, to the hope of increasing the job prospects when back home.</p>
<p>Generally, <italic>discussing with a mentor</italic> did not appear to be a solution, as situations that involved some level of dissatisfaction seemed to be related to organizations where the ethical criteria of mentor’s neutrality was not met. Interviews seemed to indicate that although volunteers do have the right to say “No” to a request, it might be that this is more a part of the rhetoric than an acceptable practice in some organizations. There are structural power relationships that make this a compelling exercise. When it does happen, this is likely to take place toward the end of a volunteer stage (when the volunteer reached a level of confidence and integration) or when young people have a longer “volunteering career behind.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265407512462682">
<title>Concluding discussion</title>
<p>As the study is based on a rather small-scale empirical research, situated in a very specific context, it cannot confirm broader theoretical claims. At best, it can provide informative evidence about the ways in which those involved, experience cross-border volunteering. These findings can open up areas for more extensive, goal-directed research and raise further theoretical inquiries in the expanding field of international volunteering.</p>
<p>Previous literature prioritized the ethical dilemmas that international volunteers themselves generate when they are not very well aware of the cultural and social conditions in host communities. This paper added a different facet to the debate, by exploring the relatively uncharted area of volunteers’ own feelings of unfairness and the tensions related to organizational volunteering infrastructure.</p>
<p>While the accounts presented in the article cannot be taken as an evidence of gaps in management, the research calls for a more refined look at volunteering in ways that encompass (besides recruitment) more considerate responses to the processes of retention and support of current volunteers. Thus, organizations need to consider young people’s own motivations and expectations about the project. They need to reframe/frame volunteering from an activity seen as entirely altruistic, to one which is also part of young people’s life plans, or a personal development strategy. In the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney and Lucas (2009</xref>), the article calls for sustainability of (international) volunteering, in the sense of developing volunteering stages that are more ethical and responsive to young people’s needs, expectations, and skills. In view of developing life-long attachment to volunteering (advocated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney &amp; Lucas, 2009</xref>), unsatisfactory experiences, like those described above, risk jeopardizing young people’s relationships with volunteering and the broader notion of cross-border mobility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is important to recognize that the young volunteers are a particularly exigent group for organizations. They may require individualized modes for recognition of their contribution and may have distinct motives for doing (or not doing) the work. Under these circumstances, organizations need to tread carefully when giving due value to the contribution, or when responding to their expectations. Yet, many organizations operate in increasingly unfriendly environments: both socially and economically. Besides, many are relatively new in the developing field of international volunteering. Nevertheless, clients (and not volunteers) are their raison d'être and main priority. However, although organizations and volunteers may occasionally hold competing views and interests, the article advocates for a genuine process of negotiation and for an ethically minded management of volunteering.</p>
<p>Based on a limited sample of participants, this research seems to suggest that the young people are not passive, but justice-sensitive when faced with situations perceived as unfair. The research argues that volunteering may be prone to similar patterns of responding to dissatisfaction that have been researched for employment. Grounded in relatively limited qualitative evidence, the article questions the tendency to informally associate volunteers’ dropout with young people’s moral instability, weak capacity to commit on the long term, or uncertainty about choices. It advises for broadening the range of motives for dropping out, by bringing in the notion that young people may quit in order to make a value statement.</p>
<p>The article resonates with previous assertions that young people are “self-reflective volunteers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512462682">Hustinx &amp; Lammertyn, 2003</xref>) and thus are capable of making sense of the organizational relationships that they are part of and of describing the volunteering processes that they are involved in. Moreover, it seems to indicate that besides being self reflective with regards to their biographical choices, the experience of dissatisfaction may be related with an awakening of critical consciousness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the article distances itself for any generalization claims. It is not that all volunteers are in the position to make proposals for change, to negotiate their role, to voice their concerns or simply say “No.” The research draws attention to the existence of a silent group of more disadvantaged young people “staying and suffering in silence.” It advises that socialization in volunteering needs to be seen as a process, in which, depending on the initial level of disadvantage/advantage, some young volunteers may become more vocal than others. A tentative hypothesis put forward looks at the potential risk for volunteers’ initial vulnerabilities to be reproduced when organizations are not particularly sensitive to issues of disadvantage.</p>
<p>Besides, given the current economic climate, it is likely that young people will use cross-border volunteering as a solution for dealing with employment insecurity at home. Organizations (but also states as providers of social services) may consider misusing/using volunteers as replacements for paid staff. Such trends require increased policy awareness, as there may be personal and social risks involved (including the depreciation of the notion of volunteering).</p>
<p>This article suggests that volunteers’ perceptions can be partially attributed to NGOs shift toward “marketization” and customary anxiety for recruitment and funding, at the expense of retention, a move that reproduces itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462682">Brudney &amp; Lucas, 2009</xref>). While the above statements may hold true for the case of local volunteering, it is not certain to what extent, cross-border volunteering may also be subject to this structural setback. In any case, it does appear that the trend for managerialism may impede organizations from devoting resources and energies to the retention of cross-border volunteers. The research base at this point is rather weak, but, as this article suggests, this is an area that deserves future inquiries, especially given the rapid expansion of cross-border volunteering (including private and commercial placements). Ultimately, one could argue that the factors that explain do not also morally justify situations like those above. Also, as the geographical perspective of the data material is narrow and context specific, it remains uncertain to what extent this explanation is valid and transferable in a broader European, if not worldwide, context.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the article wants to delimit from a potential causal link between dropout and weak volunteer management. There are many reasons for which cross-border volunteers quit,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265407512462682">5</xref>
</sup> including, but not limited to, weak commitment. It may also be that the international volunteers are prompted by multiple motivations and research shows that this increases the chances of stress and dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512462682">Kiviniemi et al., 2002</xref>). Also, there may be (for the moment, weakly understood) cross-cultural differences involved in the perception of injustice (e.g., why do international youth volunteers may feel that they are being cheated and used when apparently they are not?). In any case, volunteers’ dropout needs to be read against a larger background.</p>
<p>Apart from the legal framework, rights and responsibilities are often being discussed almost exclusively with reference to volunteers themselves. This article points toward the responsibilities that organizations need to assume when hosting international volunteers. Ultimately, the article raises questions on organization’s capacity to manage staff diversity and to respond in a sensitive and ethical fashion to the particular needs and expectations of the volunteers.</p>
<p>As the empirical research was limited, the above statements cannot be but cautious and conservative. Yet, they may be able to prompt larger processes of inquiry and (potentially) validation. Future research might benefit from having organizations and not individual volunteers as “units of analysis.” The approach applied in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-0265407512462682">Kreutzer and Jäger (2010)</xref> allows for a more refined understanding of the internal dynamics, where experiences of unfairness are being negotiated. To what extent (if any) did volunteers’ actions and reactions (including quitting) impact organizations’ practices or shape in some way their experiences? What is organization’s perspective? Such approaches would allow an inquiry into organizations seen as “communities of practice” and ask about the reciprocal nature of learning.</p>
