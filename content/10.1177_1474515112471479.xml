<title>Background</title>
<p>Heart failure (HF), on the rise worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112471479">1</xref></sup> requires conscientious self care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112471479">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112471479">3</xref></sup> Nurse researchers have taken the lead in studying the interplay between HF, patients, and spousal/partner caregivers resulting in a recent surge in HF dyadic research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112471479">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112471479"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112471479"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112471479"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112471479"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112471479"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112471479"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112471479">11</xref></sup> As the data begin to accumulate, new ways of understanding HF spousal/partner dyads and what role these dyads play in self care are being explored.</p>
<p>HF spousal/partner dyads report greater emotional investment and sense of responsibility for HF care when compared to parent/child dyads;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112471479">7</xref></sup> however, congruence or consistency of spousal/partner dyad agreement in that care is a key factor in dyadic outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112471479">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112471479">12</xref></sup> It is not sufficient for the caregiver to be merely involved, rather that the dyad agree on the self care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112471479">7</xref></sup> In addition, dyads who share responsibility for self care report better overall self care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112471479">13</xref></sup> In a number of studies, patient and informal caregiver dyads have been found to pool their personal resources (i.e. information, energy, time) to manage chronic illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112471479">14</xref></sup> Dyads are also known to develop habitual responses to similar situations as a means of streamlining decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112471479">15</xref></sup> From this, it can be inferred that dyads will manage HF care as they have successfully managed other complex problems in the past. For example, if the dyad has historically managed their finances together, the theoretical literature suggests that they will manage HF care, another complex task, together, whereas if one partner took sole responsibility for financial planning, that partner may be more likely to take sole responsibility for HF care. Furthermore, it can be deduced that there are a finite number of ways in which dyads can manage HF care (they can either work together or separately; one or the other can take the lead) resulting in several categories or types of dyadic HF care. However, quantifying dyadic HF care has not been accomplished to date due to the lack of robust instrumentation to measure this care. The purpose of this short report is to assess the response to this new instrument developed to measure dyadic HF care type in HF patients and spousal/partner caregivers and explore relationships between dyadic care type and other variables.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were accrued for a larger study (5R01NR013419-02, Hupcey, J.E. PI). The investigation was approved by the institutional review board of a health care system in the Eastern United States and conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112471479">16</xref></sup> The setting included outpatient clinics from one university affiliated health care system and one large community based health system.</p>
<p>In seeking to develop a means to quantify this spousal/partner dyadic HF care, first, a typology was developed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112471479">17</xref></sup> to portray different ways in which patients and caregivers could possibly manage HF care. A 2 X 2 table of patient or caregiver by individual responsibility or joint responsibility resulted in four categories or dyadic HF care types: two categories in which the individual patient or caregiver managed HF alone with the acquiescence of the spouse/partner and two in which the dyad managed HF together, either collaboratively or by negotiating separate spheres of responsibility (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112471479">Table 1</xref>). Our thinking about these categories was informed by the literature from statistics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112471479">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112471479">19</xref></sup> psychology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112471479">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112471479">20</xref></sup> and the health sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112471479">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112471479"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112471479">23</xref></sup> Then an instrument was developed to measure the dyadic HF care type for the individual dyad.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample included dyads consisting of a HF patient and their spousal/partner caregiver. Patients were identified by clinicians, then screened and recruited by trained research assistants. Eligible dyads had to be over the age of 18, English speaking, alert and oriented, and provide written consent. In addition, the patient had to have a documented diagnosis of end-stage refractory HF (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB/IV) in the medical record at time of consent and an identified primary spousal/partner caregiver.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112471479">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Spousal/partner dyads were recruited from 2011 to 2012 in the outpatient clinics associated with the involved health care systems. After identification by clinicians, dyads were initially contacted in the clinics by the research assistants who described the study to them and obtained informed consent. Both the patient and caregiver forms were designed at a ninth grade readability level. Self care was defined as ‘Taking care of heart failure on a daily basis includes weighing with a scale, taking medications, keeping to a low salt diet, exercising, and monitoring swelling of feet and ankles.’ The patient and caregiver were then instructed to circle one and only one category that best described how they and their partner take care (decide what to do and how to do it) of the patient’s HF. The four categories of dyadic care type provided were: 1) a patient oriented category where the patient takes care of the HF without input from the caregiver; 2) a caregiver oriented category where the caregiver takes care of the HF without input from the patient; 3) a collaborative category where the patient and caregiver take care together; 4) a complementary category where the patient and caregiver take care of different aspects of the HF (for example one may monitor weights while the other plans meals). The patient and caregiver, separately, completed the instrument in order to determine who provided routine daily self care maintenance activities involving treatment adherence and symptom monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112471479">2</xref></sup> Research assistants were instructed to observe and note if the dyads had any difficulty understanding the categories or needed clarification at any point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112471479">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version19. After assessing for missing or non-normally distributed data, descriptive statistics (mean±SD) of patient and caregiver sociodemographic (age, gender, years married, time caregiving), clinical variables (patient NYHA class), and dyadic care type were first assessed. Although this feasibility study was not sufficiently powered to detect the existence and strength of the relationships between the dyadic care type and sociodemographic and clinical variables, these were explored using non-parametric measures (χ <sup>2</sup>, φ coefficient). Finally the degree of agreement within the dyad on particular type selected was assessed using a kappa statistic. The strength of the agreement was determined according to Landis and Koch’s criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112471479">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section11-1474515112471479" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 19 dyads were included in this study. Sociode- mographic and clinical characteristics of the dyads were as follows. Patients in this sample were typical for HF patients, mean age of 71.7±9.7 years, male (<italic>n</italic>=15), and NYHA Class IIIB/IV (79%). Caregivers were slightly younger (69.2±11.7 years), female (<italic>n</italic>=15), reported having been married for a mean of 45.2±14.1 years, and had served as a caregiver for two years or less (68%). All patients and caregivers self identified as White.</p>
<p>When patients were asked to select a preferred dyadic care type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112471479">Table 2</xref>), the collaborative type was the most frequently selected (<italic>n</italic>=10), followed by patient oriented (<italic>n</italic>=5), caregiver oriented (<italic>n</italic>=2), and complementary (<italic>n</italic>=2). When caregivers were asked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112471479">Table 3</xref>), they selected both the patient oriented (<italic>n</italic>=6) and complementary (<italic>n</italic>=6) most frequently, followed by collaborative (<italic>n</italic>=5), and caregiver oriented (<italic>n</italic>=2). When non-parametric statistics (χ<sup>2</sup>, φ coefficient) were assessed exploring the existence and strength of the relationship between the patients’ self reported dyadic care type and the patient’s age, gender, years married, or NYHA class, no significant relationships were found. Nor were there any significant relationships found between the patients’ dyadic care type and the caregiver’s age, gender, years married, or years caregiving. The analysis was then repeated with caregivers’ self reported dyadic type and both the patients’ variables and their own. Once again there were no significant relationships.</p>

<p>The only relationship of interest in these analyses was the relationship between the caregivers’ self selected dyadic care type and the patients’ NYHA class (φ .82, <italic>p</italic> NS) but the relationship was not as expected, in that six caregivers selected a patient oriented dyadic care type while the patient’s NYHA class (IIIB/IV) indicated a significant amount of HF disease burden. Of the nine patients with NYHA class IV HF, only one caregiver indicated that they (the caregiver) took care of the majority of the patient’s HF care.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our main finding is that HF patient and caregiver dyads responded with ease to the new instrument and were able to self select a dyadic care type given specific criteria. Despite a relatively impaired patient population (NYHA class IIIB/IV), they had no difficulty understanding the question or selecting the category that best described their particular type. The research assistants reported that a few dyads vacillated between the collaborative (work together on the same things) and complementary (work together on separate things) types. We were concerned that the two ‘joint responsibility’ types were conceptually close (and perhaps indistinguishable to a lay person), but when given the instruction to ‘just select the one that <underline>best</underline> describes how you and your partner take care (decide what to do and how to do it) of your (or your partner’s) HF,’ they were able to select one type over the other and then used stories to confirm their selection.</p>
<p>The non-significant findings from the analysis of the relationships between the selected dyadic care type and both personal or partner variables are not unexpected as this small study was not powered to detect a relationship. Future work will explore these relationships in greater depth. Of particular concern is the subset of caregivers who indicated that they considered the patient to be primarily responsible for their own HF care despite advanced HF. This finding calls for future exploration. Whether the patient is not willing to engage the caregiver as the HF progresses or whether the caregiver does not engage needs to be better understood. It can be argued that patient oriented dyadic types that may have successfully managed HF in earlier stages of the condition need to shift to one of the joint management types. Furthermore, it is theorized that ultimately all dyads end up with a caregiver oriented type as the patient becomes less and less able to contribute to their own care. Dyads that are unable to manage this shift may be particularly vulnerable to failures in self care.</p>
<p>The lack of agreement between patients and caregivers on dyadic care type is equally intriguing, and yet, troubling. Although the limitations of the kappa statistic are acknowledged,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112471479">25</xref></sup> a kappa of 0.28 indicates only a fair degree of agreement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112471479">24</xref></sup> between the patient and caregivers, but the <italic>p</italic> value, given the small sample size, indicates an increased likelihood that this kappa is not due to chance. The relationship between agreement and successful self care needs further exploration. It would move the science forward if it were found that when both partners are working from a different mental model of who is responsible for the care, poorer outcomes result.</p>
<p>One limitation of the current study is the lack of diversity in the sample. Future study is needed to assess the response to this new instrument measuring dyadic HF care in a more diverse population. HF remains a costly condition for both health care systems and for human beings. There is a need to understand factors that may impact self care decision making for patients and caregivers. Of particular interest is how the dyad’s care type (whether the patient or caregiver takes the lead or they collaborate) relates to self care. This paper has presented a new instrument to measure dyadic HF care types and provided preliminary evidence for the usability of the instruments with participants. The next step is to understand how the dyadic care types relate to self care outcomes.</p>
