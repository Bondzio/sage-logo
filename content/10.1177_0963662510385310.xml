<p>Locally based research projects may generate multiple and competing expectations from local actors, particularly when they deal with local issues that are perceived as affecting the local quality of life, such as land regeneration. The sociology of expectations provides an entry point through which the expectations of research projects in the context of an environmental conflict can be investigated. This article analyzes a case study of a project (RECOAL) whose remit was to develop regeneration solutions for coal ash disposal sites in the western Balkans. The sociology of expectations is applied here to explain the linkage between the emergence of political discourses and collective expectations. The analysis suggests that the emergence of collective future orientations of locally based research projects needs to be understood with reference to the specific political positions from which such orientations are expressed. While expectations may shape the political debate, the political debate is also generative of such expectations.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>This article is concerned with how different expectations develop around locally based research projects about land regeneration initiatives to find new uses for degraded or derelict land. Land regeneration is often considered a key component of urban regeneration and a key task for urban planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510385310">Moss, 2003</xref>). It is normally confined to the aspects that can restore the land to serve as a material base for economic activities, but this approach tends to overlook the diverse social and cultural meanings of land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510385310">Owens and Cowell, 2002</xref>). Research projects investigating land regeneration issues are subject to social interpretations that are often expressed in the form of expectations regarding their results and potential impacts. Local actors, for example, may regard research projects as tools to improve different aspects of their quality of life. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510385310">Owens and Cowell (2002)</xref> remark, different actors’ expectations of land use projects may be incompatible and compete for attention and action.</p>
<p>Often, managers of research projects dealing with land use problems are faced with the limitations of research and scientific problems to meet the expectations of those who the project is intended to benefit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510385310">Harrison et al. (1998)</xref> argued that, in an environmental conflict, solving the technical problem may not be sufficient to “solve” the views of the people who claim that situation as problematic, and that expert knowledge will not always be accepted as correct by local people regardless of the contribution that such expert knowledge makes to the perceived situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510385310">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510385310">Burgess et al., 2000</xref>). In some cases, failing to understand the relationship between social context and land use has lead to “misreadings” of the environmental landscape by experts with implications for the environment and local livelihoods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510385310">Fairhead and Leach, 1996</xref>). While the social impact of land regeneration is often considered a key aspect of the project, project managers may find it difficult to link project delivery outputs with local demands for quality of life.</p>
<p>During the last two decades scholars have proposed opening up the environmental planning and policy-making processes in order to acknowledge the multiplicity of social values and understandings surrounding environmental issues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510385310">Rauschmayer et al., 2009</xref>). Proposals like these respond to the challenge of widening the participation in debates around environmental issues and recognizing their political implications as a way to acknowledge the uncertainty around scientific models of land and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510385310">Wynne and Mayer, 1993</xref>). More recently, empirical tools such as Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation have been produced to elicit and compare different actors’ views and values on environmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510385310">Kallis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510385310">Gamboa and Munda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510385310">Scolobig et al., 2008</xref>). These are examples of deliberate attempts to incorporate local discourses about desired futures into the processes of knowledge production and decision making. However, recognizing a multiplicity of values alone may fail to acknowledge the unequal distribution of resources and access to decision making often found at the bottom of environmental disputes. Ultimately, it is not possible to demarcate environmental science and the political context within which it is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510385310">Forsyth, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This article contends that expectations from locally based research projects need to be understood within the political context in which the environmental project is developed. The article understands these expectations as performative and situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510385310">Brown et al., 2000a</xref>). The formation of collective expectations can be explained partially with reference to the political context in which they emerge, by observing the alignment between the generation of future-orientations and specific interests surrounding a land regeneration project. The examination of a case-study of land regeneration in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina contributes empirical evidence to this hypothesis. The article is divided in four sections. Section 2 discusses the sociology of expectations, outlining the contribution of this study to existing theoretical debates. Section 3 presents the case study of a land regeneration project to investigate solutions for coal ash remediation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, analysing the political context of the project, and how different expectations emerge around those political positions. A discussion of the empirical findings in the light of the theoretical debates of the sociology of expectations brings the article to a close in Section 4.</p>

<title>2. The sociology of expectations</title>
<p>Studies of environmental conflicts around land management projects do not always engage with the multiplicity of expectations that emerge around the practice of research and development. Economics-based understandings of “rational expectations” assume that people plan for the future based upon what they think will change in the world and how other people will respond to those changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510385310">Peterson, 2000</xref>). However, these models rely largely on methodological individualist ideas that assume that actors are able to make realistic predictions of the future, regardless of uncertainties, and, thus, they presume human expectations and associated behaviour as convergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510385310">Peterson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the concept of expectations, as beliefs centred in the future about something that should occur or that is perceived as likely to occur, emerges in a wide range of analyses of environmental governance and policy. For example, the literature on public participation in environmental governance often refers to the role of actors’ expectations in shaping participatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510385310">Chess and Purcell, 1999</xref>). In general, expectations are thought to play a role in shaping public perceptions of environmental science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510385310">Rebetez, 1996</xref>), but their role in the production of knowledge in environmental conflicts has not been sufficiently examined.</p>
<p>The literature on the sociology of expectations takes a different stance on how expectations can be conceptualized and analysed. This literature engages with the future “as an object of critique in its own right, refraining entirely from attempts to predict or envisage the future of today’s emerging innovations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510385310">Brown and Michael, 2003</xref>: 5). Rather than looking into how the future will look, they conceptualize the future as a situated, temporal abstraction and analyse how specific future-orientations, or expectations, are constructed and managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510385310">Brown et al., 2000b</xref>). Expectations, as statements about what is to come, are “explicitly linked to time and implicitly linked to tacitly-held knowledges” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510385310">Selin, 2007</xref>: 198).</p>
<p>The sociology of expectations is mainly connected with studies of technology development. These studies “emphasize the co-construction of particular scientific visions of the development of the technology, novel research agendas and experimental technologies, emerging industrial structures and new ethical discourses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510385310">Hedgecoe and Martin, 2003</xref>: 328). In this vein, the sociology of expectations has explored technology and scientific fields such as nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510385310">Selin, 2007</xref>), medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510385310">Rosengarten and Michael, 2009</xref>), pharmacogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510385310">Hedgecoe and Martin, 2003</xref>), gene-therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510385310">Horst, 2007</xref>), communication technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510385310">Geels and Smit, 2000</xref>) and electronic commerce and interactive TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510385310">Konrad, 2006b</xref>). These studies focus on the activities of actors involved in the generation of new technologies, such as researchers, technicians, policy makers, industry and critics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510385310">Hedgecoe and Martin, 2003</xref>). In addition, questions about the public reactions to technology and science, such as how different publics generate and contest expectations capable of shaping the future and how resistance to hegemonic futures is mobilized, are relevant for the sociology of expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510385310">Brown and Michael, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The main insight of the sociology of expectations is their understanding of future-orientations as “performative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510385310">Brown et al., 2000a</xref>). In this vein, the sociology of expectations has looked into how expectations are capable of shaping both the present and the future. They influence not only the social construction of technology but also how the development of such technology comes to be understood and represented. The term “performativity” is related, above all, to the material presence of abstract discourses about the future: they are enacted in both language and action and shape responses to future anticipations. They are also oriented towards the process, entangling both the construction of the present and the projection of this present into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510385310">Rosengarten and Michael, 2009</xref>). However, while they are potent constituting resources, expectations may also be highly unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510385310">Brown and Michael, 2003</xref>). Expectations have been pointed out as being central for understanding the process of technological change driving innovations in two ways: being translated into searching heuristics and serving as tools for the enrolment of actors that could enable the innovation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510385310">Raven et al., 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Expectations are linked to the temporal context in which they emerge and they often reflect broad cultural concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510385310">Geels and Smit, 2000</xref>). Being temporally and culturally situated, expectations can be understood in relation to the location of relevant actors within a network of relationships and the specific interactions between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510385310">Brown and Michael, 2003</xref>). The interests and motivations of different actors are likely to shape actors’ expectations. Future-orientations are always open to contestation by different social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510385310">Brown et al., 2000b</xref>), but they may also function as “coordination devices” between different actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510385310">Konrad, 2006b</xref>). Analyses of the formation of expectations have led to identifying links between the stabilization of future-orientations and the alignment of strategies of heterogeneous actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510385310">Konrad, 2006a</xref>). In bounding together practice and imaginaries, collective expectations mobilize actors and establish different sets of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510385310">Hyysalo, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on the public understanding of science has emphasized the contextual and complex composition of actors and relations within those actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510385310">Irwin and Michael, 2003</xref>). Expectations need to be characterized as complex and temporally situated. On the other hand, the linkage between expectations and actors’ motivations, and the coordinating functions performed by expectations, remains unaccounted for. The concept of “collective expectations,” as the expectations of generalized others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510385310">Konrad, 2006b</xref>) may help explaining how relatively stable expectations become part of the social repertoire. Konrad argues that both individual and social expectations are the result of social interaction, and in particular “[c]ollective expectations emerge as a result of the exchange of expectations between large numbers of actors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510385310">2006b</xref>: 431). Social expectations are constructed with reference to discursive devices that are employed in a variety of public and private settings.</p>
<p>Some insights from the sociological tradition of Symbolic Interactionism (SI) could help to illuminate the process of formation of collective expectations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510385310">Blumer (1998[1969]</xref>) Symbolic Interactionist scholars share three premises: (1) human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings ascribed to these things; (2) things’ meaning is derived from social interaction between individuals; and (3) these meanings are modified through an ongoing, changeable, interpretative process. Sociology handbooks often summarize this approach in W.I. Thomas’s phrase: “If men [sic] define situations as real, they are real in their consequences” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510385310">Janowitz, 1966</xref>). This is not akin to a relativist approach; rather SI is regarded as a ‘down-to-earth’ approach to the study of human group life and human conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510385310">Blumer, 1998[1969]</xref>). Equally, expectations are grounded on meanings that are built through the interaction of individuals and modified through an interpretative process. Insofar as expectations are constructed as a shared reality, “they are real in their consequences”, which brings the argument back to the performative aspect of expectations.</p>
<p>Thomas’s concept of ‘definition of the situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510385310">Thomas, 1923</xref>) was developed to explain why individuals or groups of individuals may be “unadjusted” to the “normal” context in which they live. According to Thomas, a “definition of the situation” precedes any action. This is not restricted to concrete acts, but rather, it may develop in a series of habits that determine behaviour. He argued that some individuals fail to adjust to social conventions because of the rivalry between individual definitions of the situation and collective, or normal, definitions of the situation. He explained that “morality is thus the generally accepted definition of the situation, whether expressed in public opinion and the unwritten law, in a formal legal code, or in religious commandments or prohibitions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510385310">Thomas, 1923</xref>: 43).</p>
<p>The emergence of collective expectations, as expectations of generalized others, can be explained by referring to their articulation within shared definitions of the situation. Collective expectations are enacted in articulations of the future within specific definitions of the situation. Moreover, such definitions of the situation are explicitly linked with established moral (and political) positions. Although definitions of the situation are often shared by more than one individual, they may not establish the grounds of a collective morality. Rather, different definitions of the situation compete for legitimization in the political process. Collective expectations denote expectations that are part of shared social repertoires. These repertoires can be appropriated and performed by social groups in order to develop and advance specific definitions of the situation.</p>
<p>In the context of the sociology of expectations, this article aims to understand the processes whereby different social groups construct expectations around specific scientific and technological practices. Rather than focusing on a broad field of technology development and the public discourses emerging around it, the article focuses on the development of expectations around a temporal and spatially situated scientific project. In doing so, the article demonstrates the relevance of the sociology of expectations to understand the development of land regeneration projects within their social and political context. A case study is analyzed with attention to two main questions: What are the specific future-orientations performed by the publics affected by or influencing a scientific and technical project? How do they relate with the specific social and political context in which they emerge, as articulated in situated definitions of the situation? This approach allows bringing together insights from both the sociology of expectation and the literature on knowledge disputes around environmental conflicts by explicitly situating collective expectations within their political context. The sociology of expectations links the emergence of political discourses and collective expectations. The analysis suggests that expectations of scientific or technological practices need to be understood with reference to the specific political positions from which such orientations are expressed. While future-orientations may shape the political debate, the political debate is also generative of such expectations.</p>

<title>3. Collective expectations of a land regeneration project in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina</title>
<p>RECOAL (Re-integration of coal ash disposal sites in the western Balkans) was a project designed to develop sustainable and low-cost solutions for the regeneration of coal ash disposal sites in the western Balkans, focusing on the city of Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project ran from January 2005 to January 2008 and was largely funded by the 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development of the European Union. The research team included research organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Austria, Germany and the UK. This section describes the emergence of local expectations around this project and situates them within a wider political and social context. The section is divided in three parts describing (1) the political context of coal-energy generation in Tuzla; (2) the development of the project RECOAL; and (3) the emergence of expectations around the project RECOAL.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963662510385310">
<title>Nationalist politics and coal ash disposal in Tuzla</title>
<p>Thermoelektrana Tuzla (TEP) celebrated its jubilee in 2009: 50 years producing energy for the country. With a total installed capacity of 715 MW, TEP is one of the main producers of electricity in the country, and a cornerstone in the development of the industry within the region. During its 50 years in existence, TEP has been at the centre of the economic politics of the country. In the Bosnian war (1992–95) energy plants were strategic objectives and often targeted by shelling and bombings. The conflict was followed by a considerable effort to reconstruct the facilities and infrastructure in the energy sector. Another major impact of the war in the energy sector was the sudden change in the institutional and economic conditions for electricity production.</p>
<p>The Dayton agreement, which concluded the war, established ethnic quotas of “constituent peoples” (Croat, Bosniak and Serb<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510385310">1</xref></sup>) set to guarantee that each group has equal influence in decision making. In parallel, government and economic organizations have also become divided along ethnic lines. Since 1945 and until the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Electric Utility of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ElektroBiH), a state owned vertically integrated utility, had authority over the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After 1992 three ethnically led electricity utilities replaced ElektroBiH: Elektroprivreda Bosnia and Herzegovina (EP BH); Elektroprivreda Hervatske Zajednica Herceg-Bosne (EP HZHB) and Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska (EP RS). The three EPs function as independent vertically integrated utilities with an assigned territory, according to artificially established ethnic borders, where they control the electricity market. The plant in Tuzla, TEP, is under the control of the Bosniak-oriented EP BH from Sarajevo. This is at odds with the municipal government, which has since independence been controlled by the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Socijaldemokratska Partija BiH ), a centre-left political party successor to the Communist league of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the party confirmed its stronghold in Tuzla in the October 2008 elections).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the transition to a market economy meant that former Yugoslavia socialist ideologies were replaced by neoliberal discourses of capital investment and profitability. During the last years, the energy sector in BiH, under the guidance of international organizations, has followed the trend towards deregulation of the power industry. These institutional changes have had a considerable impact on the functioning of utility companies. For example, TEP Tuzla has seen large public and private investments to modernize its infrastructure with actions such as the reconstruction of three of its seven generation blocks, changes to automatic controls and modernization of the boilers. However, the ethnically-based organizational structure has not been challenged.</p>
<p>At its current capacity, the plant produces circa 0.9 million m<sup>3</sup> of coal ash per year, which is mixed with water and pumped into nearby valleys enclosed with dykes. Since the plant in Tuzla started its operation, approximately 29,500,000 m<sup>3</sup> of coal ash have been disposed of in five disposal sites, occupying 157 ha of land and rapidly growing. Settlements existed prior to the disposal of coal ash in the surrounding area. Initially, the dumping sites covered common forested areas and abandoned mines but, after 50 years, the area and depth of deposits crept close to settlements affecting local homes and gardens. Fierce opposition to the disposal sites has emerged among local residents since the late 1980s. Local opposition has fostered intense lobbying by community and environmental groups that has successfully halted the development of a new site in an abandoned coal mine used by local residents for recreation purposes. In the late 1980s and early 1990s some of the sites were covered with a thin layer of soil (20-50 cm).</p>
<p>One of the impacts of the armed conflict and the subsequent Dayton agreement has been the fragmentation of the institutional structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into two main “entities” (like “sub-countries”), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), and one independent district (Brčko). Each entity had developed a constitution during the war: the RS was conceived as a unitary state divided into municipalities and the FBiH as a federation of smaller territorial units, the cantons, which in turn were split into several municipalities. Tuzla is both a municipality and the first city of a canton within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This means that the institutional structure regarding environmental decision making in Tuzla comprises at least five levels: the national level, the “entity” level, the cantonal level, the municipal level and the local level (settlements are organized in “local communities,” <italic>mjesna zaenica</italic>, with their own representative and a secretary). Such institutional organization limits the capacity of government structures to enforce environmental regulations, provide environmental services and enable environmental action mainly because of disputes over authority, distribution of competences and allocation of resources.</p>
<p>The conflict around the disposal of coal ash in areas surrounding Tuzla is shaped by the encroachment of nationalism in government and industry and the lack of capacity of institutions to regulate the industry or provide services to those affected by environmental pollution in the face of a growing national interest in the coal-energy industry. Local residents have lived “under the shadow of the power plant” for five decades, but now, they claim, the local impacts of the plant on their livelihoods and quality of life are not being appropriately recognized and acted upon. A locally organized “green group” (Eko-zeleni) has taken action to alert the media about their situation and has catalyzed civil action to demand industry responsibilities regarding both coal ash disposal and air pollution, but, according to their accounts, they have obtained a sparse response. The municipality is engaged in a double negotiation with TEP at the local level with the objectives of forcing TEP to adhere to existing environmental regulation (this would require TEP to pay retrospectively for the pollution caused) and recuperating the ownership of the disused disposal sites. Their only “winning card” is the concession of environmental permits to build new disposal sites. In this context, the cantonal authorities on urban and regional planning are in charge of elaborating development plans for the region and, thus, they need to balance both the economic development and the quality of life needs of the area.</p>
<p>The conflict does not show signs of receding. During the last few years, as the result of the enforcement of regulations akin to environmental assessment policies in the European Union, TEP has held several consultation meetings with local communities. According to the 50-year anniversary press release recent investments in the plant have helped to meet “European ecologic standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510385310">Elektroprivreda BiH, 2010</xref>) in an attempt to address the demands of local residents. However, the encroachment of coal ash disposal in the landscapes and residences around Tuzla make it difficult for TEP to present itself in a more favourable light.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510385310">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Research on remediation of coal ash: risk and public demands</title>
<p>RECOAL used five coal ash disposal sites in Tulza to develop and test potential solutions for coal ash remediation. During the first year, the research team undertook a preliminary risk assessment that identified health and environmental risks associated with the disposal sites. The analysis suggested that the sites posed environmental risks because of the concentrations of compounds such as arsenic species and sulphates, but denied claims of local residents about the potential radioactivity of the coal ash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510385310">Dellantonio et al., 2008</xref>). During the second and third years of the project, several low-cost site regeneration options were tested such as the addition of a soil cap or the addition of organic amendments.</p>
<p>In parallel, socioeconomic research evaluated local demands associated with the management of coal ash disposal sites, and the local acceptability and feasibility of the proposed solutions. The research, carried out in several stages by UK-based researchers and local contractors, used qualitative analysis of interviews with government officials, industry representatives, local residents and non-governmental organization (NGO) workers to determine the local demands on the coal ash disposal sites. The research identified a general preoccupation with the safety of the sites and their implications on health and safety for local residents and visitors. Local residents, specifically, expressed concerns about the negative image of their communities as polluted expressed by visitors and outsiders, and demanded the enforcement of clear regulations according to “European standards” (this has influenced TEP’s later press release, as explained above). The research also suggested that rather than focusing on the possibility of cultivating the sites – which seemed inextricably linked to the transference of pollutants through the food chain – the project could turn to looking at the potential for establishing a tree plantation on the sites, a favoured option among local residents.</p>
<p>At a later stage of the project, two contractors (the Centre for Ecology and Energy (Tuzla) and Ethos research (UK)) organized and managed a workshop in Tuzla to present, review and disseminate the findings of the project on 10 July 2007. The aim was to bring together members of the project RECOAL with different social actors who might have an interest in the issue of coal ash disposal, including local communities, government, industry, NGOs and academics. Among the 58 delegates, local residents were heavily under-represented. The workshop received media attention and was considered a success by its organizers. However, during the workshop, there were few opportunities to relate the problem of coal ash disposal with the underlying political debate: it was more as vehicle for the communication of RECOAL results than a forum for locally meaningful debate about the future of the disposal sites.</p>
<p>In August 2008, six months after RECOAL was finished, qualitative research was carried out to evaluate the local views on the project and its legacy. Interviews with 33 individuals were used to situate the positions of different actors within the local debate about coal ash disposal, and more widely about the future of the coal-energy industry in Tuzla, by identifying diverging accounts of the definition of the situation, and linking them to manifested expectations of the local impact of RECOAL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662510385310">Table 1</xref>). Interviewees’ involvement in RECOAL ranged from having observed and informally spoken with a member of RECOAL to having actively participated in RECOAL as a member of the project team or as a contractor. Half of them had attended RECOAL’s workshop in July 2010.</p>

<p>One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with the assistance of an interpreter to enquire specifically about the expectations of interviewees regarding the local impact of RECOAL. All interviews were taped and translated from Bosnian into English and analyzed with specialist software. The analysis focused on mapping different visions and proposals for the future paying attention to how these visions tied in with specific interests and proposals for action in the context of coal ash disposal.</p>

<title>The politics of collective expectations in Tuzla</title>
<p>The interviews cluster around three different groups of collective definitions of the situation regarding coal ash disposal in Tuzla. The first group focuses on the continuity of life in the settlements around the coal ash disposal sites articulated as “the community-survival view,” articulated mostly by local residents and some NGOs. The second group focuses on the continuity and future of the coal-energy industry, articulated as “the cost-rational view” by TEP managers, consultants and some NGOs that do not align themselves with the “community-survival view.” The third group focuses on the development of Tuzla as a region, articulated as “the sustainable-planning view” by institutional representatives. RECOAL’s expectations are related to the specific definitions of the situation, and the result of the project is assumed to be able to confirm actors’ assumptions about the environmental problem. According to the analysis, expectations varied systematically with the actor’s position, although there was a degree of intra-group variation. For example, some local residents articulated arguments that resonated with the “sustainable-planning view,” but situated them within broader concerns about the future of their community.</p>
<p>Local residents articulating “a community-survival view” presented the problem of coal ash as externally imposed on them. Some regarded it as part of a status quo to be accepted, others as a source of consternation and protest; in all instances, they highlighted that TEP’s activities have a negative impact on “their” environment: “[powerful] people are aware that they cannot close TEP, because it is in the interest of the State, but those people have to be aware as well that I care about my life at risk, about my health and that our children are leaving because of that.” The “community” was portrayed as “endangered” by TEP’s presence and their livelihoods as compromised by industrial decline in the region where those who have the power to remediate the local situation ignore it. Local residents perceive TEP as a powerful and distant actor, protected by politicians on account of nationalist affiliations and nepotism, against which local residents are victimized and powerless, a David-against-Goliath type of conflict that parallels other black-and-white accounts of environmental struggle with “good” local residents and “bad” corporate interests. This account is part of the everyday life of local residents in Tuzla, shaping both their interactions with other actors and expectations of them.</p>
<p>In line with previous research by RECOAL, most local residents reported that they felt isolated and unsupported by their local government. Even though some of them highlighted quasi-heroic political actions by some individuals, they described their country as governed by erratic political processes, or even controlled by vested interests owing to nationalism. Within this definition of the situation, RECOAL was invoked as an arbiter who could provide factual evidence about the “reality” of the situation, because of its independence and because it transcended the nationalist debate. RECOAL could, therefore, produce the “facts” to prove the concerns of local residents about the effects of coal ash disposal. According to this view, science (instead of “talk” or “politics”) should be at the centre of the discussion: the “truth” of science is regarded as transcending local politics. Local expectations of RECOAL were built upon the need to find support for what was presented as a collective experience of pollution. RECOAL was expected to provide the final proof of the injustices committed against local communities and disseminate the results among actors capable of taking remedial action: “if one keeps repeating that they pollute, then they will find a way out, a solution.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the “cost-rational view”, which refers to the view attributed to TEP by its employees and other individuals concerned with the continuity of the industry, refers to TEP as an industry implementing the best technologies available and taking care of the environment according to well-known rational “facts,” which have to be balanced with “costs.” TEP’s work is regarded as hindered by fruitless political debate fostered by a minority group of local residents who are depicted as either irrational or dishonest (all through RECOAL’s development and during the evaluation interviews local claims about the environment were dismissed as being the product of individuals taking advantage of the situation for personal gain). Investments in ecology-related projects were presented as signs that “TEP cared” about its surrounding environment.</p>
<p>In line with this view, TEP defendants assumed that RECOAL could demonstrate that the environmental impacts of the coal ash disposal sites on the local population were within legally allowed levels. They expected “real” results of research that they could apply “according to their needs” to explain that the damage caused by the plant “is not as big as it is thought in unofficial circles.” RECOAL was expected to provide “positive results” that would confirm TEP’s arguments that the impacts of the disposal sites on the environment and the local communities are minimal. Moreover, RECOAL was seen as a tool to promote “trust” among local communities “because people trust international institutions more than they trust us.” According to TEP workers, if RECOAL results showed a significant environmental risk, the issue of the coal ash disposal sites would be transformed into a “political question.” In the context of working for a polluting industry, positive results were regarded as scientific and negative results as political, even though both positive and negative results have scientific and political relevance. Likewise, local residents, defendants of this view, hoped that RECOAL would provide “real” results about the risks of the disposal sites. While local residents argued that something must be done about serious risks posed by the ash, individuals aligned with TEP sought confirmation of what they regard as acceptable or negligible risks and pollution impacts.</p>
<p>Local government representatives claimed to be reporting the “institutional view” separated from their own personal opinion. This view can be referred to as “the sustainable-planning view” because it aimed at simultaneously meeting environmental protection and economic development concerns through the use of planning tools such as development plants and the concession of permits. RECOAL expectations were thus articulated in terms of their potential contribution to the development and implementation of these tools.</p>
<p>The municipality operates a strategy of bargaining with TEP. The interviews elicited that municipal officials hope to achieve three goals: (1) to recuperate the disposal sites for further use in order to ameliorate the pressing problem of land scarcity; (2) to identify appropriate methods and locations for TEP’s waste disposal; and (3) to get TEP to fund different initiatives to improve health protection and re-establish the trust with local communities. These objectives cannot be met should TEP be forced to close; rather, it is in the interest of the municipality to keep TEP open and to find ways to make it cooperate. For example, the municipality negotiates the concession of disposal permits for TEP in exchange for certain environmental measures and payment of environmental taxes. Moreover, negotiating the transfer of ownership of disused coal ash disposal sites may help in dealing with current land scarcity problems within the municipality. The flat areas of the disposal sites could help the municipality to locate services and infrastructure (proposals include a small airport, a hippodrome, a sports centre, a cemetery, small production units or a trailer park). However, the transfer of ownership would also require the municipality to deal with any liabilities for environmental pollution on the sites. Nationalist-based tension between the municipality and TEP is casting a shadow over these negotiations. RECOAL is expected to provide some answers regarding the safe uses of the disposal sites, which could give a winning card to the municipality, but the expectation is that the weight of the struggle will be dealt with by municipal officials.</p>
<p>The canton does not negotiate directly with TEP. Its main duty is the development of spatial plans that may direct the municipality’s decisions, requiring both “politics and science”: The problem of land scarcity emerging from a legacy of industrial decay requires the canton to find space for pressing competing uses. However, citizens are mobilized against some land uses. Having a weak authority and limited resources, the canton authorities struggle to deal with public opposition. Cantonal officials required of RECOAL some form of formal communication that they could “use”. Although cantonal representatives had attended the workshop, participated in four formal interviews with members of the project and consultants, and had electronic access to all RECOAL’s public information, they still felt the need for RECOAL to produce a document endorsed by the “signatures” of relevant institutional representatives, which would confer validity on its results. According to these officials, the formal style (rather than scrutiny of content) confers “truth” status upon the results.</p>
<p>In summary, expectations of RECOAL held by local residents were related to their self-portrait as victims of an irresponsible industry and a powerless, or corrupt, government. They expected international projects to play the role of arbiters between them and the industry. Because they perceived the situation as unjust, they expected those “arbiters” to recognize that injustice and move other parties to do something about it. In contrast, individuals who defended TEP’s position expected RECOAL to provide independent evidence of TEP’s efforts to operate the plant in the best possible way. These expectations related to their account of TEP being unfairly blamed for environmental problems beyond its responsibility. Similar to local residents, TEP supporters expected RECOAL to play the role of an arbiter that would help others recognize its efforts to reduce the power plant’s impact on the environment. The canton and the municipality were found to be struggling to balance the objectives of finding safe solutions for the disposal sites and ensuring that TEP paid a fair price for the environmental damage caused. Whereas the municipality was engaged in adversarial negotiations with TEP, bargaining for the ownership of the sites, the canton favoured a consensual approach, relying on the capacity of science to reconcile different perspectives. Both of them expected TEP to provide instrumental information that could contribute to their development and enforcement of planning and regulation tools.</p>
<p>The extracts and context given in the above sections show that different actors expected to use the results of RECOAL to support their own definition of a situation and their characterization of other actors. With the exception of cantonal representatives, all collective definitions of the situation described the relationship with generalized others as adversarial. Almost all intervieweess attributed an arbiter role to RECOAL, and most believed that RECOAL would provide them with evidence supporting their positions in the form of “true facts,” although institutional representatives referred to it as secondary input to the core of their work of balancing political interests. Although the expectations of the project were different, they all related to expressed definitions of the political and environmental situation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662510385310">Table 2</xref>).</p>
