<abstract>
<p>Despite urgent need for innovation, adaptation, and change in health care, few tools enable researchers or practitioners to assess the extent to which health care facilities perform as learning organizations or the effects of initiatives that require learning. This study’s objective was to develop and test a short-form Learning Organization Survey to fill this gap. The authors applied exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to data from Veterans Health Administration personnel to derive a short-form survey and then conducted further confirmatory factor analysis and factor invariance testing on additional Veterans Health Administration data to evaluate the short form. Results suggest that a 27-item, 7-factor survey (2 environmental factors, 1 on leadership, and 4 on concrete learning processes and practices) reliably measures key features of organizational learning, allowing researchers to evaluate theoretical propositions about organizational learning, its antecedents, and outcomes and enabling managers to assess and enhance organizations’ learning capabilities and performance.</p>

<body>
<p>Few industries require more organizational learning—or risk more from failing to learn—than health care. By organizational learning, we mean a process by which outcomes, such as adaptation to change, greater understanding, or improved performance in groups and organizations can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712448135">Argyris &amp; Schon, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712448135">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). The highly complex, hazardous, and changing environment in which health care organizations operate challenges their ability to achieve these outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712448135">Gaba, 2000</xref>). In addition, given that major failure can result in loss of life, health care organizations must also learn from small failures through experimentation to prevent problems from occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712448135">Sitkin, 1992</xref>). Challenges associated with organization learning may affect major reform initiatives such as patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) and accountable care organizations (ACOs), which call for fundamental transformation of relationships and processes within the health care delivery system and will, therefore, require experimentation and adaptation. Similarly, calls for the adoption of electronic health records and health information exchange challenge health care organizations to learn to meaningfully use these new technologies.</p>
<p>To productively adapt to the complex, hazardous, and changing organizational landscape, to absorb and act on exponentially increasing quantities of clinical information, and to continuously improve delivery system policies and processes, health care facilities must become “learning organizations” (Chassin, Galvin, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712448135">the National Roundtable on Health Care Quality, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712448135">Senge, 1990</xref>). Learning is a process of gaining information, understanding, or capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712448135">Garvin, 2000</xref>). Organizational learning refers to a complex process that differs from individual learning because it requires individuals to collectively analyze and interpret organizational experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712448135">Kim, 1993</xref>). Employees in learning organizations create, acquire, and transfer knowledge, enabling organizations to adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712448135">Garvin, Edmondson, &amp; Gino, 2008</xref>). Learning organizations are those that provide environments that foster such learning, and are characterized by tolerance, experimentation, open discussion of errors, and systemic thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712448135">Cannon &amp; Edmondson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712448135">Garvin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712448135">Senge, 1990</xref>). Health care organizations’ capacity for innovation, adaptation, and change to achieve improved patient experience, per capita cost, and population health depends on their ability to become learning organizations.</p>
<p>Abundant evidence suggests learning challenges in health care organizations, including sustaining total quality management programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712448135">Carman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712448135">Wilson, Berwick, &amp; Cleary, 2003</xref>) and implementing new technologies that require changing routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712448135">Edmondson, Bohmer, &amp; Pisano, 2001</xref>). Many also suffer recurrent problems because they do not learn from their failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712448135">Tucker &amp; Edmondson, 2003</xref>). Conversely, routine learning among disciplines and across organizations has contributed to health care improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712448135">Horbar, Plsek, &amp; Leahy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Health care organizations have developed initiatives to promote organizational learning and potentially redress shortcomings. For example, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement sponsors learning collaboratives, which provide training in quality improvement techniques and promote interorganizational learning. To support learning in its medical facilities, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has engaged top leadership, appointed designated learning officers, incorporated learning-related goals into the performance plans of senior managers, and surveyed employees about their perceptions of the learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712448135">Hunter, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712448135">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>If policies and practices are to promote innovation, adaptation, and change in health care, researchers and practitioners must be able to assess the extent to which organizations perform as learning organizations. Health care organizations must understand their learning capabilities to improve learning and enhance implementation of initiatives that require learning. Increasing evidence suggests that measuring specific learning behaviors can promote behavior change and learning in health care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712448135">Nembhard &amp; Tucker, 2011</xref>). A reliable, valid, and brief measure of organization learning would enable managers to diagnose learning problems and assign remedies. It would also facilitate the evaluation of initiatives designed to promote organizational learning, providing a potentially more responsive indicator than blunt outcomes such as employee satisfaction or turnover. Similarly, researchers could use such a tool to test the theoretical proposition that learning organizations are more adept at innovation, adaptation, and change. They could also discover conditions that make learning more likely to occur.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This article describes the development and psychometric evaluation of a short-form Learning Organization Survey (LOS) for use in health care organizations. Specifically, we confirmed the dimensionality of the LOS in a health care setting and developed a version with 27 items that could be completed in 10 to 15 minutes, the LOS-27. This tool enables managers to assess current levels of support for organization learning and thereby identify steps necessary to enhance it and allows researchers to compare learning across organizations and constructs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077558712448135">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>While several popular safety climate instruments assess collective learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712448135">Singer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712448135">Sorra &amp; Nieva, 2003</xref>), few tools enable managers to examine organizational learning in a sufficiently granular way as to pinpoint areas needing improvement. Originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712448135">Garvin et al. (2008)</xref>, the LOS is a 55-item survey measuring the learning that occurs in any organizational unit (department, project, or division) where employees engage in meaningful shared or overlapping work activities. Based on two decades of research, the LOS examines three broad “building blocks” shown to be essential for organizational learning and adaptability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712448135">Figure 1</xref>). Focused on the environment, processes and practices, and leadership, respectively, the strong presence of these building blocks is expected to correlate with more learning and thus better organizational performance. Each block and its hypothesized subcomponents are regarded as making independent contributions to the ability of groups of individuals to learn collectively, with the combination of blocks producing synergies that create optimal learning conditions. As their image implies, the blocks build on each other in that both leadership that reinforces learning and a supportive learning environment promote engagement in learning processes and practices. Different learning mechanisms underlie each building block, and each requires different supporting activities. Inconsistencies within a given organization, and differences among organizations, may occur within and across these three blocks.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077558712448135-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The first building block is a supportive learning environment, including subcomponents addressing psychological safety, appreciation of differences, openness to new ideas, and time for reflection. Concrete learning processes and practices, including experimentation, information collection, analysis, education and training, and information transfer comprise the second building block. The third building block is leadership that reinforces learning, including behaviors such as listening and providing resources.</p>
<p>The strengths of the LOS include its conceptual grounding in extensive organizational research, its use among organizations in many industries and by managers across all departments and levels of organizational hierarchy and the availability of benchmark data. The LOS is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://los.hbs.edu">http://los.hbs.edu</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Although the LOS enjoys substantial face validity, assessment of its psychometric properties has been limited and as yet unpublished. Development of the original instrument relied on a sample of one or a few senior executives from each participating organization, precluding assessment of subcomponent reliability at the group or organizational level. Furthermore, at 55 items, the instrument is relatively long. Such respondent burden may be particularly problematic in health care organizations plagued by survey fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712448135">Asch, Jedrziewski, &amp; Christakis, 1997</xref>). For this reason, the VHA requested that we develop a version of the LOS consisting of no more than about 30 items (3 items per subcomponent).</p>
<p>In developing the short-form LOS, we sought a balance between retaining the original conceptual model and sufficient item phrasing to preserve comparability across industries on one hand and the need to substantially reduce survey length and to ensure relevance to the health care sector on the other. We also retained the original response options, using a 5-point frequency scale (<italic>never</italic> to <italic>always</italic>) for the leadership items and a 7-point accuracy scale (<italic>highly inaccurate</italic> to <italic>highly accurate</italic>) for all others. The LOS-27 survey was developed with sponsorship from the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations and the VHA Employee Education System.</p>

<title>Psychometric Analysis</title>
<p>We randomly split an archival data set collected from VHA supervisory employees into derivation and validation halves. In a derivation study, we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multitrait analysis (MTA), and content analysis in the derivation sample to reduce the number of items from 55 to 27. Then in a validation study, we assessed the structure of that short form using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the validation sample. The VHA subsequently administered the short-form instrument to nonsupervisors as well as supervisors, and we conducted further CFA and factor invariance testing using this all-employee data to assess the fit of the model developed on the supervisory sample. The EFA was conducted using SPSS; CFA and factor invariance testing used AMOS.</p>

<title>Exploratory factor analysis</title>
<p>We conducted EFA with maximum likelihood extraction and varimax rotation on the derivation sample to explore the plausibility of the 10-factor structure of the original LOS. As factor analysis requires complete records, we chose listwise deletion to handle cases with missing data. Listwise deletion eliminated 2,589 (18.89%) respondents, leaving 11,336 supervisors. We compared responses of supervisors with no missing data to those with partial data. Mean differences by factor ranged from .02 for the factor eventually named Knowledge Acquisition to .13 for Supportive Learning Environment with effect size differences from .01 to .10, respectively, leading us to believe that the differences were not important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712448135">Cohen, 1988</xref>). To determine the number of factors to extract, we used the eigenvalue-greater-than-one decision rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712448135">Kaiser, 1960</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712448135">Cattell’s (1966)</xref> criteria for identifying breaks in the slope of factors plotted against the eigenvalues. We also considered the consistency of the empirically derived factor structure with the set of theoretically determined scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712448135">
<title>Multitrait analysis</title>
<p>We conducted MTA to evaluate the basic psychometric properties of the EFA-derived scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712448135">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). MTA establishes reliability by assessing internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and convergent and discriminant validity, respectively, by comparing the strength of each item’s correlation with its assigned scale to its correlations with the remaining proposed scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712448135">Hays &amp; Hayashi, 1990</xref>). We computed proposed scale scores by averaging with equal weight those items with loading coefficients greater than or equal to .40 for a given factor. We provisionally assigned items with loadings of .40 or higher on two different factors to the factor with the highest loading. MTA identified several items that could be dropped from the instrument without reducing scale quality (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077558712448135">appendix</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712448135">
<title>Content considerations</title>
<p>We carefully evaluated items to ensure the inclusion of those central to the measurement of a learning organization according to Garvin et al.’s (2008) conceptual model. We also made minor modifications to item wording to make the language more consistent with other VHA surveys (e.g., changed “unit” to “workgroup”), more familiar to health sector workers (e.g., changed “prototypes” to “pilots”), and to clarify minor ambiguities (e.g., changed “systematically collects” to “consistently collects”). Furthermore, two factors derived from the original instrument reflected similar content, but one used negative and the other positive phrasing, reflecting an unsafe and safe environment respectively. In the short form, we elected to retain predominantly positive items to cover that content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077558712448135">
<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712448135">Kaiser’s (1960)</xref> eigenvalue-greater-than-one criterion suggested an eight-factor solution, and Cattell’s scree test suggested six or eight factors. We elected to retain eight factors given greater consistency with the theoretical framework. Subsequent iterative MTAs and removal of questions demonstrating low-relevance, redundancy, potential unresponsiveness, or scaling failure resulted in a 27-item, 7-factor model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712448135">Table 2</xref>). This model resembled the original 10-factor model except that three subcomponents of the supportive learning environment block and two items from the analysis subcomponent of the learning processes and practices block were combined into one factor. In addition, close examination of items in each subcomponent led to the renaming of several constructs to better reflect their content: from “information collection” to “performance monitoring,” from “education and training” to “training,” and from “information transfer” to “knowledge acquisition.” Overall, items loaded cleanly on single factors. Where cross-loadings existed, the primary loadings were substantially higher, and the secondary loadings appeared to represent reasonable relationships across factors. For instance, the relatively high loading of the experimentation item, “This unit experiments frequently with new ways of working,” on the psychological safety factor underscores the interpersonal risk associated with experimenting with new ways of doing things in workgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712448135">Edmondson et al., 2001</xref>). These items also reflected unique content, considered important for learning organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712448135">Garvin, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Validation Study</title>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>CFA was applied using the validation half of the original supervisory sample. In addition, in January 2010, the revised survey (LOS-27) was one of three modules included in a multipurpose design to obtain data to inform several ongoing improvement efforts. All employees with e-mail addresses were invited to participate; 45% of those who logged into the survey at each facility received the LOS-27 module. As a percentage of delivered e-mails, the response rate was 33.4%, resulting in a sample of <italic>N</italic> = 27,754 for the LOS-27 module. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712448135">Table 1</xref> shows that respondents were predominantly female (63%) and white (67%); 48% were 50 years or older.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077558712448135">
<title>Sample comparison</title>
<p>First, we examined descriptive statistics and internal consistency estimates across samples, comparing the derivation and validation halves of the supervisory sample and the supervisors and nonsupervisors from the all-employee sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077558712448135">
<title>Confirmatory analyses in the supervisory sample</title>
<p>Next, using the validation half of the supervisory sample, we conducted CFA to test the replicability of our empirically derived factor model. We included correlated error terms among items that shared question stems and were thus likely to be correlated more strongly than would be accounted for by the hypothesized latent constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712448135">Cole, Ciesla, &amp; Steiger, 2007</xref>). The analysis used ML estimation of the covariance matrix; listwise deletion was again used to handle cases with missing data, eliminating 3,989 (14.37%) respondents, leaving 23,765 employees. Mean (from .08 for Time for Reflection to .28 for Supportive Learning Environment) and effect size (from .04 to .17, respectively) differences between employees with no missing data to those with partial data were not important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712448135">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077558712448135">
<title>Confirmatory analyses in the all-employee sample</title>
<p>In the sample of all employees, we conducted separate CFAs of the factor model with supervisors and nonsupervisors. Then we conducted invariance testing in the combined all-employee sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712448135">Byrne, 2001</xref>) to determine if the factor loadings, variances, and covariances were equivalent for supervisors and nonsupervisors. To test for invariance, we first estimated the factor model, with no parameter constraints across groups. We then progressively restricted the model by first constraining factor loadings to be equal across the two groups, next constraining variances, and finally also covariances. Since the constrained models were nested within the original, unconstrained model, we examined the difference in chi-square values between models to assess the degree of model misfit resulting from the progressive constraints. In evaluating the fit of the factor model, we applied criteria recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712448135">Brown (2006)</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712448135">Table 3</xref> compares descriptive statistics and internal consistency estimates for the derivation and validation halves from the supervisory sample; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712448135">Table 4</xref> shows results for the supervisors and nonsupervisors from the all-employee sample. Internal reliability estimates for scales in all four groups were similar. Means and standard deviations for the derivation and validation samples were similar, indicating that randomly splitting the samples resulted in comparable groups. In the all-employee sample, supervisors almost always had higher mean scores than nonsupervisory employees, similar to other VHA surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712448135">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712448135">Moore, Willmarth, Osatuke, &amp; Dyrenforth, 2009</xref>). However, similar standard deviations indicate the factors performed similarly across groups despite differences in means.</p>

<p>Based on the all-employee CFAs, factor loadings for both the supervisors and nonsupervisors showed similar patterns to those in the validation sample. In each subgroup, one item demonstrated a slightly lower loading (.42/.43); the others ranged from .74 to .95. Fit indices and factor loadings both indicated good model fit. Setting the factor loadings to be invariant resulted in a small but significant increase in χ<sup>2</sup> (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 45.74, <italic>df</italic> = 20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which we interpreted as inflated by the large sample size. Overall, when we constrained the factor loadings to be equal across groups, results indicated that the items measured the common factors in comparable ways for supervisors and nonsupervisors. The relatively large increases in χ<sup>2</sup> that occurred when we constrained variances, and then variances and covariances, to be equal suggested that the subgroups’ variability on the common factors (variances) and the effects of measurement errors (covariances) are likely to differ somewhat between supervisors and nonsupervisors. Fit indices for these constrained models remained acceptable, however.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we tested the construct validity of a survey instrument originally developed to assess collective learning in any organization and modified to be concise enough for practical use within the oversurveyed health care sector. Our empirical results support a seven-dimensional model of organizational learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712448135">Figure 2</xref>). Two of these dimensions focus on environmental factors, a third is a leadership factor, and the other four address concrete learning processes and practices. The environmental factors include a seven-item <italic>supportive learning environment</italic> factor, which explores whether people feel safe to speak up and make mistakes, appreciate differences in opinions and ways of working, value new ideas, and are thoughtful in decision making. The other environmental factor consists of two items characterizing the unit as making <italic>time for reflection</italic> and improvement rather than focusing only on production. The third factor, <italic>leadership that reinforces learning</italic> (four items), acknowledges the role of managers in leading organizational learning by listening, seeking input, and providing forums and resources that promote dialogue. The four process and practice factors include <italic>experimentation</italic>, with four items that address the extent to which a unit develops and tests new ways of doing things; three <italic>training</italic> items that focus on skill development in both new and experienced employees; <italic>knowledge acquisition</italic> (four items), which assesses a unit’s processes for acquiring information from experts, customers, and its own experience; and <italic>performance monitoring</italic> with three items reflecting a unit’s disciplined approach to monitoring and interpreting data on competitors, best-in-class organizations, and technological trends as ways to promote learning.</p>
<p>Empirical support for the seven-factor model was very strong, with all indices for goodness of fit, internal consistency reliability, and item factor loadings above standards. We also assessed the robustness of the empirically derived factor structure by comparing results across confirmatory samples of supervisors and all employees and found support for the invariance of the model. The factor structure is highly consistent with organizational research and the survey structure hypothesized by authors of the original LOS, including the three building blocks considered essential for organizational learning and adaptability.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest it is possible to reliably measure key features of organizational learning using a 27-item survey, providing opportunities for research and practice. While the ability of users to achieve this potential will depend on its thoughtful administration, the LOS-27 could advance research by enabling tests of hypothesized relationships between organizational learning and performance outcomes, including innovation, adaptation, and change and examination of leaders’ efforts to improve learning. Researchers could also use the LOS-27 to identify conditions that may promote learning in health care settings, such as market competition and to explore differences in perceptions of organizational learning across professional disciplines and organizational hierarchies. The short form also makes more feasible the prospect of combining organizational learning with constructs such as safety culture for purposes of studying their relationships. Health care managers may use this instrument to assess how well their organizations learn, compare their learning capabilities with those of other organizations, identify potential levers for change, and evaluate the success of initiatives to improve learning. The LOS-27 will allow health care managers to pinpoint best practices and opportunities for improving patient experience, population health, and per capita costs. Specific, near-term opportunities lie in examining how learning relates to successful implementation of electronic health records and accomplishment of reforms such as PCMHs and ACOs.</p>
<p>Our psychometric evaluation of the LOS also informs our thinking about dimensions of organizational learning and their interrelatedness by having produced some noteworthy discrepancies with the original conceptualization of organizational learning. First, our analysis indicates that a supportive learning environment may have fewer distinct subcomponents than initially conceived. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712448135">Garvin et al. (2008)</xref> identified four subcomponents of a supportive learning environment; in our study; time for reflection was the only subcomponent that empirical evidence suggested was separable. One explanation is that environmental factors important for organizational learning may be highly integrated, so while theoretically discrete, they may be less likely to vary independently. However, in contrast to the other environmental elements, enhancing time for reflection may require substantially different supporting activities, such as adjustments in scheduling and staffing ratios. Another possibility is that this finding may be unique to the VHA. We thus encourage research in other settings to attempt replication of the factor structure reported here, and in the interim recommend that non-VHA organizations adopting the LOS-27 consider the scoring of combinations of items representing potential subcomponents of a supportive learning environment as well as that factor overall.</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight the relationship between analysis and the learning environment. The empirically derived scale structure differed from the original 10-dimensional structure in that a majority of items originally assigned to the “analysis” factor loaded onto the supportive learning environment factor in both the long- and short-form LOS. These items reflect both the unit’s processes for disciplined analysis and interpretation and thoughtfulness in decision making, an aspect of a supportive learning environment.</p>
<p>Several items also exhibited low discriminant validity, with loadings greater than .30 on the experimentation scale and on either supportive learning environment or performance monitoring. We interpret this pattern as highlighting the dependence of successful experimentation on an environment characterized by productive debate, willingness to question assumptions, and performance monitoring practices that include keeping up with best-in-class processes and technology that could be tested in one’s own organization. Similarly, three items loaded relatively strongly on both the leadership and the supportive learning environment scales. This overlap would appear to underscore the important relationship between management and the environment that they create and sustain.</p>
<p>Our development of the LOS-27 had some limitations. First, the initial derivation sample used to identify the dimensions of organization learning consisted only of supervisory personnel, and VHA supervisors’ perceptions have been found to be more positive than those of frontline workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712448135">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>). However, for this study, any tendency toward more favorable responses is relevant only to the extent that it affected the interrelationships among items and thereby the scale structure derived from these data. To the extent that this may have been a concern, its influence was largely mitigated by confirmation of the original psychometrics using an independent sample that included nonsupervisors in addition to supervisors. Our tests of factor invariance found the latent structure to be the same in both groups.</p>
<p>Second, although more than 25,000 individuals responded to that second survey of all employees used in the validation study, opportunity for selection bias exists. Only 18% of nonsupervisors responded, compared with 75% of supervisors. Administration methods also systematically excluded individuals without access to e-mail. However, the demographic profile of our all-employee sample was similar to that of respondents to an aggressively marketed, annual employee work–life satisfaction survey administered nationwide in VHA 3 months later and achieving a 72% response (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712448135">Table 1</xref>). Respondents and nonrespondents may nevertheless have differed systematically in their perceptions of organizational learning. In addition, response rates varied among facilities, and higher rates of response were positively correlated with stronger learning scores for some factors. Thus, more uniformly favorable responses may have contributed to the lack of differentiation we observed within the factor of items related to supportive learning environments.</p>
<p>Third, validating the LOS-27 in a VHA sample may limit generalizability. However, the original tool was developed as a generic instrument for any industry, and while we refined the instrument for the health care settings, modifications were minor and should not preclude use in non-VHA settings. In addition, the geographic, demographic, and occupational diversity represented in VHA supports the generalizability of our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712448135">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, we recommend that psychometric properties of the LOS-27 be tested and validated in non-VHA organizations.</p>
<p>Though advantageous in this study, the large sample sizes enjoyed by the VHA may not be replicable by other facilities that would like to consider using the LOS-27 for self-evaluation. However, the high reliability of LOS-27 subscales suggests that adequate facility-level reliability could be achieved using sample sizes that are reasonable for many health care organizations. Using the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula to solve for the number of respondents needed to obtain facility-level reliability of .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712448135">Hays et al., 1999</xref>) yields sample-size requirements ranging from 109 (knowledge acquisition) to 218 (leadership that reinforces learning).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study suggests the LOS-27 reliably measures key features of organizational learning. We encourage further research using the LOS-27 to examine the relationship between learning and patient outcomes and to compare learning among health care organizations and with other industries. Such comparisons can lead to the identification and study of positive outliers that could yield findings that would enhance the ability of health care organizations to learn.</p>

<p>Note: (1) Inconsistent items were those that, if dropped, improved internal consistency of the scales. (2) An item was considered redundant if removing it had no, or very little, effect on scale internal consistency. (3) Scaling failures occurred when items had high correlations with scales other than their assigned scale. (4) Low variation was expressed as high means and low standard deviations. (5) Items were retained if the concept was deemed essential to a learning organization or dropped if less central or less well expressed.</p>
