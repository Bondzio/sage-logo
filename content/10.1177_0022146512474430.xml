<p>For several decades now, the question of whether marriage is beneficial to an individual’s health and well-being has been a major topic in both the sociology of the family and the sociology of health. Numerous studies have shown that married people are better off than unmarried people in terms of physical health, mental health, and family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512474430">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). These associations, however, do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, and there has been much debate over whether marriage makes people healthier and happier or whether healthier and happier people self-select into marriage and, once married, are less likely to divorce. Certainly, self-selection plays a role, and this role may be expanding because lifetime marriage probabilities are now higher, and lifetime divorce probabilities are now substantially lower, for the more educated than for the less educated. Yet it seems unlikely that selection is the whole story.</p>
<p>Until the recent legalization of same-sex marriage in some jurisdictions, however, it was impossible to determine how much of the advantage marriage may provide is dependent on the marriage partners’ being of different sexes. Now, with same-sex marriage legal in a number of states (nine, plus the District of Columbia, as of this writing), we have the potential to observe marriages without gender differences. It is too early for findings to appear in the research literature, but I am sure we will soon see informative studies that compare same-sex and different-sex marriages. In the meantime, we finally have enough data from large, national probability samples to begin to study same-sex cohabiting unions, which have been understudied in the past because of their modest numbers in national surveys—and probably because individuals were more reluctant to disclose that they were in same-sex unions. The two articles in this issue use pooled data from several administrations of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to gather enough same-sex cohabiting partners to compare their self-rated health with that of different-sex married and cohabiting partners.</p>
<p>Given this opportunity, and the possibility of directly studying same-sex marriage in the near future, how should we theorize the relationship among marriage, cohabitation, and health in same-sex partnerships in the United States? The simplest theory, I would argue, begins with the observation that intimate relationships appear to have similar meanings for same-sex partners and different-sex partners. This observation is supported by the research literature on relationships, albeit on the basis of small, nonrandom samples. Studies that have compared gay, lesbian, and heterosexual couples have found no significant differences in love, satisfaction, or the partners’ evaluations of the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512474430">Peplau 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512474430">Savin-Williams and Esterberg 2000</xref>). We might therefore expect marriage and cohabitation to have similar meanings for same-sex and different-sex partners and to therefore have similar effects on health. Should this proposition fail to completely explain research findings, we could then invoke more complex theories, such as the following: (1) the health benefits of marriage are limited for same-sex married couples because of factors such as continuing discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals that lower the health of both partners, or (2) the distinctive effects of marriage occur only when it is the union of a man and woman, who come to their partnership with gendered upbringings, who face different labor market conditions, and who may, on average, have some deep-seated personality differences.</p>
<p>If marriage and cohabitation have similar meanings regardless of the gender of the partners, then we would expect cohabiting partners to be less committed to each other and more likely to disrupt over time regardless of gender. It is well established that different-sex cohabiting relationships show these properties compared with different-sex marriages in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022146512474430">Cherlin 2009</xref>). Less commitment may result in less attention by each partner to the other’s long-term health and well-being. With respect to the analyses in the two articles in this issue, we might then expect at first that self-reported health in the NHIS samples would be lower among cohabitors, different-sex or same-sex, than among married persons. Yet there is a complication. It is likely that some same-sex cohabitors would have married if it were possible. Those couples may be more committed to each other than same-sex couples who would not have married even if it were possible. If so, then the same-sex cohabitor category in the NHIS data would include a mixture of couples of varying commitment and stability. Therefore, the better hypothesis is that same-sex cohabitors, as a whole, would occupy a middle position in the health hierarchy: Their levels of self-reported health would be better than different-sex cohabitors but not as good as married persons.</p>
<p>That is what the analyses in these articles show: Same-sex couples occupy a middle position, at least when the authors control only for exogenous characteristics such as race, age, region, and year. Controlling for socioeconomic status reduces the difference between the two cohabiting groups, but socioeconomic status differences are such a fundamental part of the cohabitation and marriage picture in the United States that statistical models that include them may be overcontrolling: discarding variation that is a basic part of the phenomena under study. What can we learn from this finding? First, as the authors note, it is likely that during this historical period, individuals in same-sex partnerships, all but a handful of whom were unable to marry, represented a combination of those who would have made the commitment to marriage if they could and those who would have not. Said otherwise, same-sex cohabitors may have represented an in-between group that was more marriage-like, on average, than different-sex cohabitors but more cohabitation-like, on average, than married couples. Their middle position suggests that something about cohabitation, above and beyond gender dynamics, separated it from marriage. And their middle position was reflected in their level of health.</p>
<p>But we cannot really have confidence in these findings until we see studies that directly compare individuals in same-sex and different-sex marriages. These studies, which sociologists eagerly anticipate, will help us answer questions such as whether the advantage of marriage for health and well-being has been based on wives’ doing gendered “health behavior work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146512474430">Reczek and Umberson 2012</xref>) that keeps their husbands healthier (by providing emotional support and promoting healthier behavior and regular visits to a physician) or whether marriage is a more efficient partnership for supporting and encouraging healthy behavior, regardless of the genders of the spouses. And even if marriage were found to be better for health outcomes regardless of gender, its advantage could be due to a number of factors: the greater legal rights of married couples (including federal benefits that state-by-state same-sex marriage laws cannot currently include); the utility of two people working in partnership, supporting and encouraging each other for their mutual long-term benefit; or a self-selection mechanism that could apply to both same-sex and different-sex marriage.</p>
<p>For now, the results of these two studies would suggest that as far as health benefits are concerned, cohabiting relationships in the United States are still less beneficial than marriages, even when the genders of the partners are the same. Moreover, the results are consistent with the theory that marriage and cohabitation may have similar meanings, and similar implications for health, regardless of the genders of the partners. I am not suggesting that this is the whole story; I would expect that future studies will show the continuing relevance of gender and sexuality. Nevertheless, I would predict that as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more jurisdictions, the self-reported health of individuals in same-sex cohabiting unions will decline, on average, because couples who have a firmer basis for good health will be more likely to marry rather than to continue to cohabit.</p>
