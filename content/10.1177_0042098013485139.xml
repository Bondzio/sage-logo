<italic>City of Extremes</italic> is a story of race and real estate, of a city whipsawed by racial animosity and grand visions of cosmopolitan urbanism. At the same time, it is a window into the intimate ties of race and class which bind affluent White South Africans to poor Black South Africans across fractured social and spatial landscapes. Johannesburg first emerged as a mining city, in which a foreign racial minority grew wealthy from the back-breaking labour of the indigenous majority. Even as the mining industry faded as the primary source of the city’s wealth and identity, these deeply rooted social relations continue through the present to shape urban environment.</p>
<p>Martin Murray provides a robust account of Johannesburg’s development over the course of about a century, and proves a skilled guide through what is a complex and sometimes dizzying history of city building, social conflict and urban security. Throughout, he returns to a central question: how do elite and affluent middle-class residents maintain privilege given demands from below? His concern, however, is less with the more overt forms and sites of struggle; he focuses instead on the push and pull of everyday city building by a range of actors, from globally connected financial firms, to struggling small-business owners and working-class immigrants from neighbouring countries. A central thread connecting urban form across the Johannesburg’s various incarnations, however, is the attempt by affluent groups to sequester themselves socially and spatially from the masses of urban poor who surround them.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the reader is shown both a fine-grained picture of South Africa’s largest city and a unique perspective on global urbanism from the South. In one particularly compelling statement near the end of the book, Murray argues that development in Johannesburg today represents an effective (re-)enclosure of the commons (p. 324), and this seems a fitting commentary on South African cities, but also on the trajectory of many cities around the world. For what we are presented with throughout the book is a city pulled between different extremes in different eras, but connected by an ongoing battle over space and resources that—for now—has resolved, however uneasily, into a city defined by the opposition between an outcast poor and an affluent minority hoarding resources behind increasingly fortified lines. No longer protected by apartheid laws, affluent Whites have discovered or created different mechanisms through which to maintain the social and spatial distance from Black South Africa which has defined the landscape for decades.</p>
<p>Apartheid, of course, haunts this account of Johannesburg, as it must any account of modern South Africa to some extent. Yet Murray does not dwell here unnecessarily. Instead, he contextualises the apartheid and post-apartheid eras by showing how important continuities remain and that, however much the apartheid city is a relic of the past, apartheid planning continues to have a profound impact on the social and spatial dynamics of the putatively democratic city. Murray weaves into this an analysis of unregulated neoliberalism, arguing that despite the rhetoric of innovation that accompanies market-led redevelopment, it actually creates a very rigid pathway for cities (p. 248). Combined with the ossified remnants of past planning efforts and continuing racial animus, the relatively unrestrained real estate sector plays a key role in producing the fragmented, divided and polynucleated metropolis that Johannesburg is today (pp. 5, 175).</p>
<p>Murray builds his arguments across the book’s three sections. The first focuses mainly on the historical construction of the city. Johannesburg has gone through many styles architecturally, each shaped by the economy, the city’s insertion into global flows and changing social relations within the city and country. Murray often foregrounds the relationship between built environment and elite aspirations in presenting this history. Writing of the rise of the modernist city, he observes that the new downtown skyscrapers of the interwar years expressed not only amassed fortunes and accumulated financial power, but also represented “secular monuments” to a “confident modernity” (p. 52). By the height of the apartheid era, however, change was already at work and the 1960s and 1970s saw the beginnings of central-city decline and a northward migration of affluent populations and businesses. The causes are complex but of particular note is the role of an unregulated real estate industry, which began to shift investment to the urban fringe in response to an overdeveloped and increasingly unifunctional core (p. 81). The ordered, if perverse, city shaped by apartheid planning and modernist aesthetics gave way to an equally perverse, yet less clearly ordered, metropolitan sprawl.</p>
<p>Part 2 chronicles this collapse and the emergence of a more fragmented city marked by the dual processes of urbanisation at the periphery and the peripheralisation of the core. Beginning in the 1970s, these changes accelerated in the 1980s as property values began to decline, crime rose and infrastructure deteriorated. As the centre sunk into neglect and disorder, the suburbs to the north boomed. While acknowledging that the conventional explanations focused on ‘crime and grime’ have merit, Murray offers a more nuanced analysis that includes frustration with growing downtown congestion, the related relocations of work and residence for more affluent groups and the role of excess capital that international sanctions prevented from moving abroad.</p>
<p>Instead, much of this capital ended up generating new infrastructure and capacity in the northern suburbs, drawing business away from downtown. In one stark illustration of the change, Murray shows that by 1993 suburban nodes to the north of the city contained 7.9 million square feet of office space, in contrast to 5.3 million in the central city, and this grew to over 10.8 million square feet in 1999. Overall, the growth of office space in the suburbs during this period far outstripped construction downtown (p. 106). Add to this the development of new transport technologies, state subsidies and the ongoing desire for racial segregation, and it becomes clear why the reconfiguration of urban space took the shape it did. By the time the Johannesburg Stock Exchange moved north to the ultra-upscale suburb of Sandton in 2002, the city had already been turned inside out.</p>
<p>The transformation in built and social environments towards the end of apartheid and after reveal a steady privatisation of urban space that supplanted the role of state policy in enforcing socio-spatial distance between races and classes. Privatisation in Johannesburg followed a particular logic of fortification that contributed to the emergence of scattered enclaves traversed easily by car for the affluent, but which presented many challenges for the poor (p. 241). This fortified city is the subject of the book’s third and final section. While the northward trek of the more affluent reconfigured the spatial distribution of wealth, essentially scattering it along the M1 highway towards Pretoria, the central city remains a site of considerable value and city elites were not content to leave it to the growing underclass of Black South Africans and immigrants who had taken up residence there.</p>
<p>At the same time, social tensions in the northern suburbs and downtown core were shaping different, though related, mechanisms of fortification to replace the centrally organised security apparatus of the apartheid state. In the downtown core, a kind of revanchist politics and culture emerged, expressed in the architecture, the behaviour of the nominally democratic police force and in the discourse of affluent groups and their representatives in government. A desire post-apartheid to transform Johannesburg into a world-class city mandated an effort by city elites to reclaim the centre.</p>
<p>This ongoing and gruelling day-to-day struggle for territory has produced more than its share of casualties. From the infamous raid by heavily armed police in 2008 on the Central Methodist Church, at the time a small haven for immigrants and refugees, to the steady enclosure of public space through the expansion of massive, privatised and self contained, multiblock enclosures, the central business district has taken shape as a deeply bifurcated space that is hostile to the notion of public life itself (pp. 222–223). In the suburbs, a less visually imposing and physically concentrated network of security involving the police, private security and even armed citizen patrols has emerged to secure the enclave archipelago (p. 274). Johannesburg in this sense is less a unitary city than a constellation of unevenly urbanised spaces in a state of constant tension with each other. This unevenness is not only economic and spatial, it is also political: for what we see here is a major city in a democratic nation whose broken landscape is often exclusive, forbidding and at times unnavigable for a majority of its residents, newly enfranchised or not.</p>
<p>
<italic>City of Extremes</italic> is not comforting, but then neither is the looming urban future. Of the many contributions Murray’s book makes, perhaps the most important is that it unsettles many prevailing approaches to how we think about urban futures, in both the global South and North. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, most policy-makers, planners, scholars and other urban boosters hold onto visions of inclusive and integrated cities. Yet it appears that in many, if not most, cities, segregation is hardening along with socioeconomic inequality. What this reality means for policy and practice, for social movements and community mobilisations, is unclear precisely because we are so reluctant to confront it squarely. Murray’s meticulous examination of Johannesburg directly challenges this reluctance, rendering it increasingly untenable from both empirical and political perspectives.</p>
