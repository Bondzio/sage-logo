<p>“Get to the ball! Get to the ball! Kick it! Kick it!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a parent of a 7-year-old soccer player, these are the words I remember screaming at the kids on the field. These were also the words of the coach, a parent turned coach by virtue of being willing. No training, just a naive disposition to plan and schedule practice and show the kids where they needed to be on the field. God bless those coaches.</p>
<p>Earlier in my life, I remember my football coach grabbing another kid’s facemask and yelling 6 inches from his nose in order to influence him to tackle better. I don’t think it helped change the kid’s behavior, but it made an impression on the rest of us. There is nothing like fear to motivate players to move fast on the football field. While I don’t endorse fear as a means of motivation, it can be effective in getting someone’s attention quickly.</p>
<p>Both coaches were trying to motivate their players to play harder and to be successful. But fear doesn’t motivate for long.</p>
<p>Coaching, in sports or in anything, is about tapping into an individual’s internal motivation to achieve a desired behavior change. Personal coaching—in health, fitness, work, relationships, life, and so on—has exploded in recent years. Health coaching in particular is offered by health care organizations, health insurance companies, employee wellness programs, health fitness centers, and independent coaches, just to name a few. The purpose of this article is to define health coaching and to explore the use of health coaches in diabetes education.</p>

<title>A Personal Confession</title>
<p>I used the personal training service offered at a local club for help with my workouts. Over 2 years, I had approximately 8 to 10 different trainers. It is not a high-paying job, and their commitment to it and to me seemed to wane in due time.</p>
<p>The trainers I worked with varied widely in their backgrounds and in their approaches to our work together. Some had degrees in exercise physiology, one was a former Marine with an online diploma, and others were still completing one of the myriad educational avenues toward related degrees or professional certification. Most were very pleasant, asked about my goals, and encouraged me to stay on track. Some documented my workouts and periodically checked on my progress, but the follow-through toward attaining my goals was universally poor. Other than working 3 general muscle groups, there were no clear standards of practice. It was a bit like a box of chocolates. I never knew what I was going to get.</p>
<p>In my worst experiences, it felt like I was working with an “impersonal trainer.” It sometimes seemed like I was robbing them of sleep, sustenance, or some other activity that was clearly more important than my workout.</p>
<p>I have since stopped using trainers. I continue to work out on my own, saving $100 a month in the process. I admit that I am not working out as consistently as I was, so having a trainer did help hold me accountable in spite of it being discouraging at times.</p>

<title>What Is a Health Coach?</title>
<p>It seems that anyone can hang a shingle that identifies them as a coach—a bit like the volunteer parent of my 7-year-old daughter’s soccer team or my trainers. A simple search for health coaching certification programs turns up a wide array of options, from a 3-year graduate-level program for degreed professionals to programs that promise you can become certified and “have your own program start paying for itself in as little as 90 days.” The latter option requires no medical background or previous education.</p>
<p>Coaching involves a relationship that individualizes goals specifically related to what the client wants to change or achieve. The best coaches use a process similar to motivational interviewing to help clients identify positive motivations and the barriers that need to be worked on in order to make progress. Coaches listen intently to help clients identify their own desires and the direction their motivation is most likely taking them.</p>
<p>The AADE Competencies for Diabetes Educators defines a health educator/health coach as a level 1 diabetes educator. Certified Diabetes Educators (CDEs) have standard certification requirements through the National Certification Board of Diabetes Educators. This provides an assurance of what patients are likely to receive when seeing a CDE. The only assurance when seeing a health coach may be a referral by someone you trust.</p>

<p>Health coaches are not trained in diabetes or diabetes management. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage. Diabetes educators are able to answer clinical and management questions about diabetes with specific facts. While this can be good, it can also lead to a diabetes Q&amp;A session rather than a coaching session that directly addresses motivation and behavior change. It is for this reason that diabetes educators are increasing their coaching skills. By blending clinical knowledge and skills with a collaborative, patient-centered coaching approach, CDEs can help facilitate patient-identified behavior change <italic>and</italic> help optimize diabetes management.</p>
<p>Health coaches go by several other names, including:

<list-item><p>Peer counselors</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patient advocates</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Health educators.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Scheduling with a coach varies depending on where they work. Independent coaches, coaches in a community setting, or those employed by a health plan are often able to accommodate the client’s schedule. Coaches working in a clinic generally schedule clients during regular clinic hours. Appointments are often between 8 and 5, which is not always convenient for clients, and follow-up can suffer. This is an issue for diabetes educators in a clinic setting as well.</p>

<title>Health Coaches in Practice</title>
<p>In light of where we are going with health care reform, and everyone working at the top of their licensure, teaming health coaches with diabetes educators is becoming more common. It allows the diabetes educator to focus on issues that require their clinical expertise and to collaboratively set goals with the patient. The coach’s role is to help guide and support the patient in achieving goals while holding them accountable. This arrangement brings together the motivational skills of the coach and the clinical management expertise of the diabetes educator and the rest of the care team, allowing for a more complete approach to care.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that health coaches can be an effective part of the care team. When the health coach is disconnected from the care team, such as in a fitness center or an employee health services site, they may be effective in helping the patient reach their goals, but the plan may or may not be consistent with their diabetes care plan. In this scenario, it is up to the patient to ensure that they are getting what they need from the coach and that it works with and not against their diabetes care.</p>
<p>As diabetes educators, asking patients about the use of health coaches in other settings is as important as asking about over-the-counter drugs. It’s critical to assess how the plan with the health coach fits with the overall care plan. By understanding the various types of health coaches and how patients may be engaged with them, diabetes educators can be better prepared to help patients be informed consumers and to integrate their coaching experience with their diabetes care plan.</p>
