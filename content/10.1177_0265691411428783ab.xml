<p>Herzog’s analysis is based on different kinds of crime stories that are used as a source for the analysis of culture. He focuses on the popular, the scientific and the literary discourse on crime during the Weimar Republic, a period which is often described as a culture of crisis, or a culture in crisis. The link between reportage and sensation was not unique to post-war Germany – this can be observed in other contemporary countries as well. But the relationship to crime is different: (1) concerning the extent to which the stories are used as a mirror of society; (2) as to the role evidence played. For the Weimar Republic Herzog observes a breakdown of several boundaries: between fantasy and reality; between criminal and noncriminal; between individual and society. The book examines ‘social historical developments in Weimar society as well as literary historical developments in modernist crime fiction’ (9) and links the two. At the core of the study is therefore the self-imagining of Weimar society.</p>
<p>Many Weimar intellectuals shared a fascination with crime with the general public; they saw it as ‘point of access to modernity’ (14). Besides other traits, European modernity called into question the idea of a possible installation of rationality and causality: whereas the old detective novel insisted on rationality and causality, German crime stories during the 1920s – in contrast to their English and French counterparts – dispensed with the detective and focused on the criminal. Intellectuals such as Walter Benjamin, Bertold Brecht and Siegfried Kracauer were fascinated by the mechanisms of crime fiction and linked them to the experience of modern life. Herzog combines their texts with a modernist theory of detective fiction that is characterized on the one hand by taking seriously popular texts, and on the other hand by assuming the existence of an active reader of these crime stories.</p>
<p>Although crime rates decreased significantly from 1924 onwards, cultural production continued to focus on crime. ‘This was a culture fascinated by criminals and their crimes’ (2). Herzog analyses different kinds of crime stories: on the one hand intellectual crime novels as Walter Serner’s short stories, Brecht’s <italic>Threepenny Opera</italic>, and the series <italic>Outsiders of Society</italic>. All of these deal with the crisis of narration, they dispense with the classic form of causality and rationality in crime fiction through the creation of a new genre, the documentary crime novel, set on the border between fact and fiction and intermingling the two. They were multi-perspective and therefore often contradictory in their narration, focusing rather on the investigation than on the persons investigated. The same is true for Alfred Döblin’s texts <italic>The Two Girlfriends and their Murder by Poison</italic> and <italic>Berlin Alexanderplatz</italic>, as Herzog points out. The central focus is here the life of the criminals, their position within society and what led them to commit crimes. These rather sophisticated crime stories depict a paradox: although a coherent rational narrative seems to be impossible under the perspective of a modernist focus, a need to tell stories is indispensable.</p>
<p>On the other hand Herzog analyses popular culture productions, such as the media reporting on the case of the serial killer Peter Kürten, Fritz Lang’s film <italic>M</italic> and Erich Kästner’s children’s book <italic>Emil and the Detectives</italic>. These popular crime stories did not focus on the problem of narrativity but on the collection of visual evidence and the tracking of the criminal. Criminal anthropology followed a similar approach that tried to differentiate between various criminal types. Although the ambition was similar – to catch the criminal – they used different methods: while fictional crime stories were concerned with the identification of the individual criminal, the anthropological school tried to identify criminal types by visual evidence. Two social traits eroded this ambition to identify criminals by visual traits: the figure of the Hochstapler, the impostor, as for example the <italic>Captain of Koepenick</italic>, who enjoyed great popularity, as well as the perceived normality of serial killers. Weimar society was thus portrayed in different media as a society characterized by criminality, in which was stressed the importance of an informed public, a powerful mass that was tracking the criminal after the usual methods of investigation had collapsed. In media productions, as, for example, <italic>M</italic> or <italic>Emil and the Detectives</italic>, it is the public, a ‘mass community united by a shared trauma and against a common enemy’ (129), that finally tracks the criminal.</p>
<p>The book ends with a short overview on criminal fantasy in Nazi Germany and Germany after 1945. Surprisingly, basic characteristics of the Weimar documentary crime novels were taken over by the National Socialists, and became part of state policy. For example the mobilization of the public as an aid to the police was a central trait of Nazi crime fiction. German criminalistic fantasy after World War II, in contrast, refocused on the documentary style of Weimar crime fiction and often tried to examine the period of the National Socialist dictatorship.</p>
<p>Herzog sees these very different genres of crime fiction as evidence for the pervasiveness of the Weimar criminalistic fantasy. Convincingly argued, the book combines socio-historical, literary and media analyses for an astonishing and fascinating depiction of Weimar culture.</p>
