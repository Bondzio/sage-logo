<p>The 12 studies in this collection set out to explore how the biblical word was received through preaching in the course of Christian history, from the middle of the first decade of the first century to the final decade of the 20th. As the title of the Introduction by Isabella Sandwell suggests, this involves the interaction of four variables—the preacher, the people who make up the audience, the historical place in human history in which the sermon was delivered, and its performance.</p>
<p>The first four chapters cover the early Christian period. Sean F. Winter (‘A Daring Sermon? Paul’s Preaching in 2 Corinthians 3:7–18’) rightly observes that, although the NT contains many accounts of sermons delivered both by Jesus and his followers, they are all in fact literary compositions that have been transmitted and transformed by their inclusion within a larger narrative setting. He suggests, for the purpose of his essay, that this Pauline text may have earlier seen service as a Pauline synagogue sermon prior to its inclusion in the letter. He surveys Paul’s exegetical techniques in the sermon, particularly his use of the rabbinic argumentative strategy of <italic>qal wa-homer</italic> (arguing from the lesser to the greater) in the use of the underlying Exodus text. By its later inclusion in a letter, the text is subject to a double reception and by different audiences, Jewish and Christian. Morwenna Ludlow (‘Origen as Preacher and Teacher: A Comparison of Exegetical Methods in his Writings on Genesis and the Song of Songs’) studies one of the earliest Christian writers who is better known as a theologian and expansive commentator than as a preacher. Yet Origen was from his youth a teacher and even during his later years in Caesarea, he continued the work of preaching. The focus of Ludlow’s chapter is on the <italic>Homilies on Genesis</italic> and on the Song of Songs. Jerome, who translated the Songs homilies, claimed that he did so to show how greatly his work should be esteemed ‘so that even his little ones can so commend themselves.’ A central idea in the Songs homilies is that of imitation and that the point of the homilies is to enable the members of the congregation to understand and thus, spiritually at least, to join in singing the Song. Origen had noted in the Commentary the reticence of Jewish tradition in making the Song too readily available to younger readers, yet when preaching on it, he ‘revels in the artistry and narrative form of the biblical text’(p. 59). Carol Harrison notes how early Christian literature is full of voices, a theme she explores in her essay, ‘The Typology of Listening: The Transformation of Scripture in Early Christian Preaching.’ In a largely pre-literate culture, the biblical word was <italic>heard</italic> more than it was <italic>read</italic>: the preacher, even though he read the text from a book, was also required to be a listener. This spoken and heard dimension of the homily cannot be ignored as it constitutes the communal conversation which the homily creates and there is ‘an intense, passionate relationship between speaker and hearer in the communication of Scripture: the preacher knows his congregation, cares for them as a parent cares for a child, loves them as a lover loves their beloved and is aware that what is at stake is their eternal salvation’ (p. 67). Harrison explores some of these dimensions in the work of John Chrysostom and Augustine. Isabella Sandwell (‘A Milky Text Suitable for Children: The Significance of John Chrysostom’s Preaching on Genesis 1:1 for Fourth Century Audiences’) explores how Chrysostom faced the problem of how to make a distant text relevant and accessible to his audience.</p>
<p>The preaching of the following centuries is represented by a more impressionistic sampling, perhaps at a remove from the mainstream of their relative historical periods. Beverly-Maine Kienzle presents a medieval woman preacher (‘Hildegard of Bingen’s Exegesis of Jesus’ Miracles and the Twelfth Century Study of Science’). Some 58 homilies have survived in Hildegard’s <italic>Expositiones Evangeliorum</italic>, and the majority of them at least were delivered to the nuns of her monastery at Rupertsberg, though some may have been delivered to a male community at the invitation of the abbot. Mark W. Elliott takes issue with the charge that Protestant preaching was already in decline by the death of Luther as preachers sourced their material increasingly from printed sermons and takes as an example the influence of one lesser-known figure (‘Johannes Brenz and his Written Sermons in the Spirit of Luther’). Simon Woodman explores how disruptive of public order Puritan preaching could sometimes be in 17th-century England (‘Stoned in the Pulpit: The Provocative Preaching of Hanserd Knollys’). Knollys began his preaching career as an ordained priest of the Church of England but joined the Puritan movement, even for a while emigrating to America. Woodman suggests that figures like Knollys might with some usefulness be seen against the backdrop of radical Islamic preaching in post-9/11 Britain. The 18th/early 19th century is illustrated by the work of Jonathan Edwards (‘The Excellence of Jesus Christ: Affective Doctrine in the Sermons of Jonathan Edwards’ by Oliver D. Crisp) and the poet of ‘The Ancient Mariner’ and sometime preacher (‘Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Preaching and Reflection’).</p>
<p>The 20th century is explored in the preaching of a military chaplain, a radio evangelist, and a university professor of exegesis who is also an ordained clergyman of the Church of England. Stuart Bell presents the preaching of a First World War chaplain who is best known by his nickname (‘Patriotism and Sacrifice: The Preaching of Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy, ‘Woodbine Willy’, 1914–1918’). Bell describes how Studdert Kennedy’s preaching in the front line asked the question of where God was in all of this, but answered the question by highlighting certain themes such as Christian patriotism that won him the approval of the top brass, as well as other themes that might have been more troubling, such as social justice and the suffering God. Michelle Krecji gives an account of the first woman evangelist who realized the importance of the new medium of radio (‘“Give the winds a mighty voice,” Aimee Semple McPherson and her Radio Audience’). McPherson has been satirized by Sinclair Lewis (<italic>Elmer Gantry</italic>) and Evelyn Waugh (<italic>Vile Bodies</italic>) but Krecji’s picture is fair and at times fascinating. McPherson, she claims, was the first to project herself into the private spaces of American lives in order to ally or rally the concerns of her listeners. The final contribution (‘Preaching at the Nine O’clock Service: A Study in the Shifting Meaning in a Published Sermon’ by William J. Lyons) takes the example of an experimental church ministry in Sheffield that attempted to reach into the world of young unchurched ‘clubbers’ with some success but eventually found itself mired in scandal as a result of the behaviour of its founder. John Rogerson, head of the department of biblical studies at the University of Sheffield, attempted to mediate the scandal by preaching at one of the church’s services shortly after the scandal broke. The sermon on the Good Samaritan is a good example of how a preacher can often use the given reading of the liturgical lectionary to address a need that would seem far removed from the plain meaning of the text.</p>
<p>This is an interesting collection of essays. The connecting links may not always be clear and in some cases their relevance to the subtitle of the collection is not always obvious. It is a well-produced volume (the only error I spotted is some confusion with regard to the name of Professor Rogerson on page 16). It has scarcely exhausted its theme.</p>
