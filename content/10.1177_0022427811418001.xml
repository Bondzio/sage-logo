Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: <italic>prime</italic>, <italic>rugged</italic>, <italic>dry</italic>, and <italic>remote</italic>. <italic>Prime</italic> sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying “prime” locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>journey to crime</kwd><kwd>target selection</kwd><kwd>cannabis</kwd><kwd>cannabis cultivation</kwd><kwd>rational choice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0022427811418001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because some of the most potentially rewarding criminal opportunities are often the most risky ones, a central dilemma for offenders is to balance potential rewards with concerns over security. The dilemma is interesting in part because it influences the decision-making of both predatory and market offenders. The search for profitable, yet, safe criminal targets is a central concern for offenders, whether it is choosing a neighborhood and house to burglarize or searching for suitable street corners to sell drugs. This explains why rational choice theory can help in modeling the search for suitable targets and settings for both consensual and nonconsensual crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811418001">Eck 1995</xref>).</p><p>A few researchers have succeeded in getting inside this dilemma and the decision-making of offenders selecting a target. The decision-making process involved in burglary has been the object of much empirical attention. The results of these studies are clear: Offenders do make rational choices—rational in the sense of discriminating between targets of different perceived values. This can be observed, for instance, in their ability to identify risky environmental cues when compared to nonburglars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811418001">Wright and Decker 1994</xref>), in choosing a specific time of day to target a specific type of house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811418001">Coupe and Blake 2006</xref>), in favoring the neighborhood right next to the most affluent neighborhoods because of lower perceived risks of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811418001">Brantingham and Brantingham 1978</xref>), or in searching for goods once inside a house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811418001">Nee and Meenaghan 2006</xref>). In other words, offenders solve the rewards/security dilemma by choosing targets with acceptable levels of risks and reasonable rewards, as opposed to reaching for the targets that would potentially yield the highest payoff but are thought to be riskier.</p><p>As informative as these studies have been in understanding the rationality of the decision-making process involved in selecting crime targets, we have learned little in regards to the outcome: How successful are offenders in correctly choosing one target over the other? How rewarding was the decision to pass over one neighborhood for another, more familiar neighborhood? Examining the outcome of criminal decision-making under a rational choice model is important because what makes a decision “rational” is also tied to results. Offenders may show much deliberation and thinking but still come up short—at least shorter than if they had made a “better decision.” In other words, a rational choice approach should recognize that while most to all offenders show thinking and deliberation prior to offending, not all of them are as successful in their endeavors.</p><p>The current study examines the journey to crime of offenders confronted with the dilemma of selecting a suitable site for outdoor cannabis cultivation. The particular dilemma of the outdoor cannabis grower shares similarities with the dilemmas facing the burglar or the drug dealer (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418001">Bernasco 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811418001">Eck 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811418001">Rengert 1996</xref>), but it also entails important differences that are worth emphasizing. The first objective of this study thus follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811418001">Clarke and Cornish’s (1985)</xref> plea for crime-specific analyses in introducing a new type of crime to the target-selection research tradition.</p><p>The second objective is to highlight the importance of examining both process<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811418001">1</xref></sup> and outcome in rational choice models of crime. The “process,” in our case, corresponds to the distance traveled by offenders. The outcome denotes the potential rewards. Studies that have examined variations in criminal mobility and criminal achievement are few in numbers, but their findings are consistent: most offenders do not travel far and are content with close targets. Deviations from this pattern (that is, longer travel distances) are generally linked to greater rewards (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811418001">Capone and Nichols 1976</xref>). In other words, offenders prefer short distances, but only when close targets are sufficiently lucrative. The link between process (distance traveled) and outcome (crime earnings) was examined more recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811418001">Morselli and Royer (2008)</xref>. Drawing on a sample of 194 incarcerated offenders reporting detailed criminal activity in the 3 years preceding their incarceration, the authors showed that offenders who travel farther to commit their crimes had good reasons to do so. The longer the distance traveled, the higher the criminal earnings. The effect was consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811418001">Felson’s (2006)</xref> use of the concept of strategic foraging: offenders, not unlike animals, are willing to travel farther if the additional effort is worth their while.</p><sec id="section2-0022427811418001"><title>Journey to Grow: Similarities and Differences with Traditional Target Area Selection</title><p>The search process of cannabis growers looking for a cultivation site shares characteristics with both predatory and market offenders. Similar to drug dealers, growers need to choose a location based on a long-term investment instead of a onetime deal—both will regularly visit a single area for a few months. The issue of accessibility is, therefore, crucial. Unlike dealers, however, growers do not select locations to facilitate meeting with customers. Instead, reminiscent of burglars, the site selection is driven by other concerns, such as ease of entry and exit to/from the target.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811418001">2</xref></sup></p><p>These differences with other types of crime require that we redefine the journey to crime to consider the specific context of outdoor cannabis cultivation. In doing so, it is useful to take stock of research examining how offenders select <italic>areas</italic> for offending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418001">Bernasco (2006)</xref> summarizes the target selection of areas for burglary into five criteria: (a) the proximity to the burglar’s home neighborhood; (b) the physical accessibility of the properties in the neighborhood; (c) the affluence of the neighborhood; (d) the proximity to the city center; and (e) the social disorganization in the neighborhood. An important difference with traditional journey to crime research is the fact that we move from the city to consider a search process in a rural, forest setting. This means that the city-specific criteria 4 and 5 are not useful markers for assessing the journey to grow. The first three criteria, however, can be adapted for cultivation site selection to the following: (a) proximity to the nearest road; (b) physical accessibility of the cultivation site; and (c) simplicity of the set up process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811418001">3</xref></sup></p><sec id="section3-0022427811418001"><title>Proximity to the nearest road</title><p>First, the forest setting implies that the starting point of the journey to grow will move from the offender’s residence to a more meaningful spatial measure, such as the proximity from the nearest road.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811418001">4</xref></sup> The longer the travel distance from the road, the more effort is required to set up the site and to take care of the plants, the less efficient the journey to crime. At the same time, the closer to the road, the higher the risks of detection (by the police but also by bystanders or thieves). If it is uncomplicated for growers to access their site, we can anticipate something similar for others. Not unlike the buffer zone typically found between predatory offenders and their home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811418001">Rossmo 2000</xref>), a buffer zone of a certain distance from the road is expected to be found for outdoor growers.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0022427811418001"><title>Physical accessibility of the site</title><p>Similar to the burglar who will refrain from targeting areas with properties that are difficult to access or exit, growers will consider the ease of access to the cultivation site. This is especially important given the repeated visits to the site, and the work performed, while physically on site. An important criterion specific to outdoor cultivation is the elevation of the terrain. A similar journey of 500 meters in the forest will require much more efforts, while going up a mountain than on flatter terrain. A higher elevation will also create challenges in setting up the site, especially in making sure that all plants receive enough sunlight to grow properly. Some areas chosen by growers in this study were completely flat, whereas others were rugged and mountainous. We expect that the higher the elevation of the terrain, the more limited the surface available for cultivation, and the more difficult it is to reach.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0022427811418001"><title>Simplicity of the set up process</title><p>The affluence of the neighborhood criterion translates, for growers, into a concern for choosing a location, where cultivation is both feasible and simple. For cultivation to bring any rewards, the location should allow for proper drainage, sufficient sun hours, and proper irrigation of the plants. Irrigation is of direct concern to the journey to grow. Too much or too little water can hinder the grow process and considerably reduce the payoff. For outdoor growers, this requires setting up the site close enough to a water source so that an irrigation system can be installed (or, alternatively, that manual irrigation is feasible). The longer the travel distance from the nearest water source, the higher the complexity/costs of the irrigation system. Note that suitable sites for cultivation may fit this criterion and not others, creating tradeoffs that growers need to consider in selecting a particular location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811418001">5</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0022427811418001"><title>The Current Study</title><p>The current study analyses the journey to selecting a suitable outdoor cannabis cultivation site and examines its association with one measure of outcome—the potential rewards per site (measured as the total number of plants grown). Drawing on detailed spatial data on the location and characteristics of a sample of 132 cultivation sites, we examine the patterns in site location against three measures of distance and examine their implications for the number of plants grown. In other words, we expect that sites which are the most efficient in terms of the journey to crime will allow offenders to grow more plants. Moreover, we examine the target selection of growers, looking at which distance measures appear to be the most important in the selection process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-0022427811418001"><title>Data and Methods</title><p>Geographic location and counts of number of plants per site were obtained from the 2006 Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) cannabis eradication survey for Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands in British Columbia, Canada. This survey is part of a yearly summer outdoor cannabis eradication program conducted by the RCMP in collaboration with the Canadian Forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811418001">Treasury Board of Canada 2006</xref>). Such operations are usually concentrated over the few weeks preceding harvest. For example, Canada’s annual marijuana eradication operation (“SABOT”), active in August and September across the country, reported the eradication of 163,000 plants in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811418001">Department of National Defence 2006</xref>). The region under study is well known for its extensive outdoor marijuana cultivation industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418001">Plecas, Malm, and Kinney 2005</xref>). Between 1997 and 2003, the number of marijuana cultivation cases has increased by 110 percent on Vancouver Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418001">Plecas et al. 2005</xref>). Of importance, the police data analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418001">Plecas et al. (2005)</xref> show that the rise was almost entirely due to increased efforts at targeting outdoor cultivation sites (the proportion of outdoor sites rose from 24 percent to 45 percent).</p><p>The study area comprises diverse mountainous terrain with a variety of land covers such as old growth coniferous forest, broadleaf forest, logged clearings, secondary forest from forestry plantations, agricultural land, and urban areas spread over several hundred islands of various sizes. The survey focused on Vancouver Island and the Southern Gulf Islands covering an area of approximately 39,200 km<sup>2</sup>. The largest island, Vancouver Island, covers an area of approximately 32,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The islands are separated from the mainland to the east by the Strait of Georgia and from the United States to the south by the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The climate in the area is mild with temperatures usually above freezing throughout the year at low altitudes. Much of the study area can support a productive outdoor cannabis crop planted in the late spring and harvested at the end of the summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811418001">Public Safety Canada/CPRC 2007</xref>).</p><p>The site data consist of Geographic Positioning System (GPS)-located coordinates obtained from systematic helicopter spotter surveys in August 2006 over the study area and comprise 443 recorded outdoor cannabis cultivation sites of various sizes (4–1,109 plants). Following the aerial surveys, ground crews visited the sites and eradicated the plants. Because actual plant counts were not recorded for each site visited by the ground crews, we do not have complete information on every known site; 132 sites (29.8 percent) had recorded counts of the total number of plants seized by officers during the eradication campaign. We assume that the 30 percent sample is representative of the total number of sites detected in the study area. Although it remains a limitation of this study, investigation of the issue makes it a relatively safe assumption as the missing counts were shown to occur randomly throughout the operation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811418001">6</xref></sup> After removal of one outlier site located almost on top of a mountain,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022427811418001">7</xref></sup> the final sample used in the analysis is 131 sites.</p><sec id="section9-0022427811418001"><title>Measures</title><p>Analyzing the journey to grow requires data on distances to the nearest water source, as well as to the nearest road. Thematic data representing water (i.e., lakes and rivers), roads, and the coastline were obtained from the British Columbia Crown Registry and Geographic Base in the form of digitized vector layers. These layers, representing multiple map sheets were first integrated into single vector layers for the entire study area representing the coastline, lakes, rivers, and roads. Distances from the GPS points to the nearest lake, river, and road were calculated (in meters) as the shortest straight-line distances in ArcGIS 9.2. The GPS point used for deriving each measure was calculated from the middle point of the surface of each site. For the <italic>distance to road</italic> measure, we use the shortest straight-line distance to the closest road, regardless of whether it was the actual road taken by offenders (although it should be in most cases). For the <italic>distance to water</italic> measure, we used the shortest distance to any water source, whether it was a lake or river. While growers may not always (or often) use a straight-line in their journey to cultivation sites, this measure is the only one available. We believe variations to be minor enough not to affect the substance of our results, but this remains a limitation of our data. Finally, we use a measure of <italic>elevation</italic> (from sea level, for the site’s GPS coordinate), which is a good proxy for the general accessibility of the site. Elevation of the specific location of each cultivation site was also available in the registry and was calculated in meters.</p><p>Our measure of potential rewards associated with a site location is given by a measure of the <italic>number of plants</italic> grown per site. As mentioned above, data on the number of plants per site was obtained following a count by the ground crew before eradication. While the range is wide (4–1,109 plants), the median size was 68 plants, a number consistent with other research on the size of outdoor cultivation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811418001">Bouchard 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418001">Plecas et al. 2005</xref>). While all cultivation sites in this sample were eventually detected (i.e., no offender was able to reap actual benefits from them), this outcome measure appropriately taps into the relationship we aim to uncover between efficiency of the journey, target suitability, and (potential) payoff.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-0022427811418001"><title>Results</title><p>We start by analyzing the distribution of distances involved for all sites in the sample to examine how far growers are willing to go to set up their cultivation site. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811418001">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for our three indicators of journey to crime as well as our measure of outcome—the actual number of plants grown.

Minus a few exceptionally close sites, we can find a buffer zone pattern, where the majority of growers will not set up a cultivation site within 50 meters of the road.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0022427811418001" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Descriptive Statistics for the Location and Size Measures.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-0022427811418001" xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811418001-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Mean (<italic>SD</italic>)</th><th align="center">Median</th><th align="center">Min/Max</th><th align="center">Quartiles</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="3">Elevation (meters)</td><td rowspan="3">218.5 (171.6)</td><td rowspan="3">146.0</td><td rowspan="3">13/718</td><td>25 = 95.0</td></tr><tr><td>50 = 146.0</td></tr><tr><td>75 = 352.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Distance to road (meters)</td><td rowspan="3">138.1 (119.6)</td><td rowspan="3">113.2</td><td rowspan="3">.14/668.6</td><td>25 = 53.9</td></tr><tr><td>50 = 113.2</td></tr><tr><td>75 = 173.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Distance to water (meters)</td><td rowspan="3">380.1 (421.7)</td><td rowspan="3">259.2</td><td rowspan="3">.79/2258.7</td><td>25 = 92.2</td></tr><tr><td>50 = 259.2</td></tr><tr><td>75 = 530.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Size (# of plants)</td><td rowspan="3">126.1 (166.6)</td><td rowspan="3">68.0</td><td rowspan="3">4/1109</td><td>25 = 30.0</td></tr><tr><td>50 = 68.0</td></tr><tr><td>75 = 166.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The second measure is distance to water. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811418001">Table 1</xref>, distance to water varies a lot more than distance to road among locations. Growers are also willing to be further from the water than from the road. While we find that 25 percent of growers stay within 92 meters of a water source in order to establish their site, the mean distance is 380 meters. Based on distance alone, these results suggest that proximity to a road is valued more by growers in the site selection. Finally, the last criterion to consider is the elevation of the terrain. All else being equal, growers who have the choice might select a flatter terrain. As a matter of fact, most growers stay within an elevation of 200 meters, although one quarter of growers deal with elevated terrain of over 350 meters. Using a 100 meter distance benchmark for all criteria, we see that 45 percent of growers stay within 100 meters of the road, 28 percent stay within 100 meters of water, and 28 percent of the sites are located on a terrain elevated less than 100 meters from water level.</p><p>The next step is to examine location patterns, when all three criteria are considered simultaneously. Excluding considerations for security, an ideal site would require the least amount of effort: it would be close to the road, to water, and located on a flat terrain. A cluster analysis using the TwoStep method with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the number of cluster (AIC = 155.1; AIC change stopped after four clusters) reveal that those three measures combine in at least four different ways.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811418001">Table 2</xref>, locations do not distribute evenly, as close to half of the sites cluster together (cluster 2 = 47 percent).

Because of its distance to water, this cluster is labeled the <italic>dry</italic> location.</p><p>Only eight sites match cluster 4, which is labeled as the <italic>remote</italic> location. Contrary to the other locations, there is nothing seemingly advantageous with this subset of locations: it is far from the road (492 meters), quite far from a water source although to a lesser extent than the <italic>dry</italic> location (347 meters), and the elevation is slightly above average (238 meters). These remote locations, however, may have the security advantage that others may not have due to their proximity to civilization.</p><p>Is there a relationship between the type of location and the number of plants grown?

In other words, we suspect there could be nonlinear effects where the location of a site in an especially remote location may incite growers to increase the size of their cultivation site. In order to account for this possibility, we created a new dimension made of the interaction between distance from the road and elevation and added this term in model 2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427811418001">8</xref></sup> This variable effectively isolates those sites that are furthest away from civilization and from routine detections. Note that the “remoteness” factor is a continuous measure to be differentiated from the small “remote” cluster—although the majority of these sites are found at the tail of the remoteness score distribution.</p><p>Model 2 shows that elevation remains the most important factor related to the actual number of plants, even after controlling for remoteness. Controlling for remoteness also improves the negative association between distance to road and number of plants, although it is not statistically significant. Importantly, the interaction between distance to road and elevation is significantly and positively associated with the size of the cultivation site. The more isolated from civilization, the more plants grown. Adding the remoteness factor improves the explained variance of the model from 8 percent to 12 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427811418001">9</xref></sup> Growers who make the initial decision to go through the trouble of finding isolated sites appear to do so with the understanding that the additional efforts and security will be compensated by larger rewards.</p></sec><sec id="section11-0022427811418001"><title>Discussion</title><p>In order to set up the most suitable cannabis cultivation sites—what was identified as the <italic>prime</italic> location—findings of this study show that growers choose locations that remain both relatively close to the road and from a water source. This type of location provides easy access to the sites as well as an easy access to a water source to facilitate irrigation of the plants. Congruent with most journey to crime studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811418001">Bernasco 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811418001">Capone and Nichols 1976</xref>), the target-selection process of growers is also compatible with the dynamic model of crime site selection proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811418001">Brantingham and Brantingham (1978)</xref> in that it follows a distance-decay function. This model assumes that the decrease in activity as distance increases is the result of the “costs” and time involved in overcoming distance. As also suggested by the least-effort principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811418001">Zipf 1950</xref>), an individual that is given various possibilities for action will most often select the one requiring the least expenditure of effort. Being close to the road or to a water source, however, does not mean being <italic>too</italic> close. Similar to the buffer zone found for burglars—that is, an area centered around the offender’s residence within which targets are viewed as less desirable because of the risks associated with operating too close to home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811418001">Rossmo 2000</xref>)—growers avoid selecting sites that would easily be found by passersby or thieves.</p><p>Although our data only allow us to indirectly assess the decisions made by growers, the types of location found in this study appear to highlight the rational decision-making of offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811418001">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>). In a possible attempt to minimize the perceived effort (i.e., distance to road and water, elevation) and time required for locating a suitable site, while maximizing the potential reward (i.e., number of plants), close to half the growers were able to identify the <italic>prime</italic> locations. These sites are not randomly distributed as they present specific features that not all growers were able to find. However, if growers are rational individuals, why then are just as many of them selecting “less than ideal” locations (e.g., the <italic>rugged</italic> or <italic>dry</italic>) for their cultivation site? There are at least two possible explanations. First, the <italic>prime</italic> locations are not randomly distributed in space, which means that there are only a limited number of spots over an area that match the <italic>prime</italic> criteria (i.e., close to road and water, flat terrain). It is thus possible that offenders with the same “specialist knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811418001">Bennett and Wright 1984</xref>) target the same areas, leading to a form of competition for the best sites. The selection of a less-rewarding location could be the result of the finest locations having been taken first by other growers. Another possibility relates to the knowledge of the studied area, or more specifically, the awareness space. Awareness space denotes the locations and areas that a person is aware of and possesses a minimum level of knowledge about, even without visiting some of them (e.g., growers can, and should examine maps of the area before starting their journey). It includes not only the current activity space (i.e., the area within which most of a person’s activities are carried out, within which the individual comes most frequently into contact with others and with the features of the environment) but also the activity space in the recent past, as well as the area normally within visual range of these activity spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811418001">Bernasco 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811418001">Rossmo 2000</xref>). Thus, some growers may be constrained by a restricted awareness space, overlooking specific areas of a territory that could provide greater rewards. In a large rural/forest setting such as the one studied here, it is impossible to possess knowledge of the entire area.</p><p>The study also emphasizes the importance of crime-specific analyses in journey to crime research. Because cannabis cultivation does not quite fit within the usual framework and logic established by predatory or drug market offending, we proposed three new criteria upon which to assess the journey to grow: (a) proximity to the nearest road (in lieu of the offender’s residence), (b) physical accessibility of the site (in lieu of the physical accessibility of houses in a neighborhood), and (c) simplicity of the setup process (in lieu of the affluence of the neighborhood). The difference with other types of crimes also means that a model of the location of outdoor cannabis cultivation sites should be proposed. In doing so, we build on two previous models accounting for the geography of street drug dealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811418001">Eck 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811418001">Rengert 1996</xref>) and the findings of the current study.</p><p>First, our findings show the importance of the <italic>range</italic> dimension for growers. This dimension had previously been identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811418001">Rengert (1996</xref>:71) in the context of illegal drug marketplaces and was defined as the distance customers are willing to travel to shop at a specific retail outlet. In a model of outdoor cannabis cultivation, range is defined as the distance growers are willing to travel to set up a cultivation site at a specific location. In this study, we consider the range as measured from two important anchor points: (a) the nearest road access; and (b) the nearest water source. The range (or journey), can be short, long, or in between. The other important dimension in the model introduced in this study is the <italic>terrain</italic>. The terrain is defined as the physical features of a parcel of land. How difficult the journey is may well be determined by how flat or rugged the terrain is at the site location. The terrain can be relatively difficult, or easy for cultivation purposes.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427811418001">Table 5</xref> illustrates how these two dimensions combine in various ways to produce the four types of cannabis cultivation sites found in this study. In addition, we add a prediction of the rewards that can be expected for growers choosing a particular combination. <italic>Prime</italic> locations, as demonstrated in this study, have the combination of short ranges and easy terrain that should increase the expected payoff from cultivation. For <italic>dry</italic> locations, the increased effort to access water should result in a decrease in the amounts of plants grown (medium rewards). <italic>Rugged</italic> locations have the problem of being located on a difficult terrain. Given the importance of that dimension for the number of plants grown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811418001">Table 4</xref>), the more difficult terrain should result in smaller expected rewards (“low” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427811418001">Table 5</xref>). The exception to the rule seems to be found with <italic>remote</italic> locations. These sites have no clear advantages for growers; from a rewards point of view, however, the one advantage of remote locations is their relative isolation compared to the rest. According to the model, this should result in a different pattern of expected rewards, where the additional security may incite growers to grow more plants than would be expected given the efforts needed to set up and maintain such sites. The results found in model 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811418001">Table 4</xref> seem to indicate that it is indeed the case. Whereas, we normally find the number of plants grown to decrease as a function of distance, such a pattern was reversed for the most extreme cases in our sample.</p><table-wrap id="table5-0022427811418001" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>A Model of the Geography of Outdoor Cannabis Cultivation Sites.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table5-0022427811418001" xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811418001-table5.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th>Range</th><th>Range</th><th>Terrain</th><th>Rewards</th></tr><tr><th>Location</th><th>Road</th><th>Water</th><th>Elevation</th><th>Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Prime</td><td>Short</td><td>Short</td><td>Easy</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr><td>Dry</td><td>Short</td><td>Long</td><td>Easy</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Rugged</td><td>Short</td><td>Short</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Remote</td><td>Long</td><td>Long</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Medium</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="section12-0022427811418001"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Growers who plan to establish an outdoor cannabis cultivation site enter a unique journey to find a suitable location. The study reveals that the majority of growers have identified those <italic>prime</italic> locations which yield the greatest potential rewards. As the <italic>prime</italic> locations are not randomly distributed over a specific area, it was also possible to identify that elevation of the terrain is the most important factor associated with the amount of plants grown at a specific location. As with other types of criminals, growers appear to attempt to maximize their rewards while limiting their efforts, but will usually settle for something in between.</p><p>The data analyzed in the current study has been collected in the midst of aerial detection operations conducted by local law enforcement agencies. Because similar operations had been conducted at the same time of year in years prior, one can safely assume that the majority of growers are likely to be aware, prior to setting up their cultivation site, that the risks of detection are not trivial. This could have influenced the decision-making of our growers in at least two ways: (a) decreasing the amount of plants grown per site (growers might be willing to take a chance, but only up to a certain size); and (b) overemphasizing prime locations. Regarding the latter, the possibility of aerial detection almost literally puts all sites at equal risks of law enforcement detection. In that context, there is less of an advantage in trying to find the most remote locations for the sake of security. Overall, the presence of what we term <italic>routine activity detections</italic>—detection by passersby, hikers, other growers, and thieves—remains an issue for all growers except those in remote locations whose sites are only subject to <italic>law enforcement detection</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022427811418001">10</xref></sup> As for the number of plants grown per site, police data analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418001">Plecas et al. (2005)</xref> for the province as a whole indicates that the average size of an outdoor cannabis plot has been decreasing each year from 2000 (134 plants) to 2003 (98 plants). This suggests that eradication programs may have contributed in fragmenting the outdoor industry into a multitude of smaller plots.</p><p>Combined, these two factors (smaller sizes and overemphasis on prime locations) may have produced findings that may not be replicated in every research setting. It is important to conduct similar studies in other regions, where aerial detection is less common. Nonetheless, these findings indicate that even if the risk of detection is perceived as nontrivial, offenders are willing to take a chance in the event of a successful outcome. The low costs of outdoor cultivation sites and the high-potential rewards may explain this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811418001">Bouchard 2008</xref>). It also does not change the fact that prime locations appear to influence growers into cultivating more plants. We expect that a replication in a region less policed would produce similar patterns of locations but would be distributed differently (e.g., more remote locations would be chosen) and at a different scale (e.g., larger cultivation sites).</p><p>Other limitations of this study include some uncertainty with regards to the incompleteness of our dataset as plant counts were obtained for 132 sites out of the 443 detected. There appear to be no spatial differences in sites with missing as opposed to valid plant counts and therefore it is reasonable to assume that missing data occurred randomly but this is difficult to verify. Further, it is unclear whether sites that remain undetected are able to cultivate more plants than the detected sites examined in this study—a typical limitation of research on detected, as opposed to undetected offenders. Future work could contribute by attempting to find information on the size and characteristics of sites that are never detected by police (a case-control design would be valuable). Perhaps most importantly, our dataset did not include any information on the offenders involved. We do not know, for example, whether similar offenders were involved in multiple sites in our sample. In addition, while our data contained detailed information on size and site location, we can only speculate on the type of decision-making process that influences these choices. Data derived from interviews with growers (similar to those conducted with burglars) should be used to supplement the kinds of analyses presented here.</p><p>Despite such limitations, the current study has clear implications for crime prevention. Our findings suggest that exposure to an intense eradication program over a long period of time has not led growers to stop their activities. Instead, growers have found ways to limit their losses by taking chances on prime locations that could produce a sufficiently large profit for a minimum amount of effort. Such knowledge of the decision-making of growers may help to guide prevention efforts in targeting prime locations even before they are chosen—something quite helpful in a situation, where scarce resources are allotted to cover a very large area of land. Although our findings also suggest that some displacement from those prime locations is always possible, growers will have to select sites that have less than ideal conditions (i.e., <italic>rugged</italic>, <italic>dry</italic>, and <italic>remote</italic>). In-line with the principles of situational crime prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811418001">Clarke 1980</xref>), displacement to such locations will both increase the amount of effort to set up their cultivation sites, while reducing the potential rewards associated with it.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Royal Canadian Mountain Police for access to data, as well as Owen Gallupe, Rebecca Nash, Holly Nguyen, the editor, and the anonymous reviewers for useful comments made on an earlier version of this article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn11-0022427811418001"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn12-0022427811418001"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><fn-group><title>Notes</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0022427811418001"><label>1.</label><p>The notion of “process” is central to the crime script approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811418001">Cornish (1994)</xref>.
