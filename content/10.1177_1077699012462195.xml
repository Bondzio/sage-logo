<p>9/11 presented religion reporting with a set of tremendous challenges. Could it distinguish the Islam of most Moslems from the jihadist strain that motivated nineteen terrorists to kill 2,977 innocent people in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia? Could it depict with sensitivity the myriad religious responses to the events and their aftermath? Could it describe the place of religion in the two wars that the United States subsequently waged in Muslim countries?</p>
<p>The answer, according to Christopher Vecsey, is a resounding “yes!” across the board—at least, in the case of the <italic>New York Times</italic>. “I have found the <italic>Times</italic>’ post-9/11 religion coverage to be responsible, estimable journalism,” Vecsey says in <italic>Following 9/11</italic>, “not just in any single article in which the reporter tries to define the issue and find viewpoints on its many sides, but also in the totality of reporting.”</p>
<p>Vecsey, Harry Emerson Fosdick Professor of the Humanities and Native American Studies and Religion at Colgate University, is in a good position to judge. Not only has he been privy to the culture at the <italic>Times</italic>—his brother George Vecsey is a sports columnist and former national and religion reporter there and, of course, a source for this book—but every day since 1970, he has clipped and filed <italic>New York Times</italic> articles about religion, by now filling three file cabinets with twelve drawers of clippings. In the fall of 2001, Vecsey had just begun to teach a seminar to first-year Colgate students entitled “American Religion in These Times” when the horrors of September 11 focused the class’s attention on the constant coverage of religion on the front page of the <italic>Times</italic>. In retrospect, it seems inevitable that Vecsey would write <italic>Following 9/11.</italic></p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. The first, “A Newspaper Challenged,” traces how the <italic>Times</italic> investigated motivations, meanings, and behaviors to explain the significance of 9/11. Articles celebrated interfaith solidarity, memorialized the dead, and characterized sacred places. Some of the most memorable of these articles were the daily tributes to those who died in the attack on the World Trade Center. Emphasizing the unique character and faith of 2,310 lost lives, the “Portraits of Grief” series offered consolation to those who were left behind to grieve. Vecsey quotes Michael Schudson, who observed, “In moments of tragedy journalists assume a pastoral role.”</p>
<p>Part 2, “Islam Observed,” focuses on the <italic>Times</italic>’ efforts to explain why nineteen Muslims perpetrated the 9/11 suicide killings and what they stood for and against. Moderation is a key value at the <italic>Times</italic>, which was clear in its contrast between militant Islam across the globe—austere, intolerant, violent—and the Islam of most American Muslims—ethical, community-minded, loyal to the United States.</p>
<p>Part 3, “Religious Worlds at War,” describes the <italic>Times</italic> trying to explain why a faction of Islam turned extremist, without condemning Islam wholesale as a religious faith as Christian evangelicals such as the Reverend Franklin Graham had done when he called Islam “a very evil and wicked religion.” The <italic>Times</italic> revealed its devotion to empirical science as the defining characteristic of modernity by finding that the root cause of Islamic extremism in the religion’s abiding resistance to modernization.</p>
<p>Part 4, “Meanings of 9/11,” explores the clash of Judaism and Christianity on the one hand and Islam on the other. Articles and editorials in the <italic>Times</italic> presented the Jewish and Christian West as multicultural and moderate, unlike the Islamic world, which the <italic>Times</italic> presented as theocratic and single-minded. This framework corresponded with the official U.S. justification for the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that building democratic institutions in the Muslim world would impede terrorism.</p>
<p><italic>Following 9/11</italic> has an encyclopedia quality, for better and for worse. On the positive side is the book’s depth and authority. The 89-page list of references reflects the care with which Vecsey has filled drawer after drawer of his filing cabinets with <italic>Times</italic> articles for more than forty years. And Vecsey cites all of them, many with direct quotations. In the process, unfortunately, the distinction between the reporting and the events that were reported often vanishes, themes and subthemes come and go mimetically, and the recursive text becomes, at times, tedious. The reader’s effort is ultimately worthwhile, though, because <italic>Following 9/11</italic> shows how the <italic>New York Times</italic> reported one of the most important religion stories of the era with commitment, discipline, carefulness, and heart.</p>
