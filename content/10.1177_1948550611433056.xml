<abstract>
<p>Lacking control causes illusory pattern perception, but does culture influence the patterns people perceive? Different cultural contexts invite distinct types of control, with people from Western cultures emphasizing primary control methods (i.e., personal agency) and people from East Asian cultures emphasizing secondary control methods (i.e., adjustment to surroundings). Four experiments suggest that cultural differences in primary versus secondary control orientation shape the patterns people perceive within horoscopes. When lacking (vs. possessing) control, Westerners are relatively more likely to rely on horoscopes that help them understand themselves, whereas East Asians are relatively more likely to rely on horoscopes that help them understand others. The authors isolate underlying mechanisms, demonstrating that, following loss of control, people high on primary control rely on self-focused horoscopes and people high on secondary control rely on horoscopes about friends. Thus, cultural differences in primary versus secondary control create unique signatures in pattern perception.</p>

<p>Individuals strive to gain a sense of control, which is central to well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611433056">Cohen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611433056">Glass &amp; Singer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611433056">Klein, Fencil-Morse, &amp; Seligman, 1976</xref>). When individuals cannot gain a sense of control objectively, they attempt to gain it perceptually by perceiving illusory patterns—meaningful interrelationships among a set of unrelated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611433056">Kay, Whitson, Gaucher, &amp; Galinsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611433056">Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>). One question is how people from different cultures who experience a loss of control might diverge in the patterns they perceive. We propose that culture can define a preferential focus for the types of patterns perceived: whereas Westerners prefer patterns that provide information about themselves, East Asians prefer patterns that provide information about their social relationships. We posit that this difference originates in the different conceptions of control emphasized within each of these cultures (i.e., primary vs. secondary control; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611433056">Morling, Kitayama, &amp; Miyamoto, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We first discuss illusory pattern perception as a response to lacking control, specifically describing why horoscopes offer a useful lens to study this phenomenon cross-culturally. We then turn to primary and secondary control as specific pathways through which culture can shape pattern perception.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611433056">
<title>Are There Cultural Differences in Illusory Pattern Perception?</title>
<p>When control is threatened, people often compensate for the subsequent uncertainty by imbuing the external world with higher levels of structure and order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611433056">Kay, Moscovitch, &amp; Laurin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611433056">Laurin, Kay, &amp; Moscovitch, 2008</xref>). People who lack control are more likely to perceive meaningful images in displays of static noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611433056">Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>), believe in a more controlling god (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611433056">Kay et al., 2009</xref>), and believe in superstitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611433056">Kay et al., 2009</xref>). In this article, we specifically explore how loss of control affects pattern perception in horoscopes.</p>
<p>Horoscopes, which provide information about individuals’ personality, relationships, and future purportedly discerned from birthdates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611433056">Hartmann, Reuter, &amp; Nyborg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611433056">Tester, 1987</xref>), are ideal tools in the study of illusory pattern perception. Their gnomic and equivocating description provides fertile ground for people to perceive false resemblances to their own and others’ characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611433056">Forer, 1949</xref>), and indeed, people are invariably fascinated by the information horoscopes provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611433056">Lillqvist &amp; Lindeman, 1998</xref>). Both Western and East Asian astrologers independently developed horoscopes that featured animals, were divided into 12 parts, and used birthdates to make predictions about people’s lives. The familiarity of horoscopes around the world makes them an excellent tool to study pattern perception across cultures.</p>
<p>Culture may affect the types of patterns perceived. We suggest that Westerners will prefer horoscopes that provide information about themselves and East Asians will prefer horoscopes that provide information about their social relationships (e.g., their friends), with the different conceptions of control emphasized within each culture driving these differences.</p>
<sec id="section2-1948550611433056">
<title>Culture and control</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611433056">Morling, Kitayama, and Miyamoto (2002</xref>) show that, compared to East Asian contexts, Western contexts tend to invite higher primary control, whereby people prefer to control their environment through personal agency. We propose that self-focused information is appealing to people who seek primary control. Imagine an employee with a primary control preference responding to an abusive manager: by understanding himself (e.g., Am I aggressive or reserved?), he gains information that enables him to plan effective responses that employ his own capabilities—arguing with versus appeasing his manager, for example. This preference for self-focused information can be assessed by giving people self-focused horoscopes, which can offer individualized and defining (although not necessarily accurate) information about the self and its capabilities. We hypothesize that when responding to a loss of control, Westerners will rely on self-focused horoscopes.</p>
<p>Compared to Western contexts, East Asian contexts emphasize secondary control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611433056">Morling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611433056">Rothbaum, Weisz, &amp; Snyder, 1982</xref>), which involves people adjusting to surroundings. Adjustment implies knowing and understanding the characteristics of the social environment. For instance, if the employee in the above example instead had a secondary control preference, learning about his own strengths and weaknesses might crystallize his self-perceptions at just the moment he needs to be most adaptive. Information about the self’s stable properties is less useful for adjustment because it anchors the self and limits its flexibility in adapting to the social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611433056">Rhee, Uleman, Lee, &amp; Roman, 1995</xref>). Conversely, knowing more about the boss’s and his coworkers’ characters enables the employee to adapt to them and gain their support—information about others in his social environment is more useful than information about himself. We hypothesize that when responding to a loss of control, rather than focusing on information about themselves, East Asians will focus on information about others.</p>
<p>In sum, the current research uses horoscopes as a lens through which to examine illusory pattern perception cross-culturally and suggests that the different forms of control preferred by each culture (i.e., primary vs. secondary) shape the patterns people seek when they lack control. Western cultural contexts invite primary control, rendering self-focused information more appealing. By contrast, because East Asian cultural contexts invite secondary control, information about members of social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611433056">Menon, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1999</xref>) will be a likely focal point for illusory pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611433056">Nisbett &amp; Masuda, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Four experiments explore how horoscope beliefs vary as a function of culture and control. Experiment 1 demonstrates the phenomenon, establishing that Westerners, but not East Asians, who lack (vs. possess) control are more likely to believe horoscopes that refer to the self. Experiment 2 conceptually replicates this pattern among East Asians, showing that East Asians who lack control, but not Westerners, are more likely to believe horoscopes that refer to friends. Moreover, Experiment 2 shows that horoscopes inform expectations about career paths. Finally, Experiment 3 measures levels of primary and secondary control, which we predict respectively drive the reliance on self-focused horoscopes in Westerners and other-focused horoscopes in East Asians. Following approaches by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611433056">Brockner and Chen (1996</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611433056">Wang and Leung (2010</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611433056">Wang, Leung, See, and Gao (2011</xref>), we isolate the possible psychological mechanisms underlying the observed cultural differences. We reverse the cultural patterns in Experiments 1 and 2 such that, when facing a loss of control, East Asians high on primary control tend to believe self-focused horoscopes (3A) and Westerners high on secondary control tend to believe horoscopes about their friends (3B).</p>
<p>In studying illusory pattern perception cross-culturally, we extend theory by providing two new contributions to this research. Experiments 1 and 2 show that, following a lack of control, Westerners are relatively more likely to prefer self-focused (but not other-focused) information and East Asians are more likely to prefer other-focused (but not self-focused) information. This illustrates a boundary condition for the phenomenon—people who lack control do not incorporate stimuli indiscriminately into patterns; rather, culture influences which stimuli are incorporated.</p>
<p>A second contribution expands on past research on illusory pattern perception by breaking apart control—generally conceptualized as a single construct—into two distinct constructs: primary and secondary control. In Experiments 3A and 3B, we are able to differentiate between primary and secondary control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611433056">Morling et al., 2002</xref>) and show that preferences for them may produce unique signatures in pattern perception, with those high on primary control (i.e., a tendency predominant in Western cultures) focusing on information about the self and those high on secondary control (i.e., a tendency predominant in East Asian cultures) focusing on information about friends.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>Experiment 1 explored whether lacking control affected perceptions of self-focused illusory patterns. As compared to East Asians, we predicted that Westerners would be more receptive to self-focused horoscopes when lacking (vs. possessing) control. Because self-focused information tends to be less pertinent to East Asians’ conceptions of control, we expected they would be less receptive to self-focused horoscopes when lacking control. We varied horoscope content to confirm that this pattern persists regardless of the specific horoscope content.</p>

<title>Participants and Design</title>
<p>One hundred fifty-four participants (55 Singaporean Chinese: 28 male; 27 female; 99 American Caucasians: 39 male; 60 female) participated in a 2 (Control: Lacking, Possessing) × 2 (Culture: East Asian, Western) experiment. Each participant also evaluated traits that were either relevant to the horoscope or not, yielding a mixed-model design with repeated measures.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section7-1948550611433056">
<title>Control manipulation</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611433056">Whitson and Galinsky (2008</xref>), half the participants wrote about an experience in which they possessed control, and half wrote about lacking control. In the <italic>possessing control [lacking control]</italic> condition, participants were asked to, “Please recall a particular incident in which something happened and you were in <italic>complete control of [did not have any control over]</italic> the situation. Please describe the situation in which you felt <italic>in complete [a complete lack of]</italic> control—what happened, how you felt, etc.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611433056">
<title>Horoscope manipulation</title>
<p>Participants entered their birthday and received a horoscope in return. To rule out the explanation that the horoscope’s content mattered, participants received one of two horoscopes, describing either a reserved or a risk-seeking personality.</p>
<p>Those in the reserved condition were told, “You can be extremely reserved and quiet. You dislike talking to people and prefer to have a few close friends…” Those in the risk-seeking condition were told, “You like to take risks in life and can be quite adventurous. You enjoy talking to people and prefer having large circles of friends…” The rest of the horoscope (which concerned their enjoyment of pleasing things and a good life) remained constant across conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550611433056">
<title>Belief in horoscope</title>
<p>Participants first rated their own personalities along the dimensions noted in the horoscope, “I see myself as reserved and quiet” (reserved condition) or “I see myself as risk-seeking and adventurous” (risk-seeking condition). All used the scale 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. No interaction with culture and control emerged with horoscope content, <italic>F </italic>&lt; 1. Therefore, we combined these two measures (α = .72) into one scale measuring how well participants thought the horoscope described them.</p>
<p>Also, to show that the effects were specific to the given feedback, participants also rated a statement that was irrelevant to the horoscope, “I see myself as anxious and easily upset.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550611433056">
<title>Exposure to horoscopes</title>
<p>We asked participants how often they read horoscopes (1 = <italic>not very often</italic>, 7 = <italic>extremely often</italic>). This variable was nonsignificant in all experiments (all <italic>F</italic>’s &lt; 1); therefore, analyses are reported without it.</p>

<p>Whereas Westerners were somewhat more likely to see themselves as possessing the horoscope-relevant trait when lacking control versus possessing control, <italic>t</italic>(146) = 1.70, <italic>p </italic>= .09, East Asians believed the horoscope less when lacking control than when possessing control, <italic>t</italic>(146) = −2.17, <italic>p </italic>= .03.

<sec id="section13-1948550611433056">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 1 showed that relative to East Asians, loss of control heightened Westerners’ beliefs in self-focused horoscopes. East Asians facing loss of control were less likely to believe self-focused information, perhaps because it inhibits the self’s capacity for adjustment. To explore whether East Asians are generally less likely to exhibit pattern perception when lacking control, or whether they simply form other types of patterns, Experiment 2 focused on the type of information in horoscopes applicable to East Asian conceptions of control, that is, information about social relationships. As descriptions of groups are more complicated than those of individuals, and therefore not easily comparable, we focused on horoscopes about a single friend. We predicted that East Asians who lack (vs. possess) control would be more receptive to information about their social relationships. In contrast, we predicted that these patterns would be attenuated among Westerners, given that, compared to East Asians, they show less emphasis on secondary control. We also sought to extend the findings by showing that people incorporate horoscope information into perceptions of career intentions.</p>
<sec id="section14-1948550611433056">
<title>Participants and Design</title>
<p>Eighty-two participants (52 Singaporean Chinese: 29 male; 23 female; 30 American Caucasians: 8 male; 22 female) participated in this study for credit. The design was 2 (Control: Lacking, Possessing) × 2 (Culture: East Asian, Western).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1948550611433056">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We manipulated control as in Experiment 1 but altered the subsequent procedure in three ways. We used horoscopes about a friend rather than the self, varied horoscope content to cover a new trait (creativity) to illustrate the robustness of the effect, and also measured beliefs about career preferences.</p>
<p>Following the control manipulation, participants provided a friend’s birthday, then received horoscope feedback that their friend was “creative and inventive,” along with the same general description in Experiment 1. Participants assessed their friend’s likelihood to apply for an accountant position and a sales director position (1 = <italic>very unlikely</italic> to 7 = <italic>very likely</italic>). A pretest indicated that accountants are viewed as stereotypically low in creativity and sales directors as neither stereotypically creative nor uncreative.</p>

<title>Perceiving Friends’ Career Preference</title>
<p>We first performed a Culture × Control × Trait (horoscope-relevant, horoscope-irrelevant) mixed-model ANOVA with repeated measures on the third factor. A marginally significant three-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 3.02, <italic>p </italic>= .09, suggested that this effect is driven by East Asians incorporating a friend’s horoscope information when lacking control (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550611433056">Table 1</xref>, Experiment 2 rows).</p>
<p>For the horoscope-relevant profession (accountant), the predicted Culture × Control interaction emerged, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 4.46, <italic>p </italic>= .04. East Asians who lacked (vs. possessed) control believed their friend would be less likely to apply for an accountant position, <italic>t</italic>(78) = 2.25, <italic>p </italic>= .03. In contrast, no difference emerged between Westerners by control, <italic>t</italic>(78) = .79, <italic>p </italic>= .43.</p>
<p>For the horoscope-irrelevant profession (sales director), the Culture × Control interaction was nonsignificant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = .02, <italic>p </italic>= .90. Lacking control did not cause East Asians to rate their friend as unlikely to apply for any position—only the uncreative one.</p>
<p>East Asians who lacked control were more likely to believe horoscope information about their friends, drawing inferences about their career preferences consistent with this illusory pattern.

<title>Experiment 3A</title>
<p>We have asserted that primary and secondary control preferences lead to distinct forms of illusory pattern perception, revolving around either self- or other-focused information. One powerful way to test a mechanism in cross-cultural research is to identify the specific beliefs, values, or situations under which the proposed effect emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611433056">Nisbett, 2003</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611433056">Brockner and Chen (1996</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611433056">Wang and Leung (2010</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611433056">Wang et al. (2011</xref>), we test the underlying mechanisms for cultural differences in pattern perception by measuring individual differences in primary and secondary control and showing that they moderate horoscope beliefs for the self and other, respectively. When lacking control, the most primary control-oriented East Asians should prefer horoscopes about themselves and the most secondary-control oriented Americans should prefer horoscopes about friends. This method, which provides evidence for the mechanisms responsible for the cultural differences demonstrated in Experiments 1 and 2, shows that people with consonant belief structures, even if they are members of different cultures, will display the same pattern perception preferences.</p>
<p>Experiment 3A replicates Western patterns among East Asians high in primary control. Although East Asians generally exhibit lower levels of primary control than Westerners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611433056">Morling et al., 2002</xref>; also confirmed in our pretesting),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1948550611433056">1</xref>
</sup> those East Asians higher in levels of primary control are expected to rely more on self-focused information (similar to Westerners in Experiment 1).</p>
<p>Finally, we move beyond perceptions and introduce a tangible behavioral response to assess whether horoscope information influences individuals' subsequent behavior.</p>

<p>Thirty-five Singaporean Chinese participants (22 male; 13 female) participated for credit. The design had two conditions: lacking versus possessing control.</p>

<sec id="section20-1948550611433056">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We followed the same procedure as Experiment 1, with three changes. We measured primary and secondary control, adapted the creativity feedback from Experiment 2 by making it self- rather than other-focused, and assessed behavior, that is, whether people thought in more divergent (also considered creative; McCrae &amp; Ingraham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611433056">1987</xref>) ways following such feedback.</p>
<sec id="section21-1948550611433056">
<title>Primary and secondary control measures</title>
<p>Participants first completed a subset of questions assessing primary control (4 items, α = .67; <italic>M</italic> = 4.43; <italic>SD </italic>= .67), for example, “I think my success depends on what I do and how hard I work,” and secondary control (4 items, α = .81; <italic>M </italic>= 3.44; <italic>SD </italic>= 1.11), for example, “I would like to study something like law, psychology, management, electronics, or computers because people in these occupations are greatly admired and respected”; 1 = <italic>does not describe me at all</italic> to 6 = <italic>describes me very accurately</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611433056">Seginer, Trommsdorff, &amp; Essau, 1993</xref>). We performed a confirmatory factor analysis using a direct oblimin rotation to allow for correlated factors. The expected two factors were extracted, reflecting primary control (with primary control items loading above .55) and secondary control (with secondary control items loading above .60). The items were averaged to form two scales (primary control and secondary control; <italic>r</italic>(35) = .40; <italic>p </italic>= .02).</p>

<p>Participants listed the first 10 tools that came to mind.

An average for the 10 tools formed an overall measure of familiarity, which we reverse coded such that higher scores reflected more divergent (i.e., creative) thinking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article reveals that people who lack control perceive illusory patterns in a potentially inaccurate source such as a horoscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611433056">Forer, 1949</xref>). Moreover, culture can guide this process, influencing what kinds of patterns people perceive when they lack control.</p>
<p>Specifically, Experiment 1 showed that relative to when possessing control, Westerners lacking control were more likely to see patterns in self-focused horoscopes. Experiment 2 showed that East Asians who lacked control believed horoscopes about their friends. Experiments 3A and 3B showed that primary and secondary control preferences may account for these effects, with people high in primary control more likely to believe in self-focused horoscopes and people high in secondary control more likely to believe in other-focused horoscopes. These findings show that cultural differences in conceptions of control influence the type of information individuals are most likely to incorporate into illusory patterns, and that lack of control therefore can affect peoples’ perceptions about personality, career intentions, and even behavior in different ways across cultures.</p>
<p>The key contribution of this article lies in specifying the antecedents to pattern perception following lacking control. Specifically, the article highlights culture’s powerful role in shaping people’s sense of control. Culture does not only shape how people characterize the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611433056">Heine &amp; Hamamura, 2007</xref>), but whether the “in-control self” is an agent that exercises primary or secondary control. Our findings suggest that a primary control orientation (e.g., more prevalent within Western contexts) is associated with preferences for information about the self. In contrast, a secondary control orientation (e.g., more prevalent within East Asian contexts), is associated with preferences for information about others. This culturally informed variation suggests that people lacking control will not fixate on just any stimulus to form patterns, but rather will perceive patterns that are consistent with their culturally preferred form of control.</p>
<sec id="section32-1948550611433056">
<title>Future Considerations</title>
<p>Similar patterns of effects emerged in Experiments 1 and 2 (which tapped into cultural differences), and in Experiments 3A and 3B (which tapped into primary and secondary control). The combination of these studies provides a strong argument that primary and secondary control orientations are central mechanisms behind the cultural findings. Future research could investigate more directly whether control orientations drive the cultural responses in pattern perception when lacking control, as well as explore other psychological mechanisms that could be applicable to culture, control, and pattern perception.</p>
<p>Another future consideration revolves around interpreting East Asians’ adaption to lack of control. Research on secondary control, growing out of work on learned helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611433056">Seligman, 1975</xref>), has sought to differentiate responses to loss of control such as passivity and withdrawal from the more active process of aligning oneself with the world to increase fit to regain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611433056">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611433056">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611433056">Skinner, 2007</xref>). One question, therefore, is whether the other-focused illusory patterns formed by those with a preference for secondary control help them accept their current circumstances or, alternatively, help them actively pursue greater individual control over the environment. Future research along these lines can explore the motives underlying primary and secondary control.</p>
<p>Our work is related to the Meaning Maintenance Model (i.e., MMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611433056">Heine, Proulx, &amp; Vohs, 2006</xref>), which broadly posits that when meaning is threatened (whether via threats to self-esteem, control, or certainty), the need to reassert meaning in the world is evoked. Just as terror management theory falls under the umbrella of MMM (by predicting that mortality threats will increase the defense of and belief in dominant cultural beliefs and norms), so too does this work.</p>
<p>However, whereas the MMM provides an umbrella under which much pattern perception and meaning-making literature falls, it is silent on why specific forms of control preferred by each culture would affect the types of patterns perceived. By showing that primary and secondary control are specific drivers of the types of patterns preferred, to the point of reversing our effects with Westerners high in secondary control that prefer other-focused horoscopes, and East Asians high in primary control that prefer self-focused horoscopes, we illuminate a key boundary condition of the phenomena. Facing loss of control, participants use information from horoscopes associated with their specific forms of control loss to which they are sensitive and ignore those not associated with their control loss. Future research can explore in more detail how MMM relates to various forms of control and culture, and the similarities and differences of how various phenomenon that fall under the rubric of MMM (e.g., terror management theory; self-esteem threats; reactions to uncertainty) affect pattern perception.</p>
<p>Our research also illuminates the potential consequences of lacking control by identifying the types of information people from different cultures are sensitive to in this situation. Consider the implications for persuasion. Whereas horoscopes are a passive information source, leaders, groups, and corporations can also potentially manipulate people’s sense of self or the views of their social group when they are lacking control by offering the information we have documented here—namely, dubious information about the self or others. Our data show how Westerners may develop and construct their self-concepts as they seek to verify their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611433056">Swann, 1987</xref>) following threats to control. Their emphasis on primary control may make them more susceptible to identity-related persuasion. For example, leaders may trigger lack of control to encourage people to support policy decisions they assert are identity related. The critical implication is that at least a portion of our beliefs about the self may consist of illusory patterns that emerge from potentially questionable sources.</p>
<p>Conversely, those seeking secondary control are more readily persuaded by information offering them clarity about others. This information might mislead people about the true nature of their friends and the environment, potentially exacerbating conflict. For instance, Sullivan, Landau, and Rothschild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611433056">2010</xref>) find illusory patterns in politics, showing that as an election draws nearer and control is threatened, people are more likely to view their opponents as conspiring through dirty tricks. Kramer’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611433056">1994</xref>) on paranoia similarly shows that those who lack control are more likely to perceive conspiratorial connections among people in their social environment. While such attributions clarify perceptions of others, they also increase hostilities. The critical implication is that portions of our beliefs about others may be inaccurate. Further, these different cultural conceptions of control could create divergent illusory patterns during times of unrest or change when people are especially prone to feel loss of control.</p>
<p>One final question for further research is whether illusory patterns provide psychological and/or performance benefits. Suggestive work shows that illusory pattern perception enhances the individual’s sense of control, self-efficacy, and hence performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611433056">Damisch, Stoberock, &amp; Mussweiler, 2010</xref>). Our results potentially speak to cross-cultural performance effects. For Westerners, self-focused pattern perception may help them recapture primary control and gain a sense of self-efficacy, which, in turn may aid individual job and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611433056">Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, 1998</xref>). For East Asians, using pattern perception to regain a sense of secondary control may affect interactions with others, which may have positive ramifications on group-level performance. Finally, one interesting area for future research would be to explore the behavioral effects found in Experiment 3A. As those who were influenced by the creative horoscope showed more divergent thinking, similar effects may improve performance on complex decision-making tasks that require considering information from multiple perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611433056">Nemeth &amp; Kwan, 1987</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>People have long seen patterns in the stars, but people across the world do not see the same patterns in the same stars. Our findings are the first to reveal how individuals from different cultures may display different forms of illusory pattern perception, and that these displays may be driven by different conceptions of control. This work elucidates on the mechanisms beneath illusory pattern perception, how different cultures make different sense of the same events (particularly when those events are highly uncertain), and how different conceptions of control can affect perceptions of the self and others.</p>
