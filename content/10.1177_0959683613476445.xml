<p>As rivers are sensitive to environmental changes in their catchments, reconstructed river histories can aid understanding of present river states, and in future-casting river scenarios. From the 1980s, recognition has grown of the value of studying rivers over historic and longer timescales – in understanding the potential range of fluvial responses, sensitivity to changing controls, and key drivers that operate over different spatial and temporal scales. In his editorial, Vita-Finzi emphasises traditional foci on river processes rather than development. Methods of dating and environmental reconstruction – radiometric, cosmogenic, archaeological, historical and geodetic – have advanced rapidly over the last 30 years. The time is indeed ripe to reappraise research into ‘river history in its own right, and integrated with other enquiries’.</p>
<p>The nine papers effectively draw together expert insights on the implications of methodological advances, expansions in the range of datable materials, and the integration of multimethods – to unravel river development and associated drivers. The volume’s scope is wide and engaging, with papers structured around three major sources of ideas and techniques: isotope-based environmental analysis and dating; plate tectonics and planetary exploration; the integration of biological and physical brands of geoscience. The volume’s value is in evidencing contributions from different subdisciplines – including conceptual advances in geomorphology and hydrology, and methodological developments in sedimentology, remote-sensing, geophysics, geochronology, and planetary science. Despite a primary focus on applications of high technology, there is reassuring recognition of scope for low technology investigation and interpretations of river history that rely on ‘human shrewdness rather than technical subtlety’. This review builds out in scale, time and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Over shorter timescales, Coulthard and Van de Wiel highlight how advances in field data capture (through laser scanning, computing and model algorithms) over four decades have had major implications for the potential and resolution of numerical modelling, whether landscape-scale evolution or computational fluid dynamic models. Their insightful review explores strengths and limitations of modelling as an approach to predicting future rivers, complementing field observation. Importantly they reflect on the strong potential of numerical methods to ‘challenge current ideas and raise new and important questions about the behaviour of rivers’; an important theme in the volume. Extending the historic timespan, both Trimble and Whitcombe demonstrate the benefits of fathoming rich, accessible historic archival sources in reconstructing river development over daily to decadal timescales, and on medium to large river systems. For Trimble, archives are critical resources in identifying disturbance-driven systems to unravel relative contributions of human intervention and climate as a precursor to restoration. By contrast, Whitcombe innovatively weaves river history and human health, using official records of meteorological departments, British Government in India, to establish chronology and narrative of floods/droughts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Indus Deltas – both subject to variability of monsoon weather systems. Thus she demonstrates how malaria, its epidemiological types and transmission are closely correlated with natural development and human-induced constraint of these deltas. Such analysis would be impossible without such archival detail.</p>
<p>River sediments themselves form critical river archives that can now be assessed and dated in new ways. Over decadal timescales and large spatial scales, Aalto and Nittrouer present an enhanced methodology integrating river sediment survey with a new conceptual model of <sup>210</sup>Pb inputs during floods, to identify and date individual sediment accumulation events on floodplains in dynamic heterogeneous large tropical river systems. Such results corroborate well with other evidence including known flood dates. While Williams focuses on reading microscale evidence from sedimentary units in largest-scale river systems globally, Macklin et al. also focus on field stratigraphic evidence of river sediments and landforms, in reconstructing hydrological and soil erosion processes over smaller spatial and more mixed temporal scales. Their paper integrates evidence from their research over the past three decades in the reconstruction of mainly European river history.</p>
<p>At the macroscale, Williams showcases the value of reading river sediments in environmental reconstruction in the Nile basin, with its complex histories of tectonic, climatic and volcanic activity, and changing sediment yield, balance of suspended and bedload, and potential for river metamorphosis. Techniques include strontium isotope dating of freshwater gastropods. He achieves remarkably detailed flood histories over 15 kyr, and less detailed over 150 kyr, despite ‘patchy’ alluvial records. From this evidence, he demonstrates how longer-term reconstructions help with identifying key river changes and possible drivers, such as orbital and solar irradiance cycles, and El Niño Southern oscillation events in river history – and reflecting on their applicability to other large-scale river systems. In contrast, Macklin et al. reconstruct over later Pleistocene, Holocene and historical/ instrumental time periods, drawing on increasing numbers of luminescence and uranium series ages and <sup>14</sup>C dating of fluvial units. The paper’s value is as a substantive review of the synchronism of morphodynamic river systems change over nested timescales, including the potential to draw out climate signals from archival niches. Problems still continue in scaling from simple physical models, and upwards from the local.</p>
<p>River history research has potential to provide essential sustainability science to underpin river management. While several papers make concluding links to management issues, Wasson provides the explicitly applied paper constructing ‘river management’ as needing understanding of pre-disturbance states and identification of baselines as possible management targets – identification and amelioration of perturbations from a desirable state. ‘The distinction between basic and applicable knowledge is often slight, and, with thought, the basic can become the applied.’ He argues the importance of catchment scale in quantitative differences of pre and post disturbance sediment yield, and that target states cannot be equilibrium states; river change needs to be expected. There is, however, perhaps more potential to integrate with other papers in the volume.</p>
<p>Two papers step-jump out in scale and time. Vita-Finzi argues the importance of explanatory nature of fluvial tectonics; that researching river behaviour as captured in river drainage patterns allows new understandings of impacts of longer-term planetary controls such as crustal deformation by tectonic processes. The paper underscores how multidisciplinary advances in remote sensing, isotopic dating and numerical modelling help in unravelling effects – of different tectonic pasts and their impacts before and during river system development. Finally Carr demonstrates the potential of advances in remote sensing and global altimetry in exploring what is known about the Martian river history as ‘by far the most dissected body of the solar system other than earth’. Such histories are evidenced by branching valley networks, outflow flood channels, and water-worn or water-deposited landforms. The traditional value of visual interpretation is applied in a new Martian setting. ‘Uncertainty’ is foregrounded – about events that triggered changes to the Martian surface including possibilities of episodic, massive volcanic events. We gain insights into major unanswered questions – such as how early Mars became warm enough to allow widespread fluvial erosion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this volume provides an important marker of the current state of inter- and multidisciplinary science into river histories. It combines insightful review – critiquing new conceptual advances and identifying important methodological developments – and their potential to challenge thinking about river behaviour. The volume does not argue its comprehensive status; in one sense it is a subjective mix but significant players are there. There are gaps, e.g. in what can be learnt from river histories through marine systems. The focus is primarily basic research. There is strong potential to explore more systematically the implications/applications of this science for river management. As Macklin et al. muse – despite significant advances in river system research, the applied potential of fluvial palaeohydrology has yet to be realised. The volume represents a valuable research resource for academic and doctoral students aspirant to immerse themselves more holistically in the state-of-science research on river histories.</p>
