<p>T. R. Chandrupatla, Cambridge University Press, 2009, £60.00 (hardback)</p>
<p>This will be a very useful text book for anyone who needs an introduction to quality and statistics and their application in statistical process control. The book is laid out in an organized way and well written, making it easy to read chapter by chapter, or delve into for a specific subject. The figures are clearly presented and well drawn, but there are minor improvements that could be made. For example, some of the equation texts are very small and the section titles in each chapter do not stand out clearly. Also, Chapter 6 on data presentation could arguably have come earlier on in the book.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the book covers geometric tolerances, probability, and statistics as applied to process control, and a limited coverage of reliability. At approximately £60, the book is good value for a quality hardback that should stand up to years of usage. Each chapter has a set of exercises to bring home the application of the text, which is a useful feature for any text book used for teaching purposes. It is also very helpful to have the relevant links to MS EXCEL, so that the functions can be used in software when needed. The book contains a useful CD-ROM of MS EXCEL spreadsheets, which serve to give examples of the formulae and distribution functions used in the main text.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 gives a helpful summary of the main probability concepts, and explains both discrete and continuous distributions. Although examples are used for the discrete and normal distribution, it would have been useful to also quote examples for Chi-squared, <italic>t</italic>-, and <italic>F</italic>- distributions as well. For example, greater effect could be made by linking section 4.6 (Chi-squared distribution) with section 12.4 (testing), where the former is used for calculating confidence limits and intervals.</p>
<p>In a book of this title, I would have expected more on the six-sigma technique, since it is a key methodology for improving quality, and is in widespread use. There are just two references in the text, and a short summary would have been beneficial.</p>
<p>Although ‘reliability’ is part of the title, this is not a major emphasis within the book. The subject is not really covered in detail until Chapters 11 and 12, although these do contain useful information on systems reliability and testing. Hence, if someone were looking for major works in the field of reliability, I would only recommend this book as a background text.</p>
<p>Section 5.9 on hypothesis testing seems to be the traditional means of testing the null and alternative hypotheses, according to the Neyman–Pearson (N–P) method. However, reference is made to the ‘p-method’, which seems to be confusing the former technique with that of Fisher’s method for significance testing. For a full explanation of the two different approaches, reference should be made to the work of Hubbard and Bayarri.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011425625">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>All in all, this is a very useful text book for those in industry, plus staff and students at University, as it gives a good coverage of quality and statistical subjects. It also gives a useful introduction to the basic principles of reliability.</p>
