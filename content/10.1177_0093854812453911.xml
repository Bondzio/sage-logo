<abstract>
<p>In an effort to reduce first-time sexual offending, this study focuses on the development of a risk assessment tool, the Minnesota Sexual Criminal Offending Risk Estimate (MnSCORE), designed for prisoners without any prior sexual offending history. Logistic regression modeling was used to develop the MnSCORE on a sample of 9,064 male offenders released from Minnesota prisons between 2003 and 2006. Bootstrap resampling was used to not only refine the selection of predictors but also internally validate the model. With an optimism-corrected area under the curve (AUC) of 0.763, the results showed the MnSCORE has moderately high predictive discrimination. Because the risk of first-time sexual offending was significantly lower for offenders who completed prison-based chemical dependency (CD) treatment, it is anticipated the MnSCORE may best be used as a trailer assessment to help better prioritize prisoners for CD treatment—both in prison and in the community following release.</p>

<p>Efforts to control sexual offending often focus on sexual recidivism by requiring convicted sex offenders to register, notifying communities where they will be living, prohibiting them from living near child congregation locations, and increasing the penalties for repeat offenders and registration noncompliance. Despite the well-deserved focus on convicted sex offenders, the reality is that many sex offenses are committed by those without a prior sex offense conviction (i.e., first-time offenders). In looking at Minnesota data, for example, we see that 90% of those convicted of a sex crime in 2005 did not have a prior sex offense conviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812453911">Duwe, Donnay, &amp; Tewksbury, 2008</xref>). Moreover, among offenders released from Minnesota prisons, those without a prior sexual offending history account for a greater total number of sex offense convictions following release from prison. Of the 11,379 individual male offenders released from Minnesota prisons between 2003 and 2006, 2,315 had a history of sexual offending (“sex offenders”) prior to their release from prison, whereas the remaining 9,064 had no such history (“non–sex offenders”). In the first 4 years following their release from prison, the 2,315 sex offenders accounted for 76 new sex offense convictions compared to 100 for the 9,064 non–sex offenders. Although the sex offenders had a higher sex offense reconviction rate (3.3% vs. 1.1%), the non–sex offenders accounted for a larger number of sex offense convictions (100 vs. 76).</p>
<p>Focusing on convicted sex offenders is important, for one of the best predictors of future behavior is past behavior. But in concentrating almost exclusively on preventing sexual recidivism, control efforts have neglected many sex offenses that occur. If individuals with an elevated risk for sexual offending can be accurately identified before they commit a sex offense, then it might be possible to implement interventions that address the factors that promote first-time sexual offending. If effective, the interventions would reduce the occurrence of sexual victimizations, which have been shown to be the second most costly type of crime to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812453911">Cohen &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Incarcerated offenders are, in several ways, an ideal population on which to focus prevention and control efforts for first-time sexual offending. First, correctional systems, particularly prisons, often collect and maintain a vast amount and variety of data on the offenders incarcerated. These data can, in turn, be analyzed to help identify factors that may predict first-time sexual offending. Second, assuming that first-time sexual offending risk can be predicted with a relatively high degree of accuracy, it may be possible to target interventions to higher-risk inmates while they are in correctional custody.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>This study presents results from the development of the Minnesota Sexual Criminal Offending Risk Estimate (MnSCORE), an actuarial instrument designed to predict first-time sexual offending among prisoners with no prior sex crime convictions. The sample for this study consisted of 9,064 male offenders released from Minnesota prisons between 2003 and 2006 who did not have a history of sexual offending prior to their release from prison. Using a 4-year follow-up period to track first-time sexual offending, a multiple logistic regression model was used to develop the MnSCORE. An offender’s MnSCORE value therefore represents his predicted probability of receiving a first-time sex offense conviction within 4 years of release from prison. Bootstrap resampling was used to internally validate the MnSCORE, and an interrater reliability assessment was conducted to estimate the consistency with which the instrument can be scored.</p>
<p>Following a review of the literature on the risk factors associated with both first-time and repeat sexual offending, this study situates the development of the MnSCORE within the broader evidence-based practices literature. After describing the sample and the recidivism measure used, the different types of methods to develop prediction tools and internally validate prediction models are discussed. This study then presents the results from the statistical analyses and discusses the implications of the findings for correctional practice.</p>

<title>Risk Factors for Sexual Offending</title>
<p>Actuarial risk assessment instruments are typically geared toward predicting a future occurrence of similar criminal behavior. For example, an instrument such as the Level of Service Inventory–Revised (LSI-R) predicts general recidivism for those who have committed any type of crime requiring criminal justice intervention, whereas sex offender risk assessment tools predict future sexual offending for convicted sex offenders. A recent notable exception involves the prediction tool created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812453911">Berk, Sherman, Barnes, Kurtz, and Ahlman (2009)</xref> that assesses homicide risk for offenders on probation in Philadelphia who had not previously committed a homicide. Although risk assessment tools have been created that attempt to detect whether individuals have prior involvement in problematic sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812453911">Abel, Jordan, Hand, Holland, &amp; Phipps, 2001</xref>), there are currently no risk assessment instruments that focus on predicting whether individuals will commit a first-time sex offense in the future.</p>
<p>Existing research on the origins of sexual violence has identified a number of risk factors. Studies have found, for example, that sexual aggression is linked to childhood abuse and neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812453911">Dhawan &amp; Marshall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812453911">Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, &amp; Tanaka, 1991</xref>). Sexual violence has also been associated with increased sexualization, which includes greater deviance, promiscuity, and compulsivity among those who sexually offend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812453911">Knight, Prentky, &amp; Cerce, 1994</xref>). Research has further shown that sexually coercive males are more likely to hold rape myth beliefs, possess hostile attitudes toward women, and have aggressive tendencies and psychopathic traits such as impulsivity and empathy deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812453911">DeGue, DiLillo, &amp; Scalora, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812453911">Fernandez &amp; Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812453911">Murnen, Wright, &amp; Kaluzny, 2002</xref>). Last, substance abuse has been found not only to elevate the odds of sexual violence among college males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812453911">Carr &amp; VanDeusen, 2004</xref>) but also to increase the severity of sexual assaults that occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812453911">Abbey, Clinton-Sherrod, McAuslan, Zawacki, &amp; Buck, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the literature on the etiology of sexual violence, a large body of research has emerged on sex offender recidivism. In their meta-analysis of nearly 100 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812453911">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2004)</xref> identified a handful of risk factors associated with repeat sexual offending. Most notably, they reported that deviant sexual interests, prior criminal history, a history of noncontact sex offenses, an emotional identification with children, and conflicts in intimate relationships were among the strongest predictors of sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>Included within the literature on the predictors of sexual recidivism have been efforts to develop actuarial tools that assess sexual recidivism risk among convicted sex offenders. Since the 1990s, the Static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812453911">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812453911">2003</xref>), the Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide (SORAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812453911">Quinsey, Rice, &amp; Harris, 1995</xref>), and the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool–Revised (MnSOST-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812453911">Epperson, Kaul, Huot, Goldman, &amp; Alexander, 2003</xref>) have emerged as the most widely used sex offender risk assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812453911">McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, &amp; Ellerby, 2009</xref>). Because prior history is a good predictor of whether offenders will recidivate, these instruments have largely focused on prior sexual offending characteristics such as the number of previous sex offenses (Static, SORAG, and MnSOST-R), stranger victims (Static and MnSOST-R), gender of the victim (Static and SORAG), age of the victim (SORAG and MnSOST-R), and severity of the sex offense (SORAG and MnSOST-R).</p>
<p>In developing a risk assessment tool for first-time sexual offending, there is, of course, no prior sexual offending history data to analyze. Still, several items on the Static and SORAG suggest that a lengthy nonsexual criminal history significantly increases the risk of sexual recidivism, especially if it includes violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812453911">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812453911">Quinsey et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, recent work on the development of the MnSOST-3 found that several measures of nonsexual criminal history were predictive of sexual recidivism for convicted sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe and Freske (2012)</xref> reported that the number of felony sentences, recent disorderly conduct convictions, and convictions for violations of orders for protection, stalking, or harassment significantly increased the risk of sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>In their meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812453911">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2004)</xref> remind us that the factors associated with first-time sexual offending may not necessarily be the same as those that predict repeat offending. Nevertheless, the association between nonsexual criminal history and sexual recidivism suggests that the prior criminal histories of offenders may hold clues as to which factors are predictive of first-time sexual offending. More specifically, work on the MnSOST-3 implies that disaggregating offender criminal histories by offense type as well as looking at the timing of offenses committed may be helpful in identifying predictors of first-time sexual offending. In addition, research on both sex offenders and offenders in general indicates that other potential predictors may include factors such as offender age, institutional discipline convictions, and completion of treatment programming.</p>

<title>Principles of Effective Correctional Interventions</title>
<p>Following Martinson’s conclusion in the 1970s that “nothing works” in correctional programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812453911">Martinson, 1974</xref>), a substantial amount of research has shown there are policies, programs, and practices that can be effective in lowering recidivism. This body of research, which has come to be known as the “what works” literature, forms the backbone of the evidence-based practices (EBPs) movement. Within corrections, EBP focuses primarily on implementing practices that research has shown to be effective in helping offenders desist from crime.</p>
<p>Findings from the “what works” literature suggest that interventions are most effective when they target the risk, needs, and responsivity of offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812453911">Cullen &amp; Gendreau, 2000</xref>). The risk principle holds, for example, that treatment interventions should be used primarily with higher-risk offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812453911">Lowenkamp, Latessa, &amp; Holsinger, 2006</xref>). Interventions should also target the known dynamic predictors of recidivism, which include criminogenic needs (e.g., attitudes supportive of an antisocial lifestyle, substance abuse, companions, etc.), personal distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, etc.), and social achievement (e.g., marital status, level of education, employment, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812453911">Gendreau, Little, &amp; Goggin, 1996</xref>). In contrast to static predictors (e.g., gender, race, criminal history, etc.), which cannot change, targeting the criminogenic needs of offenders is more likely to lower recidivism because these are dynamic factors in which changes can be made. In addition to risk and need, treatment interventions should take into account a number of considerations such as using well-trained staff, matching styles and modes of treatment services to the learning styles of offenders, and providing a continuity of care, which includes relapse prevention and aftercare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812453911">Dowden, Antonowicz, &amp; Andrews, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the risk principle indicates that interventions should focus on the offenders with the greatest risk of reoffending, the development and use of risk assessment tools is considered part and parcel of EBP. Commonly used risk assessment tools among correctional populations include the LSI-R, which was designed to assess risk for recidivism in general, not risk for a specific type of crime like a sex offense. Indeed, among convicted sex offenders, the LSI-R has been found to have limited predictive accuracy for sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812453911">Barnoski, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An analysis performed on the offenders examined in this study indicates the LSI-R does not fare any better in predicting first-time sexual offending. LSI-R data were available on 6,523 offenders (72% of the sample), 77 (1.2% of 6,523) of whom committed a first-time sex offense within 4 years of release from prison. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a widely used statistic to estimate the predictive accuracy of risk assessment instruments. With values that range from 0 to 1, the area under the curve (AUC) statistic is interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected recidivist has a higher score on a risk assessment instrument than a randomly selected nonrecidivist. Values at either end of the spectrum (0 or 1) reflect complete separation between recidivists and nonrecidivists, whereas a value of 0.50 indicates the prediction tool does no better than chance. An ROC curve was estimated to determine the accuracy of the LSI-R in predicting first-time sexual offending. The results showed the LSI-R had an AUC value of 0.57, which indicates it has low predictive accuracy for first-time sexual offending among Minnesota prisoners. Given the absence of risk assessment tools that can accurately predict first-time sexual offending, the development of the MnSCORE fills a gap in helping identify offenders who have a heightened risk for sexual offending.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample for this study consisted of male offenders released from Minnesota prisons between 2003 and 2006 who either did not have a prior sex offense or were not required to register as a predatory offender. Over this 4-year period, there were 9,064 non–sex offenders released from Minnesota prisons. Female offenders were excluded because none of the releasees from 2003 to 2006 were reconvicted for a first-time sex offense by the end of the follow-up period. All of the data collected by the DOC and maintained in its database, the Correctional Operations Management System (COMS), were gathered on the 9,064 offenders to identify significant predictors of first-time sexual offending. The data included information relating to demographics, prior criminal history, mental health, educational level, institutional discipline, security threat group identification, involvement in institutional programming, length of stay in prison, type of offense, type of prison admission, and whether they were released to supervision and, if so, what type of supervision (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812453911">Table 1</xref> for a description of the main predictors analyzed).</p>

<title>Measure</title>
<p>Sex offense conviction data were collected on the 9,064 offenders through the end of December 31, 2010. For the offenders in the sample released toward the end of 2006, 4 years was the maximum follow-up period. Because multiple logistic regression assumes that each offender has the same amount of time in which to reoffend, the follow-up period was limited to 4 years for all 9,064 offenders in this study.</p>
<p>Sexual offending was operationalized as a conviction for a new sex offense within 4 years of release from prison. Conviction was used as the recidivism measure because it reduces the likelihood of including false positives (i.e., cases that are not truly instances of sexual recidivism). Although rearrest is arguably a more sensitive measure of recidivism and, thus, increases the chances of identifying more true positives (i.e., actual sex reoffenses), it also increases the odds of including more false positives. In addition, information on the date(s) when the reoffense occurred was seldom available in the rearrest data but was routinely present in the conviction data. Offense date information was necessary to exclude cases of “pseudo recidivism,” as there were a handful of offenders who returned to prison for a “new” sex offense that had been committed prior to the beginning of their previous prison term, for example, an offender who was incarcerated from 2002 to 2005 was reconvicted in 2008 for an offense committed in 1998. In these instances, the reconviction was not regarded as a recidivism event.</p>
<p>Reconviction data were obtained electronically from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Consequently, a limitation with these data is that they measure only convictions that took place in the state of Minnesota. Moreover, as with any recidivism study, official criminal history data will likely underestimate the actual extent to which the offenders examined here recidivated with a first-time sex offense.</p>

<title>Multiple Logistic Regression</title>
<p>The primary goal of this study is to develop a prediction tool for first-time sexual offending that can be used not only on Minnesota inmates but also on prisoners in other correctional systems. An important criterion, then, involves the selection of a scale construction method that can produce an application suitable for widespread use. Moreover, because of the intended general use of the MnSCORE, interpretability and transparency of the scale construction method are two key considerations.</p>
<p>Consistent with these objectives, this study uses multiple logistic regression to develop the MnSCORE. Regression modeling has been widely used to develop prediction tools in the biomedical field, although recent examples can also be found within criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812453911">Brennan, Breitenbach, &amp; Dieterich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812453911">Lowenkamp &amp; Whetzel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812453911">Mossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812453911">Williams &amp; Grant, 2006</xref>). As evidenced by the recent development of the MnSOST-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>), logistic regression can be used to develop a prediction tool that is scored in Microsoft Excel, a widely used application. In addition, logistic regression offers a relatively high degree of transparency, as the prediction model is expressed in a formula that includes only the relevant variables used to calculate the predicted outcome. Furthermore, it is possible not only to discern the extent to which each variable contributes to the prediction but also to calculate the predicted recidivism probability for a specific offender. As shown later, information from the logistic regression model can be used to bracket recidivism probability estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p>

<sec id="section9-0093854812453911">
<title>Internal Validation Method</title>
<p>Three types of validity—apparent, internal, and external—are often considered important in the development of prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812453911">Harrell, Lee, &amp; Mark, 1996</xref>). Regarding the MnSCORE, apparent validity refers to its predictive accuracy on the sample used to develop it, internal validity examines the extent to which the tool’s accuracy can be reproduced on the population underlying the sample (Minnesota offenders with no prior history of sexual offending), and external validity assesses how well the tool performs on a sample of non-Minnesota offenders. Because methods such as logistic regression are designed to maximize fit, overfitting is the most serious concern involved with the creation of a prediction tool. When the prediction tool is applied to other samples, overfitting produces a reduction or “shrinkage” in predictive accuracy.</p>
<p>Apparent validity provides an overly optimistic assessment of model performance given that it examines the tool’s predictive accuracy on the development sample. Because internal validity and external validity assess a prediction tool’s accuracy on nondevelopment samples, both measures help determine the degree of optimism associated with apparent validity, which is reflected in the amount of shrinkage in predictive accuracy when the tool is applied to other samples. Although external validity provides the most stringent test of a prediction tool’s performance, data on related, yet slightly different, populations are seldom available, as is the case here. This study therefore focuses on apparent and internal validity in the development of the MnSCORE.</p>
<p>Several internal validation methods have been developed to determine the reproducibility of a prediction model. The split-population, or data splitting, method involves using a portion (e.g., one half or two thirds) of the sample to develop the prediction tool, which is then applied to the remaining portion of the sample to test the internal validity of the model. This approach, however, wastes data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812453911">Harrell et al., 1996</xref>). Although cross-validation, or k-fold validation, is more efficient than the split-population method because it involves repeated data splitting, research has shown that bootstrap resampling is the most efficient internal validation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812453911">Steyerberg, Bleeker, Moll, Grobbee, &amp; Moons, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812453911">Steyerberg et al., 2001</xref>). Developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812453911">Efron (1979)</xref>, bootstrap resampling involves pulling many smaller samples from the overall sample to generate estimates of error. In doing so, it makes full use of the data set for developing and validating models while also providing error estimates that have relatively low variability and minimal bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812453911">Harrell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812453911">Steyerberg et al., 2001</xref>). In this study, bootstrap resampling is used not only to estimate the degree of optimism in the apparent predictive accuracy of the model because of overfitting but also to help refine the selection of predictors for the MnSCORE.</p>

<title>Development of the MnSCORE: Selection of Predictors</title>
<p>Stepwise variable selection procedures are frequently used in the development of regression prediction models. Moreover, in cases like the present study where the outcome being studied is relatively new and important covariates are not known, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812453911">Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000)</xref> note that the stepwise procedure “provides a useful and effective data analysis tool” (p. 116). Although there are a variety of stepwise methods available, the two main approaches are forward selection and backward selection. Under forward selection, a variable does not enter the model unless it is statistically significant at a predetermined level (e.g., α = .05). With backward selection, a variable is removed from the model if its level of statistical significance exceeds the established alpha level. Because backward selection is generally preferable to forward selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812453911">Harrell et al., 1996</xref>), it is the approach used here.</p>
<p>Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted on the offenders in the development sample to identify significant predictors of sexual recidivism. Using an alpha of .10, more than 100 potential predictors were examined from the COMS data. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812453911">Efron and Gong (1983)</xref>, predictors were added one at a time until no further single addition achieved a significance level of .10. The main effects model showed there were 11 predictors that had a significant effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) on sexual offending (see the Main Effects model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812453911">Table 1</xref>). Among the 11 significant main effect predictors, a total of 55 two-way interaction effects were tested. Using an alpha of .05, there were two interaction effects that were statistically significant (see the Full model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812453911">Table 2</xref>). After adding the two interaction terms, however, the age at release variable was dropped because it was no longer significant at the .05 level.</p>

<p>In an effort to develop a more parsimonious prediction model, bootstrap resampling was used to refine the selection of predictors included in the MnSCORE. More specifically, only the predictors that were consistently significant in the bootstrap samples were retained. Although the bootstrap variable selection method has been discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812453911">Efron &amp; Gong, 1983</xref>), there is no widely accepted threshold for retaining or removing predictors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812453911">Zhao (1998)</xref>, for example, recommended using a 40% cutoff (i.e., predictors are retained in at least 40% of the bootstrap samples), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812453911">Cooke and colleagues (2009)</xref> used a 60% threshold, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe and Freske (2012)</xref> used a 70% requirement. In this study, a relatively high threshold (70%) was used to determine whether predictors should be included in the model.</p>
<p>After estimating 1,000 bootstrap samples from the 12-predictor model, there were 4 predictors that were statistically significant at the .05 level in less than 70% of the samples. After removing these 4 predictors (3 main effects and 1 interaction term), another 1,000 bootstrap samples were estimated. The remaining 8 predictors were statistically significant at the .05 level in at least 70% of the bootstrap samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0093854812453911" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results from the reduced 8-item model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812453911">Table 2</xref>, whereas a description of how these predictors were coded can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0093854812453911">appendix</xref>. The Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value for the model was .161, which means the model was able to explain about 16% of the variance.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that first-time sex offenders were significantly more likely to have been convicted or adjudicated delinquent for a criminal offense as a juvenile. The number of “minor” assaults (i.e., fourth and fifth degree assaults) in the 3 years preceding the most recent admission to prison also significantly increased the risk of first-time sexual offending. As evidenced, however, by the interaction between juvenile crime and minor assaults in the past three years, a recent assaultive history increased the risk only for offenders without any juvenile convictions. Offenders convicted of committing robberies, which sometimes included the use of a weapon, while they were younger than 21 had a significantly greater likelihood of sexual offending. This result is consistent with evidence presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812453911">Morash, Jeong, and Zang (2010)</xref>, where they found that a history of juvenile robbery significantly increased the chances of a prisoner sexually victimizing another inmate while incarcerated. The odds of first-time offending were also greater for those who had convictions for first-degree burglary, which involves breaking in to an occupied residence and occasionally includes the use of physical force. The results further showed that the number of convictions for providing false information to police significantly increased the odds of committing a sex offense.</p>
<p>In addition to criminal history, offenders with a history of suicidal thoughts, gestures, or attempts had a significantly elevated risk of first-time sexual offending. In their development of the Sexual Violence Risk–20, a risk assessment tool for convicted sex offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812453911">Boer, Hart, Kropp, and Webster (1997)</xref> identified suicidal or homicidal thoughts as one of 20 risk factors for sexual recidivism. Moreover, other research has found suicidal history to be associated with increased recidivism risk among arsonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812453911">DeJong, Virkkunen, &amp; Linnoila, 1992</xref>) and boot camp participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812453911">Benda, 2005</xref>). The one factor that significantly decreased the odds of first-time sexual offending was completion of a prison-based chemical dependency (CD) treatment program. This finding is consistent not only with prior research on the MnSOST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812453911">Epperson et al., 2003</xref>) but also with research on CD treatment provided within the Minnesota Department of Corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812453911">Duwe, 2010</xref>) and in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812453911">Mitchell, Wilson, &amp; MacKenzie, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the results indicate that offenders with an elevated risk for first-time sexual offending are more likely to have started their criminal careers at a relatively young age. Their criminal histories, moreover, are marked by an increased propensity for recent and/or youthful violence. The predilection for violence is further characterized by greater involvement in brazen offenses (first-degree burglaries) that often include the use of a weapon (robberies). As noted in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0093854812453911">appendix</xref>, fourth-degree assaults in Minnesota typically involve victims who are criminal justice system personnel. Combined with the finding that convictions for providing police with false information (e.g., name or date of birth) increased the risk of sexual offending, the evidence suggests this may be a population with an inordinate opposition to authority. Yet individuals with a conduct or antisocial personality disorder have been found to have a greater risk for suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812453911">Loeber, Burke, Lahey, Winters, &amp; Zera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812453911">Verona, Patrick, &amp; Joiner, 2001</xref>), which was present among the first-time sex offenders examined here. Given that suicidal tendencies are frequently accompanied by mental illness and substance abuse, the significantly higher prevalence of suicidal history implies this is a population that is also more likely to have mental and chemical health problems.</p>
<p>In reviewing the available criminal complaints and presentence investigation (PSI) reports resulting from the sex offenses committed by the 100 first-time sex offenders in this study, the evidence suggests that many of these offenders not only had lengthy histories of substance abuse or dependency but also were under the influence at the time the sex offense was committed. Indeed, of the 66 offenders for whom criminal complaints and PSI reports were available, nearly half (32) were reported to be under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the offense.</p>
<p>In light of this evidence, perhaps it is not surprising that completion of prison-based CD treatment was effective in reducing the risk of first-time sexual offending. This finding suggests the MnSCORE may be useful in helping prioritize offenders for CD treatment. As discussed later, however, there may be other interventions to consider in mitigating the risk for those who score relatively high on this instrument.</p>
<sec id="section12-0093854812453911">
<title>Assessing Predictive Accuracy</title>
<p>The accuracy of the MnSCORE was examined by assessing its predictive discrimination and calibration. With the MnSCORE, discrimination looks at how well it separates recidivists from nonrecidivists in predicting first-time sexual offending. In contrast, calibration examines the extent to which there is agreement between the predicted probabilities of first-time sexual offending and the actual rates of offending. In the ensuing sections, predictive discrimination of the MnSCORE model is examined, followed by an assessment of its calibration with actual rates of sexual offending.</p>
<sec id="section13-0093854812453911">
<title>Predictive discrimination</title>
<p>Apparent predictive discrimination for the MnSCORE was first examined by estimating ROC curves for the predicted probabilities derived from the main effects, full, and reduced models. The results showed an AUC of 0.831 for the main effects model, 0.834 for the full 12-item model, and 0.818 for the reduced 8-item model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812453911">Table 2</xref>). To determine the extent to which these ROC curves overestimate predictive discrimination because of overfitting, optimism values for each model were estimated based on the seven-step method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812453911">Efron and Tibshirani (1993)</xref>.</p>
<p>First, as shown above, AUC estimates of apparent predictive discrimination for the three models were obtained. Second, 200 bootstrap samples for each model were drawn. Third, AUC values for each bootstrap sample were estimated. Fourth, AUC values for the bootstrap models were obtained after applying them to the original sample. Fifth, optimism estimates were derived by calculating the differences in AUC values generated during the third and fourth steps. Sixth, a stable estimate of optimism for each model was obtained by averaging the values produced during the fifth step. Seventh, an optimism-corrected AUC estimate for each model was generated by subtracting the optimism average obtained during the sixth step from the apparent AUC value produced during the first step.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854812453911">Table 3</xref>, the optimism values were 0.101 for the main effects model, 0.120 for the full 12-item model, and 0.055 for the reduced 8-item model. As a result, the optimism-corrected AUC values are 0.730 for the main effects model, 0.714 for the 12-item model, and 0.763 for the reduced 8-item model. The results suggest that removing five marginally important predictors (four main effects and one interaction term) produced a more stable model. The optimism-corrected AUC value of 0.763 for the MnSCORE provides an unbiased estimate that adjusts for overfitting.</p>

<p>In their comprehensive study that assessed the predictive accuracy of the most commonly used sexual recidivism risk assessment instruments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812453911">Knight and Thornton (2007)</xref> reported an average AUC value of 0.64 for 3-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up periods. The optimism-corrected AUC value (0.763) reported here is, therefore, higher than that generally observed for convicted sex offender actuarial tools. It is important to emphasize, however, that the MnSCORE’s predictive accuracy would be, to some extent, lower when applied to non-Minnesota offenders. Indeed, the optimism-corrected AUC value of 0.763 should be regarded as an upper-level estimate as to what may be expected in external validation studies on non-Minnesota offenders. Still, in light of the moderately high optimism-corrected AUC value, the predictive discrimination of the MnSCORE would likely be, at a minimum, comparable to the better sex offender risk assessment tools even if there is a fair amount of reduction in predictive accuracy in external validation studies.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854812453911">Table 4</xref>, additional performance measures for the MnSCORE are presented. Roughly 1% of the 9,064 offenders had a MnSCORE value of 10% or higher. The top 3% had a score of 5% or higher, the top 5% had a score of 4% or higher, and the top 10% had a score of 2.1% or higher. Among the 466 offenders with a MnSCORE value of 4% or higher (the top 5%), there were 41 who were recidivists, which amounts to a reconviction rate of 8.8%. Considering the sexual recidivism rate was 1.1% for the sample, the reconviction rate for the top 5% is 8.8 times greater than the overall rate. For every true positive (i.e., recidivist) identified at the 4% cut point, there were approximately 10 false positives (nonrecidivists). Because there were a total of 100 recidivists, the 41 recidivists with MnSCORE values of 4% or higher accounted for 41% (capture rate) of the total recidivists.</p>

<p>Given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe and Freske (2012)</xref> used the same scale construction method (logistic regression) and recidivism follow-up period (4 years) to develop the MnSOST-3, comparing their results to those presented here provides a broader context in which to interpret the risk estimates from the MnSCORE. Duwe and Freske reported that 10% of their sample had a predicted sexual recidivism probability of 8% or higher. The sexual offending risk estimates for a little more than the top 1% of the offenders examined here were therefore higher than 90% of the convicted sex offenders in the MnSOST-3 sample. Thus, even though some offenders do not have a prior sexual offense conviction, which is a strong predictor of future sexual offending, their risk for committing a sex offense is still greater than that observed among the majority of convicted sex offenders. This finding helps underscore the notion that efforts to control sexual offending should not focus exclusively on those who have been convicted for a sex offense.</p>

<p>Calibration of the MnSCORE model was first assessed by estimating a Hosmer–Lemeshow test in which MnSCORE values were regressed on sexual recidivism. The test was statistically significant at the .05 level, which suggests the MnSCORE is not well calibrated with the observed rates of sexual offending in the sample. Yet because the Hosmer–Lemeshow test is sensitive to sample size, a statistically significant test does not necessarily mean the MnSCORE model is not well calibrated because of the large sample size used here.</p>
<p>Calibration was further assessed by estimating a Brier score, generating a Lowess plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093854812453911">Figure 1</xref>), and presenting data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0093854812453911">Table 6</xref> that compare average MnSCORE values and observed sex offense rates among the offenders in the sample according to 11 discrete categories of MnSCORE values. With a Brier score close to zero (0.0103) and a Spiegelhalter’s <italic>z</italic> score (0.0463) that was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .4815), the results suggest sufficient calibration between predicted and observed outcomes. Moreover, both the Lowess plot and the data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0093854812453911">Table 6</xref> indicate the MnSCORE slightly overestimates actual risk for those with scores of 10% or higher (the top 1% of the sample). On the whole, however, the data suggest the MnSCORE has a relatively high degree of calibration with the observed recidivism outcomes.</p>

<title>Reliability</title>
<p>An interrater reliability assessment was completed to determine the consistency with which the MnSCORE can be scored. Ten male offenders admitted to prison between January 1 and June 30, 2011, were randomly selected for scoring purposes. Following a 2-hour training session, 20 caseworkers at the St. Cloud correctional facility (the intake facility for male prisoners in Minnesota) each scored the 10 selected cases on the Microsoft Excel application of the MnSCORE over a 2-week period. Using a two-way random effects model, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated to determine the degree of interrater reliability among the 10 cases scored by the 20 caseworkers.</p>
<p>The results showed that the singular ICC for the 20 raters was 0.82 for consistency of ratings for the 10 cases and 0.83 for absolute agreement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0093854812453911">Table 7</xref>). The item-level data show that ratings were most consistent for completion of prison-based CD treatment. The ratings were least consistent, however, for recent fourth and fifth degree assault convictions. Overall, the findings suggest the MnSCORE has an adequate degree of reliability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a prediction tool to assess the risk of committing a first-time sex offense may be considered by some to be too much like science fiction, invoking images of Aldous Huxley’s classic <italic>Brave New World</italic> or the popular film <italic>Minority Report</italic>. The results shown here, however, suggest the MnSCORE has a moderately high degree of accuracy in predicting future sexual offending among Minnesota inmates without any prior sexual offending history. Furthermore, the instrument is, for the most part, closely calibrated with observed rates of first-time sexual offending. And because of the relatively small number of largely objective items on the MnSCORE, the results from the interrater reliability assessment indicate the tool can be scored with a sufficient degree of consistency.</p>
<p>Although these findings are promising, it is also worth noting the limitations. First, a relatively short follow-up period for recidivism was used. Because the approach used here is flexible, however, the MnSCORE model can be updated relatively easily with longer follow-up data for recidivism. Second, it is important to point out that the non–sex offenders may not truly be “non”–sex offenders insofar as some may have previously committed a sex offense but were just not been caught for it. Nevertheless, the MnSCORE may be able to detect other observable characteristics that predict sexual offending among those without prior sex offense convictions. Third, the MnSCORE was developed on a sample of prisoners. It is unclear whether and to what extent the instrument is generalizable to other offender populations such as jail inmates or probationers. Finally, it remains to be seen whether the predictive accuracy of this model is unique to Minnesota. Indeed, some of the data elements captured, particularly relating to juvenile criminal history or suicidal history, may not be widely available in other jurisdictions or correctional systems. As such, the MnSCORE may have limited value outside Minnesota.</p>
<p>Determining the extent to which the MnSCORE is generalizable to other offender populations ultimately depends on external validation studies. To facilitate the completion of such studies and use of the MnSCORE in other jurisdictions, descriptions of how the seven individual items were coded are provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0093854812453911">appendix</xref>. In addition, the MnSCORE was developed so that it can be scored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and a more detailed coding manual has been prepared. Both the coding manual and the Microsoft Excel application of the MnSCORE can be obtained from the author.</p>
<sec id="section17-0093854812453911">
<title>Implications for Correctional Practice</title>
<p>The evidence presented here suggests there are several ways in which the tool could be used to enhance correctional practice and promote greater public safety in Minnesota. Should external validation studies find the MnSCORE to have adequate levels of validity and reliability, then the implications for correctional practice discussed below would apply similarly to non-Minnesota offenders.</p>
<p>Because of the impact that completion of prison-based CD treatment had on first-time sexual offending, the most significant implication for correctional practice involves using the instrument to help better prioritize prisoners for CD treatment. In Minnesota’s prison system—and likely other states, too—the number of inmates in need of substance abuse treatment vastly exceeds the number of treatment beds available. Because it is necessary to prioritize offenders for treatment, efforts to identify those most in need of treatment often focus on recidivism risk. Indeed, Minnesota inmates given a CD treatment directive are prioritized on the basis of LSI-R score along with other factors such as MnSOST-3 score (for convicted sex offenders), chemical health diagnosis (i.e., chemically abusive or dependent), severity of offense history (i.e., bodily harm, use of a weapon, or recent assaultive history), and mental health history (i.e., major mental illness, mood disorder, developmental disability, or traumatic brain injury).</p>
<p>The MnSCORE would best be used as a trailer instrument among inmates without a prior sex offense to help better prioritize offenders for substance abuse treatment. Given the inability of current risk assessment tools to accurately predict first-time sexual offending, the MnSCORE fills a gap in helping determine the highest risk offenders in greatest need of treatment. In doing so, using the MnSCORE not only is consistent with the risk principle but also helps address a dynamic criminogenic need (substance abuse). Furthermore, using the MnSCORE to prioritize offenders for substance abuse treatment is a relatively low-cost practice that could yield significant public safety benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812453911">Cohen and Piquero (2009)</xref> have estimated, for example, that one sex offense costs society nearly $300,000. By helping offenders access scarce treatment resources who might not have otherwise had the opportunity, using the MnSCORE to assess offender risk could help maximize the benefits derived from treatment, which may include decreased incarceration and victimization costs resulting from a reduction in sexual offending.</p>
<p>Existing research has shown that substance abuse treatment is most effective when offenders receive a continuum of care by participating in both prison- and community-based treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812453911">Inciardi, Martin, &amp; Butzin, 2004</xref>). To be sure, completing prison-based CD treatment will lower the value an offender receives on the MnSCORE. Even after completing prison-based treatment, however, an offender’s sexual offending risk may still be high relative to other offenders. As a result, the MnSCORE could also be used to identify which offenders are most in need of community-based treatment at the time of release. Using the MnSCORE to help increase the extent to which high-risk offenders receive a continuum of care would also be consistent with correctional EBPs.</p>
<p>Because the MnSCORE provides risk information not currently captured by existing risk assessment tools, administering the instrument near the time of release could be useful in helping make decisions regarding parole and the appropriate level of community supervision. For example, offenders who score relatively high on the MnSCORE could be placed on a more intensive level of postrelease supervision. Furthermore, although prison visitation did not emerge as a significant predictor in the final model, it was associated with reduced sexual offending in the initial models. Research has shown that prison visitation lowers recidivism among offenders in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>), whereas evaluations of the circles of support and accountability model suggest that providing high-risk sex offenders with prosocial sources of support can significantly improve recidivism outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812453911">Wilson, Cortoni, &amp; McWhinnie, 2009</xref>). After using the MnSCORE to identify the high-risk offenders, prison staff could focus efforts to promote greater visitation among those lacking in social support.</p>
<p>Meta-analyses of sex offender treatment evaluations have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing sexual recidivism for convicted sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812453911">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812453911">Lösel &amp; Schmucker, 2005</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether the development and implementation of similar programming for offenders who score high on the MnSCORE would be effective. Most sex offender treatment programs focus heavily on the prior sexual offending history of the offender. Because of the absence of prior sexual offending history within this offender population, a traditional sex offender treatment program would not be a tenable intervention option. Moreover, developing a program specifically for offenders with a high risk of first-time sexual offending may increase the chances that these inmates would be labeled as “future sex offenders.” Given that the sex offender label carries a host of collateral consequences, including making it more difficult to find employment and housing after getting released from prison, the development of a program specifically for this population could do more harm than good.</p>

<title>Future Research on First-Time Sexual Offending</title>
<p>In addition to the implications the MnSCORE has for correctional practice, this study contributes to what we know about first-time sexual offending. The evidence suggests there may be several common predictors of first-time and repeat sexual offending. Intimacy deficits, for example, may be associated with both types of sexual offending considering that violations of orders for protection was a significant predictor in the earlier models and has been found to significantly increase the risk of sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>). Both first-time and recidivist sex offenders have been reported to have histories that are more likely to include suicidal attempts, thoughts, or gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812453911">Boer et al., 1997</xref>). Among Minnesota offenders, completion of prison-based CD treatment has been shown to be effective in lowering the risk of first-time and repeat sexual offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812453911">Duwe &amp; Freske, 2012</xref>). Future research should examine whether there are any additional connections to be found between first-time and recidivist sex offenders.</p>
<p>Future studies that examine the predictors of first-time sexual offending should also look at populations other than incarcerated offenders. Because prisoners have often committed more serious offenses and/or have lengthier criminal histories than probationers or jail inmates, the population studied here may not necessarily be representative of first-time sex offenders in general. It is currently unclear, however, the extent to which first-time sex offenders who have been imprisoned may be different from those who have not served time in prison.</p>
<p>Although sexual recidivism has captured much of the interest and concern over sexual offending, the greater prevalence of first-time sexual offending suggests it warrants more attention. Although an increase in research on first-time sexual offending may help elucidate its causes and correlates, it could also yield benefits for sex offender research in general. Indeed, increasing our understanding of what promotes first-time sexual offending may further our knowledge of sexual recidivism, which could ultimately lead to more effective prevention and control strategies that address the full spectrum of sexual offending.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<p>The following lists the seven individual items on the MnSCORE and describes how they were measured. The coding manual for the MnSCORE, which provides a more complete description of these items, can be obtained from the author.</p>
<list id="list1-0093854812453911" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Any juvenile convictions</italic>: This item measures whether an offender has been convicted, or adjudicated delinquent, for any crime, regardless of severity level (e.g., felony, gross misdemeanor, and misdemeanor) committed before the age of 18. Offenders with a juvenile offense conviction receive a value of 1 for this item, whereas offenders without a juvenile offense conviction receive a value of 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Recent minor assaults</italic>: This item measures the total number of “minor” (i.e., fourth and fifth degree) assault convictions an offender has in the 3 years preceding the most recent commitment to prison. In Minnesota, fourth-degree assaults consist mainly of assaults committed against public safety personnel (e.g., police, correctional officers, firefighters, etc.). Unlike first to third degree assaults, which tend to involve the use of a dangerous weapon and infliction of substantial or great bodily harm, fifth-degree assaults involve incidents in which the offender either commits an act to cause fear of great bodily harm or actually inflicts harm on the victim.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Robberies committed under the age of 21</italic>: This item measures the total number of convictions an offender has for robberies (simple or aggravated) that were committed when the offender was younger than 21. When the robbery offense date was available, it was used to determine whether the offender was younger than 21 at the time of the offense. However, in instances where offense date information was not available, conviction date was used to determine the offender’s age at the time of the offense.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>First-degree burglaries</italic>: This item measures the total number of convictions an offender has for first-degree burglary. In Minnesota, first-degree burglaries include offenses where the offender entered an occupied dwelling, possessed a weapon while committing the burglary, or committed an assault during the burglary.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>False information to police</italic>: This item measures the total number of convictions an offender has for providing false information to police. This type of offense typically involves offenders providing fictitious identification (e.g., name, date of birth, etc.) to police. In Minnesota, this offense is either a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Suicidal history</italic>: This item measures whether offenders have any history of suicide attempts, gestures, or thoughts. The information on suicidal history is generally provided by offender self-report at the time of intake or through other documentation such as the presentence investigation report. Offenders with a suicidal history are given a value of 1, whereas those without a history receive a value of 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Completion of prison-based chemical dependency treatment</italic>: This item measures whether offenders have completed chemical dependency treatment while in prison for the index offense. Treatment completions are not included here if they occurred during a prior prison sentence or if the offender has received a new treatment directive. Offenders who complete chemical dependency treatment while incarcerated for the index offense(s) receive a value of 1, whereas those who do not are given a value of 0.</p></list-item>
