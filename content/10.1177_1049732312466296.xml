<abstract>
<p>Based on findings from an institutional ethnography in a large mental health organization, we explore how institutional forces shape the experiences of health care workers with mental health issues. We interviewed 20 employees about their personal experiences with mental health issues and work and 12 workplace stakeholders about their interactions with workers who had mental health issues. We also reviewed organizational texts related to health, illness, and productivity. In analyzing transcripts and texts, silence emerged as a core underlying process characterizing individual and organizational responses to employees with mental health issues. Silence was an active practice that took many forms; it was pervasive, complex, and at times, paradoxical. It served many functions for workers and the organization. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for workers with mental health issues.</p>

<body>
<p>The mental health of Canadian health care workers is a growing concern. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312466296">Occupational Health and Safety Agency for Healthcare in British Columbia (2004)</xref> reported that health care workers in Canada have a higher incidence of mental health problems than any other occupational group. Mental health problems, including stress, depression, anxiety, and addictions can lead to reduced productivity within the organization in the form of sickness absence as well as sickness presence. Mental illness, for example, is associated with more lost work days than any other chronic condition, and the cost of mental health leave is, on average, double the cost of a leave for a physical illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312466296">Dewa, Chau, &amp; Dermer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to sickness absence, sickness presence is a significant concern because many health care workers continue to work despite mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312466296">McKevitt, Morgan, Dundas, &amp; Holland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466296">Rosvold &amp; Bjertness, 2001</xref>). The associated productivity costs of sickness presence are reported to be just as high, if not higher, than the costs associated with absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312466296">Lesage, Dewa, Savoie, Quirion, &amp; Frank, 2004</xref>). Working despite illness can have a negative impact on workers, their colleagues, and their patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312466296">Rabin, Feldman, &amp; Kaplan, 1999</xref>). It can also lead to poor work quality, interpersonal conflicts, and on-the-job errors and accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312466296">Attridge, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevalence and impact of mental health issues among health care workers is well documented; however, the research has several limitations. One is that the dominant perspective in the field is managerial or employer centered. Employee mental health is largely conceptualized in terms of implications for business; it is positioned as a financial and productivity issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312466296">Goetzel, Ozminkowski, Sederer, &amp; Mark, 2002</xref>). In the health care field, concerns about mental health issues relate primarily to the negative impact on the quality of the service provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312466296">Silas, 2007</xref>). Much of the previous research seems to have been aimed at creating a business case for increasing the visibility of the issues and mobilizing resources to address the problem.</p>
<p>Although these perspectives and concerns are relevant and important, we see gaps in terms of understanding how the issues emerge and are addressed in the context of work. Correspondingly little attention has been paid to the perspective of those who are actually experiencing mental health issues at work, and how these experiences are shaped by the social and organizational context within which they are embedded. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312466296">Wall (2010)</xref> argued that the business-focused managerialist approach does not foster critical reflection on underlying assumptions and power relations. She suggested that more attention be paid to the interpretive and critical aspects of the experience of health care workers. Taking the standpoint of workers can cast a different light on the issues and how they should be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312466296">Eakin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There is emerging evidence that the social dimensions of work, such as stigma, workplace demands, and social supports have a significant impact on how mental health issues are perceived and addressed in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312466296">Chenier &amp; Thorpe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312466296">Stansfield &amp; Candy, 2006</xref>). Stigma and discrimination related to mental illness is a significant issue. According to the 2002 Canadian Mental Health and Well-Being Survey, over half of the respondents with mental illness reported facing discrimination, with the workplace cited as one of the most frequent sites of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312466296">Government of Canada, 2006</xref>). There are reports of “horizontal violence” in the nursing profession, referring to negative treatment of colleagues who have an identified mental health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312466296">Joyce, Hazelton, &amp; McMillan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312466296">Ross &amp; Goldner, 2009</xref>). Workers with a mental illness are perceived to be unstable, incompetent, and lacking in credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466296">Krupa, Kirsh, Cockburn, &amp; Gewurtz, 2009</xref>). Relationship conflicts and lack of social support from supervisors and colleagues are significant predictors of mental health problems and absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312466296">Laschinger, 2007</xref>). In contrast, support from others can be a critical element of interventions that support return to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312466296">Lysaght &amp; Larmour-Trode, 2008</xref>). All of these findings speak to the importance of understanding social interactions at work.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, social interactions at work and the experiences of workers with mental health issues can be understood from multiple vantage points. In this study, we adopted a critical social theory perspective grounded in a focus on day-to-day interactions but framed by an understanding of how interactions are embedded within a broader organizational and discursive context. Much of the current research on stigma in the workplace focuses on day-to-day interactions and workers’ experiences of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312466296">Stuart, 2006</xref>). These interactions, according to principles of symbolic interactionism, involve a process of interpretation and negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312466296">Blumer, 1969</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312466296">Barnes, Buck, Williams, Webb, and Aylward (2008)</xref>, in their study of beliefs about workers with common mental health issues, described a “strain of morality” in discussions about taking time off work and negotiations about what was a legitimate work absence. Other researchers reported that workers’ perceptions of how others will interpret and respond to their mental health issues can affect whether they will disclose them and whether they seek help when they are struggling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312466296">Lysaght &amp; Larmour-Trode, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This micro-level focus on day-to-day interactions, however, tells only part of the story. We believe that it is also important to consider the broader social context within which these interactions are embedded. Organizational policies and procedures, for example, can shape the nature of the interactions. Policies related to attendance management, access to accommodation, or return to work might affect whether an employee discloses his or her difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312466296">MacDonald-Wilson, 2005</xref>), as well as the timing and duration of sick leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312466296">St-Arnaud, Saint-Jean, &amp; Damasse, 2006</xref>). The experience of employees with mental health issues might also be shaped by broader discourses regarding health, illness, and productivity. For example, societal beliefs about mental illness might be translated to assumptions of incompetence and thus discrimination against employees who are ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466296">Krupa et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the professional discourse of health care providers emphasizes the importance of projecting an image of competence, therefore subordinating personal needs in the caring process. Thus, it might be difficult to acknowledge the need to take time off and seek help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312466296">Crout, Chang, &amp; Cioffi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312466296">Harris, Cumming, &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>). These examples speak to the importance of considering the organizational (or meso-level) forces and societal (or macro-level) forces in understanding the experiences of workers within the social context of work.</p>
<p>Our focus in this article is a subcomponent of health care: mental health care workplaces. Mental health care organizations are unique in that staff might be more knowledgeable about and sensitive to the presence of mental health issues because this is the focus of their clinical work. There might, however, be unique challenges associated with workers who experience issues that are not unlike those of the clients they serve. There have been few studies specifically looking at this area of health care practice. We focused on workers in both clinical and nonclinical roles who had personally experienced mental health issues. We chose to use the term <italic>mental health issues</italic> over terms such as <italic>mental illness</italic> or <italic>mental health problems</italic> to be inclusive of varied levels of acuity and nature of the problem, including addictions. <italic>Mental health issues</italic>, as defined in the study, “The Human Face of Mental Health and Mental Illness in Canada,” referred to “alterations in thinking, mood or behavior or some combination thereof, that are associated with significant distress and impaired functioning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312466296">Government of Canada, 2006</xref>, p. 2).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The overall purpose of our study was to explore the experiences of mental health care workers with mental health issues and to account for how the social relations of work shaped their experiences. We had four main research questions: How do workers with mental health issues describe their experience? How is their experience shaped by relationships in the workplace (e.g., with colleagues, supervisors)? How do organizational structures and processes regarding health, illness, and productivity enter into and govern these day-to-day experiences? What is the impact of broader discourses regarding mental health and illness within the organization?</p>
<p>We adopted an institutional ethnography method of inquiry, an approach that explores the embodied, day-to-day experience of workers as an entry point into examining how relations of ruling organize and coordinate their experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312466296">Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312466296">Smith, 2005</xref>). This method of inquiry is effective in exploring social relations that coordinate people’s activities within institutions (Campbell). In exploring the social relations of work, we adopted a multilevel perspective, considering how the day-to-day experiences of workers were shaped by relationships in the workplace (micro level), organizational structures and processes (meso level), and broader discourses regarding health, illness, and productivity (macro level). To explore the social relations of work from these multiple levels, we interviewed frontline workers who had experienced mental health issues, as well as organizational stakeholders who interacted with ill workers. In addition, we examined organizational texts that highlighted structures and processes that might affect the experience of workers.</p>
<p>We conducted our study in a large mental health and addictions teaching hospital in Ontario, Canada. The hospital provided inpatient and outpatient services to clients as well as research and education related to mental illness and addictions. To obtain access to the organization, we initially spent 8 to 9 months negotiating support from a researcher within the organization, frontline workers, union leaders, and the executive management team. We also obtained ethics approval from the hospital and the university ethics board.</p>
<p>The primary investigator (first author) was an outsider to the workplace; therefore, we developed an advisory committee of 13 key stakeholders across the organization to facilitate navigation of organizational sensitivities in recruitment, data collection, and dissemination of research findings. The advisory committee included representatives from each of the unions, managers in both clinical and nonclinical areas of the hospital, occupational health and human resources staff, and workers with lived experience of mental health or addictions issues. We held meetings with this advisory group at the outset of the study, at the midpoint of data collection, and near the completion of data analysis. The group assisted with recruitment, provided input regarding key informants for theoretical sampling, responded to emerging themes, and made recommendations for dissemination both within and outside the organization.</p>
<p>Our initial point of entry was the experience of workers who had a current or past history of mental health issues. We did not specify particular diagnoses in the inclusion criteria because we wanted to explore workers’ interpretations of what constitutes a mental health issue. We did, however, stipulate that workers had to have been employed in the organization for a period of at least 3 months and be able to provide informed consent. Our recruitment strategies included posters, an article about the project on the staff intranet site, and word of mouth through the advisory committee members. We recruited workers with diverse experiences to trace how participants in different circumstances were drawn into a common set of organizational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312466296">DeVault &amp; McCoy, 2006</xref>). Many dimensions of difference (e.g., job tenure, illness severity) emerged naturally in the process of recruitment; however, we did some purposive sampling to specifically recruit workers who had experienced sick leave and returned to work.</p>
<p>Employee participants included 20 workers: 15 women and 5 men. They varied in terms of job tenure, role in the organization, and nature of their illness experiences. Job tenure of the employee participants varied from 5 months to 23 years (mean = 8.3 years). There were 12 clinical service providers and 8 providers who worked in nonclinical areas. Employee participants included 2 students, 14 frontline workers, and 4 managers. When asked about their illness experiences, several reported that they had multiple challenges. Most reported experiencing a mood disorder, about a third reported addiction issues, 4 reported anxiety issues, and 1 reported a thought disorder. Only 6 of the participants had taken a formal mental-health-related sick leave. Interviews with workers were 60 to 90 minutes in length. During the interviews, we explored day-to-day experiences in the workplace, including the worker’s history of mental health issues, his or her work role, and his or her perceptions of how others reacted or might react if they knew about the mental health issues. The interviewer listened for institutional processes that could be coordinating action and checked with workers about these evolving ideas.</p>
<p>The second source of data collected in our study was the perspective of organizational stakeholders who interacted on a day-to-day basis with employees with mental health issues. We included their perspectives to provide insight into the ways in which individual worker experiences were structured and shaped through organizational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312466296">Campbell &amp; Gregor, 2008</xref>). Organizational stakeholders consisted of individuals whose roles involved working with employees who had mental health issues, including managers at various levels of the organization, union leaders, occupational health providers, and human resources personnel. We identified key informants based on an initial review of organizational structures as well as recommendations by study participants. We approached potential participants directly and invited them to participate.</p>
<p>We continued to recruit participants until we had interviewed key stakeholders within the “chain of action.” According to an institutional ethnography approach, recruitment does not proceed until the point of theoretical saturation but rather proceeds until a comprehensive map can be developed regarding the social relations of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312466296">Smith, 2006</xref>). As such, workers and organizational stakeholders who were recruited at a later stage in the project were able to fill in the gaps and confirm details regarding the emerging findings. For example, we actively recruited participants who had nonclinical positions because we had been told that their perspectives and experiences might be different from those of individuals in clinical roles.</p>
<p>We interviewed 12 organizational stakeholders: 2 union representatives, 2 human resource staff, 2 occupational health providers, and 6 managers. Of the managers, 2 were in nonclinical areas and 4 were clinical managers. Ten of the organizational participants were women, and job tenure within the organization varied from 1 to 31 years. Interviews with organizational stakeholders were approximately 60 to 90 minutes in length. We asked participants to describe their experiences, including critical incidents that illustrated their individual and organizational response to workers with mental health issues, and to comment on organizational forces that affected this experience. The interviewer listened for “institutional discourses” that reflected professional training and socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312466296">Campbell &amp; Gregor, 2008</xref>), and for the ways in which experiences with workers reflected the social relations of work.</p>
<p>Our third source of information consisted of organizational texts. From an institutional ethnography perspective, texts can be an integral part of what people do and know, and are often a primary organizing force within institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312466296">Smith, 2006</xref>). We asked participants to share documents that might help us to understand individual or institutional responses to workers with mental health problems. In addition, we gathered texts within the public domain that provided an overview of the vision and mission of the organization. More than 14 different types of documents were collected, including material texts reflecting the public image of the organization (Web site, corporate brochures, annual reports), as well as internal documents such as policies and procedures that reportedly affected the experience of workers with mental health issues. We were particularly interested in texts that seemed to shape action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312466296">Smith, 2006</xref>). We noted, however, that very few participants referred explicitly to organizational texts, and many talked about the lack of documented policies or procedures to guide their actions. The absence of texts to guide action, in fact, became part of our analysis.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the interview transcripts and organizational texts was an iterative process of data collection and analysis, with one informing the other. All of the interviews were transcribed verbatim, with identifiers removed. Several members of the research team reviewed the initial interviews. The focus of our analysis was on exploring and explicating the ruling relations that organized and coordinated the local experience of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312466296">Campbell &amp; Gregor, 2008</xref>). We engaged in multiple stratified readings of the data to examine (a) the day-to-day experiences of workers, (b) how these experiences were governed by interactions with others, and (c) how experiences were governed by broader discursive and structural forces within the organization.</p>
<p>In our first layer of analysis, we examined the day-to-day “work” of employees in terms of how they talked about and responded to mental health issues. The core work of many participants appeared to involve various practices of silence; therefore, this became the primary focus of our analysis. We reviewed transcripts and texts to identify practices of silence and tipping points at which silence was broken. In the next layer of analysis, we examined how the practices of silence were embedded within the social relations of work. For example, we critically reflected on how the stories shared by participants reflected institutional and even societal discourses regarding mental health, mental illness, and productivity. Embedded within participants’ descriptions were ways in which they took up (or resisted) institutional discourses, depending on their social location within the organization. The final phase of analysis involved mapping the key pathways by which the practice of silence was produced and reproduced within the workplace.</p>
<p>We used NVivo 8 computer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312466296">Bazeley &amp; Richards, 2000</xref>) for the initial stages of coding, coupled with extensive analytic notes about emerging ideas and connections between local sites of experience and the social relations of work. Multiple layers of analysis enabled us to explore how micro- and macro-level forces shaped and were shaped by the day-to-day experiences of workers. By examining connections between local sites of experience and the overall social organization of work, we produced a conceptual map of the social relations of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312466296">Campbell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To maintain methodological rigor, we employed several data collection and analysis strategies. Throughout the study, the primary investigator (first author) maintained a reflexive journal to track the ways in which her position as a researcher affected the social production of data as well as the analysis and interpretation of the data. Her reflexive analysis, coupled with peer debriefing, enhanced the credibility of the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312466296">Murphy, Dingwall, Greatbatch, Parker, &amp; Watson, 1998</xref>). Triangulation of data sources also contributed to the depth of analysis. Because participants were recruited from a range of social locations, we were able to examine the social relations of work from a variety of standpoints. As a result, this strengthened our confidence that the study findings reflected common social processes across the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312466296">DeVault &amp; McCoy, 2006</xref>). Member-checking meetings with the organization advisory committee regarding the emerging themes provided additional support; the findings regarding the social relations of silence resonated strongly with them. We also maintained analytic rigor by examining how negative cases informed the emerging map of the social relations of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312466296">Mays &amp; Pope, 2000</xref>). We explored not only the practices of silence, but exceptions to the silence and the ways in which this reflected certain rules regarding the ways workplace mental health issues were discussed within the organization.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732312466296">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The original purpose of our study was to describe and account for the experiences of workers with mental health issues within the health care organization. A central finding that emerged early on in the study, even at the point of negotiating entry, was the silence and secrecy surrounding employees with mental health issues, and thus we made the social relations of silence the primary focus of our analysis. Silence was not simply the absence of dialogue; it appeared to be an active practice taken up by workers and workplace stakeholders across the organization. Practices of silence took many forms; they were pervasive, yet complex, and even paradoxical at times, considering the public mandate of the organization.</p>
<p>Silence was produced and reproduced not only by the actions of workers with mental health issues, but through interactions with other workplace stakeholders. In presenting the study findings, we review six key practices of silence, including (a) workers’ practices of concealment, (b) strategic disclosure by workers, (c) collective inaction among workplace stakeholders, (d) the cloak of secrecy between colleagues, (e) implicit and explicit messages to be silent, and (f) organizational gaps in communication. We follow this with reflections on the disjuncture between the internal practices of silence and the public mandate of open dialogue.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732312466296">
<title>Workers’ Practices of Concealment</title>
<p>Whether the workers were frontline staff or high-level managers, they all described strategies they implemented to manage information about their past histories or current struggles with mental health issues. For some, concealing their issues seemed to be a form of “work” that they engaged in on a daily basis. One worker stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>A part of what ended up happening, I became a perfectionist at work and I took on way more than my mind and my body probably could have handled just to cover up what was really happening with me. . . . I didn’t want anybody to see how bad, upon reflection, I was feeling or how bad—I didn’t want people to see how hard it was to cope, to manage. It was basically trying to get to work . . . the focus was to be able to survive at work. So everything else went—the house went, the kids went.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants talked about their personal investment in work; work was important and meaningful, as was their image of competence as a worker. Workers explained that even during times when they were struggling, they worked hard to conceal any impact on their work performance. Some adopted strategies such as going in to work on weekends or staying late to make up for the days on which they were less productive. One participant talked about planning days off as vacation or lieu (i.e., compensatory or “comp”) time when she felt tension building, and doing so in a way that would not only hide her problems, but limit inconvenience to other members of the team. It was as if the workers tried to maintain their image of competence at all costs.</p>
<p>Practices of concealment were related not only to current struggles, but to the participants’ respective histories of mental health issues. Several workers explained that they were careful not to reveal information about a prior mental health issue because it might jeopardize their reputation. One participant in a management position explained that she did not want to “talk about anything that’s gonna be perceived as some kind of weakness.” Another participant, who was a frontline service provider, talked about her fear that someone might find out about her history of mental health issues: “What if somebody knew? . . . I would lose my authority.” As a result, she avoided therapy situations in which she might be recognized and was careful to ensure that there were privacy restrictions on her medical records. Concealment meant working hard to disguise current or past experience with mental illness, and to project an image of competence at work.</p>

<title>Strategic Disclosure by Workers</title>
<p>Although many participants worked hard to conceal their mental health issues, there were times when the silence was intentionally broken and they disclosed to others in the workplace. Disclosure was not an all-or-nothing process; workers were selective and strategic not only about what they said, but when they said it and to whom. Disclosure practices revealed implicit rules about silence and managing one’s reputation in the workplace. One example of strategic disclosure was described as “testing the waters” by making indirect references to personal experience with mental illness and then watching for the responses of others. One worker, for example, explained, “Every once in a while I do ‘lob’ [toss out a hint or clue about] things . . . but I’ve never really come straight out about my own experience.” Another related that she would “pick and choose” what she would share based on her perception of the specific situation. The social context for sharing information seemed to be important as a testing ground to see how others would respond.</p>
<p>Workers were also strategic about the content of what they shared with others. One participant, for example, explained that she was less likely to disclose an addiction issue than a family history of mental illness or a seasonal mood disorder. She felt that her addiction issues would present a greater risk to her reputation. Another worker reported that he shared information about his past history of addiction issues but did not disclose his current struggles. Selective disclosure, therefore, involved sharing “safer” information (e.g., past rather than current experience), and might only be partial disclosure in the form of innuendo or indirect comments.</p>
<p>There were several different contexts within which strategic disclosure took place. The first relates to disclosure in the context of supporting a client. Disclosure to a client was depicted as an exceptional circumstance and not part of typical practice. Several clinicians shared examples of disclosure that did not happen right away, but rather occurred as they were conveying empathy and support to an individual who was struggling. When revealing their personal histories, they perceived this to be supportive to the client; however, they were quick to point out that disclosure of this nature was considered to be a violation of a professional code regarding therapeutic boundaries. In fact, one service provider explained that she was fired from a previous position because she had shared personal information about her use of psychiatric medication.</p>
<p>Another form of strategic disclosure took place within the context of advocacy in the workplace on behalf of individuals with mental health issues and their needs. Participants identified this type of disclosure as important, although it was associated with considerable personal risk to the workers’ reputations. One worker, for example, spoke with passion about her “stigma-busting” efforts through public disclosure of her history of mental health issues. She, like others, felt initial reluctance or trepidation to expose her personal experiences. Advocacy through public disclosure was also characterized as hard work at times, and individuals did not always feel up to the challenge. One participant, for example, lamented, “Other times I just feel too burnt out and I just let it go. It’s like I don’t want to be fighting all the time.” She felt that sometimes maintaining silence was easier than engaging in advocacy efforts.</p>
<p>A third form of disclosure was linked to the need to maintain one’s image of competence and reputation in the workplace. When work performance started to decline to the point that others would notice, disclosing struggles with mental health issues became a strategy for some workers to explain their behavior and negotiate support. One participant, for example, explained that she felt as if she was letting her colleagues down when calling in sick, and was afraid there would be complaints about her use of sick time. She chose to disclose to her manager because “[i]t would be against their whole philosophy to criticize someone who is off with mental health issues. . . . That’s why I wanted her [manager] to know that it was mental health and not me buggering off [shirking my duty] on a long weekend.” She went on to explain “[t]hat this isn’t the real me. This isn’t the normal me. This is very stressed me and eventually I’ll do a better job.”</p>
<p>Information sharing was precipitated by questions that were being raised about the worker’s ability to perform. The implications of being identified as ill seemed to be weighed against the implications of being identified as a bad employee; disclosure became a strategy of last resort to salvage one’s social identity as a good worker. Regardless of the context, when workers chose to share their personal experiences, this was managed carefully and strategically because it was outside the accepted practices of silence within the organization. It was not easy and, for many, it meant risking their reputation in the workplace.</p>

<title>Collective Inaction Among Workplace Stakeholders</title>
<p>Thus far, we have discussed strategies that workers used to conceal their mental health issues from others. There were times, however, when concealment was not effective. When issues became visible, one response of others in the workplace was to do nothing; they ignored the issues and looked the other way. Stories existed in all areas of the organization, from housekeeping and administration to frontline clinicians and high-level managers—about staff members who struggled for a long time before their issues were acknowledged or addressed by anyone in the workplace. A common thread in these stories was that issues were evident for weeks or even months, yet often escalated to a point of crisis before they were openly acknowledged and addressed.</p>
<p>One of the union representatives talked about an office employee who struggled for months with mental health issues until he was found cowering under his desk one morning. She expressed concern that his coworkers ignored his struggles. We heard a similar story about a worker with a drug problem who was ignored until his explosive outburst in the workplace demanded attention. The irony of silence surrounding mental health issues in a mental health care facility was noted by many participants. Many stories revealed that issues often had to reach “a huge breaking point” before the silence was broken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312466296">
<title>The Cloak of Secrecy Among Colleagues</title>
<p>In some cases, we heard that coworkers covered for their colleagues who were struggling. One manager dubbed this coworker silence as a “cloak of secrecy,” explaining, “People cover for one another, and they protect one another. They don’t want their friends in trouble.” According to this manager, there seemed to be a posture of protection, particularly if the employee was popular. Similarly, another manager reported, “If they are liked by the general group, they’ll cover for them. They’ll hide them, they’ll do their work, that kind of stuff.” If the employee was not well liked and appeared to be struggling, however, then this protection might not happen: “If people think that you are a whiner or a problem employee and you have even a death [in the family], someone will go, ‘Oh, you are always having a crisis!’” Another reason for coworker secrecy might be to avoid being seen as the company snitch, or as someone who wanted to “raise trouble.” Several participants hypothesized that coworkers might decide not to say anything to maintain their own reputation. One of the workers explained, “People don’t want to intrude on other people’s toes. They just want to mind their own business.” As a result, coworkers were reluctant to say something when they noticed that a colleague was ill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312466296">
<title>Implicit and Explicit Messages to Be Silent</title>
<p>In many situations, there seemed to be implicit or explicit messages to maintain silence regarding the mental health issues of employees. Several participants, for example, explained that they initiated dialogue with their managers and had their concerns dismissed. In some cases, workers initiated concerns about their own mental health; in other cases colleagues expressed concerns about the mental health of a coworker. One worker, for example, confessed to her manager about the difficulty she was having in managing her work and her fears that she was “burning out.” The response of the manager was, “There is nothing we can do.” The worker felt that her concerns were dismissed. Similarly, another worker recounted, “Anything that I have brought up [to my manager] has been pretty quickly brushed aside.” Her attempt to open a dialogue was shut down.</p>
<p>Other implicit messages to stay silent included gossip and innuendo about the unacceptability of mental health issues at work. Several participants referred to gossip within the organization about staff members with known mental health issues and how the competence of those workers was often called into question. One worker complained, “There is a grapevine [chain of gossip] here that does people a lot of damage.” Another participant who publicly disclosed her history of mental illness explained that the most dramatic and unexpected response to her disclosure was that of silence:
<disp-quote>
<p>What I wasn’t expecting was the overwhelming reaction, and that was silence. I mean, knife-cutting, no-eye-contact, scurry-out-of-the-nursing-station-as-quickly-as-possible silence. I didn’t understand why people were just visibly uncomfortable around me and had no idea what to say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although implicit, these were clearly very strong messages in terms of the unacceptability of mental health issues among employees.</p>
<p>Many participants also revealed explicit directives about the unacceptability of disclosure. One participant, for example, mentioned to a coworker one day that she was looking for help with her mental health issues and was surprised by the response she received. Instead of offering suggestions, the coworker stated, “Oh my God, don’t tell me. Don’t tell anyone.” Another worker was told that it would be “career suicide” to disclose her issues in a public forum. These messages were warnings not to disclose personal experiences of mental illness. The examples of implicit and explicit messages highlight how colleagues in the workplace were actively engaged in enforcing unwritten rules about the silence surrounding mental health issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312466296">
<title>Organizational Gaps in Communication</title>
<p>Practices of silence in some cases seemed to go beyond individual action and appeared to be embedded within institutional practices. Gaps in communication were particularly evident in relation to sick leave and return to work. Several participants reported that when a worker was on a mental-health-related sick leave, it was as if the worker had disappeared from the workplace. There was very little acknowledgement of the employee’s situation or dialogue regarding his or her whereabouts. One participant recalled a situation when a colleague was off on sick leave:
<disp-quote>
<p>Staff have been told nothing. They still have his office. There’s somebody covering his position two years later. His shoes are still in the office. His sweater is hanging up. All his personal effects are there. And people that he worked with have been told nothing. There’s this real discomfort around—like we want to send him a card. We want to know if he’s okay, but we don’t get any information.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Organizational silence extended to the return-to-work process as well. One employee talked about feeling “banished” from the workplace and then feeling “undermined” on her return to work because none of her managerial colleagues were notified of her intended return. Similarly, another worker described her return to work following a mental-health-related sick leave as extremely challenging. She explained that for weeks she had planned her return to work with her employer, yet on the day of her return, there was nowhere for her to sit. She had to wait in the hallway until someone arranged to find a desk for her. The replacement worker who had been hired temporarily to cover her work had claimed her space. “When I came back on the Monday, she had her name over my name on the door and all my pictures were off the bulletin board. And there were ones on the board of her stuff.” She felt as if she had to work to reclaim her position in the workplace.</p>
<p>A related issue that emerged repeatedly regarding sick leave and return to work was the lack of communication between stakeholders. Occupational health providers, managers, and union representatives all complained that they were left out of the communication loop, and they felt as if they were the last to be notified. Occupational health staff, for example, argued that they were supposed to be contacted when a worker was ill; however, they felt that employees and managers often acted without their input. Similarly, managers reported that they were “not privy to anything,” that they received very little information from occupational health and human resource staff about employees who were off for or returning from a mental-health-related sick leave. Union representatives also felt as if they were left out of the communication process, explaining that they got “lots of these after-the-fact calls.” Each stakeholder seemed to blame others for the lack of communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312466296">
<title>Disjuncture Between Silence and the Public Mandate of Open Dialogue</title>
<p>It is ironic to note that the pervasive practices of silence were embedded within an organization that espoused the importance of an open dialogue and advocacy regarding mental illness. The corporate brochure and annual reports, for example, profiled how the organization improved lives of those with mental illness, not only through direct treatment, but also through public education in local, national, and international arenas. Raising awareness, reducing stigma, and creating a public dialogue regarding mental illness was a central component of the organization’s fundraising campaigns. Many participants referred to their personal commitment to these organizational principles. Several managers, for example, talked about the importance of having a higher standard in the organization when it came to supporting individuals with mental health issues: “We try and practice what we are preaching.”</p>
<p>This public discourse of leadership and open dialogue stood in stark contrast to the day-to-day embodied experience of workers in the organization whose mental health issues were often surrounded by secrecy and silence. Many participants talked about the irony inherent in working in a mental health care organization that did not acknowledge mental health issues in their own staff:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s weird that there’s this discomfort around speaking openly about it. There is such an irony. It’s a mental health institution and these are supposed to be mental health professionals, and yet they have such a hard time talking about mental health when it’s us and not the clients.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Talk about mental illness and addiction issues was seen as valuable and important, but only in reference to circumscribed others, such as clients or members of the public, not among staff within the organization.</p>
<p>In summary, the study findings characterize silence, not as the absence of talk, but as an active practice taken up by workers at all levels of the organization and embedded within the practices of the organization itself. Establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and reinforcing silence regarding the mental health issues of workers appeared to be a dynamic process embedded within a complex web of social relations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Documenting day-to-day experience is the first step in an institutional ethnography approach; however, the crux of analysis is explicating the ways in which these practices are organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312466296">Smith, 2005</xref>). To account for the pervasive, multidimensional practices of silence, we adopted a multilayered perspective; one perspective focused on day-to-day social interactions, and the other considered broader social forces that shaped these interactions. The micro-, meso-, and macro-level perspectives shed light on the functions of silence for individual workers and for the overall organization.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312466296">
<title>Micro-Level Perspective: Silence and Stigma</title>
<p>One potential explanation for ubiquity of silence relates to the function that it served in preventing stigma and discrimination of workers with mental health issues. Practices of concealment adopted by workers in our study are similar in many ways to the impression-management strategies that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312466296">Goffman (1959)</xref> described in his seminal work on stigma. Impression management, according to Goffman, involves carefully managing information about a hidden disability to guard against being discredited. Even the workers’ strategies of selective and strategic disclosure parallel Goffman’s descriptions of the “innuendo, strategic ambiguity and crucial omission” strategies used to salvage one’s social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312466296">1959</xref>, p. 62).</p>
<p>The actions of workers were also similar to that which Church, in her study of disabled employees, referred to as the “choreography of concealing.” She characterized the process of concealing one’s disability as choreography in that it can be “highly elaborate, characterized by invisible micro-decisions within each transactional moment in the workplace” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312466296">2006</xref>, p. 12). From this vantage point, the worker is an active agent in practices of concealment and projecting an identity of competence in the workplace.</p>
<p>A similar interactionist perspective can be used to understand stakeholders’ practices of silence. Many explanations of stigma and discrimination in the workplace are based on a view of stigma as defined and enacted through social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312466296">Pescosolido, Martin, Lang, &amp; Olafsdottir, 2008</xref>). Differences in the stakeholders’ practices of silence noted in this study (from covering for ill workers to ignoring requests for support) can be explained by variation in the perceptions of the ill worker. Social characteristics (e.g., age, role in the organization), illness characteristics (e.g., concealability, culpability), and behaviors (e.g., visibility, severity) have all been attributed to the process of marking and labeling the worker and, ultimately, how others respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312466296">Pescosolido et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312466296">St-Arnaud et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Not unlike the findings reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312466296">Hinshaw, Cicchetti, Toth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312466296">St-Arnaud et al., 2006</xref>), coworkers in our study seemed to be supportive if the ill worker was well liked and his or her symptoms at work were considered to be a temporary reaction to a stressful experience. Coworkers covered for their ill colleagues at times and supported individual practices of concealment. Conversely, there were times when practices of silence were more punitive or dismissive. This alternative response might have been reflective of negative perceptions of the illness characteristics or behavior of the worker. Workers with mental health issues are often perceived to be incompetent and unreliable and, therefore, are likely to experience discrimination in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466296">Krupa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312466296">Stuart, 2004</xref>). Workers’ attempts to project an image of competence through practices of silence make sense in light of day-to-day interactions within the workplace and their attempts to avoid discrimination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312466296">
<title>Meso-/Macro-Level Perspective: Silence and Institutional Order</title>
<p>Accounting for practices of silence from a micro-level focus on workplace relationships tells only part of the story. We believe that day-to-day interactions in the workplace are embedded within a broader social context in which the actions of workers are shaped by meso- and macro-level forces, such as institutional and societal discourses regarding characteristics of the worker, as well as health, illness, and productivity. Day-to-day practices of silence, from an institutional ethnography perspective, are embedded within an institutional context that is outside the consciousness of individual workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312466296">Smith, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than simply making decisions about how they present to others, we hypothesize that workers’ actions are unconsciously embedded in and shaped by an institutional discourse on what it means to be a “good worker.” Within this discourse, workers are framed as healthy and competent; being ill is not socially acceptable. It might be that workers take up the discourse of competence and, in their efforts to be good workers, they ignore or conceal the signs of illness. Workplace stakeholders, like the workers, might take up the same discourse. In this process, they become involved in enforcing rules about productivity and performance, including direct and indirect messages about the unacceptability of mental health issues among employees. Employees who do not meet the standards of the “good worker” in a “perfect workplace” are marginalized or silenced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312466296">
<title>Silence and the Social Relations of Health Care</title>
<p>The functions of silence reported in this study might operate in many workplaces and are not necessarily specific to health care. The context of the mental health care environment, however, might create particular conditions for the production of silence. In fact, the smooth functioning of the organization seemed to be dependent on a distinction between healthy service providers and ill service recipients.</p>
<p>The mental health care organization in our study was socially organized in particular patterns of social relations, interactions, and authority that contributed to the business of the workplace: providing services to address the needs of patients or clients who had mental illness. Distinctions between staff and clients were reinforced in a material way by clearly demarked spaces for clients vs. staff and by outward markers of staff identities (e.g., name tags, keys). To provide quality health care and meet implicit standards of “good health care workers,” it might have been imperative for staff to appear healthy and competent.</p>
<p>This discourse of professional competence is consistent with other research regarding the professional ideology of health care service providers and their reluctance to admit illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312466296">Crout et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466296">Rosvold &amp; Bjertness, 2001</xref>). If institutional order is dependent on healthy service providers, open acknowledgment of mental health issues could disrupt the order of business and blur the boundaries between service provider and service recipient. Consequently, concealing information about a current or past history of mental health issues, ignoring signs of ill health among workers, and lack of communication between stakeholders are ways to maintain the idealized image of workers and the institutional order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312466296">
<title>Paradoxical Consequences of Silence</title>
<p>Although silence seems to serve a function in maintaining institutional order and the idealized image and reputation of workers, the practices of silence might in fact be a double-edged sword. The benefits of silence for workers, workplace stakeholders, and the organization are counterbalanced by risks to the health of workers, workplace relationships, and ultimately the reputation and quality of care provided by the organization. In some cases, silence maintains the idealized image and reputation of the workers because their struggles with mental health issues are not made public. There are risks, however, to the silence if the workers’ investment in projecting an image of competence prevents them from seeking help. Furthermore, if others ignore the issues or look the other way, there is little support for the worker who might be struggling and in need of support. Delays in seeking treatment can ultimately increase the duration of sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312466296">Brouwers, Terluin, Tiemens, &amp; Verhaak, 2009</xref>). If mental health problems remain untreated, they might escalate over time and the reputation of the worker could ultimately be at risk, particularly if the problems proceed to the point of crisis.</p>
<p>Another paradoxical consequence of silence relates to its impact on workplace relationships. In the short term, secrecy regarding workers with mental health issues might be a way of protecting confidentiality and avoiding uncomfortable discussions. Ultimately, however, social tensions might escalate over time if issues are not addressed. Ignoring “the elephant in the room” does nothing to resolve the situation, and it might, in fact, perpetuate the stigma associated with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312466296">Stuart, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A third paradox associated with silence concerns the functioning of the organization as a whole. As argued earlier, practices of silence might serve to maintain institutional order because distinctions between service providers and service recipients are not challenged, and the idealized image of the service provider is perpetuated. Ultimately, however, if the workplace environment does not support mental well-being and if workers do not get the help they need to maintain their performance at work, quality of care might deteriorate and the reputation of the organization might suffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466296">Rosvold &amp; Bjertness, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312466296">
<title>Implications of the Study Findings</title>
<p>There are several implications of the paradoxical consequences of silence for theory and practice in workplace mental health. In particular, the study findings serve to inform our understanding of disclosure and of workplace supports for individuals with a mental illness. Disclosure is an issue that is frequently discussed in relation to mental illness in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312466296">MacDonald-Wilson, 2005</xref>). Much of the literature characterizes disclosure as an “all-or-nothing” event, and the outcome of a conscious decision about whether or not to share information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312466296">Goldberg, Killeen, &amp; O’Day, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312466296">Schulze &amp; Angermeyer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of our study point toward a more nuanced picture of disclosure as a social process. Rather than viewing disclosure as something that a worker did or did not do, we have highlighted variations in practices of sharing information over time, and the strategic and selective approaches to sharing information within the social context of work. Other stakeholders in the workplace were involved, and the ways in which they received, perceived, and responded to shared information shaped the experiences and actions of workers. Impression management appears to have been an interactive, socially produced process embedded within broader institutional and societal discourses regarding what it meant to be a good worker. Furthermore, silence was not simply the antithesis of disclosure, but rather an active practice that served many functions for the individuals and organization.</p>
<p>This reconceptualization of disclosure as part of a complex social process has important implications for service providers who might be counseling workers about disclosure. Instead of simply discussing whether or not to disclose at the outset of employment, service providers might need to facilitate reflection on disclosure as a process that unfolds over time. Managing impressions in the workplace is a form of work, and how the work evolves might depend on an individual’s personal experience of symptoms, expectations of people around him or her, and the workplace culture. Instead of prescriptive advice regarding when, what, and how to disclose, service providers might need to broaden the discussion to include consideration of the practices of silence.</p>
<p>Workers might find it helpful to consider how impression management strategies not only protect from discrimination, but also how they absolve others from the need to provide support. Workers might not be aware of how they internalize expectations regarding silence, nor how others might silence their attempts to disclose. The study findings can serve to raise the consciousness of workers regarding silence and disclosure as embedded within organizational discourses. With increased awareness of these issues, workers can make informed choices regarding when and how to share their personal mental health information with others.</p>
<p>The study findings also inform how to support workers with mental health issues. Many best practice guidelines for workplace mental health emphasize the importance of an open dialogue between workplace stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312466296">Furlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312466296">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312466296">Pomaki et al., 2010</xref>). Proactive and clear communication is considered to be critical to early identification and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312466296">Couser, 2008</xref>), initiation of workplace accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312466296">Corbiere &amp; Shen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312466296">Tetrick &amp; Toney, 2002</xref>), and facilitating return to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312466296">Caveen, Dewa, &amp; Goering, 2006</xref>). Our study illuminates some of the barriers to open communication and the complex forces that produce and reproduce silence in the workplace. Although there might be benefits associated with moving beyond practices of silence, we have argued that there are also risks associated with change. There might be risks for workers in terms of stigma and discrimination, risks for colleagues related to social tensions, and risks for the organization in terms of disruption to institutional order. The interactive and structurally embedded nature of the silence practices casts doubt on suggested action points for change. Thoughtful reflection on both the positive and negative implications of sharing information in the workplace is needed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, silence surrounding mental health issues is not a new discovery, but this study is unique in the way we have analyzed silence and how it is produced and reproduced within the context of mental health care work. We have presented an anatomy of silence, exploring the different forms it might take, the ways in which it is enacted by stakeholders in the workplace, and how it is embedded within organizational practices. Silence has been characterized not as the absence of dialogue, but rather as an active practice that serves a range of functions for individuals and organizations. By describing day-to-day interactions and how they are embedded in and governed by broader social forces, we have cast light on the social relations of silence at the micro-, meso-, and macro levels, and the functions that silence serves in maintaining institutional order within a health care setting. We have argued that the silence surrounding the mental health of health care workers is complex, multidimensional, and, at times, even paradoxical. Moving beyond silence is not simply a matter of speaking out; it requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits for individuals and organizations.</p>
