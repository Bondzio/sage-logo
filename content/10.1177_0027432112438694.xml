<p><bold>EarMaster 5 School (Educational ed.)</bold> by Earmaster. Seattle, WA: Media Music Corp, 2005; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.earmaster.com">www.earmaster.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>EarMaster 5 provides ear-training practice and feedback that are comparable to teacher assistance in functional musicianship or aural skills classes. This software allows training to be continued without supervision during school hours or at home through self-guided study. Continual practice opportunity and reinforcement with accurate evaluation are important strengths of this program.</p>
<p>Students at the secondary level and beyond (high school and college), working in conjunction with theory/aural skills classes, will benefit from EarMaster 5. Teachers will be able to provide EarMaster 5 homework assignments for students to follow as topics are considered in class. Beginning students at lower grade levels can also profit by using this software, because lessons start simply and advance progressively. Professional musicians will find this software advantageous, as it provides support for many advanced chordal and interval facets.</p>
<p>There are multitudes of data input possibilities. A student can enter answers by singing, clapping, or playing an instrument into a microphone. MIDI input through an external keyboard, wind controller, or guitar is possible. There is a “MIDI transpose” feature to compensate for notes entered by transposing instruments, such as trumpet and saxophone. Inputting data on the screen, without an external device, can be accomplished by clicking multiple-choice icons or a keyboard/guitar image or by pasting notes directly onto the lines and spaces of a visual staff. QWERTY keyboard entry is also an option. Because students can input data without an external device, they can work independently through the main school computer labs or in the music suite.</p>
<p>EarMaster 5 provides the following exercise area headings: Interval Comparison, Interval Identification, Interval Singing, Chord Identification, Chord Inversions, Chord Progressions, Scale Identification, Rhythm Reading, Rhythm Imitation, Rhythm Dictation, Rhythm Correction, and Melodic Dictation. Three training modes are available:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Standard Tutor (characteristic exercises developed by the program that become progressively more difficult),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customized Exercise Mode (allowing particular intervals, chord progressions, and rhythm values to be specified by the user), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EarMaster Jazz Tutor (jazz idiom specifics for more advanced students involved with jazz study and performance).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Jazz Tutor mode allows jazz musicians to interact with advanced chord progressions and swing rhythms. As an example, if you wish to work with specific jazz chords, the content can be personalized to include such chords for aural identification. Similarly, jazz chord progressions and swing rhythms can be customized for individualized identification lessons.</p>
<p>Assessment features allow scores and profiles to be created that illustrate competence with specific elements. Appraisal statistics, demonstrating student achievement, can be exported and shared so that an assessment of deficiencies and progress can be developed.</p>
<p>EarMaster 5 can be installed on both Windows and Mac platforms. The software was set up quickly, and I had no problem with access to the icons associated with the Training Wizard. There are two versions: (1) Pro, for home use, which provides lessons for all regardless of skill level, and (2) the School edition, which includes networking support and student progress reporting features.
