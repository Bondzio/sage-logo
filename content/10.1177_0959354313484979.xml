<abstract>
<p>Some measurement theories, of which classical test theory (CTT) is a prominent example, depend on definitions rather than on real assumptions that are susceptible to empirical confirmation or disconfirmation. Thus, there is a falsifiability issue that can be, and has been, used as a criticism. I suggest that this issue be replaced with that of surprising implications. As an example, although I agree that CTT is not falsifiable, it does suggest surprising implications. Consequently, CTT is a worthy theory despite not being falsifiable. I argue, more generally, that surprising implications are more important for evaluating theories than is their falsifiability.</p>

<p>Consider some prominent measurement theories such as classical test theory (CTT) and generalizability theory (GT). It is possible to argue that theories such as these depend on “axioms” that are definitions rather than assumptions. In contrast to assumptions, definitions are neither true nor false; they are simply useful or not useful. If the logic is internally consistent, theories based on definitions (as opposed to theories based on real assumptions) cannot be demonstrated to be false. Given that measurement theories of this type are not falsifiable, does the cliché that theories are supposed to be falsifiable imply that measurement theories are not good? I will focus on CTT because it has come in for more criticism than any other measurement theory on falsifiability grounds (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354313484979">Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2011</xref>, for an accessible review).</p>
<p>CTT is a theory that describes how errors of measurement can influence observed scores. It makes use of the notion of statistical regression. To get the “flavor” of how it works, imagine that two variables are perfectly correlated, but that the <italic>measures</italic> of the two variables are subject to random measurement error. Clearly, although the variables are perfectly correlated, the correlation between their measures will be less than perfect. More generally, the introduction of random measurement error will tend to reduce the magnitude of correlations so that positive correlations become less positive and negative correlations become less negative. Put in CTT terms, because of random measurement error, the magnitude of observed correlations will tend to be less than the magnitude of “true” correlations. Based on assumptions described below, CTT allows researchers to estimate the magnitude of true correlations based on the correlations they observe in their studies.</p>
<p>CTT is based on the notion of a “true score” which is defined as the expected value of observed scores across an infinite number of test-taking occasions under the ideal condition that test-taking occasions are independent. Also, an “error score” is defined as the remainder after the true score is subtracted from the observed score. From these two definitions, it follows that true scores and error scores are uncorrelated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354313484979">Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354313484979">Zimmerman, 1975</xref>). Finally, CTT defines parallel tests as tests with the same true scores and error variances. Based on these definitions, it is possible to derive the attenuation formula that describes the extent to which measurement error decreases the magnitudes of correlations from what would be obtained in the absence of random measurement error. It is possible to add assumptions, which could be true or false, to the two main definitions described above, and thereby generate falsifiable CTT models. However, at base, CTT clearly is not falsifiable because it depends on definitions rather than on assumptions that could be true or false. Does that mean that CTT is not a good theory?</p>
<p>There are well-known problems with the notion of falsifiability as the famous philosopher Karl Popper propounded it (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313484979">1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354313484979">1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313484979">1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354313484979">1983</xref>). The most important problem is that the scientist who wishes to test a theory does not actually falsify theories directly but rather shows that the implications are incorrect. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313484979">Lakatos (1978)</xref> showed, such implications come from a combination of a theory and auxiliary assumptions. Thus, if an implication and an actual empirical finding are in contradiction, it could be that either the theory or at least one auxiliary assumption is to blame. And if it is possible to blame an auxiliary assumption, the empirical failure does not disconfirm the theory.</p>
<p>Worse yet, I have shown elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354313484979">Trafimow, 2009</xref>) that the necessity to have auxiliary assumptions implies that one cannot deem theories untestable in principle. It could be that the theory is untestable with the set of auxiliary assumptions currently under consideration but that a new set of creative auxiliary assumptions could result in a strong test. I gave several examples where theories that had been deemed to be unfalsifiable were submitted eventually to strong tests, and in some cases alleged unfalsifiable theories actually were falsified to most researchers’ satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354313484979">Trafimow, 2009</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313484979">Trafimow &amp; Rice, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At least since the famous book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313484979">Lakatos (1978</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354313484979">Duhem, 1906/1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354313484979">Quine, 1953/1980</xref>), the issue of auxiliary assumptions has been a problem for the notion of falsification. Nevertheless, there remains something compelling about the notion. Is it possible to extract out a virtue of Popper’s falsification without the well-known problems? I will argue that measurement theories in general, and CTT in particular, can help deal with this issue. Reciprocally, the philosophical implications to be explored exonerate CTT from the charge of being unfalsifiable.</p>
<p>To commence, consider that, according to Popper, the way a researcher demonstrates that a theory is falsifiable is to show that it implies that surprising findings should occur. If the surprising predictions actually occur, then the theory is corroborated (not proved). If a theory does not imply surprising findings, there is no way to perform “strong” tests of it, and the theory cannot receive strong corroboration. Following Popper, philosophers and psychologists interested in the issue have tended to assume, at least implicitly, that surprising implications imply that the theory is falsifiable.</p>
<p>Does CTT suggest surprising implications? One reason (not the only one) CTT was so dominant in the measurement area for so many years, despite the plethora of more sophisticated measurement theories that could have replaced it for at least the last half-century, is that the answer is a resounding “yes.” As I stated earlier, the correction formula comes directly from CTT. Because of random measurement error, the observed correlation between two tests underestimates the correlation between the true scores. CTT makes clear exactly the size of the effect and how to estimate the “true” or “corrected” correlation coefficient. It is now standard practice to perform the correction for attenuation and many of the statistical packages for modern measurement theories perform the CTT correction automatically. This CTT implication is so surprising that, even today, graduate students have difficulty grasping it upon the first presentation.</p>
<p>Given, then, that CTT suggests surprising implications, is it falsifiable? There are two possible conclusions. One conclusion is that surprising implications render CTT falsifiable. But recall that CTT depends not on assumptions but on definitions, and definitions are not susceptible to testing. This brings us to the remaining possible conclusion, which is that CTT is not falsifiable, just as measurement researchers have maintained for decades. But given that CTT does suggest surprising implications, we are further forced to admit that the ability to be surprising does not immediately imply falsifiability. Thus, being surprising is not a sufficient condition for falsifiability.</p>
<p>Given this, should we care about surprising implications or should we care about falsifiability? It seems to me that surprising implications go well with other desiderata of good theories. Many have argued that theories should be internally coherent, explanatory, parsimonious, and so on. Another virtue of good theories, however, is that they facilitate our deriving implications that we otherwise might not derive. The less likely we would be to derive the implications suggested by a theory, the more valuable the theory (assuming, of course, that the implications actually happen and that the theory is consistent with the other desiderata mentioned previously). A brief way to state that a theory suggests implications that would be unlikely otherwise is to state that the implications are <italic>surprising</italic>. The history of science is replete with examples of theories that were not accepted until some of their surprising implications were worked out and confirmed via experiment or observation. Thus, surprising implications are important in their own right, without the excess baggage of falsifiability. In general, researchers and philosophers can enjoy surprising implications without being saddled with the problems that auxiliary assumptions make for falsifiability. Specifically, researchers can continue to reap the benefits conferred by measurement theories, including CTT, without being discommoded by falsification issues. We can eat our philosophical cake without getting fat.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is a fanciful story by Charles Lamb (1775–1834) about how roast pig was invented in China. According to the story, a barn containing pigs burned down. The owner accidentally touched one of the pigs, burned his finger, and put it in his mouth to cool it, upon which he discovered the delights of roast pig. When the word got out, there were barn burnings everywhere so that people could enjoy this new delicacy. Of course, a sage eventually discovered that it was possible to enjoy roast pig without burning down barns. I see the present proposal as similar to the roast pig story. Thanks to philosophers such as Karl Popper, we understand how compelling it is to have theories that make surprising predictions. But in the Popperian scheme, surprising predictions were tied to falsification as roast pig was tied to barn burnings. Just as the Chinese in Lamb’s fanciful story eventually discovered that they could have the advantages of roast pig without the disadvantages of barn burnings, I propose that we can have the advantages of surprising predictions without suffering the known problems associated with falsifiability.</p>
