<abstract>
<p>Developing maternal self-efficacy offsets negative psychological consequences of premature birth, improving maternal well-being. We investigated women’s experiences in a neonatal unit (NNU) in Scotland in semistructured interviews with 19 primiparous mothers of preterm babies. We explored their experience of preterm birth and development of self-efficacy in infant feeding behaviors, identifying emergent and a priori themes. Women reported experiencing loss and biographical disruption in relation to mothering, loss of autonomy, and searching for normality after premature birth. Providing breast milk symbolized embodied contact with their baby and increased maternal confidence. They developed motivation, knowledge, and perseverance and perceived success from positive feedback, primarily from their baby and health professionals’ support and encouragement. Women actively constructed opportunities to develop ownership, control, and confidence in relation to interactions with their baby. We linked sources of self-efficacy with potential behavior change techniques to be used in practice to improve maternal confidence in the NNU.</p>

<p>Self-efficacy is a key component of behavior change and is linked with control and self-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451872">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Interventions to change health behaviors often include “developing self-efficacy” as a target, but the process for this is frequently underspecified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451872">Ashford, Edmunds, &amp; French, 2010</xref>). In this article, we describe women’s experiences of preterm birth and processes for developing self-efficacy in the particularly stressful context of a neonatal unit (NNU) following the birth of their preterm babies. We have identified emergent themes and processes using a priori themes from self-efficacy theory and generated recommendations for health professionals to help improve self-efficacy for women in the NNU context.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has the highest rate of premature birth in Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451872">Saurel-Cubizolles et al., 2004</xref>) with 7% of babies born preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation). Preterm birth can lead to poorer long-term health outcomes for the baby, including neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451872">Bhutta, Cleves, Casey, Cradock, &amp; Anand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451872">Treyvaud et al., 2010</xref>) and psychological stress, anxiety, and depression for the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451872">Singer, Salvator, Guo, Lilien, &amp; Baley, 1999</xref>). Babies born to socially disadvantaged women are more likely to be born preterm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451872">Information and Statistics Division, 1998</xref>), and such women could suffer compound loss of social, economic, and psychological coping resources in these circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451872">Hobfoll, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451872">Singer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451872">Wells, Hobfoll, &amp; Lavin, 1997</xref>). Becoming a mother is always a socially and individually transformational event, but contemporary mothering is also shaped by demanding sociocultural expectations around what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451872">Hays (1996)</xref> called “intense mothering,” where being a good mother involves heavy investment of resources. High expectations regarding transition to motherhood can lead to stress and regret when these are not met, but giving birth to a preterm baby is undoubtedly a more stressful or traumatic experience. Worries about the baby’s survival and longer-term prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451872">Hill, Aldag, Demirtas, Zinaman, &amp; Chatterton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451872">Karresen, Ronning, Ulvund, &amp; Dahl, 2006</xref>) are compounded by guilt and failure in giving birth too soon. This dissonance between expectations and the reality of mothering is particularly stressful. The context of the NNU is also difficult, with the mother often perceived as an outsider in the medical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451872">Fenwick, Barclay, &amp; Schmied, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451872">Heerman, Wilson, &amp; Wilhelm, 2005</xref>). Other stressors in the NNU are well documented and include the baby’s appearance (tiny, wizened infant, attachment to monitors, tubes) and difficulties for parents in developing relationships with their baby and staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451872">Miles, Funk, &amp; Carlson, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Although “the ability to empower parents is considered crucial” in the NNU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451872">Cleveland, 2008</xref>, p. 686), there are few empirically based guidelines as to how this might be done. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312451872">Herbst and Maree (2006)</xref> developed guidelines for NNU nursing staff based on parental feedback, but these were not theory based and not generalizable. Infant feeding, associated with nurturing, development, and growth, is key in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451872">Flacking, Ewald, Nyqvist, &amp; Starrin, 2006</xref>). Interventions to promote breastfeeding self-efficacy in mothers of term infants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451872">McQueen, Dennis, Stremler, &amp; Norman, 2011</xref>) are not directly relevant because many issues, including childbirth, hospitalization, caring for their baby, taking their baby home, and short- and long-term concerns about growth and development are more problematic for mothers of preterm babies.</p>
<p>Guidelines recommend that mothers of babies receiving specialist neonatal care should be helped to start and continue breastfeeding, including being supported to express milk. Preterm babies are unlikely to be able to feed orally until 32 to 34 weeks gestation, so enteral feeding is generally commenced via nasogastric tube, followed by breastfeeding or bottle feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451872">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2010</xref>). The mother’s own breast milk is unequivocally beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451872">American Academy of Pediatrics, 1997</xref>), and most mothers of premature babies provide expressed breast milk, but this often does not lead to breastfeeding, either because of the mother’s wishes or because milk production cannot be sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312451872">Buckley &amp; Charles, 2006</xref>). For those who do breastfeed, difficulties might add to the distress of the baby’s stay in the NNU. Maternal illness, fatigue, and psychological stress are not conducive to optimizing lactation. Intravenous nutrition and addition of breast milk fortifiers can be disempowering, exacerbating a mother’s anxiety about her own ability to feed her baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451872">Kavanaugh, Meier, Zimmerman, &amp; Mead, 1997</xref>). When the baby cannot suckle at the breast, the mother might interpret this as a rejection of her efforts to nourish her child.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence that psychological behavioral models are helpful in directing health professionals’ efforts to encourage breastfeeding, particularly those that include self-efficacy or perceived control, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451872">McMillan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451872">Swanson &amp; Power, 2005</xref>) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451872">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Self-efficacy is core to these models. In SCT, reciprocal interactions between individual physiological, affective, and cognitive states and behavioral and environmental factors are building blocks of self-efficacy, self-regulation, and control. Increasing self-efficacy in new parents improves psychological well-being with longer-term parenting benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451872">McInnes, 1998</xref>). Cross-sectional studies have shown that self-efficacy for breastfeeding full-term babies is linked with longer duration and greater satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312451872">Dennis, 2006</xref>), although problems establishing breastfeeding have been linked with lower parental self-efficacy in the NNU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312451872">Barnes &amp; Adamson-Macedo, 2004</xref>). Despite this, no intervention studies have been carried out specifically to improve maternal self-efficacy in this context. This could be because methods of developing self-efficacy have not been made explicit in research studies. There is clearly a need to understand these processes in detail for practitioners to be able to intervene successfully. Studying infant feeding behavior in new mothers offers the opportunity to examine self-efficacy processes in unfamiliar behaviors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451872">Bandura (1997)</xref> suggested self-efficacy derived from four main sources of self-related information: experiences of mastery or skill, particularly where acquired in the face of difficulty or challenge; modeling (copying others); verbal persuasion and other social influences; and physiological and affective states. Developing mastery is a primary source of self-efficacy information because it relates to control. Several factors can affect mastery, including knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and experience, and interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451872">Flacking et al., 2006</xref>). Although Bandura argued that self-efficacy is task specific, others suggested it is generalizable across behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451872">Luszczynska &amp; Schwarzer, 2005</xref>). Successful engagement in early feeding behaviors could therefore lead to developing more general maternal self-efficacy and well-being, whereas failure could lower confidence and increase psychological distress.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312451872">
<title>Study Aims</title>
<p>We explored the impact of preterm birth on maternal confidence to understand women’s experiences of infant feeding behaviors in the NNU context. We aimed to use this information to identify behavioral strategies to enhance maternal self-efficacy and empowerment in the NNU. We aimed to recruit purposively women from areas of social disadvantage because they might particularly benefit from such interventions and are generally understudied.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1049732312451872">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was a cross-sectional, qualitative study in an inner-city tertiary NNU in Scotland, located within a relatively disadvantaged community, receiving infants from across Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom according to need. The unit comprised intensive care, high dependency, and special care, with minimal facilities for parents and no rooming-in facilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312451872">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited primiparous (first-time) mothers of preterm babies in special care (gestational age less than 37 completed weeks). Participants could be any age, from younger than 16 years to older than 40 years. We excluded women with multiple births, mothers or babies with serious health problems (defined by staff), babies discharged for terminal care, mothers with significant social concerns (such as drug, alcohol addiction), or babies discharged into local authority (social) care.</p>
<p>NNU staff identified potential participants (over a period of approximately 5 months) and gave written information for the study when the infant was stable (progressed from intensive care to special care). Staff invited participants to contact the research midwife either in the unit or by telephone if they wished to take part. We carried out final selection of participants to avoid staff unwittingly selecting women with particular characteristics. We purposively sampled women of different ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. Postal codes indicating area of residence were converted to deprivation categories (referred to as “DEPCAT”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451872">McLoone, 2004</xref>), representing socioeconomic categories 1 to 7, where 1 is <italic>high</italic> (materially advantaged) and 7 is <italic>low</italic> (materially disadvantaged). We recruited 20 women (one interview was excluded because it was incomplete), including three from ethnic minority groups. These numbers are consistent with recommended sample sizes for qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451872">Brocki &amp; Weardon, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312451872">Table 1</xref> shows that 60% were from areas of high social disadvantage (DEPCAT 5, 6, or 7) and indicates their experience of tube feeding, expressing breast milk, and breastfeeding. Maternal ages ranged from 17 to 37 years and infant gestational ages from 26 to 36 weeks.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We used a semistructured interview technique, with open questions developed in discussions with a steering group, including two mothers of preterm babies, NNU staff, and researchers. We asked women about their experience in the unit and of feeding their preterm baby. We used both inductive and deductive approaches, first to identify emergent themes assessing the perceived impact of preterm birth on maternal confidence and then investigating themes using a priori categories from SCT (mastery, vicarious experience, persuasion, affect/physiology). We aimed to make recommendations for health professionals about promoting self-efficacy in this context.</p>
<p>We used a timeline interview approach to facilitate recall, starting with the childbirth experience and the baby’s admission to the unit, moving on to caring and feeding experiences, and concluding with expectations about leaving the unit. We used nontechnical and neutral nonleading language for clarity and to avoid biasing responses. We used the lay term <italic>confidence</italic> to reflect self-efficacy in our questions and open questions on the mothers’ experiences, emotions, ease or difficulty of behaviors, and interactions with baby, partner, family, other mothers, and staff. We probed the experience of different feeding behaviors. We piloted the schedule with two mothers whose babies had been in the unit in the previous year, subsequently changing some questions and shortening the interview length overall. The research midwife (appointed for the study) carried out all interviews in a NNU private area, lasting between 20 and 60 minutes. We recorded them using a digital recorder and transcribed them verbatim, with notes appended to reflect specific observations during interviews (e.g., the participant’s emotional state, or details of the baby’s progress). The researcher (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or a transcription service transcribed the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312451872">
<title>Feeding Behaviors</title>
<p>Our analysis focused on women’s experience of the three most frequently mentioned behaviors—tube feeding, expressing breast milk, and breastfeeding—representing things that women do to care for their baby in this context. Premature babies might not have fully developed the ability to suck, so full breastfeeding and/or bottle feeding might not be possible during early gestational stages. We defined breastfeeding broadly to make sure we captured a range of breastfeeding experiences and included any attempts at breastfeeding or suckling at the breast, as well as established oral breastfeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312451872">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed transcripts for themes following procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312451872">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>, which allow both deductive and inductive analysis (i.e., both top-down and bottom-up). The researcher allocated statements to codes, categories, and subcategories, classifying them into themes and patterns across participants. We first familiarized ourselves with the data, searching for themes, reviewing, defining, and naming themes for write-up. We initially carried out open coding for emergent themes across the data set, then allocated women’s confidence-related self-statements to self-efficacy components from SCT. Two researchers independently coded the data, cross-checked allocations, and discussed inconsistencies. Statements could be positive or negative and allocated to more than one category; for example, negative moods could decrease self-efficacy, whereas positive moods enhanced it. We did not count the occurrence of themes but defined them according to our judgment of links with self-efficacy or prevalence, represented in the text using conventions such as some, several, or most participants (Braun &amp; Clarke). Finally, we allocated a set of possible behavior change techniques to improve maternal self-efficacy onto the emergent and a priori themes. We prepared a draft brief summary at the end of data collection to validate results and ensure findings accurately reflected the views and experience of participants. We sent this to all participants, who were invited to comment (we received no feedback via this method). We also presented this summary to parents in a workshop in the NNU before themes were finalized. All participants were invited, and it was attended by seven women and babies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312451872">
<title>Ethical Issues and Reflexivity</title>
<p>The West of Scotland National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approved the study, and all participants gave prior written informed consent. We were aware of the potential for power imbalance, the influence of the medical context of the NNU on women’s responses, our own experience as health psychology and midwifery researchers, the sensitive nature of the topic, and women’s emotional vulnerability. We therefore emphasized the voluntary nature of the study and took care to stress our independence from the NNU to participants, to acknowledge and counter potential biases. We emphasized confidentiality, stressed the importance of participants’ views to us, and tried to ensure they could express them openly. We offered reimbursement of travel expenses and a small gift for their baby to participants at the end of the study to thank them for participating.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732312451872" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our use of a timeline approach helped to define self-efficacy development as a process related to loss and reparation, counter to women’s expectations of a normal childbirth. They described normal expectations of pregnancy, childbirth, caring for their baby, and incorporating the baby into their family and day-to-day life, and how these expectations had been challenged by their experience of premature birth. A summary of this process, including the normal process (A), emergent themes (B), and a priori self-efficacy themes (C), is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1</xref>. We also hypothesized links between emergent and a priori themes (represented by arrows).</p>

<title>Emergent Themes</title>
<p>Four emergent themes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1B</xref>) were related to women’s experiences: loss of reality; expectations of becoming a mother; being in hospital/loss of autonomy; and moving toward taking their baby home.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312451872">
<title>Loss of reality</title>
<p>Most women described biographical disruption as a result of preterm birth that happened suddenly or unexpectedly or was traumatic. Around half of the women had a caesarian section, and some awoke from their anesthetic to find their baby was not with them. They were often disorientated, experiencing pain, or too ill to go and see their baby. The postnatal ward was on a different floor in the hospital from the NNU, and women were often in rooms with women who had normal births and had their baby with them. This heightened the participants’ sense of abnormality and difference from other women: “I seemed to be the only one who was there and whose baby wasn’t . . . you had to walk past all those rooms with crying babies.” Another said, “All the women that had been in the same time as me were going home.” Several mentioned dissociation and disruption of reality related to childbirth and separation from the baby. One woman said, “It was horrible waking up the next morning and no’ [not] being pregnant and no’ having a baby to show for it either.” Another said, “It was like shellshock, I was still in shock, I think I was in denial.” Some women were offered a webcam or photographs of their baby. Although really valued by some, these did not always offset the sense of unreality because they still did not seem real. Women experienced separation as distressing and described regret and grieving for normality in pregnancy and motherhood:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt I was grieving for the pregnancy that I wanted . . . you think, “I’ll come home and I’ll be out with the pram,” but instead I’m sitting staring at him through a wee [small] plastic incubator and I’ve got to speak to him through a wee porthole, and I’m only allowed to touch him through that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense of aloneness, dissociation, and unreality in the time after premature birth was sometimes helped by the woman’s partner, who acted as a familiar and trustworthy link with the other world of the baby by communicating information. Nevertheless, this did not always offset the negative emotions women experienced related to their own lack of mothering experience, including guilt, regret, or anxiety.</p>

<title>Expectations of becoming a mother</title>
<p>Some women felt the baby was not theirs. They lacked a sense of ownership because the baby was not with them. Some felt they had not developed a bond with their baby or were not sufficiently involved in their care: “It was all a bit surreal, because although I had a baby it didn’t feel like I’d had a baby ’cause I hadn’t seen him.” Another said, “To be honest, to this day I still don’t feel like her mum [mother] here because I don’t actually have her.” Use of the word <italic>have</italic> relates to ownership, and this was a recurrent theme, particularly in relationships with staff in the NNU. Women believed they should have bonded with their baby from the moment of birth because this seemed very important for becoming a mother. However, they defined bonding by actual interactions, physical contact with the baby, and provision of care or nurture in a reciprocal, coresponsive relationship. One woman said, “He definitely recognized my voice, and when they took him off me he started to cry, and that made me feel really good.” This was directly related to maternal confidence: “He knows me now, you know, he looks about for [me] now, and I think that develops confidence, and just all the contact you have with him.”</p>
<p>Negative emotions, including fear and worry about the baby, were common to all participants. Women described being shocked, terrified, scared, upset, worried, or frightened in relation to their baby’s appearance, perceived fragility, and development and their own ability to nourish their baby. One woman said, “I was scared to touch him in case I hurt him at first . . . you know his wee [small] legs were so thin it was like your finger.” Several referred to their baby’s fragility as discouraging contact: “He was so tiny I was so scared in case I broke him.” Another said, “But now I can go in and know I’m not going to break him.” Involvement in feeding and caring for their baby was a crucial process for becoming familiar with their baby’s responses, providing reassurance and reducing anxiety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312451872">
<title>Being in hospital/loss of autonomy</title>
<p>Being in the NNU was doubly disempowering. Women lost autonomy for both their own behavior (particularly if they were unwell) and their relationship with their new baby. Several women mentioned how rules and procedures controlled contact, feeding and caring procedures, and family visiting. One said, “I was allowed to touch him but I was’nae [was not] allowed to pick him up, take him out or hold him, so I was a bit gutted [upset] about that.” Another said, “I need to ask someone before I can do anything with my baby, feed him or change him.” Staff made infant feeding decisions, making women think they were excluded or lacking in control: “Sometimes you feel like you can’t do things the way you would want to do it. Like it would be better if he was on demand feeds, like you feel you have to do what the midwives want you to do.”</p>
<p>There were exceptions. Although some women wanted to be in control of their baby’s feeding, others welcomed the fact that they could delegate responsibility for decision making to staff, and several women referred to their own perceived lack of knowledge or experience contrasting with staff expertise in caring for their baby. Some were fearful that they might make the wrong decisions, harming their baby:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of times it maybe is the staff that decide, but to be honest I’d rather that because they are the ones with the experience, eh I’m not going to come in and say “Why isn’t he getting more milk?” when I don’t know what he can cope with, so I would rather it be someone that is more knowledgeable than me to make decisions. If they think he’s not ready to go on the breast then I’d probably rather not force it too quickly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hospital rules and procedures were both symbolic and real barriers to developing normal mother–baby relationships and self-efficacy and achieving normality. Rules and regulations also prevented family members, siblings, or grandparents from touching the baby, which some women found distressing: “It’s quite upsetting because it’s like my mum’s first grandchild and she can’nae [can’t], she can’nae hold him or anything like that.” This was a barrier to integrating their baby into their family, emphasizing their difference from others and their own guilt at not being able to meet their family’s expectations: “It’s hard having to say to your mum, ‘You can’t touch her.’”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312451872">
<title>Moving toward taking their baby home</title>
<p>Going home was a step toward reestablishing normality, but women were often ambivalent about this. Nearly all women expressed positive emotions about going home, such as, “He’s moving from an incubator to a cot, it’s great, it just means it’s nearer home”; “It’s a step in the right direction, nearer the door”; and “I’m really looking forward to it, I can’t wait. Even if she’s a crybaby when she’s home, I don’t care, as long as she’s home.” However, they experienced tension between wanting to be home and in control, and a lack of confidence and worries about their ability to care for their baby without support from staff. This is illustrated by apparently contradictory statements from one woman: “I’m desperate to get her home, I’m not going to keep her here a day longer than I have to.” The same woman later said, “I’m a bit nervous because here if I need help they [staff] can help me right away, and then in my house it’s just me and my husband.” Women thought they should be confident, be expert, know their baby better than staff, and feel like the baby’s mother before they went home. This required a transfer of responsibility and autonomy from the hospital staff to the mother/parents and their own acknowledgment of their ability to fulfill the parental role:
<disp-quote>
<p>As time goes on you just want your baby home. Like in the beginning you’re just happy doing what you’re told and all that, but as time goes on you feel you know your own baby better than them, although, okay, they might be professionals and experienced but nothing can replace a mother’s and father’s kind of instinct. When we get him home we feel we can just kind of care for him the way we want to, and obviously give him a lot more love—not that we can’t give him love in here, but it’s not the same.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As well as the baby being ready to go home, the women themselves had to be ready, and this readiness was bound up with feelings of reciprocal bonds between mother and infant. One of the hospital’s conditions for taking their baby home was that they needed to be feeding successfully (i.e., no longer tube feeding, being able to suck from bottle or breast, gaining weight). This meant that establishing successful feeding was a high priority but a particular challenge for those who had intended to breastfeed. Breastfeeding and taking the baby home were sometimes competing goals, because establishing breastfeeding is difficult with preterm babies, meaning a longer stay in hospital. When they had to make this choice, women tended to be pragmatic, deciding to use bottles to feed either breast milk or formula milk rather than jeopardize going-home plans.</p>

<title>A Priori Self-Efficacy Themes</title>
<p>After identifying women’s experiences in the analysis of emergent themes, the next step was to find out how women went on to develop self-efficacy in this context. To do this we used an a priori thematic framework from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451872">Bandura (1997)</xref>, including affect/physiology, mastery, modeling, and persuasion as sources of self-efficacy. We focused on reparative actions achieved through infant feeding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1C</xref>). We suggested directional links between the two sets of themes in relation to the process of developing self-efficacy, and identified subthemes from analysis of responses to questions about feeding and developing confidence.</p>
<sec id="section16-1049732312451872">
<title>Affect/physiology</title>
<p>The impacts of both negative and positive affective and physiological experiences are important in self-efficacy theory. We identified two subthemes: creating an embodied relationship with the baby and experiencing positive and negative emotions.</p>
<sec id="section17-1049732312451872">
<title>Creating an embodied relationship with the baby</title>
<p>Several women experienced discontinuity in the embodied relationship between mother and baby following preterm birth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1C</xref>). They described how expressing breast milk enabled them to reestablish this relationship, by recognizing their own breast milk as a special or connecting substance that came from their body: “I feel really connected to her and that I’m doing something for her, not just putting something down a tube or changing a nappy, that I’m really providing for her.” This symbolized their unique maternal role in the face of disempowerment: “It was the only thing I could do for her. She’s lying in intensive care, there’s nothing you can do.” Providing breast milk allowed women to redress feelings of failure or guilt following premature birth. Women saw physical contact with their baby as essential for bonding. Some parents had experienced skin-to-skin contact with their baby, reducing the negative impact of separation. Their positive reaction highlights the importance of physically linking parent and child and establishing ownership:
<disp-quote>
<p>As soon as they gave you skin-to-skin with her I think then it was, like, “You’re mine.” The way she just cuddled in to me. It took away all the fear. It was like, “I just want to take you home now.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732312451872">
<title>Seeking positive affect and avoiding negative effect</title>
<p>Feeding was associated with both positive and negative emotions. Positive affect was an important source of reinforcement and self-validation in the self-efficacy process. Women described positive emotions such as love, pride, contentment, and pleasure when they were able to provide breast milk for their baby: “It felt great, even when I was getting a wee [small] drop,” and “It just seemed to come easy, my milk. I’m glad.” Conversely, experiencing physical pain, fatigue, and discomfort either metaphorically or physically separated mother from baby: “It [expressing milk] was quite tiring. I had just had enough. I’m so exhausted, and had to get home, so I did.” Another woman said, “I was scared about doing it [expressing milk] when they first mentioned it.” Mixed or ambivalent emotions about feeding were very common. Sometimes the initial joy of being able to produce breast milk was tempered by the realization that it was often difficult, demanding, and exhausting, requiring perseverance and resilience: “You’ve obviously the worry of, ‘Can I keep up with her?’ You know every time you phone they say, “We’re putting her [milk] up another mil [milliliter],’ and I’m thinking, ‘Oh fantastic, oh no!’”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312451872">
<title>Mastery</title>
<p>Developing mastery is the cornerstone of building self-efficacy, achieved by behavioral enactment and feedback. There were three subthemes: strength of feeding goals; seeking knowledge and skills; and practice, feedback, and experiencing success.</p>
<sec id="section20-1049732312451872">
<title>Strength of feeding goals</title>
<p>Motivation is a precondition for self-efficacy and is based on beliefs, attitudes, outcome expectancies, and behavioral goals. When these were difficult or challenging, women with greater motivation were more likely to succeed. Some women described prior breastfeeding goals and intentions: “I think it’s [breastfeeding] natural as well so I wanted to try it anyway.” Another said, “Even before she was born I had decided to breastfeed her,” and “I remember when I first came round after the operation and someone saying to me did I plan to breastfeed and I said I did.” However, others had adjusted their goals in the NNU context. Several women said they had not intended to breastfeed their baby but had reconsidered this because the baby was preterm: “The funny thing at first I was, I wasn’t going to do it. I never even thought about breastfeeding. I didn’t want to do it if he was going to be normal. Because he’s sick I just decided to do it.”</p>
<p>Women trying to establish breastfeeding described strong intrinsic motivations using words such as <italic>desperately wanting, persevering, determined, and pestering</italic> others to let them do it: “I persevered and persevered, and I was like on call every three hours expressing and thinking about him and getting his picture out and just kind of persevering with it because I really wanted to make sure that it kept going.” When women were strongly motivated to feed their baby, they described actively seeking support from staff or asking to be shown (modeled), as in this example, how to tube feed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I asked them how to do it. It was one night I came down ’cause I couldn’t sleep. So she showed me and said the next time I could just do it myself. So the next time I did and I was, like, brilliant!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others needed encouragement: “They [nurses] kept coming up and saying, ‘Do you want to do this?’ but I kind of said to them, ‘No I’d rather you did it,’ just getting me to watch what they did first because I was quite scared.” Women also deliberately sought support to enhance their own milk supply, in the form of advice (persuasion), using breast pumps more frequently, or using a picture of their baby to encourage lactation.</p>
<p>Women who were ambivalent about breastfeeding were less perseverant, being prepared to adjust their goals if things didn’t work out. Prior breastfeeding goals were subsidiary to getting their baby home. One woman said, “We’ll get home once we get him feeding, off [from] the breast or the bottle, whatever they say is the easiest.” Another had planned to breastfeed but decided to feed her baby expressed breast milk via a bottle following negative feedback from her baby:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve tried to feed her myself but she is horrified by the prospect. Every time I tried putting her to the breast the worried look came over her face and she screamed . . . you know you think, “Och [oh] well I’ll keep trying.” Yes I was a bit disappointed but then I think with everything else she’d been through as long as she’s okay she can have a bottle if that’s what she prefers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, the baby’s reaction influenced the mother’s feeding behavior. She lacked confidence to pursue breastfeeding when it was linked with her own and her baby’s perceived negative emotions. Although seemingly counterintuitive, the decision to feed breast milk from a bottle might increase confidence in this context by reducing negative affective reactions such as guilt for not breastfeeding, being more convenient (and less tiring), avoiding embarrassment because of lack of privacy for breastfeeding, or allowing others to be involved in feeding:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I put my [expressed] milk into a bottle, which she took to straight away, the nurses can bottle feed her with my milk when I’m not here, so it means that every feed she can be getting bottle fed and I don’t have the privacy issues.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312451872">
<title>Seeking knowledge and skills</title>
<p>New behaviors need to be learned. Some knowledge of how to feed babies was implicit and part of lay knowledge about good mothering. Many women mentioned they “knew” how to bottle feed a baby, or that breastfeeding was best for babies from their own prior experience. However, prior knowledge was insufficient in this context because they needed to learn specific additional behaviors (tube feeding, expressing breast milk or breastfeeding) and also specific information about the care of a preterm baby. This meant women had to become familiar with medical terms, interpreting hospital charts, and the mechanics of tube feeding and knowing how much milk their baby required. All those who expressed milk knew in detail how many “mils” (milliliters) they produced and how much their baby needed, becoming experts in their own mother–baby feeding relationship. Knowing their baby better than staff was a stage in developing ownership or autonomy in the hospital context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1B</xref>), achieved by deliberately seeking out opportunities for interactions with their baby.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732312451872">
<title>Practice, feedback, and success</title>
<p>Repeating novel or difficult tasks is important for self-efficacy. Frequent expressing of breast milk is particularly important to establish and maintain milk supply. Women experienced clear feedback for their efforts in terms of the amount of milk produced, which was measured before it was stored or given to their baby. This was confidence building when milk supply was perceived as good and the reverse when it was not so good. Success was, therefore, subjective and variable, as their baby’s demands and their own supply fluctuated over time. Some women could produce a lot of milk, which was a source of positive emotions, including pride and pleasure: “I’m putting milk up all the time now.” Another said, “I had done really, really well.” A third said: “I felt quite good actually. It made me feel not so guilty.” One woman “felt great” producing a very small amount of milk:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt great even when I was getting a wee drop at first . . . any wee drops that I managed to get would benefit him . . . even when I was getting like one mil [milliliter] I thought, “That’s really great, it’s one mil that he’s getting.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others were easily discouraged if they could not keep up with their baby’s needs, or found their milk supply diminished for no apparent reason. Women were particularly sensitive to feedback from staff in this context, so that negative comments could destroy confidence and directly affect the quantity of milk produced:
<disp-quote>
<p>I kind of overheard her [staff member] saying to one of the midwives, “She brought in some milk but there’s no [not] much there.” I had felt as if I had done great with that amount that I had brought in, so I think from the next morning nothing came, nothing at all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although perceived as initially difficult and unpleasant for their baby, most women who tried tube feeding could do it. Women talked with confidence about “doing it myself,” “not needing help,” and it feeling “natural.” There was a sense of pride in being able to master this technical skill, normally carried out by expert nurses. Success in feeding was linked to becoming a mother and transfer of control from staff to mother, and signaled that their baby was closer to going home, all themes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732312451872">
<title>Modeling and persuasion</title>
<p>Self-efficacy is also developed by modeling others’ behavior. In this context, women obtained vicarious experience from staff demonstrations of tube feeding, showing women how to express breast milk, and supporting and encouraging involvement.</p>
<sec id="section24-1049732312451872">
<title>Seeking role models</title>
<p>Few women successfully breastfeed in the NNU context, so there were few successful role models for this behavior. Prior vicarious experience of breastfeeding was sometimes mentioned, although when this was negative it might have discouraged attempts to breastfeed: “I had a few friends in the past who had tried to [breastfeed] but had real difficulty and weren’t able to, and felt really guilty afterwards.” Others’ experience was not always relevant because preterm babies are generally not able to suckle at the breast until after 34 weeks gestation, making breastfeeding and maintaining milk supply particularly difficult. Comparisons with normal gestation babies and mothers might therefore have been counterproductive, leading to feelings of difference or inadequacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732312451872">
<title>Seeking relationships with staff</title>
<p>Receiving emotional and instrumental support from health professionals was an important conduit for developing self-efficacy, improving autonomy and control in hospital (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1B</xref>). Some staff persuaded women to continue breastfeeding when they were considering stopping: “They have asked a few times, ‘Is this the decision [to bottle feed], have you finally decided, do you want to try it [breastfeeding] again?’” This encouragement could be very important if women were ambivalent about breastfeeding, although it might have made others feel guilty for not breastfeeding. Women actively sought support from staff perceived as expert and powerful in caring for their baby. Some women described how they deliberately moderated their behavior, recognizing the importance of developing positive relationships with staff and their gatekeeping role: “You’ve got to be careful what you say,” and “I don’t want them to feel as if I’m taking over. . . . I feel you’ve got to give them their place as well.”</p>
<p>One woman said, “I think developing confidence is all about developing a relationship with the midwives . . . confidence in the way I handle it all came from support from them and watching, listening, you know and learning how to do things.” Nevertheless, inconsistent advice was confusing and reduced self-efficacy:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s difficult because the midwives change all the time and then one of the midwives might say something and you’re thinking, “Oh that’s great,” you know, but then the next one comes on and they have a different way of doing things. Then one of the doctors comes on and puts him on alternative feeds, but then one of the midwives might change that, and I just feel you’re not in control.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732312451872">
<title>Partner and family support</title>
<p>Several women mentioned gaining reassurance or support from their partner, who was often the main link between the hospital team if she was unwell or could not care for her baby. When their partner helped with tube feeding, this could increase knowledge and self-efficacy via his behavioral modeling: “The good thing was that [partner] was there as well at the time so he knows as well now what it looks like when he’s feeding properly.” It was more difficult to gain practical support from the wider family. Several women felt their own family was excluded from getting to know their baby or from the baby’s care while they were in hospital, and this was linked with negative emotions and reduced self-efficacy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451872">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Feedback From Workshops With Participants and Unit Staff</title>
<p>We presented feedback describing the study themes to 7 participants whose babies were discharged from the NNU before the final write-up, giving us the opportunity to ask if this reflected their experience. These women highlighted feeling distress associated with separation from their baby in the unit and discomfort related to tube feeding and their baby’s response to this. Several mentioned guilt around perceived pressure to bond with their baby immediately after birth and being unable to express enough breast milk. Inconsistent advice from staff about tube feeding and breastfeeding was a barrier to developing confidence because it engendered uncertainty. In addition, positive emotions around mastery of feeding skills and feedback from staff on baby’s growth and progress were seen as confidence enhancing.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section29-1049732312451872" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using both bottom-up (emergent themes) and top-down (a priori) analysis, we showed how developing self-efficacy via feeding behaviors helped women to begin recovery from their experience of loss and develop maternal confidence following preterm birth. Women described how their initial experiences of loss around preterm birth led them to seek out opportunities for positive affective, mastery, and modeling/persuasive contacts with their baby and with NNU staff as a means to building self-efficacy.</p>
<p>The themes of loss and reparation relate to biographical disruption. This theory was originally developed to understand responses to illness or trauma, explaining how people made sense of experiences when a disrupted self-concept shifted from normal to abnormal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451872">Bury, 1982</xref>). The participants’ expectancies of normal parenting were shattered by the event of a premature birth. They wished to normalize their relationship with their baby by taking them home and becoming a family. We focused on behaviors and strategies, what participants did, rather than cognitive efforts at normalization. Critiques of biographical disruption theory suggested that disruption and uncertainty are not necessarily abnormal events but an inherent part of modern people’s lives, and particularly so for disadvantaged women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451872">Williams, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, we found the concept of disruption helpful in understanding loss and reparation in women’s responses to preterm birth.</p>
<p>We identified four emergent themes that revealed how women experienced disruption in the normal process of becoming a mother and becoming a family. The initial response to trauma or loss is often a sensation of hopelessness or loss of control. Although previous studies with parents of preterm babies identified similar themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451872">Cleveland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451872">Flacking et al., 2006</xref>), few explicitly related this to the process of recovery. We focused on self-efficacy to explain this process because it was theoretically well evidenced and clearly linked with promoting health behaviors such as breastfeeding in the literature. We also aimed to offer pointers for health practitioners to improve confidence in mothers of preterm babies, particularly those who are socially disadvantaged, because there could be particular long-term health benefits for both mother and baby in these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451872">Brunner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451872">Hobfoll, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451872">McMillan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Becoming a mother and becoming a family were stated goals for nearly all participants. Loss of reality and separation from their baby, lacking ownership of their baby, the rule-governed hospital environment, and fears about transition to home all militated against developing maternal self-concept. Women used their embodied relationship with their baby, developed by skin-to-skin contact, touching and cuddling, and primarily by feeding their own breast milk, to develop maternal bonds and ownership. It was easy to see why this engendered self-efficacy when things went well and women had a plentiful milk supply but led to guilt and feelings of inadequacy when it was problematic. Providing milk symbolized continuation of the unique biological link between mother and baby, started in pregnancy. When successful, women could publicly attribute their baby’s thriving and growth to their own agency. Establishing and maintaining milk supply was therefore potentially rewarding but challenging, especially when women did not understand why their supply was poor or variable. Lacking clear information about promoting lactation, including the relationship between emotional factors and milk supply, participants might have interpreted difficulties as reflecting their own deficiencies, in keeping with negative maternal self-schemas already activated by giving birth prematurely. Preexisting negative beliefs (e.g., about the difficulty or painfulness of breastfeeding, or discomfort related to the infant’s nasogastric tube) could also have discouraged women from attempting these behaviors, or reduced engagement or persistence needed to develop mastery of difficult behaviors. Early success in this context could be very important for establishing bonds between mother and baby, related to better long-term physical and psychological health for both.</p>
<p>One of our aims was to apply what we already know about enhancing self-efficacy to improve it in this difficult context. The identified points for practice could be used as part of a theoretically based RCT to promote maternal self-efficacy in the NNU. They represent examples from evidence-based taxonomies of behavior change techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312451872">Abraham &amp; Michie, 2008</xref>). Using this evidenced and structured approach let us identify and quantify the impact of specific techniques on women with different characteristics, including those from areas of social disadvantage, an advance on current interventions that are not always theoretically derived.</p>
<p>Negative affective and physiological experiences are bound up with reducing confidence and maternal well-being. Somatic indicators, such as fatigue, soreness, and pain, had a negative impact on self-efficacy for physical behaviors such as expressing breast milk. Autonomic arousal linked with stress or anxiety, and experience of preterm birth could exacerbate physical symptoms, leading to more negative affective states. High arousal related to stress or anxiety in the NNU is a barrier to successful infant feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451872">Franck, Cox, Allen, &amp; Winter, 2005</xref>). Several women in our study described negative moods such as hopelessness or discouragement in relation to feeding confidence. Because there is a negative relationship between stress and successful lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312451872">Lau, 2001</xref>), there is a clear need to develop effective stress management strategies in the NNU. Facilitating positive affective experiences, for example by supporting expressing of breast milk by providing private and comfortable environments, is also particularly important.</p>
<p>The participants achieved mastery of novel health behaviors by learning new skills, practice, repetition, and perseverance, but they also showed pragmatism in being prepared to adjust prior feeding goals in pursuit of an overarching goal to take their baby home and be a family. Their main sources of reference were NNU staff and their own partners. Staff’s modeling and explaining of feeding behaviors enhanced confidence when instructions were clear, repeated, nonjudgmental, and correctly pitched. Women valued this input, particularly in early stages of performing new feeding behaviors, and reacted positively to feedback about their own skills or abilities (e.g., in relation to quantity of milk production) or their baby’s growth and development. Conversely, they were very sensitive to negative comments and mindful of the power imbalance between themselves and health professionals in relation to ownership of their baby. Promoting psychosocial skills in staff might also help to enhance maternal confidence given the links between stress and preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451872">Brunner, 1997</xref>). We have suggested pointers for intervention to indicate how staff could fruitfully intervene, including working with the mother’s partner and family, ensuring women understand how best to establish and maintain their milk supply, giving consistent information, and offering praise and reinforcement for early attempts at infant feeding behaviors.</p>
<p>Modeling is more effective when the attributes of the model are similar, and when the model exhibits a high degree of behavioral competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451872">Bandura, 1997</xref>). In the NNU, there were very few peer role models of successful breastfeeding (with similar attributes). Staff models, although dissimilar in terms of attributes, were rated very highly regarding competence, ensuring women were motivated to enact the modeled behavior. It is incumbent on staff to relinquish their own expert role appropriately and acknowledge the role of the mother. Some mothers noted the sensitivity and skill displayed by staff in accurately judging when they were ready to take over behaviors (e.g., tube feeding, bottle feeding) and using verbal encouragement. Accurately judging readiness avoided challenging women whose self-efficacy was low and prevented their subsequent experience of failure. We noted that for some women, interactions with staff had a negative impact on self-efficacy. Staff behavior was unhelpful when it was inconsistent, or prevented women from normalizing their relationship with their baby, either explicitly by failing to involve them in decision making or implicitly by enforcing hospital rules about contact with other family members (such as grandparents), which prevented the baby from being seen as part of the family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451872">Flacking et al. (2006)</xref> noted that some women with lower socioeconomic status had difficulty expressing to staff their wishes about being separated from their baby and withdrew from interactions as a way of coping with this. This was not evident in our research, although the context was different, because women were involved in infant feeding. Nevertheless, some women described moderating their behavior to fit in with the staff’s wishes. They were careful not to upset those seen as key links or gatekeepers for access to their baby.</p>
<p>Using qualitative methods provided us with rich data but did not allow us to identify predisposing factors (such as personality) that affect self-efficacy or influence experiences in the NNU and interactions with their infant and unit staff. We were interested in the process of adjustment to preterm birth, and it would have been more methodologically sound, albeit practically difficult, to collect data at different time points, including after discharge from hospital. In addition, as health service researchers with a background in self-efficacy theory and midwifery, we might have found what we expected to find in the participants and missed alternative explanations. We attempted to address this by focusing on emergent as well as a priori themes, but this is a study limitation, as is our focus on only one NNU with rather limited facilities for parents. We deliberately included primiparous mothers of singleton babies to study novel behaviors, but it would be informative to study women with different characteristics (parity, multiple births) to measure the impact of self-efficacy, social support, and mental well-being (happiness, stress, anxiety) on a range of maternal behaviors.</p>
