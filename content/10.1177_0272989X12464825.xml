<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>. Shared decision making (SDM) and patient self-management support are key components of US and UK policy for chronic disease management, whereby SDM is seen as enhancing physician-patient negotiation around self-management. The WISE trial is implementing training in self-management support for primary care physicians in one UK region. This article describes preintervention levels of patient-reported SDM and explores how this varies with patient and practice characteristics. <bold>Methods</bold>. We analyzed baseline data from a cluster randomized controlled trial for 2965 patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from 29 family practices. Patient-level measures included self-report of chronic conditions, SDM (Health Care Climate Questionnaire [HCCQ]), health status, and demographic characteristics. Area and practice characteristics included chronic disease workload and socioeconomic deprivation. <bold>Results</bold>. The mean SDM score was 75 (out of 100), but the range was wide. The mean score was lower for IBS patients but did not vary with other disease conditions. Younger patients and those with poorer health status reported lower degrees of SDM. No associations were found with practice characteristics. <bold>Limitations</bold>. The study was restricted to one socioeconomically deprived region, and hence results may not be nationally representative of the United Kingdom. Ceiling effects on SDM scores may limit the utility of the HCCQ. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. Lower ratings from some patient groups may reflect differences in expectations rather than differences in physician behavior. Overall levels of SDM were high, and no patient or practice characteristic represented a serious barrier to SDM. However, we cannot say to what extent SDM in this chronic population addressed self-management issues rather than clinical care. More nuanced measures of SDM are required that distinguish between different forms of care.</p>

<body>
<p>Delivery of care to people with chronic conditions is increasingly organized around principles such as those embedded in the chronic care model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12464825">1</xref></sup> This model sees quality improvement as requiring action on multiple fronts, including the redesign of health systems, better decision support and enhanced clinical information systems for practitioners, and increased support for patient self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12464825">1</xref></sup> Primary care is seen as central in this model, with care for chronic conditions involving patients and primary care physicians actively engaging in negotiations about care through a process of shared decision making (SDM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12464825">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>SDM involves facilitating the patient to take greater control in the consultation and the management of his or her condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12464825">3</xref></sup> SDM overlaps considerably with related concepts of patient activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12464825">4</xref></sup> and autonomy support<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12464825">5</xref></sup> and can also be viewed as a component of the broader concept of patient centeredness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12464825">6</xref></sup> SDM is theorized to facilitate joint definition of problems, treatment goals, and methods of management between the physician and patient and so bring improvements in condition management, which should in turn lead to improved patient outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12464825">3</xref></sup> although the evidence for an association with biomedical outcomes is mixed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12464825">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12464825">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>For patients with chronic conditions—the groups with which this article is concerned—by the same token, SDM is expected to result in improved self-management (using the term in a broad sense; that is, not only medicines management but also factors such as diet, exercise, self-monitoring, and participation in self-management education courses).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12464825">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12464825">10</xref></sup> Studies in populations of patients with obesity, diabetes, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis have found SDM to be significantly associated with better self-management outcomes, including improved adherence to treatment plans, diet, and increased exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12464825">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12464825">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12464825">14</xref></sup> However, the actual causal mechanisms for these results remain unclear. Hypothesized mechanisms through which SDM can affect self-management include better patient understanding of his or her condition and treatments along with greater self-efficacy (self-confidence in the ability to self-manage), increased motivation, and a better fit between treatment and the patient’s personal lifestyle and health-related goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12464825">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, SDM features in key elements of the recent federal health care reform legislation, and several states have passed or are planning legislation that includes SDM as a key component of health care provision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12464825">15</xref></sup> The patient-centered medical home model, increasingly promoted as the way forward for primary care in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12464825">16</xref></sup> has been strongly influenced by the chronic care model, including an emphasis on patient-centered care and SDM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12464825">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12464825">18</xref></sup> Likewise, the United Kingdom government envisages a “cultural shift” toward greater patient involvement in their own care with professionals providing a supportive, advisory, and educational role in many situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12464825">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Targeting and increasing health professional support for SDM requires an understanding of current levels and patterns of provision. However, despite the bulk of chronic condition care in the United Kingdom being delivered by family physicians, there have been no studies of SDM in UK primary care. This article explores characteristics of patients and family practices that are associated with patient experiences of SDM in the United Kingdom.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12464825" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article uses data collected at baseline from an ongoing cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of professional training in self-management support in primary care, based on the whole systems informing self-management engagement (WISE) model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12464825">20</xref></sup> Practices randomized to the intervention arm received self-management support training in year 1; control arm practices received training 12 months later. Descriptions of the training programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12464825">21</xref></sup> and the trial protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12464825">22</xref></sup> are available.</p>
<p>Family practices in the United Kingdom are grouped into health management organizations called primary care trusts (PCTs) that deliver primary care services to all residents within a given geographical region. We aimed to recruit all practices within an area served by a single PCT. However, to maintain RCT power, we later added a small “top-up” sample of practices from an adjoining PCT. The PCTs were selected because they cover areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. To maintain focus on a single regional population, this analysis uses only those practices within the first PCT.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272989X12464825">
<title>Patient Recruitment</title>
<p>The WISE model is a generic intervention designed to benefit all patients with a chronic condition, but this trial focused on patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These conditions were chosen on theoretical, policy, and practical criteria. Each condition is amenable to self-management interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12464825">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12464825">25</xref></sup> and possesses an evidence base that allows comparison of the effects of the WISE “whole-systems” model with alternatives (eg individual patient education and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme). The conditions also have important differences: IBS is a more “contested” condition with greater disagreement about diagnosis and appropriate management; both diabetes and COPD are incentivized in the United Kingdom under the Quality and Outcomes Framework,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12464825">26</xref></sup> whereas IBS is not.</p>
<p>Baseline data were collected prior to practice randomization and WISE self-management support training. At each practice, all patients with each condition (up to a maximum of 200) were sent an invitation letter and baseline questionnaire, with a repeat mailing to nonresponders after 2 weeks. Patients with COPD or diabetes were identified from the practice disease registers. Registers do not exist for IBS, and therefore these patients were identified through relevant diagnostic codes in their computerized primary care record. Physicians were asked to verify that each patient met trial inclusion criteria and, for patients with more than one target condition, to identify their main condition.</p>
<p>All patients who returned a (at least partially) completed questionnaire were included in the baseline sample. Wherever possible, missing data values were collected from patients by telephone follow-up. For the purposes of the present analysis, to maximize statistical power, we have combined the intervention and control groups.</p>

<title>Dependent variable—shared decision making</title>
<p>SDM was measured using the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ). Based on self-determination theory, the HCCQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464825">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12464825">13</xref></sup> was developed to assess patients’ experiences of the degree to which their health professional is “autonomy supportive” as opposed to “controlling” when providing health care. The full HCCQ scale consists of 15 items, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12464825">Table 1</xref>. Each item is scored on a 7-point scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. An overall score is calculated as the mean of the items expressed out of 100, where a higher score indicates greater support for autonomy.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272989X12464825">
<title>Self-Reported Chronic Conditions</title>
<p>Patients were identified as having diabetes, COPD, or IBS by their practice but were also asked to self-report, from a list, all their chronic conditions (diabetes; breathing problems/COPD; IBS or abdominal problems; arthritis or painful joints, back trouble, or osteoporosis; heart problems or high blood pressure; chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), or fibromyalgia; anxiety, depression, or stress; multiple sclerosis; or “other”). We also derived a variable relating to the number of conditions reported by each patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X12464825">
<title>Health Status</title>
<p>Health-related quality of life was measured using the EQ5D (EuroQol Group), which assesses 5 dimensions of health (personal care, mobility, anxiety/depression, usual activities, and pain/discomfort) and provides a utility value based on a population tariff, where zero equates to dead and 1 equates to full health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12464825">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>We measured general health using the Medical Outcomes Study instrument, which assesses self-rated health on a 5-point scale, from poor to excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12464825">30</xref></sup></p>

Patients also reported consultations with their physician over the past 6 months.

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We based our analysis on patient self-reported conditions, to allow for patients reporting additional conditions to the one they were identified on through their practice. Since patients could self-report multiple conditions—including conditions other than our index diseases of diabetes, COPD, and IBS—we treated each condition as a separate variable in analysis. To check that patients identified by their practice and those self-reporting our index conditions scored similarly on the HCCQ, we conducted preliminary tests (comparison of means, using a regression model with clustering of patients within practices) for a systematic difference between groups: the test was nonsignificant for all 3 conditions (diabetes, <italic>P</italic> = 0.92; COPD, <italic>P</italic> = 0.12; IBS, <italic>P</italic> = 0.73).</p>
<p>Multilevel (patients within practices) multivariate regression, undertaken using the Stata Xtmixed command (StataCorp LP, College Stattion, TX), was used to investigate relationships between SDM and patient and practice characteristics. First, a series of univariate analyses examined the relationship between each independent variable and SDM scores. Next, variables found to have a univariate relationship with SDM at α = 10% or less (to avoid premature exclusion) were entered together in the multilevel multivariate regression (variance inflation factors for all included variables were below a conservative threshold of 4.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12464825">32</xref></sup> and variables significant at α = 5% at this step retained in a final model.</p>
<p>In view of the restricted number of practices, practice intercepts were specified as random effects in the model but regression coefficients as fixed effects. SDM scores had a highly skewed distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12464825">Figure 1</xref>), and therefore we repeated the analysis using the nonparametric bootstrap method (1000 bootstrap replications) with significance based on the 95% percentile confidence interval. Because a high percentage of patients scored at the maximum on SDM (see below), we also repeated the analysis (under a logit model) using SDM scores dichotomized as maximum versus below maximum.</p>

<p>To allow direct comparison across variables, relationships between SDM scores and continuous variables are reported in the form of standardized beta coefficients. Data on the HCCQ were missing for 2.2% of patients; rates for all other variables were under 4%. We applied multiple imputation (5 imputation sets) based on chained equations to independent variables but did not impute HCCQ. Imputation used regression for continuous variables and ordered logit for ordinal variables, and was based on disease conditions, patient demographics, HCCQ, health status, and health utilization measures.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>A total of 32 practices were randomized out of 44 eligible and invited. Three withdrew prior to data collection, leaving 29 that took part. On prior measures, these 29 practices were on average somewhat smaller than those that declined to participate (mean register size 3600 [range, 500–13,500] v. 5700 [1500–11,600]) and less likely to have a PMS contract (45% v. 80%) but had a similar mean area deprivation index (43.2 [range, 15.6–77.2] v. 38.9 [6.6–75.0]). We recruited a total of 3027 patients, of whom 2965 provided usable data on the HCCQ: 1372 with diabetes; 910 with COPD, and 683 with IBS, representing response rates of 41%, 38%, and 34% of patients sent baseline questionnaires, respectively.</p>
<p>The characteristics of patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12464825">Table 3</xref>. Slightly more than half the sample were female, and the majority were aged 50 years or older and white. Around a quarter of patients reported only 1 (ie the index) chronic condition, whereas nearly 50% reported 3 conditions or more.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our goal in this article has been to estimate baseline levels of SDM in UK patients with chronic conditions and to explore factors associated with SDM, to better understand the potential impacts of our self-management support intervention on patient experience and other outcomes. Mean levels of reported SDM were high, but even so, the range of scores was wide. Reported support for autonomy was generally lower from younger patients, those with poorer health status, and those with IBS but was not related to characteristics of the practice. However, these factors together explained only 7.5% of the total variance in scores.</p>
<sec id="section16-0272989X12464825">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>A number of practices declined to take part in the trial, but although these tended to be somewhat larger than participating practices, area sociodemographic characteristics did not differ. Patient response rates —although comparable with national UK surveys of primary care patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12464825">33</xref></sup>—allow the possibility of bias due to self-selection into the sample. Unfortunately, we had no data on nonrespondents by which to examine nonresponse further. The study was also restricted to one socioeconomically deprived geographical area and the range of index long-term conditions was limited, and hence the results may not be representative of all patients with chronic conditions or the United Kingdom as a whole. In addition, we had a lower response rate from the practice-identified IBS patients, and a much higher proportion of those who did respond did not self-report the condition. This reflects the difficulty of clearly identifying IBS as a condition using routine primary care information systems.</p>
<p>Almost 25% of patients gave their physician the maximum possible rating on the HCCQ. However, the variables most predictive of a maximum score were the same as those predictive of the continuous score (ie, age and general health). We cannot say whether the lack of discrimination at the top end would have been reduced by using the full 15-item HCCQ. However, other patient-reported measures of general practitioner communication have shown similar degrees of skew and ceiling effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12464825">34</xref></sup> This may limit the ability of the instrument as a trial outcome measure to detect changes in SDM.</p>
<p>We did not possess data—either individually or aggregated to practice level—on characteristics of the physicians at the practices (such as age, sex, or years in practice) and hence could not examine relationships between these and SDM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0272989X12464825">
<title>Interpretation of the Findings</title>
<p>Younger patients in the United Kingdom are found to also rate their physician lower on many other dimensions of care, including access, communication, and overall satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12464825">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12464825">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12464825">37</xref></sup> Patients reporting poorer health have likewise consistently been found to give lower ratings to overall satisfaction, access, and communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12464825">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12464825">37</xref></sup> Thus, our findings may reflect differing patient expectations as much as any tendency for physicians to behave differently with younger or less healthy patients. In addition, these cross-sectional data cannot reveal the underlying direction of the relationship—that is, whether higher levels of SDM promote better health status or whether patients whose health is not improving are more likely to regard the care decision-making process as at fault. Furthermore, our findings of relationships between patient age and health and SDM have not been replicated in other countries, such as the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12464825">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12464825">39</xref></sup> Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12464825">40</xref></sup> or the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12464825">11</xref></sup> (with one exception in the case of health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12464825">39</xref></sup>). Hence, these relationships may be unique to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>We found no relationship to patient ethnicity. However, the small number of nonwhite participants in our study means that our power to detect a relationship was low. North American studies have not consistently found an association between patient-reported SDM and ethnic group; some have identified an association,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12464825">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12464825">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12464825">41</xref></sup> and others have not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12464825">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12464825">43</xref></sup> Associations with other patient demographic factors, including sex, education, and socioeconomic status, have likewise varied between studies.</p>
<p>Whereas our study and the others referenced above investigated SDM through use of patient surveys, other research has approached the issue via analysis of directly observed or video/audio recordings of medical consultations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12464825">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12464825">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12464825">44</xref></sup> where SDM has been rated by independent observers. These observational studies have likewise varied considerably in the associations found with patient demographics. However, although none of these studies found a relationship to patient-reported general health, in two studies where physician ratings of patient health were collected, SDM was observed to be higher where the physician regarded the patient’s medical condition to be severe or to involve complex decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12464825">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12464825">42</xref></sup> This suggests that physicians in fact adapt their approach depending on their perception of the patient’s health, which may differ from the patient’s own perception. That this is the case is supported by other research that found degrees of SDM to vary widely for different patients consulting the same physicians, although patient demographics and self-reported health explained very little of this variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12464825">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although many individual disease conditions displayed a univariate relationship with SDM ratings, only IBS/abdominal problems remained associated after multivariate adjustment. This suggests that for most conditions, the first-order relationship with SDM was likely due to confounding with other factors, such as coexistence alongside IBS/abdominal problems, or through associations with age or poorer health status. It is not clear why IBS/abdominal problems should differ from other conditions in this respect. One possibility is that, despite often being associated with severe functional problems, IBS as a condition remains medically unexplained such that many IBS patients feel that primary care has little to offer in terms of medical management but nonetheless consult in the hope of finding a solution to their condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12464825">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only a small proportion of the differences in practice mean scores could be accounted for by the available patient and practice characteristics. We hypothesized that practices with a higher chronic condition workload might engage more fully with SDM, but this was not found to be the case. The fact that patient and practice-level variables accounted for only a small proportion of the variation in patient-reported SDM may be an important result in its own right since it implies that these factors do not constitute major barriers to participation in SDM. Since SDM takes place at the level of the patient consultation, the more salient factors for understanding differences in patient experiences are likely to relate to aspects of the individual physician-patient interactions. Where studies based on observation of consultations have included physician and patient attitudes and behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12464825">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12464825">43</xref></sup> the factors most strongly and consistently related to SDM have been aspects of the physician communication style, particularly supportive and partnership-building communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12464825">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12464825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12464825">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most patients felt confident and enabled in their consultations with their physician. The levels of SDM we observed are similar to those reported in studies of US patients that also used the HCCQ,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12464825">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12464825">27</xref></sup> suggesting that US patients feel equally involved in decisions about their care. However, the HCCQ measures SDM in a way that is independent of the actual content of the decisions being discussed. In the context of patients with chronic conditions and the chronic care model goal of promoting self-management behaviors, high levels of SDM—as measured in this way—can be achieved without self-management forming any part of the consultation. If neither physician nor patient possesses much awareness of relevant self-management strategies or the kinds of support resources available locally, then regardless of the extent to which autonomy is ceded to the patient, the focus of the decisions being “shared” may not extend far beyond more traditional options for care. Work undertaken by ourselves prior to, and in the process of, developing the WISE intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12464825">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12464825">46</xref></sup> and also by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12464825">47</xref></sup> demonstrates that primary care physicians in general possess little knowledge of how to support patients in self-managing in the wider sense and consequently provide very little in the way of support for such.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12464825">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12464825">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>One implication of this is that generic measures of SDM such as the HCCQ may be too general to be very informative, particularly given the generally high scores observed. More nuanced measures of SDM may be required that can discern between different domains of care, such as clinical care v. self-management support. It is entirely plausible that physicians may be willing to engage patients in certain types of decision, where they feel competent to advise and to match the patient’s preferences to the care options available, but feel far less confident about entering into dialogues around approaches to care with which they are less familiar.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the high levels of SDM indicated by this study suggest that for the most part, conditions do exist within which negotiation of supported self-management can occur, provided there is a corresponding commitment from both patient and physician. Hence, finding ways to inform and motivate both physicians and patients to this end becomes a priority if patient self-management is to play the key role in chronic condition management that health policy makers envisage for it. The WISE intervention attempts to engender such motivation by providing physicians with the necessary skills, knowledge, and access to resources to support self-management and to encourage patients to engage with the approach. The large scale of the trial means that follow-up data, when they become available, will allow the potentially complex relationships between the WISE intervention, SDM, self-management behaviors, and health outcomes to be investigated in some depth.</p>
