<abstract>
<p>Based on recent advancements in cognitive science and mathematical models of the mind, this paper proposes a hypothesis on a fundamental role of music in cognition, and in the evolution of the mind, consciousness, and cultures. The vocalizations of proto-humans split into two types: one less emotional and more concretely semantic, evolving into language, and the other preserving emotional connections along with semantic ambiguity, evolving into music. The proposed hypothesis considers specific mechanisms of the mind-brain, which required the evolution of music in parallel with the evolution of cultures and languages. The evolution of language toward becoming the semantically powerful tool used today has required emancipation from emotional encumbrances. Arguments explore why no less powerful mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality. Due to this common origin, language and music in all cultures still retain both semantics and emotionality; however, in this article we emphasize <italic>differences</italic> in the functions of music and language. The fast differentiation of knowledge due to language has created cognitive dissonances among knowledge and instincts. Differentiated emotions were needed for resolving these dissonances. Thus the need for refined music in the process of cultural evolution is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of cognition. This is why today’s human mind and cultures cannot exist without today’s music. Empirical data on the parallel evolution of cognition, emotions, consciousness, and music during the last three thousand years are discussed. Data on changes in musical styles parallel to changes in consciousness support the proposed hypothesis. We propose experimental approaches toward verification of this hypothesis in psychological and neuroimaging research.</p>

<title>Theories of musical emotions and music origins</title>
<p>Aristotle listed the power of music among the unsolved problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1029864912448327">Aristotle, IV BCE/1995</xref>, p.1434). Current theories on musical emotions attempt to uncover this mystery by looking into its evolutionary origins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864912448327">Justus and Hutsler (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1029864912448327">McDermott and Houser (2005)</xref> reviewed the evidence for the evolutionary origins of music. They emphasized that an unambiguous identification of genetic evolution as a source of music origins requires innateness, domain specificity for music, and uniqueness to humans (since no other animals make music in the sense humans do). The conclusions of both reviews are similar: “humans have an innate drive to make and enjoy music”.</p>
<p>There is much suggestive evidence supporting biological predispositions for music. Nevertheless it is unclear that these predispositions are uniquely human; they “show parallels in other domains” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864912448327">Justus &amp; Hutsler, 2005</xref>). There are “some intriguing clues about innate perceptual biases related to music, but probably not enough to seriously constrain evolutionary hypothesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1029864912448327">McDermott &amp; Houser, 2005</xref>). “There is no compelling reason to argue categorically that music is a cognitive domain that has been shaped by natural selection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864912448327">Justus &amp; Hutsler, 2005</xref>). In the <italic>Nature</italic> series of essays on music <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1029864912448327">McDermott (2008)</xref> wrote: “Music is universal, a significant feature of every known culture, and yet does not serve an obvious, uncontroversial function”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1029864912448327">Fitch (2004)</xref> comments that biological and cultural aspects of music are hopelessly entangled, and “the greatest value of an evolutionary perspective may be to provide a theoretical framework.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1029864912448327">Huron (1999)</xref> emphasized that in searching for the evolutionary origins of music, it is necessary to look for complex multistage adaptations, built on prior adaptations, which might have evolved for several reasons. He discussed social reasons for the origins of music and lists several possible evolutionary advantages of music: mate selection, social cohesion, the coordination of group work, auditory development, developing auditory skills, refined motor coordination, conflict reduction, preserving stories of tribal origins. However, according to Huron, the list of possible uses of music does not by itself explain the power of music over the human psyche; it does not explain why music and not some other, nonmusical activities have been used for these purposes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1029864912448327">Cross (2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1029864912448327">b)</xref>, concentrates on evolutionary arguments specific to music. He integrates neuroscientific, cognitive, and ethnomusicological evidence and emphasizes that it is inadequate to consider music as “patterns of sounds” used by individuals for hedonic purposes. According to Cross, the evolution of music was based on biological and genetic mechanisms already existing in the animal world. The power of language is in “its ability to present semantically decomposable propositions”. Language, because of its concreteness, on the one hand enabled exchange of specific and complicated knowledge, but on the other hand could exacerbate oppositions between individual goals and transform an uncertain encounter into a conflict. Music is a communicative tool with opposite properties. It is directed at increasing a sense of ‘shared intentionality’. Music’s major role is social, it serves as an ‘honest signal’ – that is it “reveals qualities of a signaler to a receiver”, or “as if transmitting honest information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1029864912448327">Owren, Rendall, &amp; Ryan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1029864912448327">Számadó &amp; Szathmáry, 2006</xref>) with nonspecific goals. This property of music, “the indeterminacy of meaning or floating intentionality”, allows for individual interactions while maintaining different “goals and meanings” that may conflict. Thus music “promotes the alignment of participants’ sense of goals”.</p>
<p>Cross suggests that music evolved together with language rather than as its precursor. The evolution of language required a rewiring of neural control over the vocal tract, and this control had to become more voluntary for language. At the same time a less voluntary control, originating in ancient emotional brain regions, had to be maintained for music to continue playing the role of ‘honest signal’. Related differences in neural controls over the vocal tract between primates and humans were reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1029864912448327">Perlovsky (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1029864912448327">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1029864912448327">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1029864912448327">2010a)</xref>.</p>
<p>Juvenile periods lengthened in proto-humans. Juvenile animals, especially social primates, engage in play, which prepares them for their adult lives. Play involves music-like features, thus proto-musical activity has ancient genetic roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1029864912448327">Cross &amp; Morley, 2008</xref>). The lengthening of juvenile periods was identified as possibly fundamental for proto-musical activity and for the origin of music. Infant directed speech (IDS) has special musical (or proto-musical) qualities that are universal around the globe. This research was reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1029864912448327">Trehub (2003)</xref>. Several researchers relate this sensitivity to the “coregulation of affect by parent and child” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864912448327">Dissanayake, 2008</xref>), and consider IDS to be an important evolutionary mechanism in the origin of music. Yet arguments presented later suggest that IDS cannot be the full story of musical evolution.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864912448327">Dissanayake (2008)</xref> considers music primarily as a behavioral and motivational capacity. She emphasizes that proto-musical behavior has served as a basis for culture-specific inventions of ritual ceremonies for uniting groups as they united mother-infant pairs. She describes structural and functional resemblances between mother-infant interactions, ceremonial rituals, and adult courtship, and relates these to properties of music. All these, she proposes, suggest an evolved “amodal neural propensity in human species to respond—cognitively and emotionally—to dynamic temporal patterns produced by other humans in context of affiliation.” This is why, according to Dissanayake, proto-musical behavior produces such strong emotions, and activates brain areas involved in ancient mechanisms of reward and motivation, the same areas that are involved in the satisfaction of the most powerful instincts of hunger and sex.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1029864912448327">Mithen (2007)</xref> Neanderthals possibly had proto-musical ability. He argues that music and language have evolved by the differentiation of early proto-human voice sounds such as “Hmmmm”, that is, undifferentiated proto-music-language. Further evolution toward music occurred for religious purposes, which he identifies with supernatural beings. Currently music is not needed, it has been replaced by language, it only exists as inertia, as a persistent remnant of the primordial <italic>Hmmmm</italic>. An exception could be religious practice, where music is needed, since we do not know how to communicate with gods. I disagree with dismissing Bach, Beethoven, or Shostakovich in this way, as well as with the implied characterization of religion, and we shall discuss these doubts later. While addressing language in detail, Mithen (and other scientists as well) give no explanation for why humans learn language by about the age of five, but the corresponding mastery of cognition takes the rest of a lifetime; steps toward explaining this are taken in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1029864912448327">Perlovsky (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1029864912448327">2009a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1029864912448327">2010a)</xref> and summarized later. Mithen’s view on religion contradicts the documented evidence for the relatively late proliferation of supernatural beings in religious practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1029864912448327">Jaynes, 1976</xref>), and also the mathematical and cognitive explanations for the role of the religiously sublime in the workings of the mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1029864912448327">Levine &amp; Perlovsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864912448327">Juslin and Västfjäll (2008)</xref> analyse the mechanisms of musical emotions. They discuss a number of neural mechanisms involved with emotions and different meanings implied for the word ‘emotion’. Here we shall mention just two of these. First, consider the most often discussed basic emotions; we have specific words for these emotions: fear, sexual love, jealousy, thirst . . . The mechanisms of these emotions are related to the satisfaction – or not – of basic instinctual bodily needs such as survival, procreation, a need for water balance in the body . . . An ability of music to express basic emotions unambiguously is a separate field of study. Second, consider the complex or ‘musical’ emotions (sometimes called ‘continuous’), which we ‘hear’ in music and for which we do not necessarily have special words. The mechanisms and role of these emotions in the mind and in cultural evolution are the subjects of this paper.</p>
<p>Six different types of music, fulfilling six fundamental needs, and eliciting six basic emotions, are considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1029864912448327">Levitin (2008)</xref>. He suggests that music originated from animal cries and it functions today essentially in the same way, communicating emotions. It is more difficult, he writes, “to fake sincerity in music than in spoken language”. The reason that music evolved this way as an ‘honest signal’ is because it “simply” co-evolved with brains “precisely to preserve this property”.</p>
<p>This “simply” is not convincing. Consider the fact that even birds can fake cries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864912448327">Lorenz, 1981</xref>), and further doubts arise as soon as we think about actors, singers, and poets, not only contemporary professionals, but also those existing in traditional societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1029864912448327">Meyer, Palmer, &amp; Mazo, 1998</xref>) since time immemorial. Suggestion of the ‘honest signal’, it seems, has not been informed by the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1029864912448327">Jung (1921)</xref> that some people are better able to manipulate their emotions than their thoughts, or by the current psychological studies on emotional intellect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1029864912448327">Mayer, Salovey, &amp; Caruso, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper discusses the mechanisms of music evolution from the differentiation of original proto-music-language to its contemporary refined states. Discussions of mechanisms that evolved music from IDS to Bach and the Beatles in previously proposed theories are lacking or unconvincing. Why do we need the virtual infinity of “musical emotions” that we hear in music (for example, in classical western music)? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864912448327">Dissanayake (2008)</xref> suggests that this path went through ceremonial ritualization, due to “a basic motivation to achieve some level of control over events”. She continues: “That for five or even ten centuries . . . music has been emancipated from its two-million year history and its adaptive roots says more about the recency and aberrance of modernity”. Essentially Dissanayake does not consider what modern people call ‘music’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1029864912448327">Cross and Morley (2008)</xref> appropriately disagree: “it would be impossible to remove music without removing many of the abilities of social cognition that are fundamental to being human”. They conclude that “there are further facets to the evolutionary story”. This paper discusses a hypothesis that clarifies some of these remaining questions and suggests a fundamental role of musical emotions in cognition and evolution.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of the mind</title>
<p>This section summarizes the fundamental mechanisms of the mind: concepts, instincts, emotions, and behavior. Then more complicated mechanisms essential for understanding the role and evolution of music are considered. The content of this section summarizes neuro-cognitive and mathematical arguments considered, in detail, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1029864912448327">Perlovsky (1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1029864912448327">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1029864912448327">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1029864912448327">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1029864912448327">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1029864912448327">2007b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1029864912448327">d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1029864912448327">2009c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1029864912448327">2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1029864912448327">2010f</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1029864912448327">Perlovsky and McManus (1991)</xref>; Perlovsky and Kozma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1029864912448327">2007a</xref>,b); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1029864912448327">Perlovsky and Mayorga (2008)</xref>; and in references therein.</p>
<p>The mind understands the world in terms of concepts. <italic>Concepts</italic> operate as mental representations or models of objects and situations. This analogy is quite literal, so for example, during visual perception of an object, a concept-model in the mind (memory, representation) projects an image onto the visual cortex, which is matched there to an image projected from the retina. This simplified description is discussed in more details in the above references. Experimental neuro-imaging proof of this mechanism with detailed description of the brain regions involved is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1029864912448327">Bar, Kassam, Ghuman, Boshyan, Schmid, Dale, et al. (2006)</xref>. Perception occurs when the two images are successfully matched. (Other important aspects of visual perception that are not essential for the current paper include the dorsal/ventral differentiation in object recognition and experience of object affordance - see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1029864912448327">Bruno, Bernardis, &amp; Gentilucci, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The “mechanism of concepts” evolved for the satisfaction of instinctual needs. Instincts or inborn drives are mechanisms of survival that are much more ancient than mechanisms of concepts. Psychologists currently avoid the word “instinct” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1029864912448327">Nowicki, Peters, &amp; Podos, 1998</xref>) nevertheless we use this word for simplicity, and we give the definition of the related mechanisms. Psychological literature actively discusses these mechanisms and these discussions can be followed in the references given. Here we follow these references in considering the mechanism of <italic>instincts</italic> as similar to internal sensors that measure vital organism parameters, important for normal functioning and survival. For example, a low sugar level in blood indicates an instinctual need for food. This sensor measurement and the requirement to maintain it within certain limits we consider an “instinct”. The human body-mind has dozens of these mechanisms.</p>
<p><italic>Emotions</italic> designate a number of various mechanisms which are surveyed, for example, in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1029864912448327">Cabanac, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864912448327">Juslin, &amp; Västfjäll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1029864912448327">LeDoux, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1029864912448327">Sander, Grafman, &amp; Zalla, 2003</xref>). Here we consider emotions as neural signals connecting instinctual and conceptual brain regions. Emotions (or emotional neural signals) communicate instinctual needs to conceptual recognition-understanding mechanisms in the brain, so that concept-models corresponding to objects or situations that can potentially satisfy instinctual needs receive preferential attention and processing resources in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864912448327">Grossberg &amp; Levine, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>). Thus emotional signals evaluate concepts for the purpose of instinct satisfaction. This evaluation is not according to rules or concepts (like in rule-systems of artificial intelligence), but according to a different instinctual-emotional mechanism described in the given references.</p>
<p>Language and cognition are closely interconnected, but still significantly different. Mechanisms of language and cognition are located in different parts of the brain. Language is learned early in life from the surrounding language, where it exists “ready-made”. But cognition requires experience. The extent to which language acquisition is dissociable from the acquisition of cognitive competence is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1029864912448327">Pulvermüller &amp; Fadiga 2010</xref>); social life competence might also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864912448327">Frith &amp; Frith, 2010</xref>). High cognition cannot be learned from experience alone, language “guidance” is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1029864912448327">Cangelosi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1029864912448327">Cangelosi &amp; Parisi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1029864912448327">Fontanari &amp; Perlovsky, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1029864912448327">2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1029864912448327">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1029864912448327">Fontanari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1029864912448327">Perlovsky &amp; Ilin, 2010</xref>). Interaction between cognition and language requires motivation; this motivation is provided by the emotionality of language, which resides in language sounds, the prosody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1029864912448327">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1029864912448327">2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1029864912448327">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1029864912448327">2010d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1029864912448327">Guttfreund, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1029864912448327">Balaskó &amp; Cabanac, 1998</xref>). The summarized theory of conceptual-emotional recognition and understanding involves mechanisms of intuition, imagination, planning, consciousness, unconsciousness, and many others, including aesthetic emotions.</p>

<title>The knowledge instinct</title>
<p>To satisfy instinctual needs, or inborn drives such as for eating or procreation, the mind should perceive objects around and understand situations. As discussed, this task requires matching concept-models to the surroundings. But surrounding objects would never exactly match old concept-model-memories. This has presented difficulties to artificial intelligence and pattern recognition from the 1950s until recently (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1029864912448327">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1029864912448327">2009c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1029864912448327">2010c</xref>). For this reason the initial projections of mental representations-models are vague and they approximately match many different objects. For conscious perception of specific objects, the mind has to modify concepts so that they “fit” concrete objects and situations. This mechanism operates independently of human desire “to perceive”, it is an inborn autonomous mechanism, more fundamental than eating or procreation. It is aimed at satisfying a basic need, to understand the world around by making concept-models “similar” to surroundings. The mind has an inborn instinct that “senses” this similarity and maximizes it. This mechanism is called the knowledge instinct (KI: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1029864912448327">Levine &amp; Perlovsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1029864912448327">2007d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1029864912448327">2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, Bonniot-Cabanac, &amp; Cabanac, 2010</xref>). Knowledge is the measure of correspondence between mental representations and the world.</p>
<p>Satisfactions or dissatisfactions of this drive or instinct are felt as emotions evaluating harmony or disharmony between the knowledge and the world. They are not related directly to “lower” bodily needs, but only to the “higher” need for knowledge. In this sense they are “higher”, “spiritual”, aesthetic emotions, as they have been called since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864912448327">Kant (1790)</xref>. This way Kant explained the emotion of the beautiful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864912448327">Kant, 1790</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1029864912448327">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1029864912448327">2007b</xref>, 2008b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1029864912448327">2010b</xref>). However, Kant could not complete his explanation, because he did not consider the need constantly to adapt concept-models, and he did not know about KI.</p>

<title>Differentiation and synthesis</title>
<p>The mechanisms of the mind form an approximate hierarchy. At every level top-down signals generated by representations-concepts-models at this level are matched to bottom-up signals coming from representations recognized and understood at lower levels. The mind involves a hierarchy of multiple levels from simple perceptual elements, to concepts of objects, to complex scenes, and so on up the hierarchy to the highest concepts. These highest concepts near the top of the hierarchy are essential for understanding the nature of the beautiful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1029864912448327">Ilin &amp; Perlovsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1029864912448327">Mayorga &amp; Perlovsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1029864912448327">2007b</xref>, 2008b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1029864912448327">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1029864912448327">Perlovsky &amp; Ilin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1029864912448327">Perlovsky &amp; Mayorga, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of the mind the knowledge instinct operates with two main mechanisms, differentiation and synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1029864912448327">2007a</xref>, 2008b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1029864912448327">2010a</xref>). “Down” the hierarchy differentiation creates more specific, diverse and detailed concepts. At the same time higher in the hierarchy KI drives us to understand various situations and abstract concepts as a unity of constituent notions—this is a mechanism of synthesis.</p>
<p>Language is the main mechanism of differentiation. It gives our mind a culturally evolved means to differentiate reality in great detail. The evolution of language required the neural rewiring of the circuits controlling vocalization. Vocal tract muscles in animals are controlled from an old emotional center and voluntary control over vocalization is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864912448327">Davis, Zhang, Winkworth, &amp; Bandler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1029864912448327">Deacon, 1989</xref>). Humans, in contrast, possess a remarkable degree of voluntary control over the voice, which is necessary for language. In addition to the old mostly involuntary control over the vocal tract, humans have conscious voluntary control originating in the cortex. The sounds of animal cries engage the entire psyche, rather than concepts and emotions separately. For example, the calls of vervet monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1029864912448327">Seyfarth &amp; Cheney, 2003</xref>) convey information about different types of predators nearby; however, understanding of a situation (concept of danger), evaluation (emotion of fear), and behavior (cry and jump on a tree) are not differentiated, each call is a part of a single concept-emotion-behavior-vocalization psychic state with very little differentiated voluntary control (if any).</p>
<p>In humans, emotions have separated from concepts and from behavior. This separation is not complete and languages still retain both semantics and emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2009b</xref>); however, in this article we emphasize the semantic aspect of language. Language has contributed not only to the differentiation of conceptual ability, but also to the differentiation of the psychic functions of concepts, emotions, and behavior. This differentiation has destroyed the primordial synthesis of psyche. With the evolution of language the human psyche started losing its synthesis, wholeness. Whereas for animals every piece of “conceptual knowledge” is inextricably connected to emotional evaluation of a situation, and to appropriate behavior, satisfying instinctual needs, this is not so for humans. Most of the knowledge existing in culture and expressed in language is not connected emotionally to human instinctual needs. This is tremendously advantageous for the development of conceptual culture, for science, and technology.</p>
<p>This advantage in conceptual differentiation exerts a heavy price: human psyche is not automatically whole. Human knowledge accumulated in language is not automatically connected to instinctual needs; sometimes culturally developed conceptual knowledge contradicts instinctual needs inherited from the animal past. Also various parts of knowledge may contradict each other. The feeling of being whole, synthesis, is closely related to successful functioning of the highest models at the top of the hierarchy of the mind, which are perceived as the meaning and purpose of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1029864912448327">2007b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1029864912448327">c</xref>, 2008b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1029864912448327">2010e</xref>). Therefore contradictions in the system of knowledge, the disconnects between knowledge and instincts, the lost synthesis, lead to internal crises and may cause clinical depressions. When psychic states missing synthesis preoccupy the majority of a population, knowledge loses its value, including the knowledge and value of social organization, and cultural calamities occur, wars and destructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1029864912448327">Diamond, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1029864912448327">2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1029864912448327">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">2009b</xref>). The evolution of culture requires a balance between differentiation and synthesis. Differentiation is the very essence of cultural evolution. But it may lead to emotional disconnect between conceptual knowledge and instinctual needs, to the lost feeling of meaning and purpose – including the purpose of any cultural knowledge – and to cultural destruction.</p>

<title>Functions of musical emotions</title>
<p>Here we discuss the main hypothesis of this paper: the fundamental role of musical emotions in the evolution of consciousness, cognition, and culture.</p>
<p>The balance between differentiation and synthesis is crucial for the development of cultures and for the emergence of contemporary consciousness. Those of our ancestors who could develop differentiated consciousness could better understand the world around them and who could better plan their life had an evolutionary advantage, if in addition to differentiation they were able to maintain the unity of self required for concentrating the will. Maintaining balance between differentiation and synthesis gave our ancestors an evolutionary advantage. Here we examine the mechanisms by which music helps in maintaining this balance. The main hypothesis of this paper is that maintaining this balance is the very fundamental role that music plays and the reason for evolution of this otherwise unexplainable ability.</p>
<p>In history there is a long record of advanced civilizations in which synthesis and the ability to concentrate the will was undermined by differentiation. They were destroyed by less developed civilizations (barbarians) whose differentiation lagged behind, but whose synthesis and will was strong enough to overcome the great powers of their times. These examples include the Akkadians overrunning the Sumerians some three millennia BCE, barbarians overcoming the Romans and countless civilizations before and after these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1029864912448327">Armstrong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864912448327">Bauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1029864912448327">Diamond, 1997</xref>). But I would like to concentrate on less prominent and more important events of everyday individual human survival from our ancestors to our contemporaries. If differentiation undermined synthesis, the purpose and the will to survive, then differentiated consciousness and culture would never emerge.</p>
<p>Differentiation is the very essence of cultural evolution, but it threatens synthesis and may destroy the entire purpose of culture, and culture itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1029864912448327">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1029864912448327">2007d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1029864912448327">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1029864912448327">2009b</xref>). This instability is entirely human, it does not exist in the animal kingdom because the pace of evolution and differentiation of knowledge from amoeba to primates was very slow, and instinctual mechanisms of synthesis apparently evolved along with brain capacity. The evolution of language changed this; the accumulation of differentiated knowledge vastly exceeded the biological evolutionary capacity to maintain synthesis. This paper suggests that along with the origin of language another uniquely human ability evolved for maintaining synthesis, the ability for music. The hypothesis in this paper is that music evolved along with language for maintaining the balance between differentiation and synthesis. First we present arguments, than we discuss empirical and experimental means by which this hypothesis can be verified.</p>
<p>Many scientists studying the evolution of language came to the conclusion that originally language and music were one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1029864912448327">Cross, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1029864912448327">Darwin, 1871</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1029864912448327">Masataka, 2008</xref>). In this original state the fused language-music did not threaten synthesis. Not unlike animal vocalizations, the sounds of the voice directly affected ancient emotional centers, connected the semantic contents of vocalizations to instinctual needs, and to behavior. In this way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1029864912448327">Jaynes (1976)</xref> explained the stability of the great kingdoms of Mesopotamia up to 4,000 years ago. This synthesis was a direct inheritance from animal voicing mechanisms, and to this very day the voice affects us emotionally directly through ancient emotional brain centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1029864912448327">Panksepp &amp; Bernatzky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1029864912448327">Trainor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We would like to emphasize the already discussed fact that since its origin language has evolved in the direction of enhancing conceptual differentiation ability by separating it from ancient emotional and bodily instinctual influences. While language was evolving in this more conceptual and less emotional direction, another part of human vocalization evolved toward a less semantic and more emotional direction by enhancing already existing mechanisms of the voice-emotion-instinct connection. As language was enhancing differentiation and destroyed the primordial unity of the psyche, music was reconnecting the differentiated psyche, restoring the meaning and purpose of knowledge and making cultural evolution possible.</p>
<p>The fundamental role of music in cultural evolution was to maintain synthesis in the face of increasing differentiation due to language. This was the origin and evolutionary direction of music. Due to this origin music retains both semantics and emotionality; however, in this article we emphasize the emotional aspect of music. We now return to the basic mechanisms of the mind, including KI, and analyse them in more detail in the light of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>KI was described above as an internal sensor in the mind that measures the similarity between concept-models and the world, and the related mechanisms that maximize this similarity. But clearly this is a great simplification. It is not sufficient for the human mind to maximize an average value of the similarity between all concept-models and all experiences. Adequate functioning requires constant resolution of contradictions between multiple mutually contradicting concepts and between individual concepts – quickly created in culture – and primordial animal instincts that evolve slowly. The human psyche is not as harmonious as the psyche of animals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1029864912448327">Nietzsche (1995/1876)</xref> put it, the “human is a dissonance”, a contradictory being. Some of our ancestors were able to acquire differentiated contradictory knowledge and still maintain the wholeness of psyche necessary for concentration of will and purposeful actions; those individuals had tremendous advantage for survival.</p>
<p>For these reasons KI itself became differentiated. It was directed not only at maximizing overall harmony, but also at reconciling constantly evolving contradictions, cognitive dissonances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1029864912448327">Festinger, 1957</xref>). This hypothesis requires theoretical elaboration and experimental confirmation. Emotions related to knowledge were differentiated along with KI (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1029864912448327">Sperber, 1996</xref>). Consider high value concepts such as one’s family, religion, or political preferences. These concepts ‘color’ with emotional values many other concepts; and each of these cognitive dissonances requires a different emotion for reconciliation, a different dimension of an emotional space. In other words, a high value concept attaches aesthetic emotions to other concepts. In this way each concept acts as a separate part of KI: evaluates other concepts for their mutual consistency; this is the mechanism of differentiated knowledge instinct. Virtually every combination of concepts has some degree of contradictions. The number of combinations is practically infinite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1029864912448327">Perlovsky, 2006a</xref>). Therefore aesthetic emotions that reconcile these contradictions are not just several feelings for which we can assign specific words. There is a virtually uncountable infinity, almost a continuum, of aesthetic emotions. We feel this continuum of emotions (not just many separate emotions) when listening to music. We feel this continuum in Palestrina, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chaikovsky, Shostakovich, Beatles, and Eminem, and so on (and the paper suggests a hypothesis that this mechanism extends to all cultures in the world; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1029864912448327">Berlyne, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1029864912448327">Langer, 1942</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1029864912448327">Spinoza (2005/1677)</xref> was the first philosopher to discuss the multiplicity of emotions related to knowledge. Each emotion, he wrote, is different depending on which object it is applied to. There is a principled difference between the multiplicity of aesthetic emotions and the ‘lower’ emotions corresponding to bodily instincts. Those emotions, as discussed, are referred to as ‘basic’ emotions in psychological literature (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864912448327">Juslin &amp; Sloboda, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864912448327">Juslin &amp; Västfjäll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1029864912448327">Sloboda &amp; Juslin, 2001</xref>). As discussed, psychologists identify them; they all have special words, such as ‘rage’ or ‘sadness’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1029864912448327">Levitin (2008)</xref> suggests that there are just six basic types of songs, basic emotions related to basic instinctual needs. But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1029864912448327">Huron (1999)</xref> has already argued that this use of music for basic needs is just that, a utilitarian use of music, which evolved for a much more important purpose that cognitive musicologists had not yet been able to identify. Emotions related to “mismatch” and “discrepancies” have been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1029864912448327">Frijda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864912448327">Juslin &amp; Sloboda, 2001</xref>). It is proposed here that musical emotions have evolved for the synthesis of differentiated consciousness, for reconciling the contradictions that every step toward differentiation entails, for reconciling cognitive dissonances, for creating a unity of the differentiated self.</p>

<title>Empirical evidence and experimental tests</title>
<p>During the last 3000 years much evidence has been accumulated about the parallel evolution of culture, consciousness, and music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1029864912448327">Jaynes, 1976</xref>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1029864912448327">1</xref></sup> Perlovsky, 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1029864912448327">2006b</xref>,e, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1029864912448327">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1029864912448327">2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1029864912448327">Weiss and Taruskin, 1984</xref>). This evidence demonstrates that advances in consciousness and cultures were paralleled by advances in the differentiation of musical emotions. Contemporary consciousness emerged approximately 2,500 years ago, in Ancient Greece (the first philosopher, Thales), Israel (end of prophetism), and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1029864912448327">Confucius 6c.BCE/2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1029864912448327">Lao-Tzu 6c.BCE/1979</xref>). Advancements in consciousness multiplied cognitive dissonances. To reconcile these cognitive dissonances, a new type of music evolved, antiphony, two choruses responding to each other; antiphony is the mainstay of church psalmody to this day (Neh. 12, 27–43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1029864912448327">Weiss &amp; Taruskin, 1984</xref>, p.20).</p>
<p>During the Renaissance, emotionality was accepted as a fundamental part of human psyche. To reconcile emerging psychic contradictions, a new musical style, tonality, was developed for creating diverse emotions, corresponding to evolving psyche. Tonality has remained the basis of western music for more than 500 years. The Reformation in the 16th century reduced the absoluteness of the split between spiritual and material, good and evil, – the contradiction between good and evil was taken from the heights of Heaven and the depths of Hades and placed into the human soul. The fundamental contradiction of human nature between finite matter and infinite spirit, which formed the mystical foundation of Christianity, was brought by the Reformation into everyday culture and made a part of collective consciousness. Tragic tensions originally projected onto the Christian symbol were assimilated by the human psyche. Tensions in the human soul reached an extreme point. To reconcile these tensions a new type of music was developed during the Baroque, and perfected by Buxtehude and Bach; till this day many consider this music the peak of spirituality.</p>
<p>Today multitudes of cognitive dissonances are created in people’s souls by the diversity of our culture. Popular songs play a vital role: by unifying the conceptual content of the lyrics with the emotional content of the music, the songs reconcile cognitive dissonances. This cognitive role of pop songs is much enhanced in rap music. In style and performance it is similar to Ancient Greek dithyrambs. In both dithyramb and rap, quite regular thoughts are cried out at the edge of frenzy. As in Ancient Greece 2,500 years ago, so today in a complex multiform culture, people, especially young people, are losing their bearings. Words no longer call forth emotional reactions, their prime emotional meaning is lost. By shouting words along with a primitive melody and rhythm, a human being limits his or her conscious world, but restores synthesis, the connection of conscious and unconscious. An internal world comes to wholeness, reunites with a part of the surrounding culture.</p>
<p>Future directions will develop laboratory psychological and neuroimaging experiments that could verify the proposed hypothesis that music reconciles cognitive dissonances. Laboratory experimentation should be directed at the operational definition and measurements of musical emotions. There are well developed experimental techniques for studying cognitive dissonances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1029864912448327">Akerlof &amp; Dickens, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, the dimensionality and structure of musical emotion space can be investigated by mathematical methods. It is possible to measure experimentally the subjective similarities (or distances) between musical emotions created by various chords or musical phrases. Existing mathematical techniques of multidimensional scaling can be used for assessing the mathematical properties of spaces characterized by these measurements.</p>

<title>Summary and further directions</title>
<p>The power of music over the human soul and body has remained mysterious from Aristotle to 20th century cognitive science. Contemporary evolutionary psychologists have recognized music as a cultural universal of tremendous power; and yet its fundamental role and function in cognition and its role in the evolution of consciousness and culture have remained hidden. This paper has discussed scientific hypotheses on the role and functions of music and their insufficiencies, and has proposed a new hypothesis that the fundamental role of musical emotions in cognition is to reconcile cognitive dissonances created by knowledge, and to enable the evolution of consciousness and culture.</p>
<p>This hypothesis explains musical emotional mechanisms by relating them to primordial connections between voicing and emotions. It explains the role and function of music in differentiating emotions for the purpose of restoring the unity of self. Musical emotions help maintain a sense of the purpose of one’s life in the face of a multiplicity of contradictory knowledge, or what we called the “synthesis of differentiated consciousness”.</p>
<p>According to this hypothesis, the origins of music are tied to the origins of language. Language emerged by differentiating the original unity of primordial self. Original psychic states of unified concept-emotion-behavior-vocalization were differentiated, so that concepts shed their inextricable connections to emotions and motivation, and deliberate thinking- conversations became possible. The price for this differentiation was the loss of the unity of self, lost concentration of will. Our ancestors, who could maintain concentration of will while differentiating the knowledge about the world, received unparalleled evolutionary advantage. Thus an evolutionary pressure originated to transform the emotional part of primordial vocalization into music.</p>
<p>We discussed scientific empirical methods that can be used to verify this hypothesis. One direction is to relate the changes in musical styles to the changes in cultures and consciousness. This connects the evolution of music, consciousness, and cultures. A step in this direction was made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1029864912448327">Perlovsky (2006b</xref>,e, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1029864912448327">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1029864912448327">2010a)</xref>. It was suggested for example that antiphonal music appeared about 2500 years ago along with contemporary consciousness, when fundamental contradictions in human psyche started penetrating into consciousness and created psychic tensions. Tonality was developed beginning in the Renaissance, when instinctual and emotional human nature was consciously accepted, creating tensions in the psyche with received ideas of a spiritual ‘high’. Buxtehude and Bach were developing music that could reconcile the new contradictions brought into consciousness by the Reformation. Popular songs restore synthesis by connecting the conceptual content of lyrics with the emotional content of music. And contemporary rap music, it is suggested, has a similar style and function to Ancient Greek dithyrambs, namely to reconcile instinctual needs with (at least some) basic concepts in culture and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1029864912448327">Perlovsky &amp; Goldwag, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We discussed laboratory experimental studies related to this hypothesis. Among these, the first conceptual step would be operationally to define musical emotions. This has been related to the well developed methods of studying cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance has been an important psychological tool in developing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1029864912448327">Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974)</xref> theory of human irrationality (which led to the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics). Experimental study of cognitive dissonance emotions has been initiated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864912448327">Cabanac et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>Experimental tests should be used to study the emotional (melodic) content of various languages versus the emotional content of music developed in various cultures. Which part of emotionality is related to behavior, cognition, and which to language alone? Does the increase in popularity of songs in English-speaking cultures compensate for the reduced melodic content of English language? Mathematical methods should be developed to study the spaces of musical emotions and to estimate large dimensional spaces and their structures, using a finite number of measurements.</p>
<p>The proposed hypothesis suggests that language has reduced the direct connections between vocalization and ancient emotional centers. Neural imaging tests could reveal whether music is connected to ancient emotional centers; is this connection direct? Is it different for music and language? To what extent and how does music involve emotional centers in the cortex? Are the neural mechanisms involved in poetry similar to those involved in music? Is this different for low-emotion languages such as English and high-emotion languages such as Russian? How do these mechanisms operate in tonal languages (such as Mandarin)?</p>
<p>The proposed hypothesis on the origins and functions of musical emotions addresses numerous questions, many of which have remained unanswered for millennia. The main hypothesis in this paper is that music helps to mitigate cognitive dissonances, and helps with keeping in mind contradictory cognitions, and in this way has made possible the evolution of language, cognition, and culture. Recently this hypothesis has been experimentally confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1029864912448327">Masataka &amp; Perlovsky, 2012</xref>). This confirmation is a first step towards a program to reveal neural mechanisms, and studies of the proposed hypothesis about the function of music, along with experimental laboratory tests, empirical ethnomusicological, anthropological, and historical studies. This paper has taken a step in this direction by identifying the fundamental role played by musical emotions in cognition and cultural evolution.</p>
