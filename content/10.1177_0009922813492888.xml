<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>A 9-month-old, previously healthy, fully immunized Korean male infant had fever to 101°F (axillary) off and on for 2 weeks, fussiness, decreased activity, decreased oral intake, and vomiting after feeding. His family stated that he felt warm to touch every night and that they had measured his temperature 3 or 4 times during the 2-week period. He was reported by grandmother to have fallen out of bed 1 month earlier and she noted that he seemed to prefer sleeping on his right side since the fall. His grandmother also noted swelling of the right neck for 2 weeks, which his parents denied. Initial physical examination revealed a well-developed, well-nourished male infant in no acute distress. His temperature was 100.1°F (although his maximum temperature during the first hospital day was 101°F twice), heart rate 168 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation breathing room air 97%. His tympanic membranes were clear. His pharynx was injected. The rest of his examination was reported to be unremarkable.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluation included a white blood cell count of 26 600/mL, with 57% neutrophils, 2% bands, 31% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes, and platelet count 788 000/mL. Hemoglobin concentration was 11.1 g/dL. C-reactive protein was 58 mg/dL. Serum chemistries were within normal limits. Rapid antigen tests for viral infections, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and chest radiography were negative or within normal limits. Subsequent physical examination revealed a 2 cm tender, but nonfluctuant, noninflammatory right anterior cervical lymph node. Cardiology evaluation was obtained and an echocardiogram was essentially normal. Given his age, ethnic background, fever, fussiness, unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis, a diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) was made and treatment with immune globulin intravenous and aspirin was begun.</p>
<p>On the second day of hospitalization, infectious diseases (KNF) evaluation was sought. Decreased and painful neck extension and decreased range of motion of the neck were noted. He was observed to keep his head turned to the left. Shortly thereafter, spontaneous drainage of approximately 5 mL of pus was noted from the right ear. An additional 20 mL of pus was drained by the otolaryngologist (JH) at the bedside. Computed tomography of the neck demonstrated a right retropharyngeal, peripherally enhancing abscess measuring 3.8 × 0.9 cm immediately posterior and medial to the right carotid sheath; parapharyngeal extension; associated compression of the right internal jugular vein; extension toward the right jugular foramen; mild mass effect on the adjacent airway; complete opacification of the right external auditory canal (EAC) with connection to the abscess via a defect in the exterior bony canal; but no evidence of involvement of the right mastoid air cells or middle ear cavity and no intracranial extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813492888">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922813492888">2</xref>).</p>

<p>He was started on clindamycin and vancomycin and taken to the operating room for thorough abscess drainage. There, examination revealed fullness of the right parapharyngeal space posterior to the right tonsillar pillar. An incision over the most fluctuant area released a copious amount of phlegmonous material, cultures of which were positive for methicillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. His therapy was changed to oxacillin and then oral cephalosporin at the time of discharge from the hospital. He recovered completely and continues to do well.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Initially, KD was considered because of fever for more than 5 days with unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, fussiness, elevated C-reactive protein, and thrombocytosis in a Korean infant. KD presenting with fever and isolated cervical lymphadenopathy has been described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813492888">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813492888"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813492888">3</xref></sup> as has the overlap between KD and retropharyngeal abscess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813492888">4</xref></sup> He was treated with immune globulin intravenous and aspirin until further evaluation and his clinical course revealed the diagnosis of para-/retropharyngeal abscess.</p>
<p>The retropharyngeal space lies between the middle and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813492888">5</xref></sup> It extends from the skull base to the carina and communicates with the posterior parapharyngeal space. Two chains of lymph nodes are found in the retropharyngeal space, separated by a midline raphe, until approximately 5 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813492888">6</xref></sup> These nodes drain the soft palate, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813492888">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A retropharyngeal abscess may spread to the posterior parapharyngeal space and then cephalad to the EAC via the carotid sheath or the medial parotid gland, where the deep cervical fascia splits to invest (incompletely) the parotid gland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813492888">7</xref></sup> Egress from the EAC could then occur via multiple fissures in the anterior wall of the external meatus or via a congenital defect, known as the foramen of Huschke, that is occasionally present in the anterior/inferior external meatus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813492888">8</xref></sup> Which occurred in our patient was not determined.</p>
<p>Two cases of spontaneous drainage of a para-/retropharyngeal abscess via the EAC have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813492888">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813492888">8</xref></sup> In the first, an 8-month-old infant with a 2-week history of fever, fussiness, poor feeding, and torticollis was found to have drainage from the left ear. Computed tomography revealed a large retropharyngeal abscess with extension into the ipsilateral parapharyngeal space and along the left EAC. The tympanic membrane was intact and there was a defect in the inferior EAC which was draining purulent material. In the second, a 14-year-old female with a dental abscess developed spontaneous drainage from the EAC. Computed tomography demonstrated extension of the abscess into the parapharyngeal space with extension through the fascia surrounding the capsule of the temperomandibular joint and rupture through the fascial sheet between the pterygoid muscles.</p>
<p>This unusual case illustrates the importance of attending to all the historical, physical, and laboratory clues when evaluating a child with prolonged fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813492888">9</xref></sup> Although his parents disputed the grandmother’s observation about his sleep preference, neck swelling, and difficulty turning his head, these were clues to the cause of his fever. Initially, these historical details and some abnormalities on physical examination were overlooked. Later in the hospitalization, careful examination revealed evidence of a deep neck inflammatory process, which became obvious when the ear began to drain. Careful attention to such clues often allows prompt diagnosis of infections in infants and children.</p>
