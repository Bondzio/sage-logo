<p><italic>Taiwan’s Economic Transformation</italic> is a well-constructed, clearly written book that basically fulfils the objectives it sets out. The book provides an in-depth examination of Taiwan’s economic transformation from a planned economy into a market economy between 1949 and 1965, using first-hand interview materials with key government officials from that period and analysing some hitherto unused Chinese-language archives. The book argues that the Kuomintang government’s endorsement of property rights reform and institutional change played a decisive role in the metamorphosis which has enabled its once impoverished command economy to become one of the fastest growing economies in the world.</p>
<p>The book focuses on a small group of political and economic leaders, such as Chen Cheng, Yan Jiagan, and Yin Zongrong, who introduced new institutional and organizational ideas which led to the development of the new market economy. It includes an excellent up-to-date literature review on the topic. The chapters are well annotated and the arguments presented by the authors, Tai-Chun Kuo and Ramon H. Myers, are easy to follow. Chapter 1 starts with John Hicks’s ideas about the development of market economies and the chapter describes patterns of economic change. Then the authors explain why China (including Taiwan) did not develop a productive market economy until the last few decades. They provide short but clear discussions on China’s paramount ideology and institutions – discussions which are interesting and also very helpful for understanding Taiwan’s deviations from China’s path. Chapter 2 gives an account of Taiwan’s political economy from 1863 till 1945. During the period 1863–1895, Chinese migrants transplanted the dominant institutions and economic organizations of southeast China to Taiwan. From 1895 to 1945, the Japanese imposed their institutions in such a way that Taiwan’s economy was integrated into the Japanese national economy. The chapter describes the conditions under which Taiwan effected changes that led to the development of a market economy.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is concerned with the Chinese command economy during the 1930s and 1940s and that of Taiwan’s from 1949 to 1952 under the Nationalist government. Chapter 4 follows the debates that dominated the period 1952–4 concerning wealth creation and distribution. One vision argued that state enterprises should be the primary engine, while the other vision advocated the establishment of a new environment for private enterprises to secure property rights and to effectively compete and innovate under proper state intervention. The latter vision quickly triumphed over the former. Chapter 5 describes how the Kuomintang regime introduced new institutions and organizations which transformed Taiwan’s command economy into a market economy from 1954 to 1958. By examining the processes in detail, Chapter 5 shows how American economic advisers in Taiwan and a few Western-educated Chinese technocrats played a significant role in the cognitive embrace of market economic principles. The powerful influence of the United States is also emphasized. Moreover, during this period, the Taiwanese government was in favour of policies that liberalized foreign trade as well as those that provided strong state assistance to enterprises which produced goods and services for global markets. Chapter 6 discusses an important concern of the government in 1959 and 1960 about whether it should promote foreign investment. The chapter also highlights how the interactions among Kuomintang political and economic leaders, as well as those between US aid advisers and Chinese decision-makers, helped Taiwan’s decision-makers to reach a consensus to industrialize the economy. Chapter 7 identifies the requisites that transformed Taiwan’s economy into a productive market economy and emphasizes the significance of institutional changes in economic transformation. Chapter 8, which concludes the book, describes Taiwan’s new market economy and institutional reforms. It also discusses why only a few societies in the 20th century were able to modify their command economy and transform their traditional market economy.</p>
<p>The volume under review is especially helpful for students and researchers who are interested in Taiwan’s political economic history and development. It also provides some insights into the importance of values and institutions in economic development. With regard to Confucianism, a greater differentiation between ancient Confucianism and neo-Confucianism would have thrown more light on Taiwan’s social and economic changes in modern times (see Xinzhong Yao, <italic>Confucianism and Christianity: A Comparative Study of Jen and Agape</italic>, Brighton: Academic Press, 1996; and Wei-Bin Zhang, <italic>Confucianism and Modernization: Industrialization and Democratization of the Confucian Regions</italic>, London: Macmillan, 1999). Nevertheless, the book makes an invaluable contribution to the study of Taiwan’s political economic history from 1949 to 1965.</p>
