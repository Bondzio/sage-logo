<p>Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez is certainly among the more interesting figures in contemporary Latin American politics, and one who garners significant attention from the international press and academics alike. Yet both he and his political movement are difficult to categorize. Is Chávez authoritarian or democratic? Is he a demagogue? A leftist? A populist? And if he <italic>is</italic> a populist, what exactly does that mean? Part of this elusiveness is no doubt attributable to his polarized support. Kirk Hawkins argues, however, that the key impediments to analyzing Chávez and his movement (“Chavismo”) stem from the difficulty in defining populism. In his ambitious new book, Hawkins argues that populism is indeed the essential characteristic of Chavismo, but to understand contemporary Venezuela, the definition of populism itself requires substantial rethinking. Specifically, he elaborates an ideational conceptualization of populism that he argues is more conducive to the understanding of the nature of such movements, their causes, and their consequences.</p>
<p>Hawkins presents three existing conceptions of populism. Structural approaches identify populist movements as having emerged historically in the context of popular mobilization and cross-class coalitions in support of import substitution industrializing strategies, especially in Latin America. Economic perspectives have pointed to the use of macroeconomically unsustainable policies geared toward appealing to poor sectors of society. And political-institutional definitions have characterized populist movements by their low levels of institutionalization, disregard of representative institutions, charismatic leadership, and mass electoral support. Hawkins argues that, though valuable, all of these approaches fail to get to the root of populism. By going up the ladder of abstraction toward a more basic, ideational conception, all of these previous materialist definitions can be seen largely as consequences of populism rather than populism itself.</p>
<p>Hawkins contends that populism is distinguished by the worldview and discourse of a movement’s leaders and activists—by their “fundamental beliefs about the nature of the political world” (p. 5). In particular, populists “perceive history as a Manichaean struggle between Good and Evil” (p. 5), where the interest of the people has consistently been undermined by the governing elite, the ouster of which is required for the people—the Good—to prevail. Hawkins maintains that categorizing populism in these terms facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the origins, causes, and consequences of Chavismo, but it also enriches the comparative study of populism more broadly. For example, such a conception of populism highlights the inherently antisystem nature of such movements and their belief in the need for significant—even revolutionary—reform. This conceptualization also neatly clarifies differences with pluralism emphasizing an “anything goes” attitude that pervades populism (p. 36). Although it is unsurprising that populists can win elections while carrying the mantle of the people, in this light it is equally unsurprising that the rules of the game and pluralist rights are far subordinate to victory over Evil.</p>
<p>After offering qualitative evidence that these characteristics are highly representative of Chavismo, Hawkins introduces “holistic grading” of the texts of speeches as a convincing method for measuring the extent of populist discourse among leaders of other countries at various points in history. The results place Chávez as the most populist, but in the company of Morales, Perón, Vargas, and Menem (among others), while placing Lula and Kirchner on the nonpopulist end of the scale. This highlights the tension in the popular association between leftism and populism as Hawkins concludes that they are conceptually distinct. Lula does not appear to share Chávez’s view of a struggle between Good and Evil, nor his penchant for bending the rules. And Hawkins rightly observes that Chávez himself has only gradually become rhetorically and programmatically leftist, with his “21st century socialism” emerging somewhat late in his tenure.</p>
<p>So what caused populism to arise in Venezuela? Some argue that it was a democratic reaction to the entrenched and decreasingly representative “partyocracy” established by the Punto Fijo Pact. Others highlight changing political divisions in the context of globalization. And still other perspectives hinge on an electoral response to economic crisis. Hawkins contends that populism emerged as a reaction to the lack of legitimacy of the existing system that was particularly manifest in pervasive corruption and abuse of the rule of law. Indeed, Hawkins argues that this predated the election of Chávez and can be seen in the second administration of Rafael Caldera in the 1990s. But the charismatic Chávez proved particularly able to harness the discontent of the Venezuelan majority with the “crumbling moral foundations of their political system” (p. 87).</p>
<p>Alongside qualitative evidence, Hawkins provides quantitative analysis of the determinants of voter choice in the 1998 presidential elections to test his hypothesis. He finds some support for his argument in that voters who were concerned with corruption and who wanted to see radical governmental change in the form of constitutional reform were more likely to vote for Chávez. And although other sets of variables representing structural and economic hypotheses appear to also affect support for Chávez, there is some evidence to suggest that Hawkins’s normative factors are most important. Significantly, Hawkins augments his Venezuelan analysis with an examination of his data categorizing populism across countries. Though sample sizes are relatively small (<italic>N</italic> ≤ 34), there is some support for economic and structural explanations of populism, but here too the evidence appears strongest for corruption as a key determinant.</p>
<p>After a rich treatment of the Bolivarian Circles in which he argues that their organization is likewise driven by a populist worldview, Hawkins joins colleagues Guillermo Rosas and Michael E. Johnson to analyze some of the consequences of Venezuelan populism. Examining the Chávez government’s poverty alleviation programs, they argue that the patterns of administration and benefits of the “missions” are not reflective of an economic populism that overspends to broadly shore up support. Nor do they find evidence of explicit clientelism that is used to buy off supporters, contrary to the contention of many critics of Chávez. Indeed both administrators and beneficiaries of the missions are for the most part already committed Chavistas and driven by the same worldview and discourse that underlie the movement more broadly. Furthermore, the relative administrative autonomy of the missions undermines any ability to easily steer them as effective clientelistic instruments.</p>
<p>Taken together, Hawkins has produced an outstanding, comprehensive piece of scholarship on Chávez and the Venezuelan case that adds significantly to the study of populism generally. Certainly it will draw criticism from those who approach the study of politics from a behavioral perspective. But even for the skeptical, Hawkins has made a convincing argument that ideational conceptions belong in the discussion of populism, providing a useful analytical lever that unites a broad array of cases. A Manichaean worldview that pits “the people” against its enemies helps to explain why populists can be so electorally successful while also willing to violate democratic rules and principles. It helps to understand why populism emerges under a wide range of conditions. And it helps to explain why populists who appear so strategically able to mobilize vast swathes of citizens electorally are frequently haphazard in their policies. Indeed, if the only contribution here were conceptual, it would be worthwhile. And as a paradigmatic case, Chavismo appears to fit well within Hawkins’s framework. However, the measurement of populism adds a comparative dimension that significantly enriches the overall work. The only thing wanting is more data—the grading of more leaders across countries and time—though that is asking quite a bit considering the scope of the work Hawkins has done here.</p>
<p>The least satisfying element of the argument is the primary hypothesis regarding the cause of populism. Hawkins argues that systematic violation of the rule of law (corruption) by elites undermines the legitimacy of the existing leadership and inspires the populist reaction against it. Although this is plausible, and the qualitative evidence is convincing for the case of Chavismo, the quantitative support is not as strong. For the electoral analysis, a desire for constitutional reform is a much stronger predictor of support for Chávez, and with the addition of some controls, corruption loses significance. In the comparative analysis, the small sample reduces the degrees of freedom to the extent that rigorous controls cannot be made. Perhaps better data would reinforce the results. But one of the strengths of the conceptual framework here is the extent to which it accounts for populism across the ideological spectrum. Hawkins is likely right in suggesting that populism tends to be leftist in the developing world because the masses—the people—are poor, but institutions there are also weak and susceptible to corruption. In wealthy countries, where right-wing populism may be more likely to emerge, the rule of law is much stronger. Is corruption likely to be the trigger here as well? Hawkins touches on this in the conclusion, arguing that populism of the radical right in Europe is more successful where corruption is highest or governance is worst. But it seems equally plausible that the common thread across populist variants is a <italic>perceived</italic> disenfranchisement, whether real or not. Certainly corruption increases actual disenfranchisement, but some movements stem from the perception that some “other” group is benefiting at their expense, even when they are objectively incorrect.</p>
<p>Yet this criticism is minor compared to the substantial value of this work. Overall, Hawkins has produced an intellectually and analytically rigorous piece of scholarship that is rich with evidence. It significantly advances the discussion of populism and Chavismo and should be required reading for students of both. It will likely also be of broad interest across comparative politics.</p>
