<abstract>
<p>Columns manufactured with pre-cast concrete could reduce construction waste and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by reducing the use of temporary materials such as formwork. In this paper, three types of connection methods are introduced. The structural performance of pre-cast composite columns connected to beams was investigated for the column connection. Multi-story pre-cast composite columns could significantly reduce the construction time, resulting in a decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This paper reports the analysis of the compression and bending of a two-story column so as to verify the structural performances of pre-cast composite columns to provide adequate integrity to ensure a safe environment for building accommodation. In addition, a steel-framed column and a steel-framed reinforced concrete (SRC) column configured to feature the same compression performance as a pre-cast composite column were designed on the basis of the analysis results. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy efficiency of the composite columns were compared with those of conventional steel and SRC columns during the design and construction phases. This paper also presents new composite columns providing efficient energy consumption with reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for a more environmentally conscientious construction of buildings.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11420126" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Environmental pollution has emerged as a major issue worldwide. Various industries devote much time and effort to reducing energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The construction industry is no exception to such a trend, and researchers are studying new construction methods and structural members as buildings are becoming taller and larger. W.K. Hong developed steel-framed reinforced concrete composite beams that can be used in apartment buildings, the structural performance of which have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11420126">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11420126">3</xref>]. Steel-framed reinforced concrete composite structures have already been shown to be more environmentally friendly than bearing wall structures or flat slab structures since they are more energy-efficient and are associated with reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11420126">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11420126">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Connecting the steel frame of a composite beam to ordinary reinforced concrete (RC) or steel columns has been a problem. To address this issue, this paper has proposed a pre-cast composite column that may be easily connected to a composite beam. A pre-cast composite column, a steel column, and a steel-framed reinforced concrete (SRC) column with similar nominal axial strengths were compared in terms of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions so as to investigate the environmental advantages of pre-cast composite columns.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11420126" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11420126"><title>Concept of Pre-cast Composite Columns</title>
<p>The pre-cast composite column proposed in this paper was developed for efficient connection between a column and a composite beam. It is difficult to connect steel-framed reinforced concrete composite beams and RC columns. Such difficulties result in structural problems during construction. To resolve this issue, structural steel with a length equal to the depth of the beam was embedded in column for connection to composite beams. In such a case, it is possible to connect the steel frame of the composite beam to the embedded structural steel in the same manner as is used in a conventional steel frame connection. Since the upper reinforcing steel placed along the length of the beam is installed through the steel frame in the connection, constructability is improved and the structural safety of the connection is ensured. In addition, pre-cast composite columns of up to three stories in height can be fabricated in a factory. Thus, the construction schedule can be shortened and the use of temporary construction materials such as formwork can be minimized. Also, pre-cast composite columns can reduce energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11420126"><title>Connection Method</title>
<p>As in a two-story composite column connection, a sleeve, a coupler, and pressure-welding were employed in this work.</p>
<p>Sleeve joints require installation of a sleeve in the main reinforcement of the upper composite column. The main reinforcement of the lower composite column is inserted into the sleeve, which is then filled with high-strength non-shrinkage mortar. The base plate of the upper steel frame in the column joint was designed to match the cross-section of the column so that the column reinforcement could penetrate the base plate. Consequently, the base plate was intended to serve as the shear connection member to connect the upper and lower columns. The sleeve joint between columns is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11420126">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11420126" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Sleeve joint method.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420126-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A coupler joint requires a coupler to connect the upper main reinforcement and the lower main reinforcement in the column-to-column connection joint. Couplers are placed at different vertical locations to avoid the damage of the structural performance of the connection. These different locations of couplers allow the horizontal reinforcing steels to pass without interference. In addition, couplers were placed at a lower position to adjust for the construction error. In the same manner as was used for the sleeve joint, the coupler joint requires the top base plate of the column connection to match the size of the column cross-section which, then, results column reinforcement both to penetrate the base plate and to be connected by the coupler. In other words, exposed reinforced steel in the pre-cast composite column is installed to penetrate the base plate of the column connection steel frame attached to the lower column. The column-to-column coupler joint is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11420126">Figure 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-1420326X11420126" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Coupler joint method.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420126-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Pressure-welding requires the main reinforcements of the upper and lower composite columns to be pressure-welded. Since pressure-welding does not result in a mechanical connection, it is difficult to ensure uniform quality across different connections, requiring that thorough quality control and connection strength checks than sleeve joints or coupler joints are necessary for pressure-welding. A column-to-column connection using pressure-welding is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11420126">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11420126" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Pressure-welding method.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420126-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11420126"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>To understand the structural performances of column-to-column connections, a two-story column was analyzed. A horizontal load was first applied to the connection of the two-story column, the ends of which were fixed. The maximum horizontal load was then estimated. A free-body diagram that shows the application of a horizontal load to a two-story column is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11420126">Figure 4</xref>. The diagram indicates an outcome similar to that for a beam in which a concentrated load is applied to the centre can be expected.</p>
<p>A cross-section of the composite column used in the analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11420126">Figure 5</xref>. The compressive strength of the concrete used in the composite column was 35 MPa. The steel frame to be used in this analysis for the connection was composed of SM490 steel and the reinforcement steels with the yield strength of 400 MPa. The cross-sectional size of the column was 600 mm × 600 mm, similar to those found in construction sites. A total of 12 reinforcement steels with a diameter of 25 mm was used for the cross-section, and the steel frame had dimensions of 250 mm × 250 mm × 9 mm × 14 mm as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11420126">Figure 5</xref>.

<p>To calculate the nominal moment of the composite column, the strength design method was used. In the strength design method analysis, the following assumptions are employed:
<list id="list1-1420326X11420126" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The strains of the reinforcement and concrete are proportional to the distance from the neutral axis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The strain of the concrete at the edge of the compressive side is limited to be 0.003.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The stress of the reinforcement at or below the yield strength <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> is <italic>E<sub>s</sub></italic> times greater than the strain. If the strain is larger than the value corresponding to the yield strength <italic>f<sub>y</sub></italic>, the stress of the reinforcement is assumed to be the same as <italic>f<sub>y</sub></italic> irrespective of the strain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The tensile strength of the concrete is ignored in the bending stress calculation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At ultimate strength, the stress of the concrete is not proportional to the strain. The distribution of the bending compression stress of the concrete can be assumed to be rectangular, trapezoidal, parabolic, or any shape that effectively corresponds to extensive experimental outcomes in strength prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420126">8</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The nominal moment was calculated to be 563.72 kN. On the assumption that the calculated nominal moment is the same as the maximum moment of the column shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11420126">Figure 4</xref>, the maximum concentrated load applied horizontally to the column-to-column connection was calculated to be 683.3 kN.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11420126"><title>Functional Unit of Energy Consumption</title>
<p>Various types of energy sources were used to produce important key materials for construction. The original unit of energy consumption was calculated by estimating the energy consumed per unit output with the assumption that energy used in the production process was included in the end product. The energy consumption per original unit of raw materials was estimated with the indirect estimation method using an inter-industry analysis table from 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11420126">9</xref>]. The energy consumption per unit estimated according to the inter-industry analysis was found to be almost identical to that found with the direct calculation method. The energy consumption per original unit obtained via inter-industry analysis is believed to be highly reliable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11420126">Table 1</xref> shows the energy consumptions of key materials per original unit.

<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data per original unit of key material are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11420126">Table 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11420126"><title>Comparison of Energy Consumptions &amp; CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</title>
<p>Steel and SRC columns with cross-sections corresponding to a nominal axis load of 11457 kN were selected to compare energy consumptions and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The member size of the steel column was selected to be 416 mm × 405 mm × 9 mm × 14 mm as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11420126">Figure 6(a)</xref>.

It can be seen that the same amount of reinforcing steel is used in the pre-cast composite column and the SRC column.

<p>The energy consumptions and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the materials used in each column are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11420126">Figure 7</xref>. The energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions according to concrete were greater in the composite column than in the SRC column. This is attributable to the steel frame embedded in the SRC column. However, formwork is used throughout the SRC column fabrication process, while the pre-cast composite column uses formwork only for the connection region. The aggregate energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the formwork used in SRC column fabrication are three and four times greater, respectively, than those of the composite column. Because the steel frame is composed of a single material, only the energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the steel frame were calculated. Since the basic units of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the steel frame were significantly larger than those in the other members, the energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission for the steel column were also significantly greater than those in the other columns.

The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the pre-cast composite column amounted to 28.04% and 56.78% of that of the steel and SRC columns, respectively.

<p>An analysis of the connection of a pre-cast composite column was performed. The pre-cast composite column was also compared with other columns with a similar axial load in terms of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The following conclusions were drawn:
<list id="list1-1420326X11420126" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In the analysis of a column-to-column connection using the strength design method, the maximum horizontal load of the connection was calculated to be 683.3 kN. Since a pre-cast composite column can be constructed irrespective of the connection method, a suitable connection scheme for the varying needs of each construction site can be selected. This in turn facilitates effective construction and reduces construction time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The energy consumption of the pre-cast composite column calculated from the original unit of energy consumption was found to be 8920.22 MJ. Compared with those of the steel and SRC columns, the pre-cast composite column decreased the energy consumption by 70.26% and 44.33%, respectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the pre-cast composite column calculated from the original unit of CO<sub>2</sub> emission were found to be 843.96 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>. Compared with those of the steel and SRC columns, the pre-cast composite column decreased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 71.96% and 43.22%, respectively.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The pre-cast composite column examined in this work can reduce energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared with those of steel and SRC columns. Thus, the application of the pre-cast composite column is an environmentally friendly solution that can reduce construction time.</p></sec></body>
