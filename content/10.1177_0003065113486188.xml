<p>This panel, attractively but somewhat misleadingly titled, presented three cases in which the analyst had despaired at the lack of movement in the case, at the patient’s seeming imperviousness to analytic understanding of the enacted fantasy, and had all but lost hope. In all three cases the “stuckness” was understood as a shared dynamic between analyst and patient, with the analyst experiencing deep immersion in a role unconsciously assigned by the patient. The analyst’s ability to use this countertransference response and think about what was being enacted became a way into understanding the forces resisting change. We were treated to three evocative case histories in which the analyst found a solution, from within the patient’s worldview, to resist the gravitational attraction of the stuck pattern, with each solution specific to the case but based on some shared principles. Thus, rather than offers of how-to advice, what emerged in a morning of generative interaction and little controversy were ideas about what the three cases had in common and what had helped.</p>
<p>Rosemary Balsam, as chair, introduced the panelists. She began by noting that what we refer to colloquially as “stuckness” is a clinical entity that overlaps with concepts such as “impasse,” “negative therapeutic reaction,” “enactment,” “repetition compulsion,” “countertransference,” and “transference” in its broadest sense. She added that Stanley Coen, who first suggested the panel, had chosen a “pragmatic” word “that we can all relate to in an immediate way, and the details of what any one of us considers a ‘stuck’ development in the analytic situation will be both overdetermined and multidetermined.”</p>
<p>Balsam referred to contemporary thinking on the topic, including the long-running APsaA discussion group run by Steven Goldberg and Judy Kantrowitz, and an assortment of publications by Arnold Goldberg, Mitchell Wilson, Peter Giovacchini, Lewis Aron, and Jody Davies, variously raising issues of agency, individuation, power dynamics, character pathology, and emotional details of interaction with the analyst. She stressed that deviation from technique is a sometimes controversial subject associated with these treatments, even now as our ideas about technique have evolved. She then cited Ingrid Masterson, a psychoanalyst in Ireland, who raised for her the question of the role of the body, a remark presaging a theme present in all three cases to be presented.</p>
<p>To provide context for listening to the panelists’ clinical stories, Balsam summarized several elements she saw characterizing the “stuckness” in these cases. First among them is the relentless, prolonged quality of repetitive, “signature” patterns of interaction in the analyses, sometimes leading to the analyst’s feeling at wit’s end. Relief occurs only when the analyst grasps something preconscious, just beyond the pair’s immediate communication,” that proves helpful, or allows a change of tack. After this freeing-up, the stuckness morphs into something “the same only slightly different,” a sign of growth within the heart of the entanglement. Affects in the transference include displaced or suppressed anger, longing, or sexual feelings toward a central figure in the family of origin. The patient’s body plays a key role in the scene. And, finally, each family figure takes a turn via the transference. The analyst’s reactions to these multifaceted transferential demands are the key to slowly sorting out the mutual burden.</p>
<p>The sign of the release of “stuckness” after enough iterations of the pattern, with enough difference, is that the patient reports greater ego control and ego flexibility, greater availability of affect, and increasing individuation. He or she becomes more the agent of his or her life. Finally Balsam quoted Loewald’s retranslation of Freud, “Where id was there shall ego <italic>come into being</italic>,” emphasizing that the continuous holding open of hope for the future is essential in stuck cases. Having alluded to Loewald, she noted that all three panelists use metaphors of drama in their descriptions of the process and, touching on a theme she would return to later in the discussion, reminded us of the resonance of this topic with Loewald’s well-known paper on the analytic situation as theater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113486188">1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Next Frances Arnold presented the case of her patient Janet, who was initially lively and responsive, though she had come to treatment depressed and disappointed by failures in her life. Arnold found herself at first excited by Janet’s responsiveness, but then became increasingly aware of the discrepancy between this feeling and the content of her material, realizing that the patient was projecting vitality into her analyst as a repetition in the transference of her mode of being with her emotionally absent and somatically preoccupied mother. Eventually the case became deadlocked, as Arnold came to feel there was no way for her to budge the patient out of a deadening identification with her controlling mother. Fantasy about the body was prominent in the process, which Arnold understood in the context of particular features of the patient’s development: the mother had serious medical problems and had maintained a rigid body position, ruling the family from a traction apparatus set up in a doorway. The patient had also had gynecological surgery as a teenager that resulted in her feeling inadequate and invaded. Arnold reported feeling frustrated and helpless, even while understanding that her experience of the patient was informative of Janet’s feeling helpless to “cure” her mother. Arnold, though realizing at the outset that this “stuckness” was painful to participate in, offered this reflection: “I am in deeper trouble if I am not somehow in the act, entangled in the experience we create together. In analytic participation, the capacity to be stuck in the thick of it is as much a gift as it is a possible sadomasochistic briar patch.” She emphasized the detail of the patient’s fantasy of being physically damaged and the mother’s bodily preoccupation: “it strikes me that protracted ‘stuckness’ in analyses can emanate from powerful bodily experience, and may lodge itself in the somas of both analyst and analysand. This case illustrates what it is like to try to move from soma to psyche when there has been a profound disruption and dissociation of the two, which has been the nature of my patient’s intergenerational trauma.” In a moment of clarity, she said to Janet, “I think you are putting us in traction, just like your experience of your mother,” to which she replied, in what must have been a moment of relief for both of them, “Say that again; I think you just got me.”</p>
<p>Arnold speculated that this interpretation “worked” because she put her own “neck on the line.” She offered to remain stuck with the patient as long as was required, and acknowledged that they could each make an impact on the other: “If needed I would enter the realm of her immobilized depressed mother and of Janet’s rage.” She saw Janet beginning to acknowledge her own agency as they moved into thinking of traction as a metaphor they could talk about, rather than enacting it together.</p>
<p>Another turning point in the case was a fantasy that became available to Arnold between sessions. She was preoccupied by thoughts of Janet’s inner deadness, as well as of events in her own life, both joyful and sad, involving birth, bodily changes, and aging. Her attention was caught by a story on the radio about the history of antisepsis, and the high mortality rates in childbirth because doctors did not wash their hands when they moved from the morgue to the labor room. She fell into a reverie that revealed to her a basic formulation about Janet’s case, in which she understood her specific countertransference resistance to the patient’s inner deadness. She told Janet it was like they were looking at dead bodies in a morgue, to which Janet took exception. She insisted that Arnold was confused, that in fact she was trying to show she was alive, and was crediting the analysis with helping defend the alive parts of herself. (Arnold did not comment on whether Janet was responding in the moment to a challenge she suddenly woke up to, or whether she implied that her analyst had been chronically misunderstanding her communications. Janet did not acknowledge her persistent role in maintaining the deadness, only her fight against it. Either way, Arnold had performed a judo maneuver turning Janet’s passive resistance into activity and agency.) Arnold ended by speculating that her own need to dissociate defensively from the “morgue” of the patient’s deadness may have prolonged the stalemate. Further, she said, opening this door led to additional difficult work as Janet became aware of her intense envy and its relation to the “deadening.” Finally, Arnold resolved to “remain more willingly melancholic” in order to tolerate Janet’s pessimism and contain the countertransference pull to be an “enlivener.”</p>
<p>Balsam drew attention to the mother’s posture as a “body language tableau” in the manner of Charcot’s hysterics, who would relegate others to the role of observers, shut out from participating or understanding. She praised Arnold’s crucial interpretation: “the brilliance of this interpretation is that it does not separate the mother from the daughter. Dr. Arnold didn’t say, ‘You are putting <italic>me</italic> in this noose.’ That might have pushed the daughter further into despair. Dr. Arnold said, ‘You are putting <italic>us</italic> in traction with no way to impact each other . . . just like your experience of your mother.’” Balsam went on to emphasize the physicality of the identification: “With my sense that Janet was so inexorably and wordlessly fused with the mother in bodies that defined ‘female’ as defective and disabled, . . . I think that it would be premature to try to separate them, as it were. Janet badly needed this internalized complaining, excluding mother joining her as the inside defective female she felt herself to be, so Dr. Arnold had to become imaginatively disabled too, and join in fusion with them, fully to feel the import of their female body hopelessness. But an element of Dr. Arnold’s mind was still there, observing their process. . . . she sets up the metaphor for Janet, and the Janet who also has an intelligent mind and a memory picks it up. ‘You got me,’ she says. I fantasize this means, ‘You understood this tableau in the analytic room, in the original kitchen . . . you decoded my silent play.’ That now places Dr. Arnold as what Loewald would identify as the coauthor of a script that Janet starts once again to write. Her ego temporarily resumes growth from its arrested place. . . . I find the ebb and flow here between death and life utterly compelling as it echoes the waves of stuckness and freedom . . . gradually, slowly freeing up this stiffened and stuck embodied Janet to a greater life and internalized ‘enlivened’ mental procreativity.”</p>
<p>A brief discussion followed, with questions highlighting themes that had not been emphasized in the presentation but were important to the formulation, including the sadism of the patient, the absence of the father, and the replication in the transference of the inability to mentalize, so that the mother who had no thought for the inner life of her child was represented as the patient’s inability to think about the transference.</p>
<p>Next Dionne Powell presented her work with Michelle, an outwardly successful woman who had failed in her marriage and “walked away” from a professional career. Michelle started each session asking ritualistically, plaintively, and without any awareness of her aggression, “Are you ready?” as though she had given over her ability to think and depended on her analyst to do all the thinking for her. Powell described her own feelings of “stagnation, confusion, and utter despair” at being caught in enactments of her patient’s dynamics. She was subjected to a recitation of concretely heard, unmetabolized repetitions of her own words, hour after hour, “required” to limit her comments to the most superficial observations because any intervention beyond that was experienced by Michelle as intrusive and hurtful. Often she was “required” to repeat verbatim her comments from the day before. Because the recitation was so repetitive, Powell felt like she was participating in a kind of “performance art” where the goal was to keep things the same day in, day out. She compared this to watching the movie <italic>Groundhog Day</italic>. Recognizing her patient’s need for her undivided attention but at the same time her need to engage at a distance and with rigid rules, Powell observed that “for Michelle the price of her analyst’s love was being the ‘perfect analysand,’ daily reciting her own dynamics, with my comments being folded into the lengthening narrative, neither digested, engaged with, nor understood. There was minimal nutrition or substance in this analytic meal.” She noted that Michelle would sometimes eat in the waiting room before coming in to lie on the couch, which Powell understood as Michelle feeding herself because she couldn’t be nourished in the session.</p>
<p>As the analysis went on, Michelle described the unreal atmosphere in her childhood, when her mother would minimize or deny her father’s alcoholic rages. She grew up hypervigilant, feeling the need to protect and join with her mother’s view of the world in order to preserve her own sense of safety, which included denying her own thoughts, her own individual reality. Powell vividly described how her patient turned her words into “things”: “In her relentless striving for the concrete, my interpretations became part of Michelle’s perfect productions that she could not absorb or reflect upon, but needed to be presented without contemplation, alteration, or metaphor so she could later recite them and feel reassured. My words were the literal transitional object of Linus’s blanket.” With this insight, she recast Michelle’s bossiness as a matter of survival, and could express to her a profound compassion for the young Michelle’s dilemma: “Michelle’s ambivalence about regaining her own authority and agency was subsumed under the threat of abandonment by her mother, the actual mother and the mother-analyst within.” This was all the more so in the present, as her mother at that very time was disparaging the analysis, which threatened her dependence on her daughter.</p>
<p>Tragically for Michelle, she had had a sibling who had stood up to the parents and attempted to separate, and whom Michelle believed she had treated sadistically, without the kind of parents who could provide a context for normal experiences of aggression. The sibling died, and Michelle fantasized that she had killed the child. Moreover, the death was a warning to Michelle of the danger of declaring independence from her parents. Michelle divulged an organizing fantasy that because God took the wrong child, her life had to remain non-lived, a constant reminder of guilt because she both “murdered and survived” her sister. This fantasy contributed to her stuckness in sadomasochistic enmeshment, in her life and in the transference.</p>
<p>Powell then candidly reported a countertransference difficulty stemming from her position as the sibling in own her family who had asserted an individual identity against the strong pull of the family dynamic, and from accompanying fantasies of the danger of this aggression. Her lingering guilt included an internal demand to present a façade of perfection, to “oblige” Michelle, which meshed with Michelle’s demand that she adopt an inauthentic attitude and join her in her enactment of rehearsed perfection. Thus, there was a temptation for both of them to carry on a sterile pseudoanalysis. “My struggle was how to help Michelle recover her separate identity without losing my own.” From within this dilemma, by drawing repeated attention to subtle gaps between Michelle’s perceptions and her own, Powell was able to convey her sympathy for Michelle’s position. Eventually, she said, “Michelle began to recognize that I was trying to protect the positive aspects of her that she was relentlessly attempting to destroy. Therefore a key aspect of our stalemate was Michelle’s need to attribute her aggression to the other, unaware of her own murderous rage.”</p>
<p>As in Arnold’s case, there came a moment when the analyst was able to speak with compassion for the child who had had to distort her self in order to maintain an attachment to her mother. One day Michelle commented that Powell looked “sad.” The analyst asked for her thoughts about this, and Michelle confessed an urge to “fix it.” At that point Powell offered an interpretation: “This links up to your mother’s sadness. She couldn’t handle her own sadness or yours, so the only way for you to fix it . . . was to take it all inside of you, to adopt her reality and sacrifice your own. And I am saddened by that, because it has had such a profound effect on you.” A shift in Michelle’s internal organization was then marked by a dream in which she was in danger and effectively called for help, despite a figure in the dream trying to prevent her from doing so. Michelle was impressed by her activity in the dream, so unlike her attitude in her life. There followed a period of angry attacks on the analyst, which Powell understood as Michelle’s attempts to defend herself from the intrusion of the analyst’s mind, and as expressions of her envy emerging from the dissolution of her rigid defensive system.</p>
<p>Once they reached this stage, Michelle began to speak of her awful guilt over her sadistic mistreatment of the dead sibling. Powell understood in retrospect how her submission to Michelle’s rigid demands earlier in the treatment had affected Michelle: it “fueled her self-contempt and reinforced the fantasy of her continued need for punishment. This also made its resolution for her future even more complicated because to work through these dynamics would . . . imply killing off her internalized sibling and mother, her only reliable companions in her life’s journey.”</p>
<p>Michelle then told another dream: She was about to give birth, and Powell, as her doctor, was injecting her with an anesthetic so she would not have to be afraid of labor pains. Michelle interpreted the dream by herself as a metaphor about the analysis, and was able to express gratitude and relief. While this was not the end of the treatment, it was a signal that she was now more able to think symbolically and take responsibility as an agent in the birth of a more authentic, “truer” version of herself.</p>
<p>Balsam noted the recurrence of the metaphor of performance, with Powell as the audience, on edge from fear that she would “applaud on the wrong cue.” She pointed out that Michelle’s urgency to assign her this role in the transference arose in part because “Michelle seemed intuitively afraid that Dr. Powell could take on other risky transferential roles, such as the drunken father, or the nerve-wracked denying mother.” Balsam tracked how Powell moved from being the enthralled audience to next having a few strict lines in the script, to finally being able to participate as coauthor of the unfolding play. She remarked that Powell took on the “transferential role of every family member in this dramatized, deadened, fixated enactment where one child had already perished—we are told (in fantasy or possibly in reality) as a result of defiance of these neglectfully, malignantly collusive parents.” As the analysis unfolded, Michelle tried out “fuller identifications with some of her early objects of attachment. One feels that Michelle may not end up as ‘nice’ a person . . . as before the analysis—but she is far, far more authentic in her ability to engage the world.”</p>
<p>The panel’s reporter, Rebecca Chaplan, commented at length on the cases presented thus far and anticipated Stanley Coen’s contribution. These cases, she said, are all examples of the centrality of “working through.” In “Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113486188">Freud (1914)</xref> offers the metaphor of the transference as a playground where the compulsion to repeat “is allowed to expand in almost complete freedom” (p. 154). His emphasis on the neurosis having freedom to expand is important. These patients, “stuck” in their lives, require the analyst to get “stuck” with them in the transference in order to have the freedom to fully experience their predicament, to feel it in all its manifestations. All three cases feature patients who know too well how to get along by being variously compliant, lively, competent, seductive, though at great cost to themselves. Any treatment less intensive than an analysis in which the focus of treatment is the patient’s supposed “failure” with the analyst is bound to become yet another reenactment of familiar hopes being dashed and disappointed. To make anything different of their lives they have to find a new way of being; of course, no one can voluntarily change when survival has up to now depended on these defensive strategies. These more difficult patients are fighting to not let anything happen, using all their cleverness to keep the treatment from helping. In some way, all analyses are stuck in this fight between doing things the old way and finding a new way, if we are appropriately engaging with our patients on this border.</p>
<p>Current ideas about therapeutic action, Chaplan went on, share in common the condition that we be “in it,” whether we believe the critical factor is the patient’s conviction that she matters to us and can have an impact on us; or the analyst’s ability to empathically get inside the patient’s experience and help her reflect, mentalize, or experience us as a new object; or showing we can tolerate the patient’s hatred and survive it. The analyst is charged with containing strong affects and tolerating uncertainty and confusion for long periods. One way or another, we need to find enough gratification in the process to keep us going. Arnold calls attention to the siren call of sadomasochistic enactment, with its regressive gratifications, and Coen in his presentation urges us to get comfortable with our wishes to regress so we are less likely to act on them. An important function of presenting our work and telling our stories to one another is to help us find the stamina to remain engaged with these challenging patients while retaining our ability to be “in it” and observe it, simultaneously.</p>
<p>Chaplan noted important similarities in Arnold’s and Powell’s patients. Both present as suffering a similar developmental trauma: having a mother who demands capitulation to a psychotic world as the price of love and protection, with no father to intervene. For each patient the body is involved in the battle, as the medium of expression of earliest compromises, long before access to words, over taking in and spitting out, skin boundaries, letting go or holding on, feeling whole or damaged. Both patients have a frightening identification with a crazy and tyrannical mother. To experience confusion is shameful for them, there is no pleasure in sex, no comfort in feeling intimate. In both cases the analyst is pulled back into her own conflicts, including guilt about her objects and battles over autonomy. We hear about how suffering is a way of relating, and how these patients are hanging on with their claws.</p>
<p>Pivotally, each analyst recognizes that her patient’s stubborn negativity is also a great strength. It is a sign of life, a way of defending a true, core self from destruction. Though we may differ over how we conceive of the self, it is a compelling metaphor when we think of the vow of “I won’t” as both a death grip and also the stubborn, desperate defense of an inner freedom. For both analysts, a moment came when she was able to say to her patient something like, “You are doing this for a good reason. I know how angry you are, and I don’t hate you back.” In both cases childbirth became a dominant metaphor. Arnold and Powell both acknowledge their own defenses coming into play, their own bodies and minds getting into the conversation. By accepting the legitimacy of the patient’s rage and destructiveness, Chaplan concluded, they are able to hold on to hope for creative new solutions.</p>
<p>Stanley Coen then introduced his case by emphasizing the analyst’s contribution to the stuck situation. It is tempting for analysts to become stuck with a patient in a regressed, embattled negativism. As long as they deny or defend against the wish to regress in this way, they can’t help the patient recognize his or her wish to remain in an infantile stance: “Most patients and analysts find it difficult to actually feel (not think) their own wishes to be involved in or remain in destructive and self-destructive battle with another person. It is easy to understand that other people might want to fight with their spouse or parents so as to feel intensely connected with them. But it can be very difficult to actually allow oneself, patient or analyst, to feel the wish to struggle with another person so as not to be autonomous and responsible for oneself. That is what makes it so difficult for pathologically dependent sadomasochistic patients to change.” Coen then described his work with Ms. B., who had been “fired” by several therapists for her unwillingness to understand or change her behavior. She would complain about her life and ask for practical advice, dismissing and belittling Coen’s interest in her fantasies and dreams. Meanwhile she insisted on pointing out his lack of interest in her, demonstrated, for example, in his replacing a chair in his office without consulting her. She was acutely vigilant for any sign that he was looking at her body, and rejected any attempt on his part to explore this. She insisted on the concrete, like Powell’s patient, and disavowed her role in the rigid, stereotyped enactment of seduction and rejection. By accepting his desire to fall into a sadomasochistic trap, Coen was freed not to act on it; instead he was able to speak with Ms. B. about the need to be cared for that she was expressing by parading her helplessness before him: “She and I were able to get hold of her sadomasochistic desires to torment me with her failure and falling apart, to blame me and make me responsible for her difficulties. I was able to use my own feelings of being blamed, tortured, and attacked to engage her about her pleasure in what she was doing with me. We were able to turn the nightmare scenario with which she began into a kind of theater that we could both enjoy and discuss, as we became the audience rather than the actors.” A key element for Coen was his reframing her negativity, her refusal to “participate,” as a demonstration of her anger at the neglect she felt at being abandoned as a child. He conveyed to her that her rage about his freedom to come and go, about separations both literal and imaginative, was acceptable and legitimate when understood in its original context.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Coen was able to encourage Ms. B. to think about what she was doing with him, suggesting that her repeated pushing him away after good work, or after feeling some enjoyment in their connection, stemmed from her terror of intimacy. She was afraid of being impinged on by him as she had been by her narcissistic parents, and afraid of the intensity of her rage. Coen expanded her ability to think about her inner experience by finding playful ways to present his ideas, “marking” the drama so that the two of them were positioned together in the role of spectators observing their play. The patient went through a period of severe regression in which she stopped bathing and insisted that she needed to be hospitalized, which Coen interpreted to her as her wish to show him in dramatic form how much she needed his care and attention: to feel his love without having to own up to how much she wanted this attention from him.</p>
<p>As in the two previous cases, a dream marked the achievement of a new configuration in the transference. Ms. B. reported two dreams in which people were kissing, dreams that indicated to Coen that his interventions were having an influence, and that she was working out the dangers and longings associated with closeness. While acknowledging the centrality of her aggression, portrayed vividly in one of the dreams, he was circumspect about how he interpreted this to her. He purposely avoided forcing too much on her, sensing that by pointing out sexual or aggressive themes he would frighten and antagonize her. He recognized that he had to be willing to play the role of the unhelpful mother who failed her, and he had to let her play a princess with him as the admiring father, without confusing tongues and telling her she had sexual wishes too. He protected his patient’s need “<italic>not</italic> to use analysis productively”: “When I felt under pressure to get my patient not to be herself, <italic>not</italic> to be an ‘anti-analysand,’ I would stir her up even further. It was easy to rationalize this pressure as her previous therapists had also done, as necessary for the success of the treatment. Then, of course, she objected vigorously that I cared about ‘the treatment’ rather than about her. On the other hand, when I could talk with her empathically—for her, not for me—then we could talk usefully about her wish to be stuck forever.”</p>
<p>In her discussion of Coen’s case, Balsam once again pointed to the aptness of Loewald’s metaphor of the theater for the analytic situation, which, as she put it, “allows for multiple angles on different transferences going on in the same space.” She also noted that the patient’s attitude to her body, in this case her teasing display of her body while she accuses him of prurient interest, is the entry point into her inner drama: “The body is intimately wrapped up in this stuckness—developmentally frozen, immobilized, and unresponsive, even as Ms. B. stages a mimed ‘asexual’ striptease at the beginning of hours. . . . her claws were out at all times to paralyze her analyst into a stiffness and stuckness that defined her own inner world.” As Ms. B. frustrates and mocks his attempts to be empathic, “Dr. Coen is set up to act out the role of a frustrated and angry child. As the analyst inhabits this role on the analytic stage, Ms. B. becomes her own tone-deaf, denying parent to the attached child in Dr. Coen . . . and the fact that he hates being in this position he turns into useful information for this treatment. He gains emotional insight with her, in addition to his intellectual insight about her dilemma. In addition, she becomes very demanding about any kind of separation, and in this way she inhabits the role of a small angry child to his parent.” Balsam stressed again the importance of Coen’s demonstrating to Ms. B. the originally adaptive value of her defiant stance: “He thinks fruitfully of her inner desire to keep connected at all costs to her tone-deaf mother, and her self-absorbed father.”</p>
<p>Balsam then discussed Ms. B.’s family dynamic as Coen had lived it in the transference, and added an interesting speculation to the formulation he had outlined. In the details of one of the kissing dreams, Balsam heard not only a revelation of the patient’s “disavowed and terrifying oedipal, erotic interest in Dr. Coen,” but also a symbolic expression of her desperate bond with the mother, “as a symbol of how <italic>together</italic> mother and daughter may have been in damning men, and fearing being separated by a man—reminiscent of Kulish and Holtzman’s Demeter and Persephone story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113486188">2008</xref>). . . . This position could also account for the patient’s fear of finding herself actually attracted to Coen—which casts him in the role of Hades stealing her away from mother, as in the myth. The patient has been so afraid of abandoning this mother or being abandoned by her, preferring to keep tight together but fighting.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Balsam’s discussion, the audience presented questions to the panel. One analyst asked whether the panel thought there is a particular “female” stuckness (perhaps suggested by Balsam’s introduction of the Persephone myth) and whether it was a coincidence that all three patients presented were female. All members of the panel concurred that they could equally as well have presented a male patient. Barbara Rocah then wondered what provided the analyst the freedom to act, and whether it was a special capacity in these particular analysts not to be burdened by the fear of their countertransference. This generated some lively conversation. Powell cited a few of her “good fathers,” whom she relies on for internal support, citing Joseph Sandler’s papers on the necessity for a background of safety, noting incidentally that his concept of role-responsiveness is cousin to Loewald’s idea of analysis as theater. Powell said she also finds Roy Schafer’s theories of narrative useful. Arnold noted that all three of the patients presented had pulled for an abandonment of the analyst’s sense of reality, making the process feel like a tug of war between versions of reality and forcing the analyst to defend her own sense of agency. Coen demonstrated how he might respond to his patient in a way that encourages play as a way of negotiating this border. Balsam observed that when we talk about action, often it is with a negative valuation, but that “activity of mind” is another kind of action that is required to preserve the observing ego and escape paralysis. Richard Waugaman asked about the sibling in Powell’s case and the role of family secrets, which she readily agreed was an important aspect of the case that she had reluctantly, but necessarily, omitted from her presentation. Judy Kantrowitz then wondered generally about how the analysts on the panel thought about changes in theory and technique, praising the personal quality of the presentations, and appreciating the huge difference in teaching since her own training. Peter Rudnytsky noted that outside the United States, use of the analyst’s self has been around for a long time, and we are catching up. He also commented on the dialectic of separateness and connectedness, and noted that Powell could, for example, have gratified her patient’s demand for verbatim repetition, but that would have missed the chance to think about the demand and avoided the necessary “getting stuck together” that was ultimately what helped the patient. Miri Abramis brought up the important role of consultation and highlighted the subtle, ongoing shifts of dissociation in the analytic dyad as they lose and find their minds, and as they feel their inner vitality born and destroyed. Balsam mentioned the importance of not avoiding envy, and of experiencing the feeling of shared grief for a person who “can’t have your joys.” Ruth Imber added the observation that guilt over separation is a powerful force that keeps people stuck, since it is dangerous to find a new and better parent. The talk then turned to themes of pregnancy and fertility, especially as they had developed in Arnold’s case, and the more general theme of creativity between analyst and patient.</p>
