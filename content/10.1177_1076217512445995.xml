<title>Grants and Awards</title>
<p>The Captain Planet Foundation promotes and supports high-quality education programs that enable children and youth to understand and appreciate their world through learning experiences that engage them in active, hand-on projects <bold>to improve the environment</bold> in their schools and communities. The grants are intended to (a) serve as a catalyst to getting environment-based education in schools and (b) inspire youth and communities to participate in community service through environmental stewardship activities. Eligible applicants are U.S.-based schools. While the Foundation will on occasion consider grants up to US$2,500, preferential consideration is given to funding of US$500 or less and to applicants who have 50% matching or in-kind funding. Deadlines are May 31, September 30, and January 15.

<p>The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) supports Challenge 20/20, an Internet-based program that pairs one school from the United States and one school from outside of the United States. Teacher–student teams from both schools work together throughout the fall 2012 school semester <bold>to find local solutions to one global problem</bold>. Challenge 20/20 is based on Jean Francois Rishcard’s book, <italic>High Noon: 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them</italic>. Eligible applicants include all U.S. schools, elementary and secondary, and public or private. Schools need not be members of NAIS. At a school, the group of students participating may be part of a particular academic class or other group such as a club or afterschool activity. There is no cost to participate. The award is the international cooperation and collaboration between youth. The deadline is August 17, 2012.

<p>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Foundation <bold>advances the state of aerospace, engineering, and technical leadership</bold>.

Each school is limited to up to two grants per calendar year. Eligible applicants are K-12 teachers who develop or apply science, mathematics, and technology in their curriculum. Awards are up to US$200 per individual request to supplement a learning program. Deadline is each April or June or until funding is exhausted.

<p>In2Books, a curriculum-based e-mentoring program from ePals, Inc., will be offered free to Title I schools. Students who participate in the program select and read age-appropriate, high-quality books from a list compiled by a team of children’s literature experts. The students are matched with carefully screened <bold>adult pen pals who read the same books</bold> as the students. After reading each book, students and their pen pals exchange thought about the important issues in the book via online letters. Teachers reinforce these activities in the classroom with related lessons and discussion. Eligible applicants are all third- to fifth-grade classrooms in Title I schools from any one district. Awards include the online program, books, and professional development (valued at more than US$500).

<p>The InvenTeam Initiative, created by the Lemelson-MIT Program, provides an opportunity for high school students to <bold>cultivate their creativity and experience invention</bold>. InvenTeams are composed of high school students, teachers, and mentors who invent technological solutions to real-world problems. Each InvenTeam chooses its own problem to solve. InvenTeam projects span many fields from assistive devices to environmental technologies and consumer goods. Teams partner with professionals in their communities to enrich their experiences. A panel comprising inventors, educators, InvenTeam student alumni, and MIT faculty, staff, and alumni review the applications. Up to 35 finalists are selected from the initial applications to continue to the next step. Selected finalists receive Excite Awards and attend EurekaFest, a multi-day celebration at MIT in June. Excite Award winners must attend EurekaFest to submit a final InvenTeam grant application. Travel, food, and lodging are provided. Eligible applicants are science, math, and technology educators at high schools and nonprofit educational organizations that have not received an InvenTeam grant within the past 3 years. The optimal size of an InvenTeam is 5 to 15 high school youth. Grant size is US$10,000 with up to 15 awarded each year. Funds may be allocated for research, materials, and learning experiences related to the project but not to purchase capital equipment or professional services. Deadlines for the 2013-2014 have not yet been posted, but generally, the early feedback deadline is in March with the initial application due in April.
