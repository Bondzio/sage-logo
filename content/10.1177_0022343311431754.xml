<abstract>
<p>Case study evidence suggests that inequality between regions in federations affects the risk of secessionist conflict. However, the conventional quantitative literature on civil war has found little support for a link between economic inequality and civil war. We argue that this seeming discrepancy in part stems from differences in the conceptualization of inequality and its operationalization, which has focused on individual-level wealth differences. In contrast, we investigate regional-level inequality, which is more readily applicable to understanding possible incentives for internal conflict. We adopt a spatial approach, based on new geo-coded data on administrative units in 31 federal states between 1991 and 2005, economic wealth, and ethnic settlements, and demonstrate strong evidence that regional inequality affects the risk of secessionist conflict. The results indicate that in highly unequal federations, both relatively developed and underdeveloped regions are indeed more likely to be involved in secessionist conflict than regions close to the country average. In addition, we provide evidence that exclusion from central state power as well as ethnic groups’ access to regional institutions are associated with an increased risk for secessionist conflict. The findings on inequality remain robust even when controlling for other confounding factors such as country GDP, population and war history.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Does interregional inequality cause secessionist conflict in federations? Case study evidence provides numerous examples of ethno-nationalist conflict and secessionism where economic issues appear to have played an important role, with Yugoslavia as perhaps the most prominent of the post-Cold War breakups. Although theories of nationalism have emphasized how inequality has motivated secessionism in Europe and not necessarily in violent ways, there are also strong reasons to believe that similar mechanisms can help account for violent conflict in the developing world. For example, observers have emphasized how the Biafran conflict in Nigeria in 1967 or the secessionist conflict in Punjab in the early 1980s were fueled by perceptions of economic injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>). Closer scrutiny of the cases highlighted in prior studies demonstrates that relatively poor regions such as Biafra, the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, as well as relatively richer regions such as Slovenia and Croatia have been involved in violent secessionist conflict. While a wealth difference between a region and the rest of the state alone does not necessarily result in violence, such apparent distributional inequities are likely to develop into contentious issues between a region and the center. Particularly in cases where regions have a distinct ethnic identity, perceived ethnic discrimination through economic disadvantages may trigger or reinforce ethno-nationalist grievances, thus increasing the risk of secessionist conflict.</p>
<p>However, recent large-N studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311431754">Collier &amp; Hoeffler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311431754">Fearon, 2003</xref>) have mostly dismissed inequality as a cause of civil war and argue that there is no empirical support for this claim. We argue that their findings reflect choices regarding the units of analysis and measures of inequality rather than conclusively demonstrate that there is no relationship. Conventional individual-level measures of inequality do not capture group or regional differences, which are highly salient in ethno-nationalist and secessionist conflict.</p>
<p>By relying on regional measures of inequality, our article explores whether there is evidence for a general link between economic inequality and secessionist conflict in federations. Most previous studies of regional inequality and secessionist conflict have been limited in scope due to a lack of suitable cross-national data. In fact, few systematic studies cover more than a particular world region. We try to overcome these shortcomings through more extensive tests based on new geo-coded data on administrative units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343311431754">Deiwiks, 2010</xref>) and spatial economic data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431754">Nordhaus (2006</xref>) to derive measures of interregional inequality for 31 federal countries between 1991 and 2005. Combining these measures with recently collected data on ethnic settlement patterns allows us to examine empirically propositions on regional inequality and secessionist conflict in federations on a much broader basis than previous studies. Our results indicate that both relatively poor and affluent regions are more likely to see secessionist conflict.</p>
<p>Moreover, while recent research has shown that ethnic grievances due to political exclusion or domination by other groups may increase the risk of secession (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022343311431754">Walter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022343311431754">Wimmer, 2002</xref>), much of the existing research on inequality and secessionist conflict has ignored political inequalities and often has not considered the relationship between economic and political inequalities. However, federal states often host a multitude of nationalities, and the boundaries of ethnic groups and regions sometimes overlap. In such polities, interregional inequalities may trigger economic grievances that give rise to violent, ethno-nationalist struggles. Conversely, ethno-nationalist grievances can also exacerbate conflicts over economic issues such as centralization and regional transfers. Since political and economic grievances may coincide, it is sometimes unclear whether the predominant conflict issue is cultural or national autonomy or economic inequalities between groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343311431754">1</xref>
</sup> While some of the literature on regional inequality takes into account the regional concentration of ethnic groups (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343311431754">Bakke &amp; Wibbels, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022343311431754">Sambanis &amp; Milanovic, 2009</xref>), few analyses of the effect of regional inequality on conflict have considered ethno-nationalist grievances explicitly. We find strong evidence that ethno-nationalist grievances indeed are positively associated with secessionist conflict and that economic inequality increases the risk of conflict, and the two appear to have independent effects on conflict.</p>

<title>Inequality and conflict</title>
<sec id="section3-0022343311431754">
<title>Individual and group inequality</title>
<p>Inequality plays a prominent role in the literature on the causes of civil wars. Classical contributions include important studies of peasant uprisings, viewed as a response to rural poverty (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022343311431754">Scott, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343311431754">Moore, 1966</xref>). Other scholars have linked conflict to various types of inequality in terms of structural social imbalances such as uneven income or land distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022343311431754">Russett, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431754">Muller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022343311431754">Muller &amp; Seligson, 1987</xref>). However, like grievance perspectives more generally, this literature has attracted sustained criticism from a recent wave of quantitative studies of civil war pioneered by Paul Collier at the World Bank from the late 1990s. Linking inequalities directly to grievances, these authors typically operationalize inequality by the Gini coefficient of the income distribution among individuals or households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311431754">Collier &amp; Hoeffler (2004</xref>), for example, dismiss inequality as a cause of civil wars since they find no relationship between individual income inequality and conflict. In another important study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311431754">Fearon &amp; Laitin (2003)</xref> also reject both ethnic and political grievances as explanations of civil war, based on measures of individual-level income inequality as well as purely demographic indicators of ethnic diversity such as the ethno-linguistic fractionalization index. Based on this operationalization, the authors conclude that neither economic inequality nor ethnic grievances increase the risk of conflict.</p>
<p>However, these empirical results based on individual-level measures disregard the relationship between inequality and other social cleavages. In contrast, there are good reasons to believe that civil-war violence arises from interaction involving collective actors, such as ethnic groups or political organizations, rather than being a primarily individual-level phenomenon. By distinguishing ‘vertical’ from ‘horizontal’ inequality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022343311431754">Stewart (2009</xref>) and her colleagues shift the focus to ‘inequalities in economic, social or political dimensions or cultural status between culturally defined groups’. This group-level logic is in our view more readily applicable to understanding possible incentives for internal conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343311431754">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although limited data availability has made it difficult to evaluate the relationship between horizontal inequalities and conflict in cross-national comparative studies, there are several case studies that show that relatively deprived ethnic groups seem more likely to engage in violent challenges of governmental authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022343311431754">Stewart, 2009</xref>). More recently, statistical evidence based on selective, cross-national samples has been presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022343311431754">Østby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343311431754">Østby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343311431754">Østby, Nordås &amp; Rød, 2009</xref>). Yet, to our knowledge, there is no systematic study that investigates the relationship between inequality and secessionist violence in federations around the world at the regional level. This article seeks to fill this gap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022343311431754">
<title>Regional inequality</title>
<p>Most of the existing literature on horizontal inequality and conflict analyzes inequality between ethnic groups. In this article, we instead focus on inequality between regions in federations, which may or may not coincide with particular ethnic groups and their settlement patterns. There are number of reasons why we believe it is helpful to focus on regions as potential units that may experience conflict. First, focusing on regional units rather than on ethnic groups at least partly circumvents criticism of group reification that has been directed at group-based accounts of ethnic conflict (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343311431754">Brubaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343311431754">Kalyvas, 2006</xref>). One problem with explanations of conflict based on ethnic groups concerns the potential endogeneity of ethnic groups to conflict. Using ethnic groups as fixed actors contradicts much of the constructivist literature on ethnicity and nationalism, which holds that ethnic groups can be molded and shaped through social interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343311431754">Brass, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343311431754">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2000</xref>). A focus on regions rather than on ethnic groups partly solves this problem,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343311431754">3</xref>
</sup> and also enables us to consider the extent of non-ethnic secessionist conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343311431754">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Second, it is more straightforward to identify regions or administrative units than ethnic groups. The precise and officially defined delineation of the territorial borders of regions makes it straightforward to identify the relevant units. In contrast, determining the membership of ethnic groups and their settlement patterns is much more difficult, especially in instances where there exist multiple and potentially overlapping relevant religious, linguistic and/or caste cleavages, as for example in the case of India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343311431754">Laitin &amp; Posner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, we only consider regions in <italic>federations</italic> since such units have a particularly important status compared to substate units in other types of states. A main characteristic of federal states is that their territories are geopolitically divided and that this division has some constitutional or formal recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311431754">Bednar, 2009</xref>). This makes a first-level administrative unit in a federation a more meaningful unit of analysis than a first-level administrative unit in other types of states, which usually have a much more limited political role. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343311431754">Feeley &amp; Rubin (2008</xref>: 81) go as far as ascribing ‘a personality’ to the subunits, and ‘an existence independent of their function’.</p>
<p>More generally, we argue that the effect of economic inequality in federations is particularly explosive compared to the situation in non-federations. Federalism, maybe more so than other forms of government, promises to guarantee fair governance through a system of shared rule and self-rule. As Elazar points out,<disp-quote>
<p>One of the primary attributes of federalism is that it cannot, by its very nature, abandon the concern for either power or justice but must consider both in relationship to each other, thus forcing people to consider the hard realities of political life while at the same time maintaining their aspirations for the best polity. It is not unfair to say that one purpose of federalism is to achieve this linking of the real and the ideal […] with the messianic aspirations for justice. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343311431754">Elazar, 1987</xref>: 84)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Failure to live up to this promise is likely to provoke harsh reactions from the federal units, which will carefully monitor their relationship to the center and often extend their autonomy demands, especially as regards the distribution of wealth and resources.</p>
<p>The theoretical literature suggests that interregional inequality will directly affect nationalist mobilization and secessionist conflict and will be linked indirectly to conflict depending on the ethnic composition of the region. To illustrate the direct effect, scholars investigating the former Soviet Union point to how rich regions are more likely to mobilize for secession. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022343311431754">Roeder (1991</xref>) claims that secessionist nationalism can be viewed as a reaction to redistributive policies in comparably wealthy regions of the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic region and parts of the Caucasus, which contributed disproportionally to the federal government and national economy. In an attempt to escape these burdens, these regions tried to shift the burdens to local minorities while at the same time giving preferential access to educational, political, and economic opportunities to the titular ethnic group. As a result, nationalism and separatism were rife in these parts of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022343311431754">Roeder, 1991</xref>). This view is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431754">Hale (2000</xref>), who stresses the fear of exploitation in comparably rich Soviet regions. Qualitative evidence from other cases provides insight into how relative wealth can trigger even violent conflict. In the former Federal Yugoslavia, many Slovenes expressed resentment over the region’s disproportionate contribution to the Federal Fund used for the support of underdeveloped republics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>), especially for Serbia, which was held responsible for the declining economy in Yugoslavia since 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022343311431754">Palairet, 2007</xref>). Eventually, the imbalance in financial contributions drove Slovenia to withdraw from the Federal Fund ‘as a part of its general effort to divorce itself from the nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>: 235).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343311431754">5</xref>
</sup> Other regions rich in natural resources, such as Punjab in India and Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, complain that they receive too little from central funds given their contributions to the overall economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on a different conception of economic grievances, many researchers argue that poor regions are more likely to seek secession. Some of these accounts follow the logic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343311431754">Gellner (1969</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311431754">Hechter (1975</xref>), who suggest that differences in regional economic development to the detriment of peripheral regions fuels nationalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311431754">Hechter’s (1975)</xref> ‘internal colonialism’ thesis asserts that exploitation of peripheral regions breeds secessionist grievances. In his study of regional nationalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431754">Gourevitch (1979</xref>) notes that since 1945, banking, manufacturing, resource extraction and agribusiness moved from Quebec to the neighboring province, Ontario. This declining economic investment by Anglophone regions in Quebec was the cause, rather than the effect of Québécois separatist nationalism, accompanied by accusations against the capital for its alleged exploitation of the province, undermining its economic development. Moreover, Quebec’s separatist sentiment was largely accompanied by discontent with macroeconomic policies of the central government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>). While this conflict has not turned violent yet, many others have. For example, economic deprivation seems a likely explanation for the secessionist conflict in Dagestan. Based on interviews with Dagestani elites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022343311431754">Ware et al. (2003</xref>) maintain that economic problems have contributed to the spread of Wahhabism, a religious movement that assigns importance to puritanism and rejects Western influence, especially modernization. They report that individuals in rural villages, who in general are poorer than the urban population in Dagestan, are least likely to consider Wahhabism as an extremist ideology. This explanation is also favored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343311431754">Arukhov (2005</xref>: 124), who suggests that the ‘destruction of the Republic’s economic base …, the appearance of a harsh social stratification based on wealth, noticeable income polarization, interethnic and social conflicts, and mass unemployment’ led to the Dagestanis’ defensive reaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a recent statistical study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343311431754">Østby, Nordås &amp; Rød (2009)</xref> on regional inequality in 22 states in sub-Saharan Africa helps us understand the mechanisms behind inequality and violence more generally. Based on geo-coded survey data, the study finds that relatively deprived regions are most likely to experience a civil war onset. The authors argue that in these regions, elites can easily draw on welfare differences and create a common enemy to unify the population and motivate them for rebellion.</p>
<p>Other scholars have considered the possibility that <italic>both</italic> rich and poor regions may have reasons to fight secessionist wars. In his analysis of regional economic development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431754">Gourevitch (1979</xref>) identifies inequality as an important, though not unique, factor influencing the emergence of nationalism, arguing that underdeveloped regions and developed but politically excluded regions tend to develop nationalism. He finds that both rich and poor regions in several Western countries have developed strong peripheral nationalism. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz (1985</xref>) stresses how both advanced and backward regions can develop grievances over revenue imbalances. According to Horowitz, more advanced regions are likely to see themselves as subsidizing poorer regions, and backward regions may not receive the per capita proportionate spending they would need to catch up economically with the rest of the country. Bookman reports similar results based on a study of 37 secessionist regions, and asserts that ‘all regions may claim that they are giving too much or that they are getting too little from the center, so that both relatively low- and relatively high-income states have a basis for complaint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431754">Bookman, 1992</xref>: 115).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022343311431754">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Common to most of these cases is regional dissatisfaction with central economic policies that leave the federal subunits economically worse off than they aspire to be. The affluent regions feel that they contribute too much to the federal budget and the less wealthy provinces feel they receive too little to catch up with the rest of the country. Although existing studies provide valuable insights into which regions are most conflict prone and why, they are typically limited to a few cases and hence potentially select on the dependent variable. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022343311431754">Roeder (1991</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431754">Hale (2000</xref>) focus primarily on the former Soviet Union. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311431754">Hechter (1975</xref>) analyzes peripheral nationalism in the British Isles from 1536 to 1966. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343311431754">Østby, Nordås and Rød’s (2009)</xref> study of sub-Saharan Africa includes no regions substantially above the country average. In sum, the restricted samples in previous studies limit their representativeness. Indeed, in studies that ask whether regional inequality influences conflict, we cannot exclude the possibility that the conclusions drawn may depend on the particular region considered.</p>

<title>Ethnic regions, ethno-nationalist grievances, and regional autonomy</title>
<p>As indicated in the introduction, it is often difficult to disentangle conflict dynamics and identify the core conflict issue. In his work on nationalism and secessionism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343311431754">Hechter (2000</xref>) argues that economic interests and cultural claims often go together in conflicts. Conflict issues tend to coincide if the geographical boundaries of the region overlap with the boundaries of ethnic group settlements. This is often the case in ethno-federations, where subnational administrative units are designed to serve as homelands for ethnic groups that are geographically concentrated. In fact, much of the theoretical and empirical literature discussed above explicitly or implicitly assumes ethnic regional concentration. This assumption makes sense given that the Soviet Union was an ethno-federal construction, or that in Great Britain the Scots and Welsh reside in their ‘own’ delineated regions. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431754">Gourevitch (1979</xref>) focuses on differences in economic growth in ‘regions with ethnic potential’, that is, regions with distinct linguistic, institutional or historical traditions, or in other words, ethnic regions. He finds that in the presence of ethnically structured socio-economic inequalities, regions with unequal growth are particularly prone to develop strong nationalism. Along similar lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343311431754">Bakke &amp; Wibbels (2006</xref>) present statistical evidence for their hypothesis that the co-occurrence of interregional inequality and regionally concentrated ethnic groups in federations increases a country’s risk of armed rebellion.<sup>

<p>However, demographic measures of ethnic configurations, such as concentration and fractionalization, do not provide much by way of explanation as to why leaders use ethnicity to ‘structure’ conflict along ethnic lines or exactly how violence arises. These measures do not consider groups’ (lack of) access to state power and ethno-nationalism, which is an important oversight because nationalism is an inherent part of almost all violent secessionist conflict processes. Explicitly introduced by the French Revolution, the principle of nationalism dictates that political legitimacy depends on self determination in the name of the nation. Under such conditions, foreign domination can be expected to generate political grievances among dominated groups denied sovereignty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311431754">Gellner, 1983</xref>: 1). Exclusion from central power on ethnic grounds, then, highlights the identity boundaries of the excluded groups and leads to ethnic politicization. Moreover, excluded groups are more likely to resort to arms since other nonviolent avenues to power are blocked. Thus, the key to such explanations is not ethnicity itself, but rather the way nationalism politicizes ethnicity in ways that tend to produce violence.</p>
<p>Once properly conceptualized and measured, ethnic nationalism can be shown to generate collective violence. In particular, recent quantitative studies indicate that if groups are deprived of access to state power, conflict becomes more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311431754">Gurr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343311431754">Cederman, Wimmer &amp; Min, 2010</xref>). By confirming similar findings in the qualitative literature on nationalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343311431754">Mann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343311431754">Brass, 1991</xref>), these studies go a long way toward overturning the earlier conventional wisdom that tended to dismiss the role of ethnic grievances in the recent quantitative research on civil wars. Moreover, these results add credence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022343311431754">Stewart’s (2009)</xref> multi-dimensional notion of horizontal inequality, as political exclusion of ethnic groups can be seen as a form of political horizontal inequality.</p>
<p>Regions in ethno-federal states often hold substantial regional power even if excluded from central state power. However, some scholars consider regional autonomy by concentrated ethnic groups to have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the state (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431754">Hale, 2000</xref>). Regional autonomy – as implied by the concept – is a matter of regions, not of groups, meaning that these territories with clearly defined boundaries are equipped with decision-making institutions that can be used to challenge the government’s authority. Thus, regional institutions can facilitate collective action, such as civil war and secession, in particular.</p>
<p>A large literature on ethnofederalism argues that such institutional arrangements can lead to secessionism in the long run by providing necessary resources to fight a civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022343311431754">Roeder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343311431754">Bunce, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343311431754">McGarry &amp; O’Leary, 2003</xref>) and increasing the region’s bargaining position vis-à-vis the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022343311431754">Treisman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz (1985</xref>) suggests that political control of a region determines whether a group attempts to secede. In particular, the administrative setting enhances a group’s claims to its own state so that ethnic identities are being forged and ‘politicized’, and thus makes growing demands and secessionist conflict more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022343311431754">Nordlinger, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022343311431754">Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343311431754">Brubaker, 1996</xref>). To sum up, access to resources and identity-strengthening conditions provided by regional institutions are likely to increase the risk of secessionist conflict.</p>

<title>Hypotheses about economic and political grievances</title>
<p>The previous sections have shown how recent quantitative studies on inequality do not find support for the general relationship between inequality and civil war. We believe that this in large part arises because of inappropriate use of individual-level measures of inequality. In our theoretical and empirical analysis, we focus on regions and regional measures of inequality in order to investigate the link between inequality and secessionist conflict more closely.</p>
<p>As the literature review has also shown, empirical studies on interregional inequality have failed to provide an unambiguous answer to the question whether regions above and below the national average wealth are the most likely candidates for secessionist conflict in federal states. Furthermore, studies on economic inequality and conflict have tended to disregard political inequality, even though political and economic grievances are often intertwined in ethno-nationalist conflicts. Instead, we consider both economic and political inequality together with regional autonomy as explanatory factors for strong nationalism and secessionist conflict (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431754">Gourevitch, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, as we have seen, most existing studies of regional inequality and conflict tend to be limited to a few countries or a single world region. In this article, we extend the geographic scope to federal states around the world.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022343311431754">
<title>Interregional inequality</title>
<p>First, we consider economic inequality separately from political inequality. We assume that relatively wealthy regions expect to keep their wealth, or at least receive as much of the central ‘cake’ as they contribute. Relatively underdeveloped regions insist on intergovernmental transfers to compensate for their lack of wealth. These expectations tend to generate claims of asymmetric federalism, which is likely to be blocked by the federation’s central elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311431754">Kymlicka, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The resulting economic grievances that stem from perceptions of economic injustice are likely to be attributed to federal economic (e.g. redistributive) policies, which are coordinated at the central level. Secession is a way to escape an untenable situation. Hence, we hypothesize the following:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H1:</italic> Regions with wealth levels far above or below the country average are more likely to engage in secessionist conflict.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This hypothesis assumes a symmetric effect on conflict applying to both relatively rich and poor regions. Since the effects may not be symmetric and inequalities in one direction may hold without the other, we divide H1 into the following two sub-hypotheses:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H1a:</italic> Regions that are relatively rich are more likely to experience secessionist conflict than regions closer to the country average.</p>
<p>
<italic>H1b:</italic> Regions that are relatively poor are more likely to experience secessionist conflict than regions closer to the country average.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022343311431754">
<title>Political grievances in ethnic regions</title>
<p>Viewed as a dimension of horizontal inequality, political exclusion tends to produce ethno-nationalist grievances, which may in turn spill over into political violence. We have presented arguments and evidence connecting such situations with the outbreak of internal conflict. Indeed, where ethnic groups are exposed to alien rule, fundamental norms of political legitimacy are violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343311431754">Brass, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311431754">Gurr, 1993</xref>). Such violations tend to trigger emotional reactions that facilitate the organization of challenges to the political status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022343311431754">Petersen, 2002</xref>). Wherever foreign domination implies discrimination and humiliation, political entrepreneurs claiming to represent the excluded groups are prone to advance political claims to overcome the perceived injustice. Where the incumbent government resists such claims and denies the nationalist opposition the right to express dissent through regular and peaceful channels, the probability of violence becomes especially acute.</p>
<p>In one of the rare works that combines economic and group grievances as explanations for secessionist conflict, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz (1985</xref>) analyzes the relation between ‘backward’ and ‘advanced’ groups and regions. His conceptualization of regions and groups assumes that regions often resent economic imbalances while groups tend to complain about imbalances with regard to proportionality in relation to population. We adopt a similar stance: while we hypothesize that it is the (lack of) economic welfare of <italic>regions</italic> that affects the risk for secessionist conflict, we assume that political grievances of <italic>groups</italic> make conflict more likely. Thus, ethnic groups that are barred from access to central power typically seek to improve their status by seceding:<disp-quote>

<italic>H2:</italic> Regions containing excluded ethnic groups are more likely to experience secessionist conflict than those regions inhabited only by included groups.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022343311431754">
<title>Regional institutions</title>
<p>We contend that the risk of secessionist conflict is particularly high if an ethnic group is excluded from state power but has access to institutions at the regional level. We assume that access to regional institutions makes secession more likely, because ethnicity is in this case already a politically relevant category in this region. As a result, ethnic and nationalist mobilization by regional leaders is comparably easy, which promotes ethnic parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311431754">Brancati, 2006</xref>) and facilitates ethnic outbidding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311431754">Brubaker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022343311431754">Roeder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311431754">Gorenburg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz, 1985</xref>). Furthermore, as indicated above it can be assumed that ethnic groups that control a regional subunit will have more organizational and tangible resources available to fight a secessionist war (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022343311431754">Bunce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431754">Hale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343311431754">McGarry &amp; O’Leary, 2003</xref>). In this view, group mobilization is facilitated through the lack of logistical obstacles in the case of access to regional governmental institutions, which may lead to secessionism in the long run. Also, the costs that a region would incur to have a functioning state apparatus in case of secession are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343311431754">Carter &amp; Goemans, 2011</xref>). The combination of exclusion at the central level and the access to regional institutions at the regional level is likely to exacerbate what scholars have coined the ‘centrifugal effects’ of federalism and decentralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431754">Chandler, 1987</xref>: 156). More specifically, leaders at the regional level are able to use existing institutions to gather large-scale support by mobilizing on ethnic grievances that are directly based in the lack of power at the center. These conditions make administrative units readily available candidates for secessionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343311431754">Hale, 2008</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize the following:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H3:</italic> Regions where the largest excluded group has access to regional institutions are more likely to experience secessionist conflict than regions where the largest excluded group has no access to regional institutions.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Our empirical analysis relies on logistic regression with secessionist conflict onset as the dependent variable. We use a panel dataset consisting of first-level administrative units from 1991 through 2005, which contains data on the lifetime and geographical extension of administrative units in 31 countries (author). The countries included in the dataset are selected based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311431754">Bednar’s (2009)</xref> list of governments that have been federal or ‘quasi-federal’ for at least one year between 1990 and 2000. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311431754">Bednar (2009</xref>: 18f), a country is a federation if (1) it is geopolitically divided, (2) ‘the state and national governments have independent bases of authority’, and (3) if ‘authority is shared between the state and the national governments’. If one of these criteria is not fulfilled, Bednar speaks of quasi-federations. Based on this definition, we derive an inclusive and theoretically interesting selection of 31 countries for the empirical analysis.<sup>

<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is a dichotomous indicator of the onset of a secessionist conflict. We focus on secessionist conflict rather than other types of political violence since such conflict by definition involves a geographical referent – often a first-level administrative unit. We determined secessionist conflicts by selecting from all internal conflicts coded in the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Data (ACD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431754">Gleditsch et al., 2002</xref>).<sup>

</sup> By relying on conflict narratives from the Uppsala Conflict Database,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022343311431754">10</xref>
</sup> we determined whether the secessionist region was involved in conflicts by reference to administrative boundaries, related ethnic groups’ location, or natural boundaries such as rivers and mountain ranges. If the secessionist region is an administrative unit or consists of several administrative units, we code the region(s) as experiencing secessionist conflict onset.</p>
<p>For the analysis, we code a unit-year as 1 if an administrative unit experienced a conflict onset, and set onset to 0 for all other years. Years of ongoing conflict were dropped from the dataset. Some conflicts consists of several spells of conflict, separated by years when the number of battle deaths fail to reach the 25 deaths in the ACD data, and hence give rise to several conflict onsets.</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The main independent variables provide measures of regional inequality and the political status of ethnic groups.

These data are available as raster data of 1 degree grid cell resolution, unfortunately only for the year 1990. For this reason, we have to limit our analysis to the period starting in 1991 and ending in 2005. Using 1990 values as representative for subsequent years can be defended since relative inequalities do not tend to change quickly over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022343311431754">Tilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022343311431754">Stewart &amp; Langer, 2009</xref>).<sup>

<p>To measure the degree of political inequality (see H2 and H3), we use data on ethnic groups in the EPR dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343311431754">Min, Cederman &amp; Wimmer, 2008</xref>) and its extension GeoEPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022343311431754">Wucherpfennig et al., 2011</xref>). EPR identifies politically relevant ethnic groups in 155 sovereign states between 1946 and 2005 and their degree of access to central state power. GeoEPR adds geographical information on the location of ethnic group settlements. We first determine which ethnic groups reside in a given administrative unit by overlapping group settlement areas and the territory of administrative units. We then consider whether or not any of the groups within a region are politically excluded (cf. H2).<sup>

For the largest group in an administrative unit we then determined whether or not it enjoys ‘regional autonomy’ or is a ‘separatist autonomy’, two subcategories of the power-access variable in the EPR dataset.

At the country level, we include logged <italic>GDP </italic>per capita lagged by one year, since poorer states have been found to be more likely to see civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343311431754">Hegre &amp; Sambanis, 2006</xref>) as well as logged <italic>Population density</italic>, which is likely to increase collective dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343311431754">Lichbach, 1995</xref>); a higher population density might increase social tensions arising from a scarcity of land, housing, and employment, and in turn may lower the threshold for decentralization as well as pressures for some regions to ‘opt out’.<sup>

<p>Our final dataset consists of 10,786 region-years with as few as 40 conflict onsets for the time period from 1991 through 2005. We therefore use a rare-events logit regression estimator, and we cluster the standard errors by country to compensate for possible unequal variances across countries.

<p>Together, the symmetric models (1–3) and the asymmetric model (4) provide robust support for all of our three hypotheses. First, <italic>lineq2</italic> as well as the <italic>high</italic> and <italic>low</italic> indicators are positive as expected and statistically significant at the 0.001 level for all four models. This suggests that regional inequality is indeed robustly related to secessionist conflict onset.</p>
<p>With regard to H2, the results suggest that the presence of an excluded group in a region considerably increases the risk of secessionist conflict (see Models 2–4). The coefficient is both positive and statistically significant. H3 also receives empirical support, as revealed by the reported results for Models 3 and 4. The results indicate that if the largest excluded group has access to regional institutions, the likelihood for secessionist conflict increases.</p>
<p>All the control variables behave as expected. We find that the likelihood for secessionist conflict is higher the richer the whole country and the higher the population density. Administrative units that have experienced conflict previously are at greater risk of renewed conflict.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022343311431754">Figure 4</xref> displays the predicted effects given differences in <italic>g/G</italic> for a region with and without an excluded group, all other variables kept at their median. This figure shows that both relatively poor and relatively wealthier units are more likely to see secessionist conflicts, and that conflict becomes more likely the further we move away from relative economic equality. Likewise, the difference for an administrative unit with an excluded group (solid line) and a group without excluded groups (dashed lines) indicate that political inequality also plays an important role.</p>

<p>In an extension of the dataset to administrative units in both federal and non-federal states in the whole world, we find that our findings are not limited to federations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022343311431754">15</xref>
</sup> The results in Model 6 show that the main coefficients remain statistically significant, revealing a stable effect of relatively poor and relatively rich regions on secessionist conflict. Moreover, the federation dummy in Model 6 is statistically significant and positive, suggesting that inequality affects regions independently of the institutional form of a government. Only the <italic>Excluded</italic> variable just misses statistical significance at the 5% level (<italic>p</italic> = 0.054).</p>
<p>We then extend the original analysis to the entire post-World War II period in Model 7, assuming that regional inequality in 1991 remains stable throughout the prior period from 1946. As can be seen in Model 7, the level of statistical significance of the variables does not change although the coefficients for <italic>high</italic> and <italic>low</italic> decrease slightly.</p>
<p>Model 8 considers robustness with regards to the definition of our measures of wealth. Nordhaus’s spatial GDP data measure includes all economic activity including revenues generated by natural resources. However, it is possible that a region may be rich in oil, and hence coded as being relatively wealthy by our measure, while revenue is redistributed elsewhere and without the regional population benefiting from oil revenues. The conflict in the oil-rich Niger delta in 2004 illustrates how such situations are likely to be conflict-inducing as well, although this entails a different causal path than the primary one stated by our theory. In an attempt to measure more adequately the regional wealth as experienced by the population, we use the specific components provided for the G-Econ data to subtract the share of revenues generated by oil in a region from the original GDP data. Model 8 includes the asymmetrical inequality indicators using this wealth measure, and the robustness of the inequality indicators suggests that revenues generated by our hypothesized mechanism are independent of oil, although the presence of such a resource does seem to play a role in the outbreak of secessionist conflict as well, as indicated by the positive <italic>Oil Revenue</italic> coefficient.</p>
<p>We have also conducted additional robustness checks, beyond those reported in the tables. Given the small number of onsets, it is important to make sure that the results are not driven by specific observations with extreme values. Our additional analyses confirm that our main findings are not affected by removing the poorest region that experienced conflict (Chechnya in Russia) or the richest conflict regions (Bayelsa, Delta, Rivers, Ondo in the Niger Delta, which are listed as wealthy due to the presence of oil fields in this region). Nor do the results change in any major way if one chooses population thresholds other than 5,000, such as 0, 10,000, or 20,000, to determine the ethnic group within a given administrative region. Moreover, replacing the control variable measuring population density by logged absolute population values does not alter the main results significantly, except that it reduces the statistical significance of the <italic>Excluded</italic> and <italic>Regional Institutions</italic> variables.</p>
<p>Additional robustness tests indicate that geographical variables, such as minimal distance to an international border and minimal capital distance, fail to reach statistical significance and do not seem to notably influence the effect of the main independent variables.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022343311431754">16</xref>
</sup> The same applies to control variables such as the number of administrative units in a country or a country-level dummy variable indicating whether or not the country has experienced previous conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022343311431754">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, we consider the problem of reverse causation. It is plausible not only that poor regions have a higher likelihood for secessionist conflict but also that conflict destroys infrastructure – necessary for trade, for example – and hence may substantively diminish a region’s wealth. In order to minimize such endogeneity bias, we exclude all regions experiencing conflict in 1990, the year of wealth measurement, but this does not affect the main findings.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provides clear evidence that both relatively affluent and underdeveloped regions in federations have an increased risk of secessionist conflict compared to regions that are closer to the country’s wealth average. In parallel to the effect of economic inequality, we show that regions affected by ethno-nationalist exclusion are also more conflict prone. Moreover, our findings indicate that ethnic autonomy at the regional level has a positive effect on the outbreak of secessionist conflict. Despite the hope that regional institutions may appease ethnic groups in their demands for self-determination, it seems that these institutions can fuel secessionism and hence increase the probability of secessionist conflict.</p>
<p>Our analysis improves on existing approaches by using first-level administrative units as the units of observations and relying on a comprehensive dataset of 31 federations around the globe between 1991 and 2005 as well as systematic measures of regional inequality. While unit heterogeneity across different parts of the world cannot be excluded, any analysis of a general effect of regional inequality on secessionist conflict requires a global, comprehensive, and non-biased sample of countries and regions. Based on such a systematic comparison, we conclude that regional inequality appears to be detrimental to peace, <italic>both</italic> in regions that are much poorer and in regions that are much wealthier than the country average.</p>
<p>Focusing exclusively on violent secessionist conflict, we make no attempt to explore the causes of nonviolent separatism and peaceful state breakups, such as the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, although some secessions may have seen some limited violence, such as the Baltic and Caucasus regions that seceded from the Soviet Union, these did not involve enough violent conflict or non-state organization to be listed as civil wars in the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflicts Dataset. Another limitation concerns potential endogeneity bias. As reported in the previous section, we address this partly by excluding administrative units that experienced conflict in 1990, the point in time when wealth is measured, but a more thorough approach would involve modeling selection effects explicitly, perhaps using alternative instruments or indicators of economic inequality. Finally, theorizing about the effect of economic factors on conflict onset, we implicitly assume that secessionist conflicts are fought as attempts to improve regions’ economic situation. However, it is well known that some secessionists fight despite expected deterioration of the economic situation in case of success, especially where the benefits of self-determination outweigh material considerations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431754">Horowitz, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research will be necessary to disentangle the effect of political and economic horizontal inequality in federations, but for now we conclude that separatist conflict appears to be driven by asymmetries along both dimensions. Given the general skepticism as regards the role of grievances in the contemporary civil-war literature, this in itself is an important finding.</p>

<p>The G-Econ dataset provides spatial estimates of GDP for five-year periods starting with 1990, but since the subsequent data points are adjustments based on natural resource and population and do not constitute new information on economic activities, we use only the original data from 1990 in our main analysis.

<p>When introducing the country-level variable for previous conflict, the coefficients of the main independent variables as well as the regional <italic>Previous conflict</italic> dummy remain statistically significant and do not change in size, except <italic>Regional Institutions</italic>. This roughly doubles in size, which suggests that governments are more likely to grant autonomy to groups that have launched violent secessionist bids in the past. Also, the statistically significant, negative coefficient of <italic>Previous conflict (country)</italic> shows that if a country has experienced secessionist conflict before, another onset in any region of the country becomes less likely. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022343311431754">Walter’s (2006)</xref> reputation argument, which states that central governments have an incentive to prevent separatists from seceding because otherwise they might face similar challenges by other regions.
