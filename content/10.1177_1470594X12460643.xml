<abstract>
<p>The article responds to an influential critique of the view that there is a conceptual distinction between kinds of liberty. The critique in question began with Gerald MacCallum Jr’s famous argument that liberty is a single concept that has a triadic structure between agent, constraint, and end. Against this view, the article argues that the triadic structure offered by MacCallum is unable to conceptualize a particular distinct understanding of liberty. Following Charles Taylor, the article defends the view that there is a distinct ‘exercise-concept’ of liberty that the triadic structure cannot account for. In support of this claim, the article contests a recent argument that an exercise-concept of liberty <italic>can</italic> be conceptualized in terms of the triadic structure. The article argues that the triadic framework can only conceptualize an exercise-concept of liberty at the cost of abandoning the substance of that framework. To defend this, the article explains that the triadic structure and an exercise-concept are basically conceptually distinct in virtue of the fact that the former embodies a ‘static’ concept, whereas the latter embodies a ‘dynamic’ one. To complete the argument that an exercise-concept is a distinct concept of liberty, the article articulates a common theme that unifies both the triadic structure and an exercise-concept as concepts of liberty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 50 years after its original publication, Isaiah Berlin’s famous essay ‘Two Concepts of Liberty’ (2002) remains a central reference point for discussion of the nature of individual freedom. One of the most important offerings in that influential contribution is Berlin’s analysis of the famous distinction between the concepts of negative and positive liberty. This purported conceptual distinction has not, however, gone uncontested. The challenge to Berlin’s thesis was first marshalled by Gerald MacCallum Jr (2006), who argued, pace Berlin, that freedom or liberty<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X12460643">1</xref>
</sup> is in fact a single concept, and that the distinction between positive and negative liberty is not a conceptual one, but simply a way of grouping together different substantive views with respect to when we are free. While MacCallum’s view has been not just influential, but widely supposed to supersede Berlin’s position on the existence of a conceptual distinction between forms of freedom, it has, as is to be expected, attracted its own critical response. Perhaps most notably, Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor (2006</xref>) has cast doubt on the claim that all forms of positive liberty can be conceptualized in terms of the single concept of liberty which MacCallum champions. In the spirit of Berlin’s distinction, Taylor argues that there are two fundamentally different ways of conceptualizing freedom: freedom understood as an ‘opportunity-concept’ and freedom understood as an ‘exercise-concept’. For Taylor, the single concept defended by MacCallum captures only freedom as an opportunity-concept, leaving space for a conceptually distinct understanding of freedom as an exercise-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor, 2006</xref>: 143–4).</p>
<p>This article represents a further move in this dialectic concerning whether liberty, as a concept, is singular or plural. In the context of that narrative, the article offers a defence of Taylor’s distinction between two concepts of liberty in response to a contemporary reassertion of MacCallum’s thesis that liberty is a single concept. The reassertion in question is found in the form of claims made by Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460643">Nelson (2005</xref>) that the purportedly distinct concept of freedom expressed by freedom as an exercise-concept is, in fact, conceptualizable in terms of MacCallum’s single concept. In reply to Nelson’s argument, the article offers to substantiate two claims: first, that freedom understood as an exercise-concept cannot be conceptualized in terms of the shape of the single concept which MacCallum offers; second, that in spite of failing to conform to that way of conceptualizing freedom, and hence representing a distinct concept, freedom understood as an exercise-concept really is a concept of <italic>freedom</italic>. In respective service of these contentions, the article offers two innovations: first, that the conceptual distinctness of freedom as an opportunity-concept in contrast to freedom as an exercise-concept is illuminated by the fact that the former is a static concept, whereas the latter is a dynamic concept; second, that there is a thematic unity between freedom as an exercise-concept and freedom as an opportunity-concept bound up with an understanding of the self (in contradistinction to the world) as a deciding or determining factor in the direction of an agent’s life. Drawing a distinction between concepts of freedom in this way also underscores the sense in which there is a way of understanding individuals’ freedom (as an exercise-concept) under which individuals themselves bear a crucial degree of responsibility for the extent to which their own lives are free ones.</p>

<title>The narrative of disagreement: two concepts or one?</title>
<p>Berlin is clear that the difference between negative and positive understandings of freedom is not found along an axis of ‘different interpretations of a single concept, but two profoundly divergent and irreconcilable attitudes to the ends of life’ (2002: 212). Negative and positive liberty are, at bottom, different <italic>concepts</italic> of freedom, not merely different ways of expressing or understanding a single, overarching concept of freedom. They are understood by Berlin as follows.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Freedom in a negative sense is ‘involved in the answer to the question “What is the area within which the subject – a person or groups of persons – is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be without interference by other persons?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12460643">Berlin, 2002</xref>: 169).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Freedom in a positive sense is ‘involved in the answer to the question “What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12460643">Berlin, 2002</xref>: 169).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X12460643">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>While Berlin is insistent that negative and positive understandings of freedom offer answers to fundamentally different questions, there are points at which he concedes their apparent logical proximity (2002: 177). If, for instance, an individual’s role as a master of himself or herself is limited as a result of the interference of others, this would seem to suggest a continuity between positive and negative freedom that would at least appear to cast preliminary doubt on the validity of a conceptual distinction between the two.</p>
<p>This disputation of the conceptual distinctness of positive and negative freedom has found its most powerful voice in the form of Gerald MacCallum’s defence of freedom conceived as a single, triadic concept. Instead of seeing positive and negative freedom as distinct concepts of freedom, MacCallum argues that we should view freedom as always one and the same triadic relation. His explanation of the nature of the concept of freedom is worth quoting in full:
<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever the freedom of some agent or agents is in question, it is always freedom from some constraint or restriction on, interference with, or barrier to doing, not doing, becoming or not becoming something. Such freedom is thus always <italic>of</italic> something (an agent or agents), <italic>from</italic> something, <italic>to</italic> do, not do, become, or not become something; it is a triadic relation. Taking the format ‘<italic>x</italic> is (is not) free from <italic>y</italic> to do (not do, become, not become) <italic>z</italic>,’ <italic>x</italic> ranges over agents, <italic>y</italic> ranges over such ‘preventing conditions’ as constraints, restrictions, interferences, and barriers, and <italic>z</italic> ranges over actions or conditions of character or circumstance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12460643">MacCallum, 2006</xref>: 102, original emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On this basis, MacCallum argues that positive and negative understandings of freedom are not different <italic>concepts</italic> of freedom, but different families of <italic>conceptions</italic> whose differences are found in the variation in content they specify across the variables in the triadic framework (2006: 107).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X12460643">3</xref>
</sup> In other words, positive and negative views of freedom are distinguished in virtue of the fact that they offer broadly different substantive views regarding the identities of agents whose freedom is in question, what kinds of things function as preventing conditions on freedom, and the range of things agents might be free to do or become. So, for instance, while negative views of freedom characteristically identify only preventing conditions on freedom that are external to agents’ bodies, several positive views of freedom count as preventing conditions factors that are in some sense internal to the self, such as desires and beliefs. Whatever the substantive conception of freedom in question, therefore, if it is genuinely a claim about freedom, then such a claim will have this triadic structure, and its substance will be filled out by the content given to the three variables therein. The view that positive and negative freedom represent distinct concepts of freedom is therefore a confused one, based on a failure to recognize that the concept of freedom has this essentially triadic character.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important move made in response to such thoughts, and in defence of a conceptual distinction between kinds of freedom, has come in the form of Charles Taylor's attack on the sufficiency of negative liberty as a way of characterizing individual freedom. Drawing on Berlin’s characterization of the distinction between positive and negative freedom, Taylor argues that expressing this distinction slightly differently proves illuminating. Instead of explaining doctrines of positive freedom, as Berlin does, in terms of the <italic>source of control</italic>, we should understand conceptions of positive freedom to be concerned with ‘a view of freedom which involves essentially the exercising of control over one’s life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor, 2006</xref>: 143); instead of explaining doctrines of negative freedom, again as with Berlin, in terms of the <italic>area in which an individual is free from interference</italic>, it is possible to conceptualize them in terms of freedom as a matter of ‘what it is open to us to do’ or what we have the <italic>opportunity</italic> for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor, 2006</xref>: 144). These are, Taylor argues, fundamentally distinct ways of conceptualizing freedom: respectively, freedom conceptualized as an <italic>exercise-concept</italic> and freedom conceptualized as an <italic>opportunity-concept</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor, 2006</xref>: 143–4).</p>
<p>Taylor’s distinction between freedom as an exercise-concept and freedom as an opportunity-concept is not strictly a mere relabelling of the positive and negative concepts, respectively. Rather, Taylor introduces the exercise–opportunity distinction as a way of better mapping the kind of basic distinction between two fundamentally different ways of conceptualizing freedom that the distinction between positive and negative freedom captures only imperfectly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460643">Taylor (2006</xref>: 144) explicitly argues, for instance, that while some forms of negative view might rely solely on an opportunity-concept, there are negative views that incorporate some form of self-realization and, therefore, depend in part on conceptualizing freedom in terms of an exercise-concept. So the distinction Taylor proposes between the exercise- and opportunity-concepts of freedom at least partly cuts across the distinction between positive and negative freedom, at least as it is conceived by Berlin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X12460643">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While Taylor’s essay is not explicitly addressed to MacCallum’s triadic framework, its implications as a contestation of that framework are clear. For MacCallum’s triadic framework conceptualizes freedom in terms the absence of a constraint or restriction standing between an agent and some end. The absence of that constraint or restriction renders the end open for, or available to, the agent whose freedom is in question. The triadic framework is quite clearly, then, a pure opportunity-concept. Freedom conceived in terms of an exercise-concept, on the other hand, is not a matter of the absence of constraints, but concerns an individual’s exercising some form of control over his or her own life. It is not a matter of what individuals have the opportunity, facility, or ability to do, but the kind of activity in which they actually engage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X12460643">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To sustain MacCallum’s assertion that freedom is a single concept with this triadic structure in the face of such claims, the challenge is therefore clear: either demonstrate that freedom conceived as an exercise-concept is, contrary to initial appearances, in fact conceptualizable in the relevant way in terms of the triadic framework or establish that freedom conceived as an exercise-concept is not really a kind of <italic>freedom</italic> at all.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X12460643">6</xref>
</sup> I will return to the question of whether the purportedly distinct exercise-concept reflects an intelligible way of conceptualizing freedom, and for now defend the claim that exercise-freedom really is conceptually distinct. I will argue, moreover, that its conceptual distinctness is underpinned by its resistance to conceptualization in terms of the triadic framework.</p>
<p>What lends credence to the thought that an exercise-concept of freedom can indeed be conceptualized in terms of the triadic framework is that it appears that many of the freedom-type claims characteristically found in positive views of freedom are indeed conceptualizable in the terms of that framework. In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12460643">MacCallum (2006</xref>: 112–5) argues that positive freedom-type claims such as those regarding individuals who are enslaved by passions or are less free in virtue of a failure to do what is most rational can be conceptualized in terms of the constraints that desires and ignorance represent over what agents really wish (or would really wish) to do.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X12460643">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>According to MacCallum, positive views can be conceptualized in terms of the triadic framework precisely because the framework is neutral with respect to what can count as an agent or constraint. The kind of positive views of freedom under consideration identify individuals as free when they are acting in certain ways, say, those ways in which they realize a certain ideal of themselves. MacCallum’s diagnosis of the freedom character of such claims is that individuals are free only when they realize an ideal of themselves because individuals that fail to do so therefore remain hostage to certain internal constraints that render them unfree. This is positive freedom, indeed, exercise-freedom, conceptualized in terms of the triadic framework. Liberty is one concept, not two.</p>
<p>The attempt to conceptualize exercise-freedom in terms of the triadic framework is subject to a seemingly obvious response, however. It might be argued that MacCallum’s position shows only that <italic>it is possible</italic> to take some positive freedom-type claims such as ‘If someone is failing to realize an ideal of themselves, they are unfree’ and interpret them in terms of the triadic framework. However, for the defender of the view that there is a conceptually distinct way of understanding freedom (freedom understood as an exercise-concept), this is simply to mislocate what it is that an individual’s freedom consists in. If it is exercise-freedom that is in question, an individual’s freedom <italic>consists in their acting in certain ways</italic>; it does not consist in the absence of constraints to their so acting. So, to frame the positive claims in terms of the triadic framework is to misidentify what about the situation is freedom relevant according to the exercise view. It is because the triadic framework is essentially an opportunity-concept and that an exercise-concept is a structurally distinct way of conceptualizing freedom that the latter resists interpretation in terms of the former. There are at least two concepts of freedom, not one.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X12460643">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Defending this claim that there is a conceptual distinction between freedom understood in an exercise sense and freedom understood in an opportunity sense is the chief concern of the remainder of the article. In particular, the article replies to a contemporary reassertion of the MacCallum thesis offered by Eric Nelson. In support of MacCallum’s triadic concept, Nelson argues that the distinction between Taylor’s exercise and opportunity understandings of freedom is not a conceptual one, but a difference that is located in the different interpretations of constraint they respectively offer. Once the notion of constraint is interpreted broadly enough, an individual’s freedom in an exercise sense can be <italic>explained in terms of the absence of constraint</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460643">Nelson, 2005</xref>: 64–5).</p>
<p>In response to Nelson’s claims I argue that an exercise understanding of freedom resists conceptualization in terms of the triadic opportunity-concept. The incompatibility between these fundamentally divergent ways of conceptualizing freedom is illuminated by noticing the fact that the former represents what I call a ‘dynamic’ concept, whereas the latter represents what I call a ‘static’ concept. I support this with an exploration of the concept of constraint, and argue that in order to sustain content for MacCallum’s triadic framework, the concept of a constraint or a preventing condition must be understood in a way that entails the failure of the triadic framework adequately to conceptualize an exercise understanding of freedom. Finally, I consider and defend the claim that exercise-freedom is intelligible as a concept of <italic>freedom</italic>. In support of this, I offer a theme that I argue unifies both the exercise- and opportunity-concepts as concepts of freedom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X12460643">
<title>Nelson on one concept of liberty</title>
<p>Nelson’s attempted vindication of MacCallum’s singular concept of freedom, in the face of claims such as those from Taylor, revolves around an argument to the effect that exercise-freedom is in fact conceptualizable in terms of the triadic framework. Taking the claim ‘freedom is self-realization’ as an exemplar of this exercise view, Nelson argues that the identification of ‘freedom’ with ‘self-realization’ needs unpacking. After all, Nelson suggests, ‘self-realization is, presumably, quite a lot of things; we still want to know what is “free” about it’ (2005: 63). Nelson therefore diagnoses the claim ‘freedom is self-realization’ into two further conditional statements: ‘if people are free, they will realize themselves’ and ‘if people realize themselves, they will be free’ (2005: 64).</p>
<p>Analysis of the first conditional statement (‘if people are free, they will realize themselves’) demonstrates, according to Nelson, that exercise-freedom differs from other understandings of freedom only in virtue of the nature of the constraints it identifies. Nelson explains that exercise-freedom thus ‘lists as constraints any and all things that might dissuade or distract the agent from following his higher self and choosing his natural object’ (2005: 65). Nelson argues, in other words, that <italic>whatever it is</italic> that explains an individual’s failure to engage in the relevant form of action represents the constraint in question, the absence of which entails that individual’s engaging in the action in question and, in virtue of that absence, renders the individual free. As Nelson explains, ‘the state of free people looks like an “exercise” state only because of … extremely broad normative claims about what things are to count as constraints’ (2005: 65). Exercise-freedom, therefore, simply operates with a sort of maximally capacious understanding of the kinds of things that can function as constraints: <italic>anything</italic> that explains an agent’s failure to ‘self-realize’.</p>
<p>To illustrate, take an individual who fails to realize themselves because they are too lazy to seek out and pursue the kinds of things in which their self-realization inheres. On Nelson’s account, the way to diagnose the sense in which the individual lacks freedom is to identify their laziness as a constraint, the removal of which will make them free. What if, however, the individual, relieved of the ‘constraint’ of a disposition towards laziness still fails to self-realize, now because of a failure to recognize the relevant activities worthy of pursuit? Again, Nelson’s argument maintains, the individual’s loss of exercise-freedom, in this case, inheres in the existence of a further constraint: the ignorance with respect to what are worthy pursuits. What if, still further, the agent in fact recognizes what things are worthy of pursuit, but is, as a matter of fact, motivated by less worthy pursuits and fails to self-realize because of this? Well, Nelson’s argument explains this case as well. The fact that the individual’s recognition of the worthiness of the relevant pursuits is not motivationally efficacious represents the constraint in question. If the ‘constraint’ of motivational inefficacy is removed, the individual will pursue the relevant worthy pursuits constitutive of self-realization. Nelson explains, ‘anything that might prompt an agent to choose “not x” is understood as a constraint, then of course any agent of whom freedom can be posited will do or be x – and only x’ (2005: 65). Freedom as self-realization can be explained not in terms of a fundamentally distinct concept of freedom, but in terms of the nature of constraints on the exercise of the activity. As such, exercise-freedom is wholly explicable in terms of the triadic framework and does not, therefore, represent a distinct concept of freedom at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not clear that Nelson’s analysis here is wholly satisfactory. Nelson’s reduction of the proposition ‘if people are free, they will self-realize’ does appear plausible. However, Nelson’s interpretation of exercise-freedom in terms of the dual conditional statements he offers is itself illegitimate. In a largely convincing reply to Nelson, this much is noticed by John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X12460643">Christman (2005</xref>). The claim under consideration is the exercise-freedom-type claim that ‘freedom is self-realization’. While Nelson deciphers this in terms of the dual conditionals ‘if people are free, they will self-realize’ and ‘if people self-realize, they will be free’, Christman rightly argues that, in fact, the claim ought to be unpacked as ‘if people are free, they are <italic>self-realizing</italic>’ and ‘if people are self-realizing, they <italic>are free</italic>’ (2005: 85) . In other words, Nelson illegitimately shifts from the present to the future tense and, as Christman observes, ‘this is to alter the conceptual thrust of the positive view, which is not fix the meaning of freedom in terms of what will lead to it or allow it to flourish. Using the present tense retains the <italic>logical</italic> connection meant here, that freedom is X (and not the conditions that allow it)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X12460643">Christman, 2005</xref>: 85, original emphasis). Nelson’s analysis, therefore, has the consequence that freedom is conceptualized as the means to self-realization, rather than as freedom as self-realization, as the exercise view maintains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X12460643">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nelson’s reduction of exercise-freedom to the terms of the triadic framework, therefore, seems to rest on a failure to take exercise-freedom seriously on its own terms. For his deconstruction of the claim that ‘freedom is self-realization’ is precisely one that makes it amenable to the triadic reduction. Executing this deconstruction is, for Nelson, a means of explaining what is freedom-relevant about self-realization (2005: 63). In interpreting the exercise view in the way he does, however, Nelson appears simply to rule out of court the identity claim made by the exercise view. This is to <italic>explain away</italic> exercise claims as being implicitly different from the way in which many of their advocates explicitly understand them. It is, in essence, to claim that theorists of exercise-freedom are mistaken about the nature of the concept they take exercise-freedom to represent. But this cannot be right, however, for this is a conceptual disagreement, not a normative one. Freedom as an exercise-concept necessarily has the shape its advocates say it does. One can argue, of course, that a given conceptual specification does not pick out anything of relevant significance or that, relatedly, its utility as an analytical tool is limited. In this context, for instance, a critic of the exercise view might maintain that what is picked out by exercise-freedom is not really freedom-related at all. This is, however, a further issue to which I will return in the following. The issue at stake here remains whether exercise-freedom really is conceptualizable in terms of the triadic framework, and this argument cannot be won by simply reinterpreting the nature of the concept of exercise-freedom in different terms.</p>
<p>A reply on Nelson’s behalf might reasonably be raised at this juncture. The deconstruction of the claim ‘if people are free, they will be self-realizing’ does not, in fact, result in seeing freedom <italic>as a means to</italic> self-realization, and, in consequence, failing to take seriously the identification of self-realization with freedom. Rather, it implies that the absence of constraints and the activity of self-realization are <italic>one and the same</italic>. For instance, in so far as an agent is not self-realizing (and, therefore, not free on a given account of exercise-freedom), this is explicable in terms of the constraints on their being so, such as, their failure to be motivated by the pursuit of activities that count as self-realizing ones for them. The absence of those constraints <italic>just is</italic> their pursuing the relevant activities. So, the argument runs, the absence of constraints is not a condition that is external to, and hence merely a means to, freedom in exercise-freedom; it is identical with the state in which the individual in question engages in the activity that is said to mean that they are free. Call this the ‘identity claim’.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Nelson does not explicitly make the identity claim, it is crucial in order to sustain the view that exercise-freedom is conceptually reducible to the triadic framework. It is, however, eminently questionable. In the above, I observed that in order to identify the absence of constraints with self-realization itself, it is necessary to conceptualize things such as ‘a failure to be motivated to engage in worthy pursuits’ as constraints. Is it really plausible, though, to represent such motivational failure as a <italic>constraint</italic> on action?</p>
<p>I suggest that if things such as ‘motivational failure’ cannot count as constraints, then it looks like exercise-freedom can be made to fit the form of the triadic framework only at the cost of abandoning the substance of the framework – that freedom consists in the absence of constraints. Only when something very close to ‘a failure to act’ is represented <italic>as a constraint</italic> can we make the identity claim. The identity claim is, after all, that the absence of the constraint and the presence of activity are <italic>one and the same</italic> (and not merely necessarily consequential on one another). But it just is not plausible to see ‘not doing or acting’ as a <italic>constraint</italic> on doing or acting. Rather, this is simply the state of affairs in which I fail to engage in self-realizing pursuits. In virtue of failing to engage in those pursuits, I lack a kind of freedom, but I lack a kind of freedom simply because I fail to so engage, not, in this case, because I am constrained. As such, the constraint model exemplified by the triadic framework fails to capture freedom conceived as an exercise-concept.</p>
<p>Nelson’s response might take the following form. To be sure, it might be implausible to conceptualize ‘motivational failure’ or simply ‘not doing’ as a constraint, but this is a substantive objection to the exercise view of freedom. Any doubts one has about the plausibility of conceptualizing these things as constraints are, therefore, substantive reasons to reject the <italic>conception</italic> of freedom offered by the exercise view, not doubts about the possibility of conceptualizing exercise-freedom in terms of the triadic framework. In other words, Nelson might well argue, the objection simply rejects the exercise view as a plausible substantive view of freedom.</p>
<p>In fact, the claim here is not a substantive one, it is a conceptual one. The claim is not simply that ‘motivational failure’ and ‘not doing’ are substantively implausible constraints on freedom, it is that to represent these things as constraints in this context is to deprive the concept of constraint of key dimensions of its meaning. In the below, I explain the concept of constraint, show how it is less permissive than Nelson requires, and argue that freedom understood in terms of the absence of constraints (an opportunity-concept) is an essentially ‘static’ concept, whereas freedom as an exercise-concept is an essentially ‘dynamic’ concept. I proceed to show that the triadic framework cannot conceptualize dynamic concepts. This argument is made through the invocation of a further distinction between preventing conditions and precluding conditions. I argue that the identity claim only appears plausible when we conflate precluding conditions and preventing conditions. The failure of the identity claim entails that the triadic framework expresses a static concept that is fundamentally distinct from a dynamic exercise-concept.</p>

<title>Static versus dynamic concepts of liberty</title>
<p>A ‘constraint’ is not a particular thing, but the way in which something functions. It is to describe something in terms of what it does. It is, in this context, to pick something out as bearing a particular kind of relation between an agent and an end. For instance, to say that a fence is a constraint on a given agent is to express something about the function it has, about what it does; namely, that this physical object, in virtue of its physical location and the set of actions or objectives it obstructs, represents a constraint for a given agent or set of agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X12460643">10</xref>
</sup> The concept of constraint is, therefore, an inherently relational one and, indeed, this relation is precisely what is picked out by the triadic framework. The <italic>y</italic> variable picks out the thing that is constraining the agent, <italic>x</italic>, with respect to the end, <italic>z</italic>.</p>
<p>The concept of freedom understood as the absence of constraints, embodied by the triadic framework, is what I will describe as an inherently ‘static’ one. In contrast, freedom understood as an exercise-concept is inherently ‘dynamic’. Static concepts pick out phenomena that do not entail something happening over time. Dynamic concepts pick out phenomena that do entail something happening over time. To illustrate, ‘location’ is a static concept since it picks out a spatial configuration that does not entail something over time, whereas ‘descent’ is a dynamic concept since it picks out a movement from high to low that entails something happening over time.</p>
<p>The triadic framework expresses a static concept because the relationship of ‘constraint’ it picks out does not entail something happening over time. When an agent is constrained from an end, that end is unavailable (or less available) to that agent and the fact of its being unavailable is not, itself, something that entails something happening over time. In contrast, exercise-freedom entails some form of activity, some doing, which entails the performance of an action over time. The phenomenon picked out by the triadic framework is static and, therefore, fundamentally conceptually distinct from the phenomenon picked out by freedom as an exercise-concept, which is dynamic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X12460643">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To clarify this, let us respond to some doubts that might be raised with respect to the validity of this distinction. One might argue, for instance, that the triadic framework is not, in fact, a so-called ‘static’ concept; the fact that the variables of the framework might be filled by dynamic phenomena shows as much. Consider an agent prevented from crossing from one side of a river to the other by the fast-rushing water or an agent who is only able to travel from one island to another by making use of a ferry crossing. In these cases, a dynamic phenomenon represents either the constraint on the agent’s freedom or the process by which the constraint is eliminated, respectively. It ought to be clear, though, that this does not serve to establish that the triadic framework is non-static. For the triadic framework expresses the <italic>relation</italic> between the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> variables. It is this relation that is a static one. Whether any given variable refers to dynamic phenomena is irrelevant. If one waterfall is in the north of a country and the other to the south, the fact that ‘waterfall’ is a dynamic concept does not in any way suggest that their relative location is non-static. The same is true when the end is something dynamic. As we saw in the above, one attempt at reducing exercise-freedom into the terms of the triadic framework sees the removal of constraint as a means to some form of self-realizing activity. Under the triadic framework, though, it is the absence of constraint, rather than the engagement in the activity, in which an agent’s freedom inheres and it is that relation which the triadic concept of freedom picks out that is a static one. When a balloon is tethered to the ground it will float upwards should the tether be cut, yet this does not suggest that the concept of being tethered is dynamic like ‘floating upwards’ is.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X12460643">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A further contestation of the distinction between static and dynamic in this context might be to argue that dynamic concepts are, in fact, reducible to static ones. If this is true, the argument might run, this can be used to support the claim that exercise-freedom is, in some sense, reducible to the static terms of the triadic framework. For instance, the concept of descent (which I have argued is dynamic) itself entails a succession of static states of affairs (the successive positions of the descending object) and is, therefore, reducible to non-dynamic phenomena. To think this is a problem for the conceptual distinction between freedom as a static opportunity-concept and freedom as a dynamic exercise-concept would be a mistake. Even if the <italic>phenomenon</italic> of descent is reducible to static states of affairs, this does not imply that it is conceptually reducible. In other words, the very concept of descent expresses a series of <italic>successive</italic> states of affairs happening over time and is, therefore, non-reducible to static states of affairs. To offer another example, one might argue that a collective is reducible, as a phenomenon, to its individual constitutive members, but this does not in any way suggest that the very concept of a collective is reducible to the concept of the singular, only that the concept of the collective refers to the concept of the singular.</p>
<p>To cast final doubt on the validity of the static–dynamic contrast here, one might argue that it is misleading to characterize the triadic framework as a static concept in virtue of the fact that when we assert the presence or absence of a constraint we are asserting a temporally existent phenomenon which, therefore, happens (that is to say, exists) over time. The contrast between static and dynamic does not, therefore, serve to mark a distinction between the triadic framework and an exercise-freedom. To say that an agent is free from constraint is therefore ordinarily to assert something happening over time; namely, the sustained state of such an agent being free from constraint. If I am free from jail, I am free for the period of time I am not locked away; my freedom entails a period of time and that is a dynamic notion. This is an ingenious, but ultimately flawed objection to the static–dynamic contrast as I use it to distinguish between opportunity- and exercise-freedom. Most obviously, offering an existential proposition that uses a particular concept does not tell us about the nature of the concept itself only that there is an actual instantiation of it. To assert that ‘my car is in the garage’ deploys the concepts of car, location, and garage, but also asserts a temporal occurrence. If anything entails something happening over time, it is this existential assertion, not anything in the concepts themselves.</p>

<sec id="section5-1470594X12460643">
<title>Preventing versus precluding conditions</title>
<p>It could be argued, however, that my claim that the triadic framework embodies a so-called static concept in fact simply begs the question against a broader understanding of the concept of ‘constraint’. For if we take seriously the identity claim, the absence of constraint really is a dynamic phenomenon, given that, under that claim, the absence of all constraints is identical with a state of activity of the relevant sort. If freedom as the absence of constraints is coterminous with freedom as exercise, then the triadic framework is not essentially static.</p>
<p>In fact, my claim that the triadic framework is essentially static does not simply beg the question against the alternative view. For there is good reason to reject the identity claim, and where the identity claim fails so does the argument that the triadic framework can itself conceptualize the claim that an individual’s freedom <italic>consists in</italic> the engagement in a certain kind of activity. The identity claim fails crucially because the concept of constraint is not as capacious as the identity claim requires.</p>
<p>A further distinction will help illustrate this contention. When something functions as a constraint, it functions as a <italic>preventing condition</italic>. Preventing conditions limit the instantiation of subsequent states of affairs. This can be contrasted with <italic>precluding conditions</italic>. Precluding conditions are features of states of affairs that logically prohibit the simultaneous instantiation of others. If I have at most two apples in my basket, this <italic>precludes</italic> my having more than two apples in my basket, but it does not <italic>prevent</italic> me from having more than two apples. If there are no more apples or if the apples that there are sit too far up the apple tree for me to pick, then I am prevented from having more than two apples in my basket. If I am on holiday in France, this precludes my being at home in England, but I am prevented from being at home in England (within some specified time-frame) if I am unable to get on a flight home, for example. It seems obvious that the logical impossibility of my being both in France and in England does not make my being in France a constraint. Similarly, if I am not engaged in self-realizing activity, the logical impossibility of my simultaneously also being engaged in such activity does not make my not being so engaged a constraint. Yet this subsumption of precluding conditions under the category of preventing conditions is precisely what the identity claim needs to sustain it – it involves conceiving of ‘not doing’ (a precluding condition) as a constraint (a preventing condition) on ‘doing’.</p>
<p>In response, one might accept that it would be wrong to confuse precluding conditions and preventing conditions, but argue that to avoid this confusion the triadic framework ought to be specified in terms of both. That is, the triadic framework now reads: <italic>x</italic> (agent) is free from <italic>y</italic> (<italic>preventing or precluding condition</italic>) to do or become <italic>z</italic> (end). This move avoids the erroneous <italic>conceptual subsumption</italic> of precluding conditions under the category of preventing conditions. However, the objection to confusing preventing and precluding conditions is not simply that it is a conceptual confusion to conflate the two, it is that including precluding conditions under the <italic>y</italic> variable deprives the triadic framework of the particular conceptual content its original specification has. For it matters that the <italic>y</italic> variable stands for <italic>constraints</italic> and not something broader; it is precisely this relation of constraint in which the content of the triadic concept of freedom largely inheres and this relation is a fundamentally static one.</p>
<p>The dilemma for the defender of MacCallum is clear, therefore: either hold on to the identity claim and broaden the category of constraint to such an extent that it also covers precluding conditions, thereby depriving the triadic framework of its distinctive content, or relinquish the identity claim and retain the character of the concept of constraint, but thereby identify freedom with the absence of constraints (a static notion), and not with actual engagement in activity (a dynamic notion).</p>

<title>The world as ‘decider’: a unifying theme</title>
<p>The above, therefore, demonstrates that freedom understood as an exercise-concept is conceptually distinct from freedom understood as an opportunity-concept. This alone, however, does not establish the claim that there is more than one concept of <italic>freedom</italic>. For we need to know what is freedom-relevant about the kinds of activity in which freedom is said to consist on the exercise view. Quentin Skinner also notices the necessity of making this case if the claim that freedom is a single triadic concept is to be comprehensively defeated. Skinner argues that in the work of TH Green and Bernard Bosanquet a form of positive freedom is defended that resists the terms of the MacCallum framework: ‘Freedom is not … viewed as absence of constraint on action; it is … viewed as a pattern of action of a certain kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X12460643">Skinner, 2006</xref>: 246). Skinner explains that in the face of this, a defence of the MacCallum view can only argue that the claims found in Green and Bosanquet ‘are not intelligible as claims about liberty; that they must either be muddled or be talking about something else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X12460643">Skinner, 2006</xref>: 247).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X12460643">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The necessity of making the case is all the clearer in virtue of the fact that exercise-freedom is not <italic>obviously</italic> a concept of freedom. While it is eminently intuitive to understand freedom in terms of an opportunity-concept, the same is not necessarily true of exercise-freedom. Why is doing one particular kind of thing or behaving in particular ways to be identified with freedom? In fact, I believe there is a compelling alignment to the exercise- and opportunity-concepts of freedom that explains their common status as concepts of <italic>freedom</italic>. Those concepts are united when we understand freedom as a matter of ‘the self’ rather than ‘the world’ being ‘the decider’ or determining force in the direction the life of the self takes – what it does, chooses, becomes, and the like.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470594X12460643">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To illustrate the unity this theme expresses, it is illuminating to reflect on some of Berlin’s doubts about what he calls ‘The Retreat to the Inner Citadel’ (2002: 180). Berlin suggests that under the self-mastery view, whether something constrains depends on its frustrating the <italic>actual desires</italic> of the agent in question. Only if parts of the world impose on the ends and purposes an agent actually conceives and pursues do they frustrate his or her self-mastery and thereby infringe his or her freedom. However, making constraints a function of the desires they actually frustrate has, for Berlin, severely counterintuitive implications. For it has the paradoxical implication that I can free myself from a constraint by manipulating my desires in such a way that I no longer desire what the constraint prohibits. In Berlin’s terms, by exacting ‘a strategic retreat to an inner citadel’ (2002: 182) I can liberate myself from the constraints the world imposes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X12460643">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To avoid the paradox, Berlin would have it that constraints are constraints even when they prohibit things we do not in fact want, but things we might possibly want. I suggest that we can shed light on the disagreement over whether freedom is inhibited only by the frustration of actual desires (or whether freedom is limited even when our actual desires are not frustrated) by casting the disagreement in terms of whether it is the ‘world’ or the ‘self’ that decides the direction a life takes. Take a prisoner in a locked room who does not desire anything that would require him to leave the room. On the actual desire criterion, the prisoner’s freedom is not limited by the locked door – it does not frustrate his or her actual purposes. Conversely, on the possible desire criterion the presence of the door does limit the prisoner’s freedom – there are any number of actions the prisoner might possibly desire, but could not perform should he or she wish. I suggest this disagreement about the nature of freedom is best understood as being underpinned by a disagreement over whether it is the world or the self that determines the life of the prisoner.</p>
<p>For when the prisoner does not desire to do what the locked door prohibits, in a certain sense the world does not decide or determine what the self does. The parts of the world that prevent what the prisoner does not desire are seemingly irrelevant to what the self does. Alternatively, the possible desire criterion can be interpreted as taking a different view about the role the world plays in deciding what the self does – that there is a sense in which the world does decide the direction of the life of the prisoner in virtue of the fact that it decides, pre-emptively, that <italic>if</italic> a course of action is desired, it is unavailable. The world delimits the possible routes for the self, even if they are routes the self does not desire.</p>
<p>In this context, Christman has a different explanation for the intuition that the prisoner lacks freedom <italic>even when he or she does not desire anything that the locked door prevents</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X12460643">Christman (1991</xref>: 353–4) argues that in prisoner-type cases it is frequently our sense that the prisoner’s desires have <italic>adapted to</italic> the constraints imposed by the world that makes us feel that the prisoner lacks freedom. In other words, we feel that the prisoner lacks freedom even when he or she does not desire to leave the locked room because of a tacit sense that the prisoner has had his or her desires conditioned by the constraints he or she faces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X12460643">16</xref>
</sup> Freedom is, therefore, undermined because the circumstances themselves have forced a narrowing of the agent’s horizons and ambitions. Again, though, this can be interpreted through the lens of understanding freedom as related to the self (as opposed to the world) as a decider. When the prisoner lacks freedom because of adaptive desires, there is a sense in which his or her desires are foisted upon him or her by the restrictive circumstances that he or she faces. This is in contrast with a process of self-reflective character development in which the self in some sense decides or determines the set of desires and purposes to be pursued.</p>
<p>Exercise-freedom can be understood in a way that is very closely related to, if not essentially involved with, this kind of self-reflection. It involves the self reflecting upon the beliefs and desires one has and, in doing so, the self standing as a kind of arbiter over what those beliefs and desires ought to be.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X12460643">17</xref>
</sup> Being the arbiter in the sense that I intend might involve, for instance, deliberating over whether the standards of evidence justify holding the beliefs one holds or casting and questioning a given normative conviction one holds against a broader evaluative perspective one adopts. It is for the individual, as Lawrence Haworth puts it, to exercise the capacity to ‘subject their ends to critical appraisal in the light of one’s beliefs and values, future preferences one expects to have, and desires one has about the future’ (1986: 39). When an individual employs his or her rational capacities in reflection on the constitution of the self, the individual is the governor of the self in a way in which absent that reflection he or she is not. It is to be the court through which some defining elements of the self (one’s beliefs, desires, purposes, and so on) must pass. Without any form of self-reflection of this sort, the individual is, in a manner of speaking, a pure recipient of his or her beliefs and desires. In contrast, by engaging in a kind of self-reflection that exercises control over the constitution of the self, the self has a kind of input regarding who the individual is and how that individual’s life goes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X12460643">18</xref>
</sup> Indeed, this thread is very definitely present in Berlin’s own presentation of the positive view. When I am free in the positive sense, I am ‘a doer – <italic>deciding, not being decided for</italic>, self-directed and not acted upon by external nature or by other men as if I were a thing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12460643">Berlin, 2002</xref>: 178, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Now, to be sure, the particular details of a given form of exercise-freedom are a substantive matter, and the question here is primarily a conceptual one. However, sketching the contours of a candidate and plausible such conception illustrates how exercise-freedom shares with opportunity-freedom the quality of being concerned with the sense in which the self rather than the world is the decider of the way the life of an agent goes. On the opportunity side, the possibility of the self being the decider of the life of an agent can be restricted or hemmed in by features of the world that foreclose certain avenues and actions; the impetus of the self being thereby stifled or limited. But even absent those constraints, there is a question about whether the life is <italic>positively governed</italic> by the self through reflective arbitration of the kinds of beliefs to hold or desires to pursue. Where the self is passive rather than active in this regard, there is a greater sense in which the world decides the direction of the agent’s life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470594X12460643">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This unifying theme allows us to explain, therefore, why exercise views may be fittingly designated ‘freedom’, rather than an alternative label. It offers a reply, for instance, to challenges such as that of Matthew Kramer, who questions the ‘illuminatingness and sharpness’ of ‘freedom’ understood as a positive category, arguing that ‘the sundry versions of the positive-liberty ideal will warrant application of a variety of terms … “self-fulfilment”, “self-realization”, “self-expression”, “self-mastery”, “autonomy”, “self-reliance”, “self-control”, “self-determination”, “self-development”, “flourishing”, “self-direction”, “political participation”, and “active citizenship”’ (2003: 95–6). Each of these terms, Kramer argues, will typically represent a more accurate and appropriate designation of the phenomenon and ‘not only will little or nothing be lost if the positive uses of “freedom” and “liberty” are eschewed, but in addition an avoidance of those terms as designations for the positive-liberty theorists’ objectives will promote analytical precision’ (2003: 96). No doubt one way of enhancing analytical precision is via the proliferation of concepts and terms to individuate and to demarcate separately normatively distinct phenomena. However, precision is but one dimension of conceptual utility, and the rationale for drawing the conceptual distinction between positive and negative views in a way that retains a mutual connection with ‘freedom’ is that it is desirable precisely because both such views are jointly implicated in this overarching idea that it matters whether it is the self rather than the world that decides the direction of the course of an agent’s life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470594X12460643">
<title>Conclusion: positive and negative; exercise and opportunity</title>
<p>The foregoing demonstrates that there is a conceptual distinction between types of freedom. While the triadic framework is an eminently plausible analysis of an opportunity-concept of freedom, there is a basically distinct way of conceptualizing freedom in which freedom consists in a certain kind of activity: exercise-freedom. The article makes the case not only that the dynamic concept of exercise-freedom is structurally distinct from the static opportunity-concept, but also that the former is appropriately conceived of as a concept of <italic>freedom</italic> in virtue of a common theme of freedom understood as the self, as opposed to the world, as a decider. Drawing a conceptual distinction between the opportunity and exercise concepts in this way, therefore, also highlights the sense in which the latter reflects a way of understanding freedom that requires a positive impetus by the self. Exercise-freedom requires action and activity. A lack of exercise-freedom is, therefore, not reducible to the constraints on freedom an agent faces, but entails the agent himself or herself taking some form of control of his or her own life. The conceptual division, therefore, helps us to identify an intimate relation between freedom and responsibility that obtains in this distinctive exercise understanding.</p>
<p>Questions remain, however, regarding the terminology with which it is most appropriate to express all this. Should we see exercise-freedom as coterminous with positive freedom or as a subcategory to that more general set of views? Should we see negative freedom and the opportunity-concept as one and the same? Indeed, as MacCallum himself shows, many positive-type freedom claims about <italic>internal</italic> constraints on the self operate with (or at least are comprehensible under) what I have labelled an ‘opportunity-concept’. But if the appropriate conceptual distinction is, as I have argued, between exercise and opportunity, then aligning the positive and negative categories with these implies regrouping what were historically considered positive claims alongside negative ones. Indeed, this is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460643">Nelson (2005</xref>: 58) claims when he argues that the <italic>negative</italic> view is essentially about the absence of constraint. The worry might be, however, that the communicative utility of the distinction between kinds of freedom is limited by this strategy that revises the conceptual categories away from their historical counterparts.</p>
<p>Aside from such potential problems involved in reinterpreting the way in which positive and negative views ought to be categorized, retaining both of these cross-cutting distinctions might nevertheless be useful, provided they are understood in different lights. On the one hand, as the article argues, we have the <italic>conceptual</italic> distinction between opportunity- and exercise-freedom; on the other, we have the categories of positive and negative freedom which reflect different <italic>groups or families of conceptions</italic>. But why, apart from this connection with the history of how the labels have been used, should we leave the positive and negative groupings intact if they do not reflect the <italic>conceptual</italic> distinction of importance? One reason that commends doing so comes with the fact that negative and positive freedom reflect importantly different domains of freedom – external and internal, respectively. This is significant partly because the character of a constraint is an important determinant of what others are responsible for in respect of its creation or the alleviation of it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X12460643">20</xref>
</sup> In other words, there might be general features of internal constraints that bear on what, in respect of such constraints, we owe to one another. It might be, for instance, that because the removal of internal constraints is characteristically only achieved through action on the part of the constrained agent themselves (as some of the views discussed above seem to hold), others lack responsibility for facilitating their removal (or even have a responsibility not to attempt to facilitate their removal). While there is not space here for an in-depth discussion of the detail of these doubtlessly complex issues, it is worth noticing that the conceptual distinction for which I have argued is only one factor when it comes to deciding which ways of grouping conceptions of freedom are useful ones. Of course, as the article substantiates above, whichever set of labels are best to capture it, liberty is at least two concepts, not one.</p>

<p>In the course of further exploration of the nature of these respective concepts of liberty, Berlin explains how the negative concept concerns ‘the area in which a man can act unobstructed by others’ (2002: 169) and that I lack freedom in this sense only if I am ‘prevented from attaining a goal by human beings’ (2002: 169).

<p>A similar, and explicit, rejection of the MacCallum view is mounted by Quentin Skinner, who argues that the relevant notion of positive freedom he has in mind is such that ‘the freedom of human agents consists in their having succeeded in realising an ideal of themselves … this is not to speak of a condition in which someone is free to do or become something.</p>

<p>Indeed, Skinner himself explains how one of Berlin’s initial attempts at expressing the distinctive character of positive freedom is subject to just this kind of interpretation. He notices that Berlin’s first formulation of the notion of self-mastery refers to the thought that ‘the <italic>obstacles</italic> to your capacity to act freely may be internal rather than external, and that you will need to free yourself from these psychological <italic>constraints</italic> if you are to behave autonomously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X12460643">Skinner, 2006</xref>: 244, emphasis added).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the argument here is not that there are <italic>precisely</italic> two concepts of freedom, but that freedom ought to be understood in terms of <italic>at least</italic> two concepts. Nothing I argue for here rules out the possibility of further conceptually distinct ways of understanding freedom.</p>

<p>Indeed, MacCallum offers a comment in defence of his own analysis that would seem to support my own contention here. MacCallum parodies the view that manipulating the variables of the triadic framework changes the very concept of freedom it expresses, suggesting that ‘one might as well say that the shift from “The apple is to the left of the orange” to “The seeds of the apple are to the left of the seeds of the orange” changes what “to the left of” means’ (2006: 113). The static nature of the relation picked out by the triadic framework remains unchanged by the inclusion of dynamic variables.</p>

<p>While Skinner correctly identifies the challenge for the positive or exercise theorist, his justification of the freedom character of the account of positive freedom is, in my view, unsatisfactory. Citing Berlin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X12460643">Skinner (2006</xref>: 247) argues that the Neo-Hegelians justifiably took their thesis to be one about human freedom because only by actually following a fulfilling way of life do we overcome the constraints and obstacles to the realization of our full potential. However, this gives the impression that positive freedom lays claim to the label of freedom only by association, rather than because of some quality it possesses itself. That is, only by being intimately bound up with, and connected to, what is <italic>truly freedom</italic> (freedom from constraints) is the impression given that self-realizing is an activity with a freedom character itself.</p>

<p>As Berlin famously insists, ‘it is as if I were to say: “I have a wound in my leg. There are two methods of freeing myself from pain. One is to heal the wound. But if the cure is too difficult or uncertain, there is another method. I can get rid of the wound by cutting off my leg. If I train myself to want nothing to which the possession of my leg is indispensible, I shall not feel the lack of it”’ (2002: 182).</p>

<p>Incidentally, Christman also argues that because many of the actions that are limited by circumstances such as being locked in a room are fundamental to human flourishing this makes it difficult to suspend the sense that the prisoner does, at least on some level, desire the actions that the circumstances frustrate. Therefore, our sense that the prisoner lacks freedom depends on an implicit sense that the barriers that the prisoner faces obstruct the actual desires that he or she has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X12460643">Christman, 1991</xref>: 354).</p>

<p>This does not imply the possibility of a kind of ‘radical choice’ by the self with respect to what is desired or believed. Indeed, the possibility that we might ‘simply decide’ that something is worthy of epistemic affirmation or evaluative endorsement is probably incoherent.</p>

<p>It is a further merit of this theme of freedom as related to the self as a decider that it offers an intuitive interpretation of Phillip Pettit’s claims about freedom as non-domination (an understanding of freedom that Pettit himself takes to be conceptually distinct from both the positive and negative views) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12460643">Pettit, 1997</xref>). Under freedom as non-domination an individual is free (and non-dominated) to the extent that others do not have the <italic>capacity to interfere in his or her affairs on an arbitrary basis</italic>. This is continuous with seeing the family of concepts of freedom (however large that family is) as being tied together by an understanding of the self versus the world as decider. For under non-domination there is a sense in which the agent who has the capacity to interfere arbitrarily in the life of another plays a deciding role in the direction of the life of the individual over whom such an agent dominates. In a real sense, the direction a dominated individual’s life takes is decided by something outside that dominated individual’s self – another’s will.</p>

<p>The connection between freedom and who has the responsibility for creating or removing a constraint chimes with the theme of an essay by David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X12460643">Miller (2006</xref>). There Miller argues that constraints on freedom should be identified as those for whose existence other agents are morally responsible.</p>
