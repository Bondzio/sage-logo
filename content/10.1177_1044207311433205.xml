<abstract>
<p>Providing personal assistance services (PAS) in the workplace (WPAS) is one approach to support the employment of individuals with disabilities. This descriptive study examined the implementation of Medicaid WPAS by collecting and analyzing telephone interview data from key informants selected from county and public authority officials in California in 2010. The results showed that less than a fraction of 1% of individuals with disabilities who used Medicaid personal care services used the services at work. The barriers to using WPAS included lack of consumer knowledge about the Medicaid buy-in program and about WPAS, lack of additional hours allocated for WPAS, lack of WPAS arrangements for intermittent services and transportation, negative attitudes of PAS staff, and uncertainty regarding PAS budget cuts. Policy recommendations include improving information about the buy-in program and WPAS, collecting WPAS information about client interest in working, establishing a WPAS client tracking system, increasing hours to cover PAS at work, addressing negative PAS staff attitudes, and increasing the flexibility of PAS hours and services.</p>

<body>
<p>Individuals with disabilities represent only a small proportion of the total workforce in the United States (about 3.4% in 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311433205">Kaye, 2010</xref>). The rate of employment of those individuals with disabilities declined from 32% at the beginning of the 2007 recession to 29% nationally in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311433205">Kaye, 2010</xref>). Although many individuals with disabilities would like to work, there are numerous barriers preventing work, such as lack of awareness about disability and accommodation issues, concerns over costs, and fear of legal liability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison, Glazier, O’Connell, Norton, &amp; Himmelstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311433205">Kaye, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311433205">Stoddard, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To support the employment of people with disabilities, the federal Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA) of 1999 was passed to fund states to establish Medicaid Infrastructure Grants (MIG). Designed to remove barriers to employment, increase their rates of employment, and support their economic self-sufficiency, the MIG programs were allowed to establish optional state Medicaid buy-in programs. The state buy-in programs allowed employed persons with a disability who earn less than 250% of the Federal Poverty Level to pay a premium to receive state Medicaid services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207311433205">Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311433205">Croake &amp; Liu, 2009</xref>). Each state sets its own income and resource limits and premiums for coverage.</p>
<p>In response to the federal MIG program, California, like many other states, passed legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311433205">California Working Disabled Program, 1999</xref>) to establish a Medicaid buy-in option for qualifying employed individuals with disabilities (for those with limited assets at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level). Enrollment in the California Working Disabled program was lower than the initial estimates of 6,835 in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207311433205">California Department of Health Services, 1999</xref>), and actual enrollment reached only 5,229 individuals in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207311433205">Bell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A condition of the federal MIG program was that states must provide personal assistance services (PAS) inside and outside of the home to the extent necessary to enable a person to maintain competitive employment. PAS is defined as help with activities of daily living (ADLs; e.g., bathing, dressing, eating, or toileting) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; e.g., shopping, finances, and medication management). PAS at work (called WPAS in this article) may help to increase employment among people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311433205">Stoddard, 2006</xref>) and improve quality of life among individuals with certain disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311433205">Dowler, Solovieva, &amp; Walls, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207311433205">Webb, Wrigley, Yoels, &amp; Fine, 1995</xref>). WPAS includes help of a personal nature such as eating, toileting, and taking medications at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207311433205">Coble-Temple, Mona, &amp; Bleecker, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>WPAS needs to be distinguished from task-related assistance for carrying out job tasks (e.g., filing, turning pages, or retrieving work materials), which is generally considered to be the responsibility of employers to make reasonable accommodations to assist employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207311433205">Silverstein, 2003</xref>). Moreover, WPAS generally does not include job coaching, which provides guidance on work skills and behaviors often paid for by state vocational rehabilitation agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1044207311433205">
<title>The California Personal Care Services Program</title>
<p>To implement the state’s Medicaid buy-in program, the California Workforce Inclusion Act was passed in 2002 to allow individuals in the Medicaid buy-in program to use services from the state optional Medicaid personal care services (PAS) program (called In-Home Supportive Services [IHSS]) if they needed and qualified for the PAS program. The legislation specifically allowed individuals to use some of their approved PAS monthly hours in the workplace, although PAS users were not given any additional hours for WPAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207311433205">California Department of Social Services, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The California PAS program provided services to about 430,000 participants using 376,000 caregivers in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207311433205">Taylor, 2010</xref>). The PAS program is administered by each county, which is responsible for the determination of program eligibility, conducting client assessment of need, authorizing hours of services, and program implementation. The counties are responsible for reviewing caseloads and monitoring quality. They maintain a data tracking system known as the Case Management, Information, and Payroll System (CMIPS). The counties also set the consumer share-of-cost, handle consumer appeals, and provide conflict resolution between providers and consumers.</p>
<p>Because most PAS providers in California are independent and do not work for an agency, each county is required to have an employer of record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207311433205">California Assembly Bill, 1682</xref>). To meet this mandate, most counties established either a public authority or nonprofit consortium. Currently, 54 of the 58 California counties use the public authority model, which assists with the administrative functions of the program. Public authorities serve as the employer of record for wage and benefit negotiations with unions, maintain a provider registry to help those consumers who need help finding a provider, and provide home care provider and consumer training.</p>
<p>Annual individual needs assessments are conducted by county caseworkers who determine eligibility for the PAS program and approve the authorization of PAS hours per month. It is then at the consumer’s discretion if he or she wants to use some of those hours to obtain, retain, or return to work. California uses an eligibility assessment for PAS applications called the Functional Index Score (FIS) to measure the level of need, ranging from 1 to 5, with a higher ranking reflecting an increased need for assistance with tasks for ADLs or IADLs. The rankings for each task are averaged, resulting in an overall FIS score from 1 to 5, with a lower average reflecting less need for assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311433205">California Department of Social Services, 2009</xref>, October 1). The score is used to determine the amount and type of hours of personal care services each individual is authorized to receive. The assessment form does not include questions about client interest in working or the ability to work with support.</p>
<p>The 2009–2010 California budget changed the eligibility requirements for the PAS program. Those PAS recipients with a FIS below 4 but greater than or equal to 2 would lose all domestic and related service hours, and those with a score less than 2 would have their PAS services eliminated entirely. Consumers with the highest need in terms of hours, or those with a FIS of 4 or higher, would not have their service hours cut. In addition, the 2009–2010 budget approved the following: (a) new PAS provider background checks, enrollment, and orientation and (b) reduced county PAS budgets and staff positions. In 2009, a court injunction blocked the implementation of the 2009–2010 budget language that proposed service cuts based on changes in the need criteria (i.e., FIS scores) and wage changes, but the requirements for criminal background checks and other quality assurance measures did go into effect.</p>
<p>Although California has the nation’s largest PAS program, little is known about the extent of WPAS utilization by those enrolled in the California Working Disabled program. One study of 1,507 working-age Californians with disabilities found that only 4.5% reported using assistive technology at work, including WPAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207311433205">Yeager, Kaye, Reed, &amp; Doe, 2006</xref>). This study was designed to address this gap in knowledge. Because the California PAS program is operated largely at the county level, this study was focused on officials who were administering either the public authorities or county program directors. This study of WPAS occurred at a time of program and budget uncertainty related to the state’s fiscal crisis.</p>
<sec id="section2-1044207311433205">
<title>Aims of the Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the use of and barriers to Medicaid WPAS. California was selected for study because it has a large Medicaid program that offers PAS to be used in the workplace. The study collected and analyzed information from a telephone survey of 24 selected key informants who were public officials responsible for managing PAS programs located in 20 counties in 2010. Specifically, the aims of the study were to describe (a) staff knowledge of WPAS policies, (b) the number of individuals using WPAS in counties, (c) barriers to the use of WPAS, and (d) program and budget changes that may affect WPAS users.</p>

<sec id="section4-1044207311433205">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A convenience sample of key informants was selected from PAS county and public authority officials to conduct interviews between December 2009 and February 2010. Using a listing of the 58 county program managers and 54 public authority executive directors, 39 individuals were selected to represent a broad geographic distribution throughout the state in both urban and rural counties. Email, letter, and telephone contacts were made with individuals from both groups to request interviews and obtain informed consent.</p>
<p>Of the 39 key informants identified for the study, 24 agreed to participate (61% response rate). Those that declined to participate generally indicated that they were too busy with implementing the 2009–2010 PAS budget and program changes. Of the 24 key informants, 9 were executive directors of a public authority, 1 was a former program manager at a public authority, and the remaining 14 key informants were either program/division managers or supervisors overseeing a county’s PAS program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1044207311433205">
<title>Interview Guides</title>
<p>The key informants represented 20 counties from all parts of the state and were of all sizes, ranging from the largest county in the state (Los Angeles County), the San Francisco bay area counties, and the fourth smallest county in the state (Mono County). The 20 counties in the survey offered PAS programs that covered about 75% of the total California PAS enrollment (430,000 individuals in 2009). The interview guide was developed by the research team based on a review of the literature on PAS in the workforce, reports on the PAS program in California, discussions with the project officer for the funding agency, and informal discussions with PAS officials in California. Researchers pilot-tested the interview guide that was developed with two Public Authority officials. No major changes were suggested.</p>
<p>The final interview guide consisted of semistructured questions regarding PAS service provision allowing for open-ended responses by the key informants. The guide included the following categories of questions: (a) staff knowledge of workplace policies, (b) information on the number of individuals who used PAS in the workplace, (c) barriers to the use of WPAS, and (d) the state’s 2010 budget and policy changes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1044207311433205">Table 1</xref>). In addition, background information on the informant was collected.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The interviews were conducted by three researchers with the average telephone interview being 30 to 45 minutes long. Researchers were experienced in qualitative data collection and had previous experience conducting telephone interviews. Researchers read the questions verbatim from the Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved interview guide. During the interviews, researchers took detailed written notes on each respondent’s answers. They also asked additional IRB-approved probing questions about experiences related to the interview questions. Additional observations and feedback were also noted.</p>
<p>Each researcher transcribed his or her notes immediately after the interview was completed to ensure accuracy. In some instances, key informants sent additional information in follow-up emails (e.g., the estimated number of consumers expected to lose services if the service cuts went into effect). After all interviews were completed, they were coded independently by two researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1044207311433205">
<title>Coding and Analysis</title>
<p>Before the thematic coding of the data was started, interview notes were initially grouped into two main categories based on the respondent’s affiliation: public authority or PAS program county officials. Initial codes were created by looking at the salient themes that emerged by question. Both researchers followed this same process, noting any different codes identified between them. With further discussion, coding was further refined and agreed on by the two researchers. The resulting codes identified the themes that were present in most of the interviews.</p>
<p>Data on barriers were grouped into the following topical areas: “consumer knowledge about the Medicaid buy-in program,” “lack of consumer awareness about the WPAS program,” “no additional hours provided for WPAS,” “intermittent services needs,” “transportation issues,” “negative staff attitudes about WPAS,” and “uncertainty regarding the budget and state policies.” No differences were found in the types of responses between the public authority and county official respondents so the findings from the two respondent groups were combined. The following results are presented by topic categories.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-1044207311433205">
<title>PAS Staff Knowledge of Workplace Policies</title>
<p>Almost two thirds of all key informants (15 out of 24) said they were familiar with the PAS policies regarding use of authorized hours in the workplace, and 1 respondent personally used WPAS. The remaining 9 key informants stated they had either little or no knowledge of the provision of WPAS hours. Of those officials who reported having little or no knowledge about the provision of PAS hours in the workplace, most believed their staff knew that consumers could use their authorized PAS hour in the workplace.</p>
<p>When asked how the key informants became aware of the provision of WPAS, seven informants cited a 2004 letter sent by the state administering agency, the California Department of Social Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207311433205">California All County Letter No. 04-43, 2004</xref>). Three key informants said they were aware via other materials or regulations sent by the state, three became familiar through a training or presentation, and two cited the legislation that established the Workforce Inclusion Act of 2002. Two key informants heard about the provision of WPAS through the state association of public authorities, and one key informant became aware of the provision from participation in this study. The remaining six could not recall how they became aware of the provision of WPAS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1044207311433205">
<title>PAS Users in the Workplace</title>
<p>California does not mandate standardized state or county-level reporting of the number of individuals who use WPAS. Most key informants interviewed reported that data on the numbers of consumers using WPAS were not systematically tracked by their agency. Only two counties had a computerized tracking system for WPAS. The most common reason key informants gave for not collecting information was that their county had few consumers using WPAS.</p>
<p>The majority of the key informants provided an estimate of WPAS users, with only two key informants unable to provide information. Of the 20 counties with estimated data, 8 counties reported no consumers using WPAS. Another 9 counties reported between 1 and 10 individuals using WPAS. Finally, 1 county (Orange) reported about 40 individuals and the largest county (Los Angeles) reported 110 individuals using WPAS. Overall, there were an estimated 190 WPAS users out of 330,144 PAS users in the 20 counties in 2010. Thus, less than a fraction of 1% (about 0.05) of PAS users used PAS at work in the 20 counties surveyed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1044207311433205">
<title>Barriers to PAS Use in the Workplace</title>
<p>Key informants identified six major types of barriers to using WPAS in California. These are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section12-1044207311433205">
<title>Lack of consumer knowledge about the Medicaid buy-in program</title>
<p>Some key informants reported that many PAS consumers did not have an adequate understanding and knowledge of the Medicaid buy-in program, and they specifically lacked information about the program’s income eligibility requirements and benefits. For example, to remain eligible for MediCal benefits, they did not believe that consumers knew they could enroll in the buy-in program if their income is equal to or less than 250% of the Federal Poverty Level. Individuals who used PAS often believed that when a person was working, he or she would become ineligible for Medicaid benefits, so they do not pursue employment. Key informants believed that the buy-in program has not been adequately publicized and explained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1044207311433205">
<title>Lack of consumer awareness about the WPAS program</title>
<p>When asked whether PAS consumers are aware of the ability to use their PAS hours in the workplace, only 7 out of 24 key informants believed they were. These 7 key informants thought that young, working-age, and self-directed individuals were the ones most likely to be aware of the ability to use PAS hours in the workplace. The remaining 17 key informants doubted that consumers were aware of the ability to use WPAS because of a lack of publicity, outreach, materials, and knowledge about WPAS in general.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1044207311433205">
<title>No additional hours provided for WPAS</title>
<p>Some key informants reported that a key barrier to using PAS hours at work was the state law requirement that WPAS hours can only come out of the total number of hours approved for care at home, with no additional hours authorized for assistance at work. In other words, allocated hours for use in the home have to be reallocated for work. A respondent stated,<disp-quote>
<p>If you have only 283 of PAS per month and you use them all and still have unmet needs, you cannot go over those 283 hours and ask for additional hours for PAS at the workplace. PAS at work can only occur if hours used at home are exchanged for hours used at work. There are no additional hours above and beyond the monthly maximum that are given for work PAS and of course there is the cap on the number of monthly hours.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several key informants felt that the time allocations for specific caregiving tasks are also too restrictive to allow for care in the workplace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1044207311433205">
<title>Intermittent service needs not accommodated</title>
<p>As PAS hours are based on the specific time for each task performed by a PAS provider, consumers who use WPAS generally only require help with intermittent tasks throughout the workday (e.g., toileting). Thus, providers would not be paid unless actually performing tasks, making it difficult for a consumer to find a PAS provider willing to work in increments of less than an hour. Unless the provider could also care for other PAS users at a geographical location or workplace, it generally was not be feasible to have a provider available for intermittent needs at work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1044207311433205">
<title>Lack of payment for worker transportation</title>
<p>Nine of the 24 key informants reported that a lack of payment for provider transportation was a barrier to using PAS hours at work. Due to the fact that the current PAS regulations do not cover the time and costs of a provider traveling to and from a consumer’s home or workplace, many felt that consumers did not pursue using WPAS. This barrier is illustrated by the following quote from a respondent:<disp-quote>
<p>For those requiring assistance at work, for example with eating at lunch and toileting, the provider cannot get paid for driving or gas to get to the workplace. Since there are no provisions in the PAS regulations to cover the costs of traveling to the workplace to provide this assistance, it is not cost-effective for the caregivers to provide such care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1044207311433205">
<title>Negative PAS staff attitudes about WPAS</title>
<p>Some key informants expressed negative attitudes about the utility and appropriateness of providing WPAS. Some stated that PAS is meant only for the home and to prevent institutionalization. As one respondent said,<disp-quote>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think PAS is appropriate for the workplace. It’s not an adequate workplace support since that support is intermittent. PAS personal care service hours are not intermittent and are supposed to be used in the home to prevent institutionalization.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most key informants stated that the majority of their PAS consumers were not of working age. Others felt that their PAS consumers were either too disabled to work or uninterested in employment. One respondent said, “Many of our other clients are very high needs and may not have the cognitive ability to even understand that they can use their PAS at work, much less work.” Another stated that “most of our clients are home based and not seeking employment, or don’t even think they’re employable, so don’t even consider using PAS at work.” While it was clear that most PAS users are not candidates for employment, negative staff attitudes may interfere with objective assessments of the ability to be employed and a willingness to encourage using PAS outside of the home.</p>

<title>Uncertainty Regarding PAS Budget Cuts</title>
<p>With the adoption of changes in the state’s new level of care criteria, some individuals were expected to lose their eligibility for PASs where the individual’s functional needs for services were lower than the state’s new minimum requirement. The state’s new level of care criteria also set guidelines for hours of service based on their assessment levels. Informants reported that the uncertainty regarding the new level of care criteria and the PAS budget cuts, which were on hold because of court injunctions, had created confusion among county and public authority officials about the future of the overall PAS program. The proposed reductions in eligibility for the PAS program resulted in a conservative approach to eligibility determinations and a lack of staff support for expanding PAS to the workplace.</p>
<p>Informants were also asked to estimate the number of overall PAS users that would decrease with the adoption of new state level of care criteria. The informants reported that they expected on average that about 5% to 15% of PAS users would lose their eligibility for PAS and about 15% to 30% of PAS users would lose some PAS hours although there were wide variations in estimates across counties. Informants were also asked whether the number of WPAS users were expected to decrease with the adoption of new state level of care criteria; 21 of the 24 key informants anticipated no change because their counties currently had either no consumers or very few using WPAS. In the other counties, the policy changes were expected to reduce the use of WPAS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to describe the implementation of WPAS in California by collecting and analyzing telephone interview data from key informants selected from county and public authority officials in California in 2010. Specifically, the study described (a) staff knowledge of WPAS policies, (b) the number of individuals using WPAS in counties, (c) barriers to the use of WPAS, and (d) program and budget changes that may affect WPAS users.</p>
<p>The major finding was that very few individuals used Medicaid WPAS in California 7 years after the passage of legislation that authorized Medicaid PAS for use in the workplace. This finding was consistent with a previous study in California that suggested that many individuals with disabilities make limited use of PAS and assistive technology at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207311433205">Yeager et al., 2006</xref>). Other states, such as Maine, have also reported limited use of Medicaid WPAS by individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207311433205">Salley &amp; Glantz, 2002</xref>). A survey of PAS users in Virginia’s Medicaid program found that 9% of those not working would be able to work if WPAS were made available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311433205">Barrett, 2004</xref>). Perhaps more individuals in California and other states would be able to work if WPAS were made more accessible and available.</p>
<p>Another finding was that California counties did not have tracking systems to identify individuals who needed or used WPAS and therefore accurate information on WPAS was unavailable. If state officials do not consider information on WPAS users to be important enough to track, this sends a message to the PAS staff and users that WPAS is not an important service. A standardized state system for tracking or reporting WPAS use should be considered to provide accurate data on program utilization in different settings and could even be mandated as part of the federal Medicaid buy-in program. In addition to tracking WPAS users, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that adding an employment section to the initial PAS assessment screening is a useful way to identify individuals who plan to or who would like to work. If such information were a part of an assessment and tracking system, it could be used for outreach to help identify potential individuals who could use WPAS.</p>
<p>One of the study’s contributions was to identify some important barriers to access to the Medicaid buy-in program and WPAS in California. Some PAS and county staff had no or limited knowledge of policies regarding the use of PAS hours in the workplace. To address this issue, education and marketing information about the appropriateness and the availability of PAS in the workplace to PAS and county staff would need to be improved.</p>
<p>Another major barrier was the lack of consumer knowledge about the basic Medicaid buy-in program and the WPAS program. Study informants believed that many consumers believe they will lose MediCal coverage (and thus become ineligible for PAS) if they return to work. Increasing the visibility and knowledge of the Medicaid buy-in program concurrent with increasing marketing information about the availability of WPAS is needed to address this information gap.</p>
<p>Another barrier was the limited hours of PAS services available. The California PAS program could also be changed to allow the authorization of extra hours to cover WPAS. This would require a statutory change in the provisions of the California Workforce Inclusion Act which currently only allows previously authorized PAS hours to be used in the workplace. Additional hours and more flexibility regarding usage could provide consumers with the freedom to use their authorized PAS hours how, when, and where they choose, as previous research has also suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another finding was the problem of how to provide intermittent PAS at work, which has not been adequately addressed at the policy level. If more than one PAS user were in a workplace setting, the shared use of PAS would make services more efficient and cost-effective. Paying coworkers to provide assistance at work would be another option to help ensure access to WPAS. The transportation barrier cited in this study and previous ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311433205">Ellison et al., 2010</xref>) could also be addressed by paying for the transportation of PAS workers to and from the home and workplace settings.</p>
<p>Negative attitudes by some PAS program staff also appeared to be an important barrier. Some staff reported that individuals with disabilities using Medicaid PAS cannot or do not want to work, consistent with findings from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311433205">Jee &amp; Menges, 2003</xref>). Other PAS staff reported that PAS should only be provided in “home” settings. Such beliefs are counterproductive to helping people with disabilities start work or return to work and maintain independence.</p>
<p>As several key informants recommended, one way to increase PAS program flexibility is for states like California to implement the federal Cash and Counseling program, which was initially implemented between 1998 and 2000 in 3 states (Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey) and a second set of programs was launched between 2004 and 2009 in 12 states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311433205">Doty, Mahoney, &amp; Sciegaj, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207311433205">Doty, Mahoney, &amp; Simon-Rusinowitz, 2007</xref>). The program allows “budget-authority” to individuals to manage a specific monetary allowance and to employ personal assistants and purchase related services and goods, such as transportation services, rehabilitation services, assistive technologies, and home modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311433205">Doty et al., 2010</xref>). If implemented in California, it would give individuals greater flexibility to use PAS at work and to pay for transportation and related costs.</p>
<p>This study was limited to a small convenience sample of key informants in California. Although the study covered 20 counties that represented about 75% of the PAS program participants in California, it did not include all counties. The study did not interview PAS users who might have provided greater insight into the barriers to using PAS at work. Finally, it cannot be assumed that California is representative of other states.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a need to address the state commitment to helping individuals with disabilities maintain or return to work if they require PAS. The federal government designed a program to provide Medicaid buy-in to encourage individuals with disabilities to return to work and as part of this program, states must offer WPAS. Although the legislation was implemented, adequate program and policy mechanisms to ensure access and to remove barriers to WPAS have clearly not been put in place in California. A more intensive effort is needed in California and possibly in other states to ensure knowledge about the program and to establish access to a viable WPAS with assessment of the need for WPAS, access to adequate WPAS services, and a tracking system to evaluate WPAS. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could provide greater guidance to state PAS programs on the need for flexibility in providing PAS and for increasing hours to meet the specific needs for WPAS. WPAS must be available to those who need such services to be employed.</p>
