<abstract>
<p>Among the Worora-speaking Aboriginal Australian people, in addition to the usual verbal expressions by which classificatory kinship is denoted, and the various contextual behaviors that index such categorial relations, kinship is experienced not only on the body, through a system of gestures, but as well as in the body, that is, through feelings in the musculature: hence kinship – one’s parents, etc. – is as well experienced parenterally. Cross-culturally, the adult human body constitutes what we might term both a diagrammatic model of other, generally macro-social aspects of the experienceable universe of phenomena, and as well a ‘natural’ <italic>origō</italic> or indexical centerpoint from which, in practices and in imaginative representations, a cultural actor can project a connection between the here-and-now and some encompassing social order. The Worora case is interesting precisely as it unites the two in both a topographical and parenteral experience of a system of classificatory kinship, reflexively experienced on and in the body.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1463499613483402" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>My paper is about experiencing kinship not only <italic>on</italic> the body but as well as <italic>in</italic> the body, that is, through feelings in the musculature: hence kinship – one’s parents, etc. – experienced parenterally. The adult human body constitutes what we might term a ‘natural’ – that is, more precisely, culturally ubiquitous – <italic>origō</italic> or indexical centerpoint from which, in various social practices and in recurring imaginative representations, one can project a connection between the here-and-now of experienceable social space-time and some enveloping and perduring social order. Perhaps by virtue of this, the very structure – that is, partonomic compositionality – of the human body becomes an available icon, of one or another specific sort, of such social order. And sometimes, especially in situations of ritual performativity, the body is made or taken to be an indexical icon in-and-on which cosmic forces operate or even from which cosmically effective forces emanate. Let us consider some examples.</p>
<p>First, <italic>indexicality</italic>. While we do not have to engage in naïve Whorfian speculation on the direction of causality involved, we should note that the human body engaged in an interactional utterance-act is the default <italic>origō</italic> in which to locate the intention-bearing social person presumed upon by all systems of verbal deixis. When we say ‘default’, we mean that, in the absence of some special circumstance of deferred or computably relayed transposition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499613483402">Goffmanian (1981 [1979]</xref>: 145) animator of a message over a relevant stretch of discourse, the individual performing it (covering oral, manual, and other such channels of communication), is the spatio-temporal locus-from-which referents are locatable, predicable states-of-affairs are modally projectable, illocutions seem ritually to have been effectuated, etc. Deictics of ‘person’ illustrate this, being ways of identifying a current referent of discourse in relation to the dramatis personae (the relational roles) of the interlocutory event. When the referent can be identified as or as including the sender of the message-fraction, one can use a so-called First Person deictic; when the referent includes both sender and responsible receiver, one uses a so-called Inclusive (First) Person. Given the way one can selectively target such responsibility for interlocutory response, note that the sender of a message can also verbally differentiate the one (or more) individual(s) inhabiting the role of receiver(s) from any co-present audience by communicating about a ‘you’ [referent = receiver(s)/addressee(s)] vs about a ‘he/she/it’ or ‘they’ [referent ≠ sender <italic>or</italic> receiver].</p>
<p>Deictics of ‘location’, also loosely known as ‘demonstratives’, place a referent relationally in respect of the sender of the signaling message-fraction by superimposing on the role structure of the communicative event a radial geometry around the sender-as-<italic>origō</italic>, defining, minimally, two regions: one in which sender is located, a ‘here’ and ‘this/these’ region; the other an elsewhere, ‘there’ and ‘that/those’. ‘This [referent]’ ‘here’ is in the first; ‘that [referent]’ ‘there’ is beyond the first, and thus in the second. Sometimes, as in Latin, there is a quasi-‘here’, an additional positively stipulated region carved out of the otherwise residual ‘there’, indicating a referent in the radial region of the receiver/addressee of the message-fraction. (And for many locational deictics, laminated upon such radial regionalization around the sender-as-<italic>origō</italic> are one or more schemata of directional and/or topographical differentiations, themselves radially conceived with respect to a presumed <italic>origō</italic> of the collective social group of which the sender is a member, such as ‘uphill [<italic>sc</italic>., from where ‘we’ live]’.)</p>
<p>In general, then, whether we are describing simple deixis of ‘person’, of ‘location’, of ‘temporality’ (true Tense systems), or more complex deixis of ‘evidentiality’ (aligning the currently sender-anchored communicative event with a prior epistemic one), whatever is pointed out in-and-by the use of one of these forms is computed with respect to presuming upon the existence and identifiability of the individual in the role of sender in the communicative event, a role we in turn presume to be discoverable in-and-at a particular human body. The adult human body is thus transparently positioned as the very anchor of the communicative life of micro-contextual experience – an indexical mode of reflexive and interactive subjectivity, as writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483402">Benveniste (1971)</xref> pointed out, made possible by the phenomenon of referential and predicational deixis.</p>
<p>Second, <italic>iconicity</italic>. Sometimes, by contrast, the human body becomes a microcosm, iconically founding the very imaginative representations of the macro-context that comprises the cosmic and secular order of what we do experience. Numerous organic metaphors of Western social thought rest on such elaborate iconicity of schematization of social formations, such as when we speak of an officeholder as the ‘head’ of government of a polity, or when we speak of the ‘bowels’ of a corporation; or of agents of espionage as being a licensing authority’s ‘eyes and ears’. There is a kind of functional analogy between the individual’s reflexively experienceable body and an understanding of the functionality of its working parts and those of these collective orders that come into being in social life and are composed of mutually interconnected aggregates of personal role- and status-differentiated individuals.</p>
<p>In the prehistory of Hinduism, the Vedic cosmogonic repartition of society into the three-plus-one <italic>varṇa</italic>s different in their essences and hierarchical position in the social order results from their origins in the cosmic <italic>Ur</italic>-body of Puru⋅a rendered a sacrificial victim by the gods (<italic>Rig Veda</italic> 10.90.11–14). The Brahmins, the priestly estate, originate from the head and mouth of Puru⋅a; the Kśatriyas, the ruling and warrior caste, originate in the chest and arms; the Vaiśyas, the agriculturalists and pastoralists, originate in the abdomen and thighs; and the Śūdras, the non-twice-born estate of laborers, originate in the feet. Note the structural order of which the hierarchical system of social categories is a pictorial, or iconic, representation in moving from head to foot. Observe, too, the regionalization of the body and its association with distinct actions and activity types that are projected as the principles of organismic solidarity in society more generally. Thus, the priestly <italic>varṇa</italic> functions in the sacred knowledge economy as the repositories of texts and as the verbalizers of them in ritual liturgy. The kingly <italic>varṇa</italic> masters and can appropriately brandish the weaponry of protection and conquest, guided, of course, by the wisdom and liturgical skill of the brahmana <italic>varṇa</italic>. The pastoralists control the abundance and wealth derived from the fecund land, for example the cattle (<italic>paśu</italic>-, cognate with the Latin root of <italic><underline>pecu</underline></italic><underline>niary</underline>), and thus in modern Hinduism include merchants and manufacturers. These make up the tripartite ‘twice-born’ estates historically derived from Indo-European society. Thus, the lowliest laborers emergent from Puru⋅a’s feet carry the burden of the other <italic>varṇa</italic>s and work at their behest.</p>
<p>There is, as well, third, a kind of <italic>indexically mediated iconicity</italic> in social spacetime. This results from the very regionalization of the human body constituting an <italic>origō</italic> so as to project a corresponding volumetric envelope into the physical and especially social space around itself that is correspondingly differentiated in social experience, such that spatial differentiation is deployed in constituted norms for interpersonal interaction. As Edward T. Hall long ago noted in his ‘proxemics’ research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499613483402">Hall 1966)</xref>, every society has a normatively gradient set of radially projected zones of exclusion – recall the ego-proximal and ego-distal minimal binary of verbal deixis – around the individual adult human body physically corresponding to particular roles inhabited in different social activities. Interacting persons tend to respect the inviolability of such zones of interpersonal distance, such that moving into the interlocutory other’s zone is itself an illocutionary act that counts as a shift in role relationality. If one thinks of two standing persons, the practical dimension of space is a horizontally measurable distance between them. The different bodily regions may require different degrees of closeness vs distance, as in chaste cross-gender social kissing in standing greetings and leave-takings in our own society, where heads may be in approximation, but mid-sections may not be, or heteronormative but homosocial male-male hugging, strictly upper-body contact, frequently involving only one side of the shoulders and chest.</p>
<p>But note as well that in numerous systems of stratification, the space projected around the body is also differentiated on a vertical dimension, so that the space projected for some distance around a higher-status person’s body (think especially of monarchs and officials near to them) cannot be occupied by anyone of lower status. Hence, the high status person expects that others, inevitably hierarchically lower, will grovel in the projected region vertically at the level of the feet or knees or whatever of one’s exalted personage. Hence, too, the expectation that the lower-ranked individual will always present a body-front orientation in projective social space to the projective body-space of the higher ranked. The illocutionary deployment of body placement in the vertical dimension of projective body-space and of the orientation of the deferential individual’s projective body-space instantiates, in this way, an iconic diagram of position in a kind of conically conceptualized social hierarchy, a lower-ranked person always ‘looking up’, as it were, to the higher-ranked person.</p>
<p>Again, note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483402">Robert Hertz’s (1960 [1909])</xref> famous ‘right’ and ‘left’ for ‘sacred’ and ‘profane’ – as in European heraldry, among countless other ethnographic facts worldwide – and regions ‘in front of’ and ‘behind’ an asymmetrically planar form are defined as projections from the human body as the body participates in and anchors the social space of ritual practice. (Who gets to sit at the right hand of God – or on the host’s right at a dinner party? Erving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499613483402">Goffman (1979 [1976])</xref> noted the standing-behind vs sitting-in-front relationality of gender dyads posing as ‘male’ and ‘female’ in <italic>Gender Advertisements</italic>.) Even the everyday body becomes an anchoring <italic>origō</italic> – a ‘landmark’ as we say in studies of spatiality – for locating objects and other bodies in relation to it, such that locational deixis is a linguistic universal the structuring power of which we carry around with us constantly imposing and reimposing its potential structuring of the universe as we move from communicative situation to communicative situation. The ‘here-and-now’ and its planar and axial projections always happen to be definable by where-and-when the partonomically regionalized communicative body stands, sits, or lies.</p>
<p>But, importantly, there is fourth kind of phenomenon, an <italic>iconically mediated indexicality</italic> of the adult human body, not, then, as a point-source, as an undifferentiated unity, but as an articulated or composed assemblage of iconically experienced parts. The body itself is a complex space, doubly so, in fact, as well as a complex structure of substances or essences. This is true no less for cultures outside that of our own biomedicine as it is for our own biomedically infused or overlain culture. The body is subdivided in every society into what we call ‘body parts’ and ‘bodily regions’, generally labeled. The three-dimensional parts and regions are interrelated through a scheme of partonomy or meronomy, the ‘X is a part/constituent of Y’ kind of relationship that holds in both of the spatial imaginaries of the body. In Western languages/cultures, toe &lt;foot &lt;leg is a transitive partonomy of parts experienced in three-dimensional space, as is finger &lt;hand &lt;arm or nose &lt;face &lt;head; but note that in a reductive one- and two-dimensional surface schematic, they are just three component regions of the respective limbs. Note also the node-and-connector partonomies involving landmarks (like joints) for skeletally anchored or shaped body regions. It is quite complex as a form of cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>Similarly, the internal bodily substances, experienced or imagined as organ-like entities, and as essences, tissue-like constituent principles, are understood to be components of the body in various functional – notwithstanding merely partonomic – relationships. These manifest as cause-and-effect within the envelope of the body itself, such as the notion that blood brings oxygen and glucose to muscle tissue – instances of a local cultural physiology of the components of the functioning body, whether that of our contemporary biological science or someone else’s. Some of these functional relationships are conceptualized as enabling instrumentalities of human powers – faculties manifest in the social individual and its activities of many kinds, such as that an individual’s intention-to-walk animates a foot. The latter especially connect a particular body through a part or system of functionally linked parts – and thus the social individual with which the functional partonomy is associated as <italic>origō</italic> – to its enveloping world, minimally that of other human individuals and beyond to an even more diverse environment of life lived in the universe of beings and other causal phenomena.</p>
<p>Note how these two models of the human body are projected, <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic>, on other fauna (sometimes flora), beings, objects, topography, dot, dot, dot – both where the analogies (and homologies) are obvious, as for many large game mammals, and where they are not, as for example Tarascan pottery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483402">Friedrich 1969</xref>), Northwest Coast house structures faced with sentient faces featuring mouths for entrance and egress, or our riverine ‘mouths’ and caves as ‘bowels’ of the earth. What is of interest is how the partonomic and especially functional organization of an individual adult human body becomes indexically connected as such to the enveloping universe of beings, etc., the indexical connection mediated by the very iconism of partonomic and functional principles.</p>
<p>It is in this respect that the Worora facts are of interest, it seems to me. Wororas, in the ethnographic horizon of late 20th century small-scale Aboriginal Australian society, were organized into a number of moiety-exogamous patriclans who lived, at contact, on and around the coast and offshore islands in the region near the Prince Regent River (<italic>Málaṇḍum</italic>[<italic>a</italic>]) in the Northern Kimberly of Western Australia. I worked among them at Mowanjum Community, outside the town of Derby, to which missionary settlement they had been moved in the 1960s along with people who spoke the related Ngarinjin and Wunambal languages, with whom they had begun intermarrying under missionization. While my work there during 1974 and 1975 centered on language documentation, for which it was funded by the Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies in Canberra (to which grateful thanks), many of the more fascinating phenomena I happened upon involved kinship, which was certainly the armature of cultural belief and practice beyond anything that someone not experienced in such small-scale, ‘classificatory’ kin-based societies can appreciate.</p>
<p>Indeed, every interaction within the community was possible only by virtue of interlocutors’ knowledge of how each is or could be related to the others involved. Everyone manifested a rapid computational ability in making inferences based on what are termed in the kinship literature ‘relative product definitions’ of both egocentrically and sociocentrically reckoned denotations of any individual in relation to any given propositus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499613483402">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, egocentrically, So-and-So’s – for instance, using a masculine given name – ‘mother’s older brother’ (‘<italic>gáranàŋga ŋawà:yanaŋgá:nja</italic>’) must be So-and-So’s <italic>gagá:ya</italic>. For any propositus and any possessive construction expressed in a chain of possessed–possessor iterations of kinterm simplexes, one can compute the kinterm simplex by which propositus’s relation can preferably be denoted. And via a triangulation, if two people can compute a relationship to a common egocentrically reckoned relative, they know how they are related one to another. In such a ‘classificatory’ Omaha-style kinship universe, with [a] a prescriptive marriage rule (second patrilateral cross-cousin marriage, a man prescriptively marrying – in ‘relative product’ terms – FaMoBroSoDau), [b] structural equivalence of the sibling sets (Bro–Si as well as Bro–Bro) in any generation, and [c] equivalence of alternating generations within the patriclan, a small number of kinterm simplexes saturate the entire universe of possibly computable positions in the egocentric grid, recurring, of course, in structurally determinate positions. But more than this egocentric reckoning, there is a generally agreed upon sociocentric or collective reckoning of generalized ideal marital exchange among the patriclans, whereby members of each of the patriclans have a stipulative relationship as wife-givers/wife-takers in a chain of such relationships, whence one’s patriclan membership alone, absent an egocentrically computable common relative, can be used ascriptively to presume upon one’s relationship to someone whose clan membership is known or can be determined.
<fig id="fig1-1463499613483402" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Egocentric and Sociocentric Kin-category Reciprocals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1463499613483402-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>As is, of course, importantly the case in such a small-scale society, the social relations between dyadic pairs of individuals are also saturated with prescriptions and proscriptions according to what kind of kinship dyad maps into, say, the speaker–addressee role relationship. (For almost 200 years now, to be sure, such phenomena have indeed been the very bread-and-butter of what eventually became disciplinary social anthropology.) As is to be expected, then, such mappings from kin categories to interactional roles are indexed by, among other things, the comportment of the individuals in these roles in respect of mutual bodily dispositions – relative bodily placement, orientation, access of zones, etc. – that range from signaling non-interaction for tabooed interactional dyads to signaling intimacy for certain consubstantial as well as connubial ones. Such bodily comportment indexes contribute to a cross-modal behavioral text performing, as it were, dyadic social relations; the text includes as well various verbal prescriptions and proscriptions of address and of verbal register.</p>
<p>Thus, at one extreme, by virtue of a marriage, anyone in the patriclan of the man’s wife’s mother – thus, wife’s mother, her siblings, her father and his siblings, her brother’s children ([m. <italic>gúruma</italic>, [f.] <italic>gurumá:nja</italic>) – is a person with whom social relations are taboo for that husband and his same-generation siblings. The husband et al. ([m.] <italic>wáḷbaya</italic>, [f.] <italic>waḷbayí:nja</italic>) are obligated to avoid direct gaze, touch, etc., to use a special ‘mother-in-law’ lexical register when speaking in their presence, and to deploy certain grammatical tropes of negation when it is necessary to communicate with them as addressees (that is, as tropic ‘not-addressees’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483402">Silverstein 2010</xref>: 348). They are in a ‘<italic>ρámbar</italic>’ relationship one to another, semiotically instantiated by multiple forms of bodily and communicative avoidance. At the opposite extreme, by the within-patriclan alternating generation principle, the classificatory sibling sets of a person’s structural FaFa’s generation and structural SoSo’s generation are all extremely intimate both physically and verbally. The senior such generation are termed ‘older siblings’ ([m.] <italic>ŋawá:ya</italic>, [f.] <italic>ŋawá:nja</italic>), the junior ‘younger siblings’ ([m.] <italic>ŋawmalé:ya</italic>, [f.] <italic>ŋawmalé:nja</italic>), and all of these, whether generational or chronological by birth order, are covered in the terminological reciprocals [m.] <italic>ábi</italic>, [f.] <italic>abí:nja</italic> (‘<italic>Mitupela pρápƏ ábiabi</italic>!’ is the common Kriol (contact English) claim, ‘We two are genuinely ‘<italic>ábi</italic>’ to each other!’, indicating the very closest of relationships within a patriclan. The name of a senior (G<sup>+2</sup>) generation <italic>ábi</italic>, that is classificatory FaFa(Bro) or FaFaSi of some newborn, is passed on, at birth, to an <italic>abi(:nja)</italic> in the junior (G<sup>0</sup>) generation, emphasizing the alternating generational continuity from time immemorial to time immemorial within the patriclan.</p>
<p>Each such possible dyadic relationship thus implies a stereotypic range of mutual bodily orientations and zones of possible contact or of prescribed avoidance of the two poles of role inhabitance, stereotypes that Wororas can formulate as norms. One person’s comportment in or in respect of such a dyad thus comes to index the possibility, under normative expectation, of the corresponding interactional alter.</p>
<p>What was fascinating to discover is that the kinship universe is inscribed both on and in the various stereotypical parts of the body, bespeaking the ‘visceral’ – bodily – indexical connection that people experienced between the regions and parts of their own bodies and various others in society conceived of as classificatory kinspersons. This is structured by an iconic mapping of these regions of the body to categories of the classificatory kinship system via which all human relationship – and even relationship in the wider totemic world of cosmologically potent flora, fauna, and topography – is reckoned. There is a connection of the parts of one’s body to, as it were, the body civic.</p>
<p>One manifestation of this emerged as I was investigating Worora sign language, a whole set of frequently iconic gestures for denoting things and activities, traditionally used when out hunting, during enforced liminal seclusion of initiands, those suffering bereavement, etc. Thus the hand raised with palm away from one’s body and fingertips clustered signals a ‘marsupial cat’, clearly via the <italic>pars pro tota</italic> or synecdoche of its footprints. Similarly, a ‘crocodile’ is denoted by a hand, index finger extended, pulled horizontally across the plane at one’s mouth level, pointing, in effect, to dangerous teeth. Among the signs emerging in such elicitation were an extended finger drawn down in the centerline of the forehead, denoting ‘a man’, and an arm inwardly curved around and upward toward the side of the body, with the cupped hand at the waist, denoting a ‘woman with child’, a pantomime derived from the common mode of carrying infants on the hip. These fairly obvious iconic signs for humans, it turned out, were part of a much more systematic set that I had never before connected to the bodily kinesis accompanying many older people’s conversational discourse about themselves and others.</p>
<p>It turns out that as people talked about others – all, by the conventions of everyone being kin, relatives in some classificatory sense – their bodily kinesis always included various touches of their own bodies, movements of the arms-and-hands to specific places that did not accord with the way we Euro-Americans – even the Euro-Australians I was encountering outside Mowanjum – used their gestural space. The behavior was too widespread among the oldest speakers whom I observed and with whom I worked to be just Geertzian blinks-of-the-arms, as it were, flicking flies or other flying vermin off the body as one talked (which was, to me, a constant necessity).</p>
<p>All this became clear to me when, in eliciting terms for body parts and regions, people sometimes spontaneously associated an additional term from the realm of kinship with it, in a sense metapragmatically ‘glossing’ the normal denotational term for the body part or region with the kinship relation to which it corresponds in a diagrammatic mapping of the parts of the body. Thus, <italic>guḷí:la</italic> ‘shoulder blade’ yielded the ‘gloss’ <italic>gúruma</italic> ‘(Bro)WiMoBro’ [or, equivalently, FaMoBroSoWiBro, etc.] – <italic>gurumá:nja</italic> ‘(Bro)WiMo’, the taboo brother-sister pair whom one must never face nor even communicate with, particularly in cross-sex dyads. Indeed, conceptualized in terms of bodily orientation, the canonically conceptualized position for such dyadic non-relationality is to be facing away from each other, that is, as we say in our English idiom, to be giving each other the ‘cold shoulder’ focused here on the shoulder blade as the bodily landmark. Thus, pointing to one’s own <italic>guḷí:la</italic> is, in effect, referring to a person classified as <italic>gúruma</italic>(<italic>:nja</italic>) with respect to (in the default case) the signer as propositus, the indexical success of the pointing gesture in the kinship realm depending on the association of that body landmark with that category in the kinship universe.</p>
<p>Eliciting the word <italic>ŋámugu</italic> ‘breast’ similarly spontaneously yielded the explanations ‘<italic>wáρagu ŋàrganaŋga</italic>’ ‘our [excl.] son’, said on behalf of a brother-sister sister-sister dyad, and also, explanatorily, ‘<italic>wáŋalaŋ</italic>’ ‘very young child’ as a life-cycle stage, the very one where such a young child would still be suckled at its mother’s breast. (The more formal terms are <italic>ibá:ya</italic>/<italic>ibá:nja</italic> ‘♀So/Dau’; see below.) The breast of the mother of such a child is, then, the body part that focally is in contact with a suckling child, and thus comes indexically to project into the kinship category of <italic>wáρagu</italic>(<italic>nja</italic>) by someone who is in the special reciprocal category of such an individual’s <italic>gará:nja</italic> ‘Mo’. There seems to be a converse projective relationship for <italic>wáρagu</italic>(<italic>nja</italic>) from the perspective of <italic>gagá:ya</italic> ‘MoBro’ in particular, the body region <italic>máṇḍum</italic> ‘belly’ being a man’s projection for his ‘SiSo/Dau’. Here, it would seem, the fact that an individual addressed as ‘<italic>gága</italic>’ [voc.] is always obligated to share whatever he has on demand from a classificatory SiSo/Dau, prototypically food to fill the belly, gives a rationale for this association, one, like that of the Mo to her child, of nurturance. More generally, the inalienably possessed body part term -<italic>málaba</italic> ‘buttock(s)’ is used reciprocally for the relationship between classificatory <italic>gagá:ya</italic> ‘MoBro’ or <italic>gará:nja</italic> ‘Mo(Si)’and <italic>wáρagu</italic>(<italic>nja</italic>) ‘♀So/Dau; SiSo/Da’. This may well rest on the child’s being seated on the lap or similarly oriented at its buttocks to the senior relative, with the generalization to the reciprocal direction of kin reckoning. (In fact, two of my consultants differentiated further between right and left sides of the body, associating the region on the <sc>RIGHT</sc> (<italic>wáρawàḍa</italic>) side as I have just described, but associating the <sc>Left</sc> (<italic>djámawi</italic>) side -<italic>málaba</italic> with the converse sets of <italic>ibá:ya</italic>/<italic>ibá:nja</italic> ‘(Bro)DauSo/Dau’; FaSiSo/Dau’ in relation to <italic>djamá:ya</italic>/<italic>djamá:nja</italic>, the alternating generation ‘MoFa/MoFaSi’ [structural generation G<sup>+2</sup>] and ‘MoBroSo/Dau’ [G<sup>0</sup>] and all similar generationally even-number kinship categorizations within the patriline of the classificatory Mo and MoBro.)</p>
<p>These kinds of kinship associations seem to cluster, interestingly, in the lower regions of the body, freeing up the hands and arms as gestural articulators. The muscle of the calf, inalienably possessed -<italic>wáyama</italic>, is associated with any <italic>ábi</italic>/<italic>abí:nja</italic>, the classificatory alternating generation fraternal/sororal members of one’s patriline/-clan. The knee(cap), inalienably possessed -<italic>lúŋguma</italic>, is associated with the reciprocal relationship of two persons, one being anyone in the patriline of classificatory MoMo(Bro), all <italic>gadjá:ya</italic>/<italic>gadjá:nja</italic> (or ‘<italic>gadjá:djaye</italic>’) and the other being classificatory (Si)DauSo/Dau, frequently called <italic>ibá:ya</italic>/<italic>ibá:nja</italic>, but more carefully distinguished as <italic>bρ´ḍ</italic>/<italic>bρ´ḍnja</italic>. The flanks, at the joint of the hip and thigh, -<italic>waṇḍá:ρu</italic> are associated with the marital dyad, ‘♀Hu/Hu(Si)’ <italic>gulá:ya</italic>/<italic>gulá:nja</italic> and ‘♂Wi’ <italic>maŋgá:nja</italic>. (My consultants who differentiated left and right as noted above, also differentiated <sc>right</sc> side for <italic>gulá:ya</italic> and <sc>left</sc> side for <italic>maŋgá:nja</italic> as well as <italic>gulá:nja</italic>. They did not spontaneously offer the equivalent for any male in the patriline of the classificatory <italic>maŋgá:nja</italic>, however, though all such males across all structural generations are equivalently ‘father-/brother-in-law’ or <italic>wá:ya</italic>, a relationship demanding special verbal behaviors of respect, such as using ‘Third Person Plural’ [= ‘They’; cf. German <italic>Sie</italic>] when addressing a person of this category. Inasmuch as the name of one’s <italic>wá:ya</italic>, too, must never be used, but only a teknonymic allusion through his daughter’s, perhaps it is understandable that no separate bodily region is associated with this ‘wife-giver’ relative. Recall, too, that the wife of any <italic>wá:ya</italic> is, of course, by the logic of the system, a <italic>gurumá:nja</italic>, a taboo <italic>ρámbar</italic> relation associated with the shoulder blade region of the dorsum.)</p>
<p>As I later discovered on a library trip, an earlier student of Worora, the Rev. J.R.B. Love, an Anglican missionary, had published a paper on ‘Worora kinship gestures’ in 1941, from which the accompanying plate is reproduced courtesy of the Hon. Librarian of the Royal Society of South Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1463499613483402">Figure 2</xref>). Observe in <italic>Image 7</italic> the gesture of touching the shoulder blade, gesturally communicating <italic>ρámbar</italic> (the relationship of man [and his sister] to wife’s mother [and her brother]) by touching the <italic>guḷí:la</italic> ‘shoulder blade’. Observe in <italic>Image 2</italic> the gesture of a woman cupping the breast, signaling a woman’s (or man’s sister’s) child. Indeed, the noticeable bodily kinesis I had observed was all a part of an enduring system of reflexive bodily gestural deixis which inscribes some of the most recurrent and importantly terminologized categories of the Worora kinship reckoning system and its modes of interpersonal relationship on the body as terminologically regionalized. Someone in any of the particular dyadic relationships can refer to his or her dyadic counterpart with such a gesture, just as, establishing a referent as a kin-reckoning propositus, one can deictically gesture that individual’s counterpart in the dyadic set. The latter is exceedingly useful when referential taboo makes it impossible to use someone’s name, for example in referring to someone some time after that individual’s death.
<fig id="fig2-1463499613483402" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>J.R.B love's “Kinship Gestures” of Worora Communicators.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1463499613483402-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Given a set of cultural presumptions or stereotypes about kinship-categorially-based interpersonal behaviors, several of the places of gestural deixis illustrated in Love’s photographs can be understood in terms of how bodies of the respective kinspersons come into approximation, as noted above. Such are clearly the gestures in <italic>Images 2</italic> and <italic>7</italic>, as I noted above: giving suckle to a child, and giving ‘the cold shoulder’, as it were, to one’s taboo relative. Similarly, in <italic>Image 6</italic> we have the gesture for <italic>ŋa-waṇḍá:ρu</italic> ‘my thigh-trunk juncture’ which is where, metonymically, a husband-wife [and, by sibling-group logic, husband’s sister and wife’s brother and father] are joined, presumably via the marital couple’s sexual union. (Husbands and wives are joined at the hip, not twins.)</p>
<p>Love is interested in the manual gestures as a substitute for verbally denoting the particular kinsperson, seeing them in the context of Aboriginal sign languages that can be used when silence is necessary, as in hunting, or when the distance between communicators is great and visual signals are more discernible. Thus, unfortunately, he does not name the body parts and regions as well as the kinship terms for which they substitute under such conditions, so it is sometimes impossible to say with certainty that my own field data match precisely as to bodily region, bodily landmark, etc. We can follow Love’s English language descriptions of where the target of the gesture lies on the body.</p>
<p>In <italic>Image 1</italic> is illustrated the gesture for adjacent generation members of a patriline or patriclan, <italic>irá:ya</italic> ‘Fa; (♀Bro)So’ and <italic>bamρá:nja</italic> ‘FaSi; Dau’ Love describes it as ‘bending up the arm and touching the shoulder with the hand’. While my consultants agreed on the shoulder as associated with <italic>irá:ya</italic> a couple distinguished <italic>bamρá:nja</italic> as associated with the upper arm rather than shoulder. Love describes <italic>Image 3</italic>, for classificatory ‘Mo(Bro)’, as ‘placing one hand below the thigh, near the buttock’. But as we have seen, his consultants must have been indicating their -<italic>málaba</italic> ‘bone in buttocks’, rather than the musculature of the dorsal (back or under) aspect of the thigh, their -<italic>malé:ma</italic>. <italic>Image 4</italic> Love describes as a gesture of ‘placing a hand on the lower leg, either shin or calf’, for a classificatory ‘sibling’ <italic>ábi</italic>/<italic>abí:nja</italic>, a male/female member of one’s patriline in an even numbered generation with respect to the propositus; note that the calf, <italic>ŋa-wáyama</italic> (‘my calf’, inalienably possessed), which my Worora friends associated with this kinship status, sounds almost like a pun on the terms for ‘[my] older brother/sister’ <italic>ŋa-wá:-ya</italic>/<italic>ŋa-wá:-nja</italic> (to be distinguished from the non-inalienably possessed term wá:ya ‘WiFa, WiBro’). Love’s <italic>Image 5</italic> is a gesture pointing to the knee for ‘the mother’s-mother and daughter’s-child relationship’; indeed, the -<italic>lúŋguma</italic> ‘knee (cap)’ is spontaneously associated with the <italic>gádja–bρ´ḍa</italic> dyad for anyone in the patriline of the MoMo(Bro). The marital dyad, Love notes in explaining <italic>Image 6</italic>, is denoted ‘by touching one hip’ which, as noted above, should mean one’s <italic>-waṇḍá:ρu</italic> ‘thigh-trunk juncture’. Love says in essence that the <italic>wá:ya</italic> patriline, the patriline of the ‘wife-givers,’ ‘is included in this gesture’, which probably is a function of the fact that a <italic>wá:ya</italic> is referred to via one’s ‘Wi’, a <italic>maŋgá:nja</italic> of the patriline. We have dealt with Love’s <italic>Image 7</italic> for full taboo relationships, but should note here that Love’s <italic>Image 8</italic> illustrates a gesture for which I have no data, but which seems to follow the logic of bodily circumspection that figurates a certain circumspection in social relations. This is the relationship most directly between a classificatory ‘♀HuMo(Bro)–(Si)SoWi’ reciprocally termed [m.] <italic>ŋalindjá:ya</italic>/ [f.] <italic>ŋalindjá:nja</italic>. Love describes this gesture as ‘touching the spine about the region of the kidneys’, i.e. lower down than the body region for the taboo <italic>ρámbar</italic> relationships, and on the same dorsal (away-facing) aspect.</p>
<p>Love’s glosses his <italic>Image 9</italic> ‘placing the hand below the thigh, near the knee’ as a gesture denoting ‘MoFa’, <italic>djamá:ya</italic>. He also states that ‘[a]n alternative is to touch the spine high up, either by reaching the hand over the shoulder, or by reaching up the back’. In my data I have no such association; rather, the -<italic>málaba</italic> ‘buttocks’ seems to be associated indifferently both with the Mo(Bro)–(♂Si)So dyad, as noted above, and with the alternating even-numbered generation relatives in that senior patriline, MoFa(Si), MoBroSo/Dau, termed <italic>djamá:ya</italic>/<italic>djamá:nja</italic> or, in quasi baby-talk, <italic>bába</italic> [voc.]. Perhaps in the interval between Rev. Love’s investigations in the early years of the 20th century and mine, c. 1975, and under very different conditions, this intra-patriline distinction had been lost.</p>
<p>It is useful to consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483402">Love’s observation (1941: 109)</xref> on the use of these ‘kinship gestures’:<disp-quote>
<p>In daily use the gestures accompany the spoken word for the degree of kinship. In introducing a stranger, the one making the introduction will name the relationship that exists between himself or herself and the stranger, and at the same time, make the gesture for that relationship. So, also, in answering a question as to the relationship that exists between a person interrogated, the one answering will name the relationship and, at the same time, make the gesture.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a certain ‘bodily logic’ to the regionalization of these kinship associations. The taboo and otherwise socially constrained relationships are associated with places on the dorsum of the trunk. The marital relations are located near the genitalia. The various relationships of solidarity and nurturance via being born of a woman are on the buttocks and lower limbs, as also that relationship of patriline and -clan solidarity, the classificatory siblings at the lower legs. Supportive intra-patriline father/aunt–(brother’s)child relations are at the shoulder–upper arm region. It was clear to me from observing generationally distinct bodies that at a period somewhat before my own fieldwork, each of these regions was the site of systematic body surface marking in the form of carefully executed cicatrice designs, created as indexes of passage of the person through different phases of the life cycle, maturing into a full set of kinship relationships at both the egocentric and sociocentric planes, and within totemic quasi-kinship orders. It seems quite certain, then, that the kinship associations of body landmarks and regions reflect the various constructive claims that each of the relevant patrilines/-clans has upon one’s person as the center node of a universe of relationships keyed by kin categorization. Put another way, from the polarity of that central person’s body, each region or landmark of the body’s surface such as reviewed here seems to connect the corporeal experience to a social universe.</p>
<p>But inward from them are particular muscular and skeletal structures, known in great anatomical detail not only from the killing and butchering of game – a kangaroo roasted whole bears a remarkable resemblance to a human corpse – but from numerous traditional practices involving the flesh and skeleton of the human body. The consciousness of one’s own bodily interior, interestingly, is experienced not only through the diagrammatic iconicity of regionalization such as we have been reviewing, but mediated by it, through the indexicality of bodily connection to the classificatory universe of one’s kinspersons. From time to time the kinship universe seems to be sending bodily signals not about the individual experiencing them but about others. One becomes aware of out-of-the-ordinary qualitative feelings monitored on the inside – tingling, cramp, throbbing, shooting or dull pain, etc. For the older Wororas with whom I worked, such feelings were indexes of something going on in the way of the particular classificatory kinsperson associated with this region by the deictic system of kinship gestures. A cramp in my right calf must mean some distress for my classificatory brother; on the left a classificatory sister. Shoulder pain – my <italic>irá:ya</italic> or <italic>bamρá:nja</italic> ‘Fa or FaSi/♂So or Da (or ♀BroSo or Da)’ must be into something bad. ‘<italic>Úmbara gulù:ygulú:y ŋànuŋ</italic>’ ‘hip-joint twitching-twitching I’ve-got’: alerting me to some uneasy plight of my Hu or Wi (note the body-part association as described above). <italic>Yàwuḷyáwuḷ ŋanùŋ</italic> ‘I’ve got tingling’: ‘might be some fella come out now’, i.e. a person of the relevant classification should soon appear.</p>
<p>People interrupted conversation with me as well as with others to remark on these momentary indexical <italic>body amulets</italic>, as we might term them for their communicatively channeling the forces of a social universe, convinced that their own bodily state was an instrument responsive to the social consubstantiality of consanguineal kinship. The qualia of the variously diagrammatic parts of the body, called to reflexive attention, index the conditions of the social universe in which that body – and its regionalizations and partitions – takes shape and exists as an experienceable aspect of Worora selfhood.</p>
