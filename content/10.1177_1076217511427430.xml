<abstract>
<p>Educators need to know the professional standards in their field to maintain high levels of professional competence. This article focuses on four sets of teacher preparation standards in gifted education. They address initial and advanced preparation of educators who teach students with gifts and talents. Initial preparation standards include the National Association for Gifted Children/Council for Exceptional Children–The Association for the Gifted (NAGC/CEC-TAG) teacher knowledge and skill standards for gifted and talented education and the NAGC preparation for all teacher standards that were developed in response to the Higher Education Opportunity Act. Advanced preparation standards incorporate the <italic>CEC-NAGC Advanced Knowledge and Skill Set: Specialist in Gifted and Talented Education</italic> and the <italic>National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Exceptional Needs Standards</italic>. These standards relate to other national teacher preparation, content, and gifted education programming standards. Research suggests that standards have a positive effect on professional competence and the field and are used to legitimize the field of gifted education; to build consensus; to offer guidance for developing programs at the university, state, and local levels; and for evaluation and advocacy.</p>

<p>In 2010, the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) adopted professional ethical principles intended to provide guidance for special educators in addressing individual differences among students and their families. Included among CEC’s 12 principles are “practicing within professional standards” and “maintaining a high level of professional competence.” Educators who want to adhere to these principles and attain excellence in their chosen profession need to know the professional standards in their field, how they complement other national standards, and how they support professional competence. This article will address each of these important topics.</p>

<title>Professional Standards in Gifted Education</title>
<p>The field of gifted education has four sets of teacher preparation standards: the National Association for Gifted Children/Council for Exceptional Children–The Association for the Gifted (NAGC/CEC-TAG) standards at the initial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217511427430">NAGC &amp; CEC-TAG, 2006</xref>), knowledge and skill standards in gifted and talented education for all teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217511427430">NAGC, 2006</xref>), NAGC/CEC-TAG standards at the advanced level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217511427430">NAGC &amp; CEC-TAG, in press</xref>), and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS)–Exceptional Needs Specialist certificate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217511427430">NBPTS, 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1076217511427430">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Teacher Preparation Standards</title>
<sec id="section3-1076217511427430">
<title>Initial preparation for teachers of students with gifts and talents</title>
<p>The NAGC/CEC-TAG standards at the initial level are used by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) to accredit teacher preparation programs and to act as a guide for Pre-K to Grade 12 program leaders who have the responsibility of planning and implementing professional development for teachers of gifted and talented students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217511427430">Johnsen, VanTassel-Baska, &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217511427430">Kitano, Montgomery, VanTassel-Baska, &amp; Johnsen, 2008</xref>). They are intended to provide a framework for those teachers who are seeking their first certificate or license in gifted education and who plan to teach gifted and talented students. The 10 standards are divided into knowledge (e.g., what teachers should know) and skills (e.g., what teachers should be able to do; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217511427430">NAGC/CEC-TAG, 2006</xref>). The first standard begins with a knowledge-based foundations component that traces the theoretical, historical, and research-based constructs central to understanding the changes that have occurred in the field of gifted education. These changes have evolved as a result of increasing diversity and perspectives regarding inclusive and developmental models. Standards 2 and 3 emphasize how gifted students’ learning and development are different from those of other students. Specific attention is given to the interaction of these characteristics with cultural background, language, poverty, and learning problems that sometimes accompany giftedness. Standards 4 and 7 stress the importance of instructional strategies and instructional planning. Standard 4 emphasizes a repertoire of pedagogical approaches that have been found effective with gifted students. These include differentiating curriculum and instruction, modifying learning environments, and transferring advanced knowledge. Standard 7 focuses on the products necessary to differentiate curriculum for gifted learners including learning plans, differentiated materials, and scope and sequence documents. Standards 5 and 6 emphasize the nature of learning environments for the gifted that provide optimal contexts for learning personal, social, and intellectual skills; the development of oral and written language and communication skills at appropriate levels of advancement; and using appropriate technologies. Standard 10, the collaboration standard, focuses on the multiple types of collaboration necessary in developing programs for these learners from families, to school personnel, to various community groups. Standard 8 describes the knowledge and skills essential for both identification of gifted learners, including the use of multiple methods for finding underrepresented populations, as well as the knowledge and skills needed to assess learning in programs. Finally, Standard 9 focuses on professional and ethical practice in relating to students, other educators, and individual stakeholders. It challenges educators to be sensitive to diversity and to reflect and continually improve their practices through professional development.</p>

<title>Preparation for all teachers</title>
<p>When the Higher Education Opportunity Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217511427430">HEOA; 2008</xref>) was reauthorized, three sections addressed gifted and talented children: teaching skills, required forms, and a state report card on the quality of teacher preparation. Teaching skills included those that related to increasing student learning, achievement, and the ability to apply knowledge (e.g., explaining academic subject matter; teaching higher order analytical, evaluation, problem solving, and communication skills; and using instructional strategies that are grounded in the disciplines, based on the identification of students’ specific needs, and supported by empirically based practices and research). To demonstrate that they are meeting the HEOA requirements, all teacher education programs need to provide evidence showing the effectiveness of their curriculum in preparing educators to implement research-based teaching practices in their classrooms for gifted and talented students and to use student academic achievement data to improve instruction. Moreover, states are required to assess the quality of traditional and nontraditional teacher preparation in meeting the standards in the HEOA (i.e., the quality of the program in preparing educators to teach gifted and talented students).</p>
<p>In response to the HEOA, the professional associations in gifted education identified the following teacher preparation standards for all educators:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217511427430" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Understand the issues in definitions, theories, and identification of gifted and talented students, including those from diverse backgrounds;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Recognize the learning differences, developmental milestones, and cognitive/affective characteristics of gifted and talented students, including those from diverse backgrounds, and identify their related academic and social-emotional needs; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Understand, plan, and implement a range of evidence-based strategies to assess gifted and talented students; to differentiate instruction, content, and assignments for them (include the use of higher order critical and creative-thinking skills); and to nominate them for advanced programs or acceleration as needed.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These three standards were developed using the NAGC/CEC-TAG initial teacher preparation standards that addressed knowledge and skills primarily within Standards 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217511427430">
<title>Advanced preparation for educators of students with gifts and talents</title>
<p>NAGC/CEC-TAG standards at the advanced level are for those educators who have an initial certificate, who typically are already in gifted education, and who want more knowledge and skills in the discipline. The six standards at the advanced level provide benchmarks to ensure that experienced gifted education professionals are able to practice at an accomplished level. Although not a part of the NCATE review process, the university faculty may use the advanced gifted education professional standards as a guide in developing, evaluating, and improving their programs. Pre-K to Grade 12 administrators may use these standards to design professional development and to select directors, coordinators, and teacher leaders in gifted education. The first standard, Leadership and Policy, focuses on preparing educators to develop group facilitation and problem-solving skills for conducting leadership activities, analyze legal and ethical policies, advocate for those that support high-quality education for individuals with gifts and talents, and mentor newly certified teachers. Standard 2, Program Development and Organization, emphasizes the key features in program development for exceptional and general education students based on a thorough understanding of development and learning theories and evidence-based practices. Standard 3, Research and Inquiry, engages the educator in identifying, evaluating, using, conducting, and disseminating educational research that informs practices in the education of students with gifts and talents. Standard 4, Individual and Program Evaluation, identifies knowledge and skills related to selecting instruments, monitoring and evaluating gifted and talented education programs, and advocating for evidence-based practices in assessment. Standard 5, Professional Development and Ethical Practice, focuses on modeling ethical behavior, promoting professional standards and personal growth, providing professional development that is based on effective school and classroom practices, and implementing practices that promote the success of individuals with gifts and talents. The sixth standard, Collaboration, stresses the importance of working with other professionals in integrating services for individuals with exceptionalities and understanding the role of collaboration in promoting understanding, resolving conflicts, and building consensus. Similar to the initial standards, there is a strong emphasis on diversity and culturally responsive education practices throughout the standards.</p>

<title>NBPTS–exceptional needs specialist</title>
<p>Another option for teachers who already have an initial license in gifted education is to pursue a NBPTS certificate. The NBPTS is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance the quality of teaching by developing high and rigorous standards for accomplished teachers and by creating a national voluntary system certifying teachers who meet the standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217511427430">NBPTS, 2010</xref>). The new option for gifted educators is a pathway within the Exceptional Needs Specialist certificate. Accomplished teachers within this certificate tailor instruction to each student’s distinct abilities, recognizing that students with exceptionalities represent a diverse population and that those with gifts and talents also have special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217511427430">NBPTS, 2010</xref>). The 12 standards are clustered within three major areas: foundations for effective practice, student learning and development, and roles and practices within the learning community. Educators are able to apply their knowledge to the field of gifted education within each of the 12 standards. For example, in collaborating with families to support students’ education, a teacher of a student who is gifted might initiate a discussion on the appropriateness of subject or grade acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217511427430">NBPTS, 2010</xref>). Similarly, educators who are involved in identifying students with exceptionalities should know the specific research-based practices for identifying gifted and talented students and be aware of challenges related to bias in testing, particularly for those students who are underrepresented in gifted education programs. Along with advanced university degrees in gifted education, educators with initial certificates, therefore, have two viable choices for becoming more accomplished in their field.</p>
<p>All of these standards in gifted education focus on what teachers should know and be able to do so that gifted and talented students receive instruction that is customized to their individual needs. These standards are connected to other sets of standards, which focus not only on teacher preparation in general education but also on subject matter content and programming.</p>

<title>Relationship of Teacher Preparation Standards in Gifted Education to Other National Standards</title>
<p>The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) recently released the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) Model Core Teaching Standards. The CEC and the NAGC were represented on a consortium of state education agencies and national educational organizations that updated the 1992 model teaching standards, which provided a voice for students with diverse learning needs. These standards emphasize the learner and learning, content knowledge, instructional practice, and professional responsibility. They stress the importance of the teachers’ understanding of students with exceptional needs, including those associated with disabilities and giftedness, and the use of strategies and resources to address these students’ needs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427430">CCSSO, 2011</xref>, Standard 2[h], p. 11). Moreover, the standards emphasize developmentally appropriate instruction that “enables each learner to advance and accelerate his/her learning” (Standard 1[b], p. 10).</p>
<p>All of the standards, including InTASC and those specifically developed for educators of students with gifts and talents, are interrelated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217511427430">Table 1</xref>). Each set of standards stress the importance of understanding the learning and developmental characteristics of a diverse population of learners and of creating learning environments that enhance these characteristics. Moreover, all emphasize the important roles that assessment, planning, and instructional strategies assume in the successful implementation of effective programming. With the exception of the abbreviated gifted standards for all teachers, the remaining standard sets incorporate ethics, leadership, and collaboration as significant professional responsibilities. While knowledge of discipline areas is certainly important across all standards, specific content knowledge standards in specific discipline areas such as math or language arts are addressed to some degree in the InTASC and NBPTS standards and language standards of NAGC/CEC-TAG, but are more thoroughly described by professional associations such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics or the National Council of Teachers of English and by the new Common Core State Standards. The new Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217511427430">National Governor’s Association &amp; CCSSO, 2010</xref>), which have been adopted by 48 states and territories, emphasize higher order thinking skills, conceptual understanding, in-depth research, and a developmentally appropriate continuous progression of skills that prepares a student for college and careers. These areas are foundational to curriculum development within gifted education and are identified within the NAGC/CEC-TAG teacher preparation standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427430">CEC, 2009</xref>; see Standards GT4S2 [higher level thinking], GT4S3 [research], GT7S3 [scope and sequence], GT7S5 [conceptually challenging], and GT7S6 [career]). It is important to notice that these highly influential Common Core Standards include critical curricular areas that will enhance the education of gifted and talented students.</p>

<p>Along with teacher preparation and content standards, there are gifted education standards for developing and implementing programs. These standards, the 2010 “Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Programming Standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217511427430">NAGC, 2010</xref>), are closely aligned to the teacher preparation standards and include 36 student outcomes that are organized into six programming standards (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1076217511427430">Table 2</xref>). The first standard focuses on <italic>learning and development</italic>, which is foundational to the remaining standards because educators need to understand the characteristics and needs of the population for whom they are planning assessment, curriculum and instruction, learning environments, programming, and professional development. The second standard, <italic>assessment</italic>, incorporates identification, the assessment of learning progress, and evaluation since they are inextricably linked to one another. The third standard, <italic>curriculum planning and instruction</italic>, addresses not only curricular planning but also talent development, instructional strategies, culturally relevant curriculum, and accessing appropriate resources to engage a variety of learners. The fourth standard, <italic>learning environments</italic>, emphasizes the creation of safe learning environments where students are able to develop personal and social responsibility, multicultural competence, and interpersonal and technical communication skills for leadership. The fifth standard, <italic>programming</italic>, includes a variety of programming options that are coordinated and implemented by a team of educators who have adequate resources to implement comprehensive services. The sixth standard, <italic>professional development</italic>, focuses on the resources and methods needed to prepare educators in developing the social, emotional, and cognitive abilities of students with gifts and talents.</p>

<p>Although there are a variety of gifted education and national standards, it is clear that they address similar areas. For example, when educators are learning about the characteristics of gifted and talented students, they are meeting the knowledge and skill sets within teacher preparation and programming standards in gifted education as well as those standards identified by InTASC and the NBPTS. Since most state standards are also correlated to the national standards, gifted educators whose practices are aligned to professional standards have a greater likelihood of maintaining a high level of professional competence.</p>

<title>Standards’ Effects on Professional Competence</title>
<p>Standards appear to have positive effects on professional competence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427430">Darling-Hammond (2000)</xref> noted that, in all cases, teachers with full certification status are “by far the most important determinant of student achievement” (p. 30). Those with advanced certificates not only have increased knowledge and skills that relate to higher student achievement but also have more longevity in the field of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217511427430">Hakel, Koenig, &amp; Elliott, 2008</xref>). Within the field of gifted education, trained teachers lecture less, emphasize more creativity and higher level thinking skills, demonstrate fast pacing of instruction, conduct more discussions, and implement student-directed activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427430">Hansen &amp; Feldhusen, 1994</xref>). Moreover, successful teachers in gifted education use strategies commonly cited in the standards and are more confident in their abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217511427430">Siegle &amp; Powell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217511427430">Starko &amp; Schack, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217511427430">Story, 1985</xref>). Those with graduate degrees in gifted education were also more likely to individualize instruction and provide curriculum modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217511427430">Westberg &amp; Archambault, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1076217511427430">1997</xref>). However, teachers with limited training do not differentiate instruction for gifted and talented learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427430">Archambault et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217511427430">Gentry, Rizza, &amp; Owen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217511427430">Starko &amp; Schack, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217511427430">Westberg, Archambault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993</xref>). Students are therefore the ultimate beneficiaries of high standards for teachers.</p>
<p>In addition to these positive effects on classroom instructional practices, the field of gifted education is improved by standards. Standards legitimize gifted education as an area for teacher preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427430">Johnsen, 2006</xref>). Teachers need specialized knowledge and skills to teach learners with gifts and talents. They need to know these students’ characteristics, how to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and how to effectively serve them. Moreover, standards build consensus about desired practices and what is important for teachers in gifted education to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076217511427430">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Johnsen, 2007</xref>). These agreed-on knowledge and skills form the basis for many of the state and district standards and ensure educational quality across schools and educational institutions.</p>
<p>Standards also develop a scholarly consensus regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to teach gifted and talented students by identifying effective, research-based practices to use in gifted education programs. Three types of research were used in validating the teacher preparation standards at the initial and advanced levels: literature/theory based, research based, and practice based. Literature- and theory-based research included knowledge and skills derived from sources such as position papers, policy analyses, and descriptive reviews of the literature. Research-based studies included peer-reviewed articles that use rigorous research methodologies to address questions of cause and effect and that have been independently replicated and found to be effective. Practice-based research included lighthouse studies, professional wisdom, and emerging practices that arise from teachers’ classroom experiences and are validated through some degree of action research (all definitions are from the Professional Standards and Practice Committee of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427430">CEC; 2009</xref>). Because scholars agree to these standards, educators can be assured that the knowledge and skills within have research support.</p>
<p>Standards can offer guidance to teacher preparation institutions in developing programs at both the initial and advanced levels and to Pre-K to Grade 12 leaders in planning and implementing professional development activities. They can act as benchmarks along a continuum of developing expertise and provide meaningful progress indicators. However, each standard needs to be extended to ensure that educators have a clear vision of what the standards actually look like in a classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217511427430">Gubbins, 2008</xref>). In this way, educators can develop professional development plans and identify needed human and material resources for successful implementation within their classrooms. Professional development also needs to be supplemented by classroom observations and on-site technical assistance to ensure fidelity of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427430">Johnsen, Haensly, Ryser, &amp; Ford, 2002</xref>). Educators who are involved in setting goals for their own professional development, understand the specific characteristics of the standard, and receive support are more likely to be successful in progressing from novice to expert gifted educators in adapting their classroom practices for gifted learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217511427430">Gubbins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427430">Johnsen et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Standards can also be used as a tool for influencing public policy. They can provide a base for discussion with general and state educators about important qualities for teachers of gifted education. In addition, they can be used to evaluate the effects of educational rules and regulations at the state level on gifted students and then be used in advocating for change in meeting their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217511427430">Gallagher, 2008</xref>). At the local level, standards can guide school districts in examining their personnel policies and in implementing more rigorous competencies for gifted educators.</p>
<p>Finally, standards can be used in program evaluation. For example, a school district may want to implement more differentiation practices. By examining Standard 4 of the NAGC/CEC-TAG teacher preparation standards, educator leaders might notice that teachers who differentiate know how to preassess learning needs (GT4S4); to apply higher level thinking and metacognitive models to content areas (GT4S2); to provide opportunities for students to explore, develop, and research in their areas of interest (GT4S3); to pace delivery of curriculum and instruction (GT4S5); to provide challenging, multicultural curriculum (GT4S6); and to use assistive technologies (GT4S7). The district identifies the specific characteristics of each of these practices and then identifies or develops assessments that are aligned to the standards. The standards are then used to target specific needs, to measure progress, and, ultimately, to link to student outcomes.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Educators who are involved in teaching students with gifts and talents have access to four sets of standards that focus on professional competence. These standards are for those entering the field as well as for those who have been in the field for many years. Standards in gifted education are aligned with other national teacher preparation standards, content standards, and the 2010 “Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Programming Standards,” which allows for the concurrent attainment of specific knowledge and skills that are supported by a rich research base.</p>
<p>Research indicates that standards have a positive effect on professional competence and on the field. Trained teachers incorporate more differentiated practices that are cited in the standards into their classrooms. Moreover, standards legitimize the field of gifted education; build consensus; offer guidance for developing programs at the university, state, and local levels; and may be used for evaluation and advocacy.</p>
<p>Gifted education standards are a necessity in developing professionally competent educators. Practitioners who have attained the relevant theory and research, an understanding of the developmental levels of gifted and talented students, a foundation in content and pedagogical knowledge, and classroom instructional management techniques ultimately strengthen the quality of services for gifted and talented students.</p>
