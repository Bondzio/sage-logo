<p>No-touch (NT) saphenous vein (SV) grafts are superior to SVs harvested by the conventional technique (CT), with a patency comparable with the internal thoracic artery (ITA). Preservation of the vasa vasorum is implicated in the success of NT harvesting. We compared the vasa vasorum and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in NT SV with ITA and radial artery (RA) grafts. Skeletonized SV (SSV) was also analyzed. The NT SV had a higher number and larger vasa vasorum compared with ITA (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) and RA (<italic>P</italic> = .0004) that correlated with eNOS protein. Activity of eNOS in SSV grafts was significantly lower than NT SV grafts (<italic>P</italic> = 004). Since a high proportion of the vasa vasorum are removed in SSV using the CT, we suggest that preservation of the vasa vasorum and eNOS-derived NO contributes to the high patency for NT as compared with SSV grafts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The success of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) relies on the long-term patency of the conduit used for revascularization. Originally saphenous vein (SV) grafts were used but the internal thoracic artery (ITA; also known as the internal mammary artery) has subsequently become the conduit of choice since it has a superior patency compared with the SV grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712443729">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712443729">2</xref>
</sup> The poor long-term results with SV grafts and the encouraging results with ITA have led to a search for other arterial conduits for CABG. Among arterial grafts, the radial artery (RA) has gained the widest popularity; as in many studies, it has shown an excellent long-term patency<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319712443729">3</xref>
</sup> compared with SV grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712443729">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319712443729">5</xref>
</sup> However, recent studies have shown no difference between RA and SV grafts regarding their clinical outcome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319712443729">6</xref>
</sup> or patency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319712443729">7</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the SV remains an important and the most widely used complementary conduit for patients undergoing CABG and improvement of its long-term patency has been a major goal.</p>
<p>The success of the arterial grafts can in part be attributed to the preparation technique used before implantation. Arterial grafts are commonly harvested complete with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and they are not distended. It has been shown that the perivascular tissue of ITA releases potent vasorelaxing factors such as nitric oxide (NO).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712443729">8</xref>
</sup> In contrast, the SV is generally harvested by the conventional technique (CT), as originally described over 40 years ago.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319712443729">9</xref>
</sup> Here the vein graft is stripped of its surrounding tissue and usually distended to overcome spasm, procedures inflicting considerable surgical trauma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319712443729">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, a no-touch (NT) harvesting technique was introduced where the vein graft is harvested together with its pedicle of surrounding tissue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319712443729">11</xref>
</sup> A prospective randomized trial showed a significantly increased patency rate for NT SV grafts, which was comparable to the ITA and significantly better when compared with CT SV grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712443729">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The vasa vasorum is a network of nourishing microvessels supplying nutrients and oxygen to the blood vessel wall, and this network is more pronounced in muscular veins than in arteries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712443729">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319712443729"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319712443729">15</xref>
</sup> It has been suggested that the vasa vasorum within the pedicle of NT SV plays an important role for the success of the technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712443729">16</xref>
</sup> The aim of this study was to quantify the vasa vasorum in NT SV, ITA, and RA grafts and also to determine endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) protein levels and NOS activity in these grafts as well as in skeletonized SV grafts (SSV). We hypothesize that apart from the luminal endothelium of the grafts, the vasa vasorum and endothelial cells lining these microvessels are important sources of NO impacting on graft performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0003319712443729" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>After obtaining ethics committee approval and patients’ written informed consent segments of SV, ITA and RA from 11 patients who were included in a randomized controlled trial of CABG at Örebro University Hospital, Sweden, all patients received an ITA, an NT SV, and an RA graft (11 of 11 male, 51-65 years of age). Samples were harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue intact. Half of the length of the NT SV graft samples was kept with surrounding tissue and the other half was skeletonized (SSV) before fixation. None of the grafts were distended.</p>
<p>The samples were immediately immersion fixed for 5 hours at 4°C in 4% formaldehyde for immunohistochemistry or frozen in liquid nitrogen at surgery and stored at −70°C until use.</p>
<sec id="section3-0003319712443729">
<title>Vasa Vasorum</title>
<p>Standard immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded transverse sections which, after antigen retrieval, were incubated to identify endothelial cells using primary antibody CD34 (clone QBEnd-10, 1:100 DakoCytomation, Denmark) and NCL-NOS-3 (dilution 1:40; Novocatra, UK) used for eNOS with negative controls prepared by substituting primary antibody with Dako ChemMate antibody diluents (DakoCytomation, Denmark).</p>
<p>For quantitative measurements of vasa vasorum, images of CD-34 staining of all vessel sections were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam MRc5 color camera on an automated Zeiss Axioplan Microscope using Zeiss Axiovision software (final magnification of sections viewed on monitor &gt;300 times). The images were normalized and the borders of media (between the internal and external elastic laminae) and adventitia (between external elastic laminae and the border of surrounding tissue) were manually defined. Measurements of media and adventitia area within the defined borders were performed. Endothelial cells and each area of detected vasa vasorum were automatically determined by planimetry and identified by the imaging system. The primary end point was the total vasa vasorum area (the sum of all areas detected) and density (number of detected vasa vasorum per square millimeter) and calculated within the media and the adventitia, respectively. In most cases, 2 sections were analyzed for each sample and the mean values recorded. Image processing and analysis were carried out using Zeiss KS400 software as previously described.<sup>

<title>Western Blots</title>
<p>Frozen samples from 4 patients were used for the determination of eNOS protein expression by Western blot analysis. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer, protein concentration determined, protein extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted for eNOS. Filters were blocked overnight and proteins detected by a 1-hour incubation with rabbit anti-eNOS antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by incubation with biotinylated species-specific secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Resultant antigen–antibody complexes were detected by incubation with avidin–biotinylated complex reagent (Vector Labs) using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). After exposure, films were analyzed by scanning densitometry on an Ultroscan XL (LKB Wallac, Huntingdon, Cambridge, UK) and expression levels standardized using β-actin. The eNOS expression was expressed as densitometric units (du).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003319712443729">
<title>Citrulline Assay</title>
<p>Activity of NOS was assessed using the citrulline assay. Homogenates of segments of frozen samples, with a standard length of 5 mm, from 6 patients, were prepared as before and the NOS activity determined by the conversion of [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-arginine to [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-citrulline using an NOS activity assay kit (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK). After incubation of tissue lysate with reaction buffer (37°C for 1 hour), the reaction was stopped and radioactivity quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Activity of NOS was expressed as fentomoles [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-citrulline produced per minute per 5 mm sample (potential NO produced per minute per 5 mm sample). Blanks were prepared by incubating in 1 mmol/L of the competitive NOS inhibitor <italic>N</italic>-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and rat cerebellum extract was used as a positive control.</p>

<sec id="section6-0003319712443729">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) of microvessel counts and size. In the statistical testing for vasa vasorum, where media and adventitia were added to a total, we formed differences in counts and size between NT and the 2 arterial grafts. For eNOS expression and NOS activity, the same difference was formed and we also contrasted NT SV with SSV. The statistical significance of these contrasts was analyzed in mixed model analyses where the correlation between samples taken from the same patient could be taken into account. The technical specification of the analysis was a correlation structure with compound symmetry and the degrees of freedom were given by the Satterthwaite method.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712443729">17</xref>
</sup> The raw data complied approximately with the normality assumptions, but as an extra precaution we also performed the analysis on logarithmically transformed values. A 2-tailed <italic>P</italic> level &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Vasa Vasorum</title>
<p>The distribution and density of vasa vasorum, as assessed by identification of their endothelial cells by CD34 immunostaining, were more pronounced and penetrated deeper into the media in the NT SV than in the ITA and RA.</p>
<p>The highest proportion of vasa vasorum in both the ITA and RA was confined mainly to the adventitial layer with a few vasa vasorum located in the outermost part of the media in close proximity to the external elastic lamina. In contrast, the vasa vasorum in the NT SV was almost equally distributed in the adventitial and medial layers, penetrating approximately 300 μm into the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319712443729">Figure 1</xref>). Morphometric analysis showed a higher number of vasa vasorum in NT SV grafts compared with ITA and RA grafts both in the media and in the adventitia that were of larger size.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to formally quantify the number and size of vasa vasorum in the SV, ITA, and RA, the most used graft materials for CABG. An important aspect of this study was that all grafts were prepared from the same patients with the same technique wherein they were harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and not distended. In the majority of previous studies comparing arterial and SV grafts, the grafts were prepared using different techniques, where arterial grafts were harvested with an intact pedicle and were not distended while the SVs grafts were both skeletonized and distended during their preparation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712443729">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319712443729">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319712443729">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Here we have demonstrated that NT SV grafts have a significantly higher number and larger sized vasa vasorum in both the media and the adventitia than that in ITA and RA grafts. As a microvascular blood supply to the media, the vasa vasorum play a more important role in providing oxygen in veins than in arteries that are supplied mainly by diffusion from the luminal blood. Consistent with this statement, and supported by our findings, is the report that the vasa vasorum are abundant in veins and larger arteries with a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319712443729">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Rapid development of atherosclerotic lesions in the rabbit carotid artery is induced by perivascular manipulation where the placement of a close-fitting collar results in the formation of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) caused by the obstruction of the adventitial vasa vasorum and creation of mural ischemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319712443729">20</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, removal of the adventitia of the carotid artery induced NIH formation but intimal hyperplasia regression was observed on appearance of a neoadventitia associated with the restoration of medial oxygenation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319712443729">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, in tissue-engineered blood vessels developed as potential substitutes for autologous bypass grafts, the appearance of “adventitial” vasa vasorum has been described after implantation of the engineered graft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319712443729">22</xref>
</sup> Similarly, tissue-engineered blood vessels created from human fibroblasts exhibited complete tissue integration and the formation of vasa vasorum underlying the importance of this microvessel network in the maintenance of viable graft material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003319712443729">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The luminal termination of vasa vasorum in canine vein was demonstrated over 30 years ago,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003319712443729">24</xref>
</sup> and we have shown both light and electron microscopic evidence supporting this finding in SV grafts used in patients undergoing CABG.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712443729">16</xref>
</sup> The potential existence of intraluminal termination of vasa vasorum was described by Souza who observed retrograde filling of the adventitial vasa vasorum during the removal of vascular clamps at the completion of SV graft insertion in CABG.<sup>

</sup> However, while these findings were on in situ vein preparations, the in vivo extrinsic arterial supply of SV vasa vasorum arises from the external pudendal, superficial femoral, superior geniculate, and posterior tibial arteries.<sup>

</sup> A number of endogenous factors have been shown to affect the tone of the vasa vasorum that may impact on the performance of vessels used as bypass conduits. For example, in vasa vasorum dissected from porcine and bovine thoracic aorta, endothelin 1, noradrenaline, and angiotensin II all cause vasoconstriction and substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and bradykinin cause relaxation, an effect partly mediated via NO.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319712443729">27</xref>
</sup> The potential importance of adventitial sources of NO is reinforced by results of a porcine vein graft model, where NOS was localized to regions of neovascularization formed in patent grafts fitted with a porous external stent. This finding was associated with increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation, supporting a role for NO in improved graft performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003319712443729">28</xref>
</sup> Further evidence of a beneficial role for adventitial eNOS comes from the study of Kalra et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003319712443729">29</xref>
</sup> who demonstrated that ex vivo gene transfection of SV grafts is most efficient when targeting the adventitia as compared with intraluminal delivery.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have provided quantitative confirmation that the vasa vasorum is far more pronounced in SV than the ITA and RA, indicating that these microvessels play a more important role in the SV than in arterial grafts. Also, we have shown that skeletonization of SV markedly reduces the number of vasa vasorum in this conduit, suggesting that damage to this microvessel network has a detrimental effect on vein graft patency. Our findings support the hypothesis that keeping the surrounding tissue of NT SV intact preserves the vasa vasorum and maintains transmural blood supply. Conservation of this important source of endothelial-derived NO contributes to the improved performance of NT SV grafts. It seems paradoxical that, using conventional harvesting techniques, an ischemic vein graft is used to revascularize ischemic myocardium.</p>
