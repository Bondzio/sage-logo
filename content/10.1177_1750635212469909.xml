<abstract>
<p>This article is a two-part exploration of the reporting of sectarian conflicts in Nigerian newspapers. It seeks to find out how enemy images and stereotypes are created in the journalistic process; how they shape attitudes, and stoke hatred with the possibility of fuelling/amplifying sectarian violence. The authors draw examples from conflicts in Northern Nigeria, specifically the November 2008 crisis in the central Nigerian city of Jos. The first part deals with the examination, through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), of data collected from the Nigerian cities of Jos, Abuja and Kano. The second part is a study, via Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), of 160 reports by <italic>THISDAY</italic> and <italic>Daily Trust</italic> newspapers during the November 2008 violence. In a bid to correlate the findings of the main study (IPA), the article applies Teun A van Dijk’s socio-cognitive model to identify specific use of labels/rhetoric/enemy images, hyperboles, litotes and so on, in the two newspapers’ reports. The article therefore postulates that Nigerian newspapers use enemy images and stereotypes to demonise the ‘other’, reshape their readers’ impression of the ‘other’, reinforce intolerance and, possibly, spread hate and amplify conflicts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469909">Hallin and Mancini (2004)</xref> assert that no media in any part of the world can be said to be entirely neutral, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469909">Hackett (2003)</xref> argues that newspapers in Nigeria are extremely active in using labels to shape attitudes. The 1990s, in particular, saw a huge swell in the number of newspapers and other strands of the media in Nigeria. This was partly due to deregulation of the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212469909">Oyobvaire, 2001</xref>) and the changing political economy of the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635212469909">Larkin, 1997</xref>). Deregulation also led to increased professionalism and competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635212469909">Oso, 1991</xref>) and, in a bid to sustain their market in an increasingly changing environment, there was a sway towards ethnicity and/or religion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212469909">Oyovbaire (2001)</xref> notes that the environment transformed from dichotomy (North versus South) to trichotomy (North, West and East) and finally multichotomy (36 states across the country) and that ethnic and religious influences in the pluralistic states continue to serve as some form of gravitational force attracting loyalty from the media and journalists.</p>
<p>During the sectarian violence that erupted in Jos (the capital of Plateau State) in November 2008, newspapers were accused of allowing their ethnic and/or religious interests to dictate the prism through which they viewed and reported the crisis. It is against this backdrop that Haruna<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750635212469909">1</xref></sup> notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is, I believe, the lack of even-handedness in reporting and condemning political violence that camouflages as religious violence by both the media and the clergy which is the greatest obstacle against the emergence of democracy in Nigeria.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212469909">Ishaku (2009</xref>: 135) also comments on the manner in which newspapers report religious crises in Nigeria:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we have been witnessing in the reportage of the ethno-religious conflict in northern Nigeria is a form of journalistic recklessness that reflects total disregard for the truth or the continuing survival of Nigeria as a corporate and sovereign entity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ishaku goes on to mention some Northern newspapers like the <italic>New Nigerian</italic> and <italic>Daily Trust</italic> as well as broadcast media like the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) Kaduna, the Hausa versions of international broadcast organisations like the BBC, VOA, Radio France International (RFI) and Deutsch Welle (DW) as pro-Islamic North (p. 136).</p>

<sec id="section2-1750635212469909">
<title>An overview of the Jos crisis of November 2008</title>
<p>Jos is a tin-rich city in the middle of Nigeria and the capital of Plateau State which prides itself as the ‘home of peace and tourism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750635212469909">2</xref></sup> Around the time that the crises in Bauchi (1992) and Zangon Kataf (1992) erupted, Jos automatically became a focus. In 1994, a mild altercation took place but was immediately contained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212469909">Musa, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Between September 2001 and May 2004, there was a series of conflicts that cost thousands of lives and property worth several millions of dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212469909">Ishaku, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212469909">Musa, 2010</xref>). Again, the crisis resumed on 28 November 2008 following local government (council) elections in which the Jos electorate was divided on the basis of religion and ethnicity (Human Rights Watch, 19 December, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212469909">Dufka, 2008</xref>). And there was suspicion of electoral malpractices (<italic>Weekly Trust</italic>, 29 November 2008), leading to protests by supporters of the Muslim candidate (<italic>THISDAY</italic>, 29 November 2008). The State Governor, David Jonah Jang, reportedly gave a ‘shoot-on-sight’ order to security officials and, by the next day, reports claimed more than 300 people had been killed (Human Rights Watch, 19 December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212469909">2008</xref>). In the midst of the crisis, results of the elections held across the state were officially released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212469909">Musa, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the international and local media actively reported the crisis, although there were allegations of bias. Specifically, local newspaper reports were accused of leaning towards ethnicity and/or religion. It is important to note the age-old rivalry between the media in the North and those in the South dating back to 1859 when Reverend Townsend founded the first newspaper in Nigeria – <italic>Iwe Irohin Fun Awon Ara Egba ati Yoruba</italic> – in the South-West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635212469909">Babalola, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212469909">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212469909">Ogbondah, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750635212469909">Olayiwola, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750635212469909">Salawu, 2006</xref>), giving the South a head start. <italic>Gaskiya Tafi Kwabo</italic> was founded in 1937–1938, more than 78 years after <italic>Iwe Irohin</italic> and nine other newspapers had been established in the South. Today, with most newspapers located in the South and owned by Southern proprietors, the South towers over the North. This seeming lop-sidedness could partly be blamed for the leaning towards ethnicity or religion, especially during ethno-religious crises, as each section attempts a defence of the interests of the side it is aligned to.</p>

<sec id="section3-1750635212469909" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research methodology</title>
<p>In this article, we employ two techniques used for collecting data for this article. First, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was utilised in analysing articles and news reports by two Nigerian newspapers during one of the sectarian violence episodes in the country. CDA is a strand of Discourse Analysis (Foucault, 1980, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750635212469909">Wooffit, 2001</xref>) which focuses on the critique of ideology and power, and analyses the manifestation and reproduction of social and political inequalities through discourse. CDA contends that, on its own, language is not powerful but becomes powerful depending on the use it is put to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635212469909">Wodak, 2001</xref>). Applying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Teun A van Dijk’s (2001)</xref> socio-cognitive model,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750635212469909">3</xref></sup> 160 reports published by the two newspapers, <italic>Daily Trust</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750635212469909">4</xref></sup> and <italic>THISDAY</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750635212469909">5</xref></sup> from 29 November to 26 December 2008 were studied.</p>
<p>Second, semi-structured and focus group interview techniques were used to collect data in the Nigerian cities of Jos, Kano and Abuja. The first part of this study involved individual interviews (semi-structured) with publishers, editors, reporters and media commentators; participants are code-named IS1-7 (individual study, for the purpose of confidentiality). The second part has been code-named GS1-3 (group study) and is made up of two focus group interviews with a media audience cutting across gender, tribe, age and religion. All participants were randomly selected and efforts were made to ensure even representation of interests. In order not to tamper with participants’ subjective phenomenology, they were asked to relay their experiences with newspaper reporting of religious conflicts in Nigeria, while interviewers chipped-in with follow-up questions at appropriate moments. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was applied to analyse data from transcribed interview audio and the subjectivity of participants’ experiences was allowed to determine the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750635212469909">Storey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750635212469909">Willig, 2001</xref>); the way the participants made sense of their experiences helped the researchers to interpret them also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212469909">Bryman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212469909">Gray, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212469909">Grbich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750635212469909">Smith and Eatough, 2007</xref>). In the end, attempts were made to provide answers to questions that included: What was the manner of reporting the conflict? What factors determined the reportage? In what ways were enemy images and stereotypes used to demonise the other? Who was the target and by whom? What was the intent? What effects might it have had on the crisis and potential eruption of violence? The main purpose of applying the two approaches, CDA and IPA, is to correlate results from one technique with those obtained by means of another approach. This approach is known as triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212469909">Bryman, 2004</xref>: 275; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212469909">Davies, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212469909">Flick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212469909">Gray, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis by means of IPA</title>
<p>Following the examination of interview data, it was realised that the use of enemy frames often has various goals, one of which is to ‘justify hanging the dog’ by presenting a very negative picture of an opponent and making people lose sympathy with them. IS4, an ex-editor explains that enemy images contribute towards reinforcing prejudice against certain people and increase the possibility of violence against them:
<disp-quote>
<p>You have already demonised some people when you say Fulani people just think of Dogo Na Hauwa and see all Fulani as people who kill women and children. Or when you say Berom some people link them to people poisoning ponds to kill cattle or attack Fulani in their hamlets. If you continue to report it that Berom attack or Fulani attack you are just piling hatred or perpetuating violent behaviour against certain groups.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The more individuals or groups are linked to certain atrocities committed by a handful of deviants from amongst them, the more everyone gets blamed. This position is further argued by GS1, a film producer resident in Jos who laments: ‘negative reports from Jos make us see Jos people as violent and hardly get our sympathy.’ But IS1, a newspaper columnist suggests that stereotyping usually begins where journalists take sides: ‘It’s rare that you’ll find journalists that would acknowledge if there’s a wrong on the side of those they support … whereas all the time they try too often to demonise the other side.’ In view of the foregoing, IS2 notes that one of the Plateau disturbances had been misconstrued:
<disp-quote>
<p>When we hear about the attacks on Dogo Na Hauwa village we jump to conclusions and fail to look beyond the surface. But have we asked ourselves what happened previously? Fulani were massacred in Kuru Karama and the killings in Dogo Na Hauwa were reprisals for the killings of Kuru Karama.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A journalist in Abuja, IS7, also concurs that the media create negative pictures of the ‘other’: ‘to the South-West media the Hausa/Fulani are generally seen as the bad guys even when they are not and the impression has been created on the minds of their readers.’ And further backing this position, GS2, a female student of journalism, relays her experience: ‘I was born and bred in Jos and have Muslim friends, but at a point, due to the sort of reports I was reading about Muslims in newspapers I said I would stop keeping Muslim friends.’</p>
<p>But GS2 adds that she has since learnt not to see people as the stereotypes the media construct of them. IS6, a Human Rights activist, also argues that the media in Nigeria view things from their regional perspective: ‘If you read a paper owned by Southerners they never say anything good about the North. And if you read one that is owned by Northerners they say negative things about the South.’</p>
<p>IS3, a senior political correspondent, says images are negatively used to refer to people based on what they are thought to be or represent:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is the use of names that paint a bad picture. Like the Hausa/Fulani seen as metaphor for political domination. And there are words like militants, area boys and all these are negative reference to create an image of violent persons.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A female ex-editor, IS5, claims that some people are negatively branded due to their religious beliefs: ‘nothing good is reported about Muslims … Even Southern Muslims are getting the same treatment. It is like if it is a Muslim don’t celebrate him. In that respect you see that stereotype phenomenon.’</p>
<p>But GS3, an unemployed youth, does not think it is only Muslims that are negatively framed in the manner pointed out by IS5:
<disp-quote>
<p>They allow some writers or contributors to use the word <italic>arna</italic> (infidels) to refer to Christians, while Christian-owned media are used to refer to Muslims as terrorists or Hausa as <italic>malo</italic> (cow or animal). This is not good at all and should not be seen on the pages of newspapers or any media.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469909">Hackett (2003)</xref> argues that the media are extremely instrumental in shaping attitudes. IS5 corroborates this argument by suggesting that: ‘the longer you stay in this profession the more you realise that we actually mould opinion. The things we do impact on people’s lives more than we think.’ However, it will be quite helpful to refer to certain theories explaining how people’s actions/reactions might or might not be determined by the news reports they consume. This aspect of the article will be dealt with in the discussion section. In the meantime, we examine specific newspaper reports with a view to correlating or challenging the findings in this analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1750635212469909">
<title>Data analysis by means of CDA</title>
<p>In this analysis, three general trends were discovered in the 160 news stories, articles and opinions/letters to the editor that were studied. These were: (1) the use of labels/enemy images to demonise the other – these traits were more obvious in editorials and commentary columns than news stories as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635212469909">Ottosen (1995)</xref>; (2) finger-pointing (capable of escalating the conflict) was visible in news stories, editorials and commentary columns; and (3) exaggeration and/or understatement (either to emphasise their negatives or de-emphasise their positives) were also found in news stories, editorials and commentary columns. In at least half of the reports, it was found that each had one or more of these three trends, as almost all the reports/articles fitted into these categorisations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750635212469909">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>By means of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Van Dijk’s (2001)</xref> model, two articles – one by <italic>THISDAY</italic>, ‘How the Plateau became a tinderbox of ethno-religious strife’, and the other by <italic>Daily Trust</italic>, ‘Dear son of the soil’ – are analysed to classically illustrate how neutrality might have been jettisoned, leading to the possible use of enemy images and stereotypes. First, <italic>Daily Trust</italic> columnist Bala Muhammad’s ‘Dear son of the soil’ (<italic>Weekly Trust</italic>, 6 December 2008) began with:
<disp-quote>
<p>Last week in Jos, as ‘sons of the soil’ marauded around Gangare and Dilimi downtown on a murderous rampage, they were communicating with each other in Hausa, the language of their victims, the ‘settler’. Again, listening to the rulers of Plateau State, speaking in almost fluent Hausa on the media, the massive irony of it all is lost only on the most naive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In that opening statement, including the headline, at least five of Van Dijk’s features can be identified: (i) the use of topics and macropropositions (reference to marauders); (ii) local meanings (presupposition, labelling and polarising); (iii) hyperbole (marauding, murderous rampage); (iv) litotes (using stereotypes to demean); and (v) formal structures (rhetoric, uncontrollable mood/opinion). In the article, satire was used with precision, yet the mood and tone of the author could be noticed. The headline, itself, suggests a degree of mockery and labelling since the ‘indigenes’ often use the Hausa term <italic>dankasa</italic> (literarily meaning ‘son of the soil’) to refer to themselves, although it means indigenes or aborigines. So, the term was used in the piece to possibly label and mock them. The word ‘marauded’ must have been coined from marauder (meaning a raider, looter or an intruder – enemy images) to paint a negative picture of the ‘son of the soil’. It therefore seems both degrading and hyperbolising. There was stereotyping as the entire people were presented as murderers, raiders intent on raiding and perhaps exterminating their victims, the Hausa. The article could easily polarise and leave a negative impression of the other. Following a complete analysis of the article, it was realised the author used negative terms in the forms of labels/enemy images/stereotypes, etc. 41 times. They are as follows: son of the soil (9), settler/settled/migrant (24), rulers (1), so-called Middle Belt (1), indigene/indigenous (6).</p>
<p>Second, <italic>THISDAY</italic>’s article authored by its correspondent in Jos on 5 December 2008 carried the headline ‘How the Plateau became a tinderbox of ethno-religious strife’ and three separate quotes are considered below to illustrate the use of label or enemy images:</p>
<list id="list1-1750635212469909" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(a) Mercenaries from Kebbi, Katsina, Sokoto and Niger Republic turned out in large numbers to kill citizens of the state …</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) Over 80 houses … belonging to the Igbos and other citizens were razed to the ground.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(c) … and members of the PDP who felt that the Hausa-Fulani had no locus standi, as they are not originally from Jos-North, and indeed not from Plateau State.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In this case, too, there was the use of topics and macropropositions (mercenaries, kill citizens), local meanings (labels, not original, no locus standi), ‘subtle’ formal structures (uncontrollable feeling/tone), hyperbole (mercenaries in large number), litotes (not original, no locus standi), etc. The headline seems to be intended to create a grave picture and the use of ‘mercenaries’ in the text succeeds in this regard. There is also veiled stereotyping of people from Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi States and the neighbouring Niger Republic as they are presented as persons willing to be rented out to carry out mass murder. In the same way, there is polarisation as the author presented one side as the aggressor and the other as the aggressed. The use of the Latin term ‘no locus standi’ to refer to Hausa appears patronising as it is a legal term to mean having no ground, credibility or right to something. Hyperbole, it seems, is also applied in the claim that mercenaries were imported to give a picture of an invasion or a raid, just like Bala Muhammad’s use of ‘marauded’ in his article. The author used enemy frames, polarising or stereotyping words at least 20 times in the article. These words include: indigenes/indigenous/citizens of the state (8), settlers/settlement/settle (7), migrants/migrate (1), originally (1), mercenaries (1), other Christians/other citizens (2).</p>
<p>Another trend discovered in the reports was the preponderance of a journalistic process that seeks to shift the blame to the other side. Articles with this feature were categorised and analysed under the heading finger-pointing. <italic>THISDAY’s</italic> report ‘Dozens killed in Jos LG Election Riots’ (29 November 2008) was analysed first. In this article, the paper appears to have used terms suggesting conclusiveness and subjectivity, even though it did not show any evidence of a thorough independent check or credible sources but what it referred to as ‘eye witness account’. For example, the paper reported that supporters of the opposition All Nigerian People’s Party (ANPP) became violent after it was speculated ‘that their candidate, whom they said was leading the PDP candidate was about to be declared the loser’. In the report, both topics and macropropositions, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750635212469909">Van Dijk (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">2001</xref>), seem to be used. The paper appears also to be in breach of the rule of neutrality as it wrote ‘the council polls widely believed to have been won by the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Barrister Timothy Gyang Buba’ at a time when the results were being disputed by the opposition parties and there were protests/violence that had cost dozens of lives.</p>
<p><italic>Daily Trust</italic> also seems to have taken part in the dispute by pointing accusing fingers at the other side. For instance, its report ‘Plateau: Scores killed in council polls violence’ (<italic>Weekly Trust</italic>, 29 November 2008) stated that the crisis started following suspicion that the results were about to be manipulated by the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) to hand victory to a candidate despite what the paper claimed was an ‘unassailable lead’ by another candidate. It also reported attacks on places of worship and schools, but categorically named Al Bayan Islamic School (giving credence to suggestions that the paper is pro-Islamic, pro-North) as one of the damaged properties. And, like <italic>THISDAY</italic>, it did not mention a single credible source to support its claim nor did it mention carrying out an independent check but merely said ‘<italic>Weekly Trust</italic> gathered’. There appears to be the use of topics and macropropositions (suggesting manipulation of polls results), local meanings (polarising the conflict) and local context, lending itself to being a platform for propaganda.</p>
<p>There were also traits of exaggerations or understatements intended to either bloat or belittle. <italic>THISDAY</italic>, for example, in its report ‘Jos crisis: Yar’Adua shuns Jang’ sounds sympathetic to Governor Jang by presenting him as a victim of unfair treatment by President Yar’Adua. The paper wrote that: ‘President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua may have stylishly shunned Plateau State Governor Jonah Jang as he refused to grant the Governor audience yesterday.’ It suggests both the use of topics to draw attention and create relevance, and local meanings to polarise and hyperbolise the crisis.</p>
<p>Similarly, it looks as if <italic>Daily Trust</italic> employed hyperbole in its report ‘Police killed 90 youths in summary executions – Report’ published on 21 December 2008 in reference to the Human Rights Watch documentation of alleged extrajudicial killings during the crisis. Rather than present it as an allegation, the headline appears conclusive even though it was only a report by a neutral organisation based on eyewitness accounts that were either accurate or inaccurate.</p>
<p>These articles illustrate specific situations that confirm respondents’ suggestions that newspapers hardly refrain from being in breach of the rule of neutrality and, hence, objectivity – a prerequisite for effective, ethical practice. Rosen (Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005a: 203, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635212469909">Lynch and Galtung, 2010</xref>: 51) aptly defines objectivity as:
<disp-quote>
<p>the value of fairness, which is extremely important. It’s the ethic of restraining your own biases, which is also important … It’s the idea that journalism can’t be the voice of any particular party or sect.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Against the above backdrop, one is inclined to argue that neither of the two newspapers was able to uphold the virtues so clearly articulated in Rosen’s statement, and therefore practised the sort of journalism that lent itself to being the voice of only a section of the society. These issues will be discussed in more details in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This section attempts a more detailed corroboration of the findings of the main study by discussing the results of the CDA examination of <italic>THISDAY</italic> and <italic>Daily Trust</italic> newspapers’ reports during the conflict of November 2008 in relation to those of the main study. Thus, references will be made to the socio-cognitive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Van Dijk, 2001</xref>), which argues that topics symbolise the meaning or purpose of a discourse and are usually articulated in titles, headline summaries, abstracts, thematic sentences or conclusion and so on, while local meanings, under the overall control of global topics, are the sort of information that most directly manipulate the mental models and, as such, the opinions and attitudes of recipients; also that topics and local meanings are easily stored in recipients’ memories and reproduced whenever necessary and could have grave social consequences. References will also be made to media systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469909">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>) that suggests through political parallelism that the media reflect the political schisms in their environment. They also contend that ‘no analyst would argue that journalism anywhere in the world is literally neutral’ (p. 26). To support the suggestion for non-neutrality, we draw also from the framing theory argument that journalists acting under the influence of ‘frames sponsored by multiple social actors, including corporate and political elites, advocates and social movements’ turn news stories into a forum for frame contests wherein those actors struggle to define political issues from their own perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212469909">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>: 176). The media effects model will also be drawn into this discussion, especially its suggestion that people’s behaviour is directly influenced by the media and anti-social behaviour is usually a reflection of the consumption of negative media contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212469909">Gauntlett, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The first two write-ups were cited in an attempt to paint how newspapers used demonising pictures of the ‘other’ and, in the process polarised the conflict by making it look like a thing of ‘us’ and ‘them’. For example, in the commentary in <italic>Daily Trust</italic>, derogatory terms like ‘marauders’ were used repeatedly, including the catchy headline ‘Dear son of the soil’. <italic>THISDAY’s</italic> article had a similar use of demeaning adjectives like ‘mercenaries’ and phrases like ‘no locus standi’. In each case the intent, perhaps, was to manipulate the audience and influence their reaction to certain situations either now or in future. Topics and local meanings, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Van Dijk (2001)</xref> argues are easily stored in recipients’ memories and reproduced whenever necessary, were effectively deployed to achieve this objective. In the main study, it should be recalled, IS4 had warned that the representation of a rival or ‘the other’ with enemy images contributes to reinforcing prejudice against some people and increases the possibility of violence towards them. Similarly, GS1 had argued that ‘negative reports from Jos make us see Jos people as violent and hardly get our sympathy.’ IS5 had admitted that they, journalists, indeed shape people’s attitude: ‘the longer you stay in this profession, the more you realise that we actually mould opinion. The things we do impact on people’s lives more than we think.’ The above confession brings the message home if gauged against GS2’s statement that: ‘I … have Muslim friends, but at a point, due to the sort of reports I was reading about Muslims in newspapers I said I would stop keeping Muslim friends.’ The respondent’s point, here, is that newspapers had influenced her impression of and attitude towards some people.</p>
<p>Neutrality, an essential rule of practice journalism, remains an issue as both analyses suggest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469909">Hallin and Mancini (2004)</xref> argue that often the media are actively part of the political schisms in the environment they operate. Framing theory also postulates that journalists play into schisms by allowing sponsored frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212469909">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>) to determine the prisms through which political issues are defined and reported. The choice of language in all the samples in the CDA analysis might have been deliberate. In the first two articles, as explained earlier, derogatory terms were used with precision, while the next two samples show what looks like a swift assumption of a finger-pointing role. For example, <italic>THISDAY</italic> (29 November 2008) accused the opposition ANPP supporters of igniting the violence because ‘their candidate, whom they said was leading the PDP candidate, was about to be declared the loser’. And <italic>Daily Trust’s</italic> stable-mate (<italic>Weekly Trust</italic>, 29 November 2008) suggested that the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) was to blame for the crisis following suspicion that PLASIEC wanted to rob a candidate with an ‘unassailable lead’ of victory and hand it over to another candidate. In both reports, however, there were no credible sources to support their positions. But, clearly, they took sides rather than report the conflict as a neutral party. This also corroborates IS1’s statement that ‘It’s rare that you’ll find journalists that would acknowledge if there’s a wrong on the side of those they support.’ They go the extra mile to select certain information and exclude others so as to construct a convenient frame ‘to demonise the other side’, as IS1 added.</p>
<p>By selecting and emphasising, through hyperboles, certain information while deselecting or deemphasising others, via litotes, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Van Dijk (2001)</xref>, and further advanced by framing theory, the opinion of recipients of such information is swayed and, possibly, prejudice is reinforced, hate is stoked and conflict amplified. Van Dijk specifically expounds that, by using hyperboles, ‘their’ negatives are exaggerated, while ‘their’ positives are understated through litotes. From the use of terms like ‘marauders’ and ‘mercenaries’ in the first two articles to the second set in which the newspapers assumed the role of advocates for a group/sect as opposed to the other, up until the last two articles where exaggerations/understatements were sufficiently employed, there were efforts to manipulate the audience. For instance <italic>THISDAY’s</italic> report ‘Jos crisis: Yar’Adua shuns Jang’ blew up the matter out of proportion by suggesting even in the headline that the President had mistreated the Governor. Also, <italic>Daily Trust</italic> hyperbolised its report ‘Police killed 90 youths in summary executions – Report’. Although it was more appropriate for it to present it as an allegation at that time, it chose, rather, to exaggerate and make it look like it had been established, fully, that the police carried out the extrajudicial killings. Again, this confirms IS5’s position that they (journalists) mould attitudes and impact hugely on their audience.</p>
<p>It is imperative to note that, while the intent in those articles might be to shape people’s attitudes, the opinion-moulding prowess of newspapers in Nigeria appears a bit exaggerated. This is because of the low level of literacy in the country, which affects newspapers’ circulation figures, as only a small percentage of the population actually reads newspapers. But it is necessary to also refer to the argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212469909">Nyamnjoh (2005</xref>: 42) that people devise alternative means of accessing information when facing certain difficulties, and that pavement or clandestine media emerge under such circumstances as people utilise ‘clandestine radio and word of mouth; turn to or marry with alternative channels of communication such as the grapevine, political rumour, humour, parody, irony and derision’. Word of mouth travels quite fast; and rumour is a major issue in Nigeria. The violence of November 2002 often referred to as the <italic>THISDAY</italic> crisis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750635212469909">7</xref></sup> was escalated through word of mouth.</p>
<p>Whereas the media effects model presumes that people’s behaviour is directly influenced by the media and that anti-social behaviour is usually a reflection of the consumption of negative media contents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212469909">Gauntlett (1998)</xref> describes this approach as stereotypical and refers to a study by Hagell and Newburn (1994: 30), in which an attempt was made to trace the behaviour of 78 violent teenage offenders to media usage, by comparing them to more than 500 ordinary school pupils of similar age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212469909">Gauntlett (1998)</xref> notes that the researchers discovered that the violent behaviour of the teenage offenders had no connection with media usage as they watched less television and video than the other participants in the study and had no access to technology or any interest in violent programmes.</p>
<p>The above suggestion notwithstanding, sufficient attempts have been made in this section to corroborate findings in the two separate studies, showing how news reports are tailored to play into divisions in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469909">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>) and manipulate the audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469909">Van Dijk, 2001</xref>) with potentially serious social implications. This also correlates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469909">Hackett’s (2003)</xref> observation that the media are extremely instrumental in shaping attitudes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the examples highlighted in the two data analyses, it is helpful to draw attention to the demonising, polarising and hyperbolising roles of newspapers in the sectarian conflict of November 2008 in Jos. The sample of reports by <italic>THISDAY</italic> and <italic>Daily Trust</italic> analysed here differed principally due to the fact that the newspapers belong to two geo-political extremes in the country and this plays a major role in determining their choice of news values and presentation. Framing theory was cited earlier to explain how factors outside of the media set the agenda that determines the journalistic process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212469909">De Vreese et al. (2001</xref>: 108) boost that position by suggesting that: ‘The central dimension of a frame seems to be the selection, organisation, and emphasis of certain aspects of reality, to the exclusion of others.’ The sample, therefore, illustrates the use of labels/rhetoric/enemy images, hyperboles and litotes to demonise the other, polarise the conflict, misinform the audience and stoke hate with the possibility of amplifying the conflict. It also strengthens the earlier findings of the main study that newspapers reinforce prejudice by using enemy images and stereotypes, and take sides, especially during conflict, leading to the spread or escalation of violence.</p>
<p>IS4, acting on previous experience, had warned that, if the media continued to polarise conflicts by stereotypically ascribing the crimes of a handful of people to an entire tribe or group, they would be spreading hate and violence. The sectarian violence of November 2002 is an example of where news reports acted as a catalyst. It was not the first time media were blamed for fuelling sectarian violence through careless reporting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212469909">Ishaku (2009</xref>: 7) states that violence had followed <italic>Fun Times</italic> magazine’s (a stable-mate of <italic>Daily Times</italic>) report in which they alleged ‘Prophet Muhammad had an affair with a woman of easy virtue and later married her.’ And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469909">Hackett (2003</xref>: 58) explains that the violence, referred to as the <italic>Fun Times</italic> riot, took place in March/April 1991 in reaction to the report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212469909">Ishaku (2009)</xref> cites and that one Yakubu Yahaya, a follower of the national Shi’ite religious leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, had led thousands of supporters to burn down the office of the government-owned <italic>Daily Times</italic>. The riots spread to Kaduna, Kano and Sokoto.</p>
<p>While newspapers (media) have not been directly accused of igniting the November 2008 sectarian violence, analysis of reports in this article can be correlated with suggestions by participants in the main study to conclude that: (a) the reportage of the two newspapers differed due to their regional and religious affiliations; (b) they (the newspapers) used polarising terms to make the crisis a thing of ‘us’ and ‘them’; (c) enemy images and stereotypes were employed to demonise the other; (d) the audience are aware of the use of such images to influence their impression of the other; (e) ‘otherness’ is a major feature of cultural and political differences between the two divides, North and South, or Islam and Christianity; (f) the media fall into this classification of ‘otherness’ and constitute a primary site for its expression and in the process they spread and/or amplify the violence; and (g) in order to transform the situation there is a need for the media to refrain from providing a platform for promoting negative, hate campaigns. This can be achieved if they heed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635212469909">Lynch and Galtung’s (2010</xref>: 51) advice that in journalism ‘objectivity, balance and truth are like motherhood and apple pie’. The three are inseparable and each one complements the others. Also, very importantly, they must reject the idea that journalism can be the voice of one particular group as opposed to others.</p>

<p>The conflict referred to as the ‘<italic>THISDAY</italic> crisis’ followed an article by <italic>THISDAY</italic>’s style writer, Isioma Daniel. Daniel had reportedly lived in Britain and was probably not quite aware of the sensitive nature of religion in Nigeria. In a bid to advance arguments to support the hosting of the Miss World Beauty Pageant, the journalist wrote in the article that even Prophet Muhammad (SAW) would not mind taking one of the contestants as a wife. Most Muslims interpreted this as very derogatory and offensive. But hoodlums took advantage to unleash mayhem.</p></fn>
