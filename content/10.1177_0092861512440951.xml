               <italic>Objective:</italic> The purpose of the study was to compare revised and current ibuprofen over-the-counter (OTC) allergy alerts for usability, readability, and overall preferences in consumers naive to drug allergies and drug-induced allergy survivors. <italic>Methods:</italic> Label comprehension studies in naive consumers and survivors used standard measures for usability, readability, and preferences to rate new versus current content and format regarding time of onset, onset after prior safe use, syndrome name, progressive nature, symptoms, and use of capital letters. <italic>Results:</italic> The revised allergy alert was statistically superior to the current alert as reported by all participants for overall preference, most new key content elements, and usefulness for first-time users (for each, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Survivors agreed the new alert applied to their drug allergy experience (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). <italic>Conclusions:</italic> There is a gap of key information in the current OTC ibuprofen allergy alerts, demonstrating the need for revision of the OTC Drug Facts label.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Drug-induced allergies (DIAs) are rare, unpredictable, and potentially life threatening, even if medications have been taken safely before. DIAs include delayed T cell–mediated hypersensitivity reactions that often involve the skin, starting with minor symptoms that can quickly progress to more serious conditions such as erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512440951">1</xref>
            </sup>  </p>
         <p>SJS and TEN can be difficult to diagnose initially because they may manifest with symptoms for which the associated medicine is self-selected or prescribed (eg, flu-like prodome of malaise and fever) before the rash appears.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512440951">2</xref>
            </sup> By the time the emerging DIA is identified correctly and appropriate therapy is administered, the reaction may have progressed to more severe stages of blisters, skin redness, mouth sores, and/or swelling of the cheeks, lips, eyes, and tongue. In extreme presentations, skin sloughing may ensue, involving 10% to 30% of the body surface area of TEN patients. Hence, early recognition of an emergent DIA is essential to improve odds of successful treatment. EM, SJS, and TEN are rare. It has been estimated that 1% of all dermatological outpatient visits are for EM.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512440951">3</xref>
            </sup> Based on Medicaid billing, Strom et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512440951">4</xref>
            </sup> estimated the incidence of SJS to be 2.6 to 7.1 cases per million per year. The mean age of onset is 45 years, and women account for over 60% of cases.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512440951">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512440951">6</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>DIA warnings are found in the labeling of over 100 medicines, including sulfa-antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512440951">7</xref>

            </sup> In 2005, a Citizen Petition from physicians, researchers, and patients requested changes to prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ibuprofen allergy alerts to include naming SJS and TEN in the alert and emphasizing rashes and blisters as listed symptoms, as well as printing a black-box warning on prescription products and in Dear Health Professional letters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512440951">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512440951">12</xref>
            </sup> The FDA accepted portions of the proposed labeling of the Citizen Petition and made modest changes to the OTC ibuprofen allergy alert. Neither the petitioners nor FDA provided empirical evidence for the proposed or modified (ie, current) ibuprofen allergy alerts.</p>

            </sup> Ibuprofen was switched from prescription to OTC status in 1983, for which a simplified testing of a “laundry list of warnings” versus major warnings was done, although never published. During the development of the OTC Drug Facts label in the mid-1990s, there was no formal testing of the OTC allergy alert itself. It was not until 2002 in preparation for an FDA advisory committee considering OTC drug-induced organ toxicity that an OTC pharmaceutical company conducted a consumer assessment of the OTC ibuprofen label.<sup>

            </sup> Results of this study have limited application due to potential investigator bias of in-person survey interviews, lack of specific questioning on different content elements of the allergy alert, and lack of input from persons who had experienced DIAs. </p>
         <p>In this context, our research explores the following questions: (1) How do DIA survivors describe their earliest DIA symptoms and those that caused them to seek medical help? (2) Do the revised and current ibuprofen allergy alerts have similar utility in terms of eliciting the correct intended action step to an emergent DIA scenario? (3) Does the revised allergy alert outperform the current alert, in terms of other usability parameters, including reported usefulness for first-time ibuprofen users, coverage of most DIA symptoms as reported by DIA survivors, and overall preference?</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>This research was undertaken under institutional review board approval in 3 parts: (1) online descriptive survey of DIA survivors, (2) in-person LCS of naive consumers who reported never having had a DIA, and (3) online LCS of DIA survivors. </p>
         <p>The online descriptive survey was fielded through email solicitation by the SJS Foundation (Denver, Colorado). Inclusions were self-reported physician diagnosis of a DIA, &gt;18 years of age, and not a health professional. Survey development was informed by a literature review and online drug information resources to identify DIA symptoms and those prompting medical attention, as well as timing of DIA onset relative to exposure and whether DIAs occur after first or multiple exposure and demographics. The in-person LCS in naive consumers was fielded at a local community center using a US$5.00 gift card incentive. Inclusion criteria were no self-reported physician-diagnosed DIA, 18 to 90 years of age, and ability to read English in 6-point Helvetica with or without corrective lenses.  The online DIA survivor LCS included those &gt;18 years of age with a self-reported physician diagnosis of SJS and/or TEN.</p>
         <p>For the in-person LCS, naive consumers were randomly given 1 of 2 versions of an actual OTC ibuprofen 100 carton: a currently marketed version and one with the revised allergy alert in similar format and font. Naive consumers were first shown the following scenario: “A woman, Dolores, used ibuprofen safely before, when she had a headache several days ago. On Saturday, she had another headache and took another dose of ibuprofen. Several hours later, Dolores awoke from a nap. Her eyes felt puffy to her, and she noted in the mirror that she had a blister on her lower lip. What should Dolores do?” For the online LCS, handling an ibuprofen carton was not possible to assess ease of finding the alert; it was also not possible to randomly assign online participants to different alerts. Hence, only the revised alert was tested in DIA survivors using the “Dolores” scenario. Symptoms chosen for the scenario appear in both the revised and current alerts. Pretest of the scenario in a subgroup of 5 SJS survivors indicated the emergent scenario included what might be considered minor symptoms.</p>
         <p>The utility criterion for correct intended action (ie, correct action utility) was defined at 80% for correct responses regarding intention to stop use and seek medical help in response to the “Dolores” mild symptom scenario. Tied to this utility measure were assessments of understandability (all participants) and ease of finding the warning on the carton (naive consumers only). Additional usability parameters were derived from queries on which alert would be more useful for first-time users of ibuprofen (all participants), whether DIA survivors reported the revised alert covered most of their DIA symptoms and whether they would have sought medical help sooner with the revised warning (DIA survivors), and preferences for key content elements (KCEs) added from the results of the descriptive survey (all respondents). All participants made side-by-side assessments of overall preference.</p>
         <p>Primary measures for all participants were correct action utility, usefulness for first-time users, and overall preference. For DIA survivors, another primary measure was whether the revised alert covered most of their DIA symptoms. Response formats were Likert scales, single categorical responses (eg, yes/no/uncertain; alert A/alert B/uncertain), and open-ended questions. </p>
         <p>Analytics included descriptive statistics; 2-sided, 1-sample <italic>z</italic> test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests of Likert scale questions and simultaneous 95% confidence intervals of proportion preferring the revised versus existing label (using the F distribution approximation and Bonferroni adjustment); and the Fisher exact test.<sup>

            <title>Online Descriptive Study of DIA Signs and Symptoms</title>
            <p>Fifty-five percent of contacted SJS Foundation members (n = 261) responded to the online descriptive survey. Ninety-one were excluded: 37 with uncertain or no self-reported physician diagnosis, 20 health professionals, and 34 who reported not seeing the first DIA symptoms. The remainder (n = 170) was composed of 2 subgroups: (1) 33 NSAID DIAs (8 ibuprofen alone, 14 ibuprofen and aspirin and/or naproxen, and 11 other), and (2) 137 non-NSAID DIAs (100 antibiotic DIA, 23 anticonvulsant DIA, and 14 other DIA). The NSAID DIA subgroup included 27 SJS, 4 TEN, and 9 SJS/TEN survivors. Most DIA survivors were female (81%), spoke English as a first language (100%), did not consider or were uncertain the first symptoms were a DIA (75%), thought their first DIA symptoms were mild (52%), and reported their symptoms progressed to a severity needing medical help (100%).  </p>
            <p>The NSAID and non-NSAID subgroups reported first symptoms within a few minutes to 1 day (49% NSAID ibuprofen, 24% non-NSAID), 2 to 7 days (23% NSAID, 27% non-NSAID), or more than a week postexposure (20% NSAID, 45% non-NSAID); the remainders were uncertain. Both subgroups reported similar prior use to first DIA intervals (ie, about 26% after the first dose, 27% after the second dose, and 53% of the remainder after 10 or more days of use). </p>
            <p>Frequently reported first signs/symptoms and those for which medical help was sought for both subgroups included rash, skin reddening, blisters, swelling of parts of the face, and hives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512440951">Table 2</xref>). Certain symptoms when medical help was sought had higher mention rates including general ill feeling, fever, and mouth sores. All regions of the skin were eventually involved for all survivors; regions of the face were &gt;70% of mentions.</p>

Exclusions were 38 dropouts before answering questions, 70 health professionals, and 21 with uncertainty if they had a DIA. Most were middle aged and female, had graduated college or technical school, and were white (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512440951">Table 3</xref>). Most reported that before their DIA episode, (1) they never suspected a DIA would happen to them (93% for all DIA survivors; not shown), (2) they never realized how serious a DIA could be (95%), and (3) they were not likely or uncertain they would read the allergy alert before using ibuprofen the first time (55%).</p>

Most participants gave the correct intended action for the “Dolores” scenario, with lower percentages among DIA survivors possibly due to the online survey setting being conducive to longer explanations (privacy and keyboard) and/or their reliving (as some said) their own delay in seeking help.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This research is the first to use DIA survivor input to create an improved evidence-based allergy alert for OTC NSAIDs. From the pooled LCS data, over 90% favored the revised alert, 84% rated the revised alert more useful for first-time ibuprofen users, over 95% rated the 2 primary KCEs (ie, can occur hours to days after use and even if used safety before) as important content in the alert, and over 92% of DIA survivors reported the revised alert covered most of their DIAs. The revised alert performed better than the current alert on ease of finding possibly due to prominence from greater size despite similar location on the carton as the current alert.</p>
         <p>Before experiencing their DIAs, survivors do not believe a DIA will happen to them and do not understand its potential severity. This is supported by the significantly lower proportions of naive consumers rating certain KCEs as important (ie, the concept of the DIA progressing to severe and the word “life-threatening”). After taking the survey, many naive consumers engaged the researchers asking for SJS-related information. When told SJS is life threatening, they asked to change their answers, which was not permitted. This suggests KCE importance ratings may be underemphasized by naive consumers.</p>
         <p>DIAs are unpredictable and potentially serious. The best protection for a consumer is the availability of a capable medical team, which can act swiftly to contain worsening side effects. A key element of this process is the medicine label, which is usually accessible during use for OTC medicines through primary container labeling. Hence, providing consumers essential information about emergent side effects creates the best opportunity for a consumer to realize the potential severity of early milder manifestations of a serious DIA and to know what the appropriate action should be in the event of DIA symptom emergence. SJS/TEN survivors are among those in the best position to provide relevant information on emergent side effects relating to allergies. Heretofore, LCSs have largely been designed by health professionals and tested in naive consumers or an undocumented mix of naive consumers and those who may have had a drug side effect. Consideration should be given to adding a recommendation in the FDA’s LCS guidance that would cite the potential importance of including enriched samples of individuals with prior relevant adverse drug experiences pertinent to the drug labeling question under review.</p>
         <p>Utility and other usability measures were used to (1) assess correct intended action, ease of finding, ease of understanding, and for a possible emergent DIA; and (2) determine participants’ attitudes about potential usefulness for first-time users and whether the revised alert addressed most of the DIA survivors’ symptoms. These measures have not been validated in prospective studies, which would not likely be feasible due to the low frequency of DIAs. Nevertheless, they represent a logical framework. We recommend the construction of scenarios with milder forms of emergent side effects and with a lower acceptance criterion (ie, about 80%). We postulate that the higher “correct intended action” ratings for naive consumers are related to their ability to more easily assume Dolores’ persona because unlike DIA survivors, they are not conflicted by their own experience with an actual severe DIA. Further, one can reasonably argue that waiting to see if the mild symptoms progress before seeking medical help is not necessarily an incorrect answer to such a scenario because making that decision after reading the label alerts the consumer and initiates a decision-making process. Indeed, if the 10 survivors who reported wait-and-see are counted as correct, the DIA survivor group rating of correct intended action for the milder emergent DIA scenario is 92% and in the range reported by naive consumers. </p>
         <p>Notably, most naive consumers report they would likely not read the allergy alert before taking an OTC NSAID for the first time. Also, most DIA survivors never thought a DIA would happen to them nor realized the potential severity of a DIA. This is not surprising. Other work has demonstrated a major medication information gap in the United States, including nationally representative work showing that 50% of consumers 50% or less of the time read and/or keep the retail drug monograph disseminated at the time of dispensing each prescription medication.<sup>

            </sup> Our reading of the many anecdotal descriptions in the open-ended components of the DIA survivor studies has highlighted for us the potentially very grave and life-changing nature of DIAs from NSAIDs and many other medicines. We urge that attention be given to public education campaigns to raise awareness of DIAs among consumers. Similar campaigns to health professionals would also be appropriate, given that 61% of DIA survivors in the descriptive survey reported their condition was misdiagnosed. </p>

            <title>Limitations</title>
            <p>The LCSs in naive consumers were powered to yield statistically significant differences but not necessarily to be nationally representative of the general population. Our central objective was to raise awareness about incorporating the voice of those who have experienced a drug side effect into any proposed safety-related drug labeling improvements. Using a literate study population permitted this issue to be conveniently addressed. However, with regard to less literate consumers, it is relevant that both alerts are written at about the same reading grade level, and the FDA has deemed the current alert as appropriate for general use. Nevertheless, given the overwhelming support from both naive consumers and DIA survivors to expand medically relevant content of the ibuprofen allergy alert, there is reason to consider expanding this study to ensure lower literacy groups not only understand, but offer feedback on, the expanded content of the revised alert.  </p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Inclusion of the documented experience of individuals who have experienced a drug side effect, in this case a DIA, has been shown to be a fruitful way to enrich OTC drug labeling with relevant information for naive consumers who might experience a rare, potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction. The FDA guidance on LCSs should specifically embrace this approach, and the OTC ibuprofen allergy alert should be revised with information on time of onset, progression of severity, DIA risk even if the product has been used safely before, other symptoms, and selective use of all capital letters.</p>
