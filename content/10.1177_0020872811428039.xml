<p>“The aim of human rights, if I may borrow a term from engineering, is to move beyond the design and drawing-board phase, to move beyond thinking and talking about the foundations stones - to laying those foundation stones, inch by inch, together.”</p>
<attrib>Mary Robinson, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</attrib>

<p>On 1st October, 2011 I had the honor of attending an event titled <italic>Our Bodies, Our Future: Advancing Health and Human Rights For Women and Girls</italic> which was held in Boston Massachusetts. This global symposium celebrated the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the release of the landmark book “Our Bodies, Ourselves”, or OBOS as it is now called. The event was attended by close to 700 women and men (both in the audience and viewing globally) and provided a space for a full range of discussions of human rights for women and girls; from the ability to climb a tree to sitting in the board room.</p>
<p>The symposium was attended by women from Israel, Armenia, Serbia, Japan, Tanzania, Turkey, Moldova, New Zealand, Bulgaria, Nepal, Senegal, Holland, India, Palestine, Uganda, Chile, Puerto Rico and the United States. The day was one of optimism, and hope. It stimulated new ideas, shared collective knowledge and was a call for action for women and girls to transform how they share information transgenerationally and globally.</p>
<p>Joan Ditzion, MSW, a social work colleague and one of the three social workers who were part of the original 14 founders of the Boston’s Women’s Health Book Collective (BWHBC), the precursor of OBOS, in an article entitled “Celebrating 40 years of Women’s Empowerment and Activism”, described the 1960’s and early 1970’s as a time of enormous global political and social change which gave those women and girls who were actively participating in the collective, a sense of optimism that they could change oppressive and sexist institutions. Women activists, meeting in consciousness raising groups around the world began to question sexism and what had been their “traditional” roles as women. Women’s bodies were and still are, often wrapped in invisibility and silence. Women were viewed and viewed themselves as having no intrinsic value, inferior to men, the “other” sex, and objects to please men. This book, which was initially published as a news print pamphlet “Women and Their Bodies” and became “Our Bodies, Ourselves”, has been translated into over 25 languages.</p>
<p>At the celebration on Saturday, Bylle Avery, founder of the Black Women’s Health Imperative, said: “When you are doing what is good for yourself as women, you are doing what is right for others and the world; and there is a need for a collective consciousness change. People have become complacent and we need to have a continual fire in our bellies and in our souls as it relates to the women’s health movement. Where is the anger and where is the fire? That the women present and around the world are the ones we have been waiting for!”</p>
<p>Adrienne Germain, President Emerita of the International Women’s Health Coalition, in her remarks offered some dire and alarming global statistics such as:</p>

<p>There is a continued and urgent need to:</p>

<list-item><p>Support women to mobilize access to information which is a human right;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Need to revolutionize how countries invest in health care for women;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Invest in new generations -1/3 of the world is under the age of 19.</p></list-item>

<p>Girl power initiatives in Pakistan, Peru and Brazil are helping both girls and boys to create civil societies. The rampant sexualization and sexualized images of women and girls negatively affect their mental and physical health. Organizations such as SparkaMovement are transitioning from women’s empowerment to girls empowerment and developing Girl Activist training.</p>
<p>Globally women are examining what it means to be gender minorities and why women’s distinct health needs/issues are more readily recognized during a woman’s reproductive period.</p>
<p>The African Feminist Forum examined the intersection of the economic, political and health and sexual rights as key human rights. OBOS 40 provides women with the tools to resist and power to seek help; develop community specific content; assume individual versus collective responsibility for women’s health which leads to individual, group and collective empowerment, and entrepreneurship. It is women centered, evidence based, and not “all knowing”.</p>
<p>Forty years after the publication of OBOS much of the world is still unfriendly to women: there is a need build alliances with younger men to join in solidarity in advocating for women’s rights for the goal of healthier lives. Human rights activism is political activism. Loretta Ross, national coordinator, SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice, said: “40 years ago OBOS spawned a transnational movement.” IFSW’s International Policy on Women states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>5.1 Women’s rights are human rights. To the extent that women and girls do not enjoy equal rights, their common human needs, and those of their families, will not be fully met and their human potential will not be fully realized. Therefore, the social work profession’s core commitment to human rights must involve a commitment to protecting and preserving the basic rights of all women and girls. Women of all ages and at all stages of the life cycle deserve protection from discrimination in all forms, including the elimination of all forms of gender-specific discrimination and violence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Speaking together propels us from a sense of isolation into a time of optimism and hope and stimulates new ways of acting on our collective knowledge. We all must speak out for what is right, louder than those who are shouting for what is wrong. Sexual and reproductive rights are basic human rights. Women’s bodies are the first place for women to exercise their rights…civil and human!</p>
