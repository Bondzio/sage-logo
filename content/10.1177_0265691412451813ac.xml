<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813ac"><title>Barbara H. Stein and Stanley J. Stein, <italic>Edge of Crisis: War and Trade in the Spanish Atlantic, 1789–1808</italic>, The Johns Hopkins University Press: Baltimore, MD, 2009; 640 pp.; 9780801890468, $79.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This is the third volume in the Steins’ panoramic survey of the economic and political history of Spain and its Atlantic empire over the course of the eighteenth century. The first volume, <italic>Silver, Trade, and War</italic> was remarkable for its clear, rigorous analysis of the colonial economy and the generation of political economists whose careers overlapped with the War of Spanish Succession. The second volume, <italic>Apogee of Empire</italic>, was notable for its contentious argument concerning the timing, intensity, and goals of the crown reformers during the reign of Charles III (1759–88). In this third volume, <italic>Edge of Crisis</italic>, the Steins have produced a work of staggering erudition, destined to transform scholarly understanding of the reign of Charles IV and the Spanish Atlantic economy in the period leading up to the two inter-linked crises of 1808: the occupation of Spain by French armies, and the abdication of the Bourbon kings, as well as the ricochet effects this produced in the New World, where the unprecedented crisis of sovereignty began separatist struggles which ultimately unravelled the empire. In this volume, at least, the Steins do not take the story beyond 1808, but rather seek to draw attention to the fissures developing in the preceding two decades. In Stanley Stein’s formulation, ‘empires do not collapse; they crack, crumble at the edges, and erode as they fade away’ (x).</p>
<p>At the heart of their 600-page book is a story of how the bureaucratic stability and burgeoning transatlantic trade that had categorized the last decade of Charles III’s reign was undermined by an array of forces, ranging from the massive dislocations caused by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary wars, changing diplomatic alliances, personal rivalries at court, and broader (structural) economic forces, including the impact of policy shifts such as the decree of <italic>comercio libre</italic> (free commerce). What is most impressive is the assiduous attention the Steins pay to how different factors – ideological, personal, intellectual, political, military – influenced various aspects of the economic relations between colony and metropole: mining, export agriculture, commerce, and industry.</p>
<p>In many respects, the Steins’ book is a series of meticulously crafted case studies, unified by a general vision of imperial decomposition. They discuss watershed moments like the decision by the crown in the late 1790s to sanction <italic>comercio neutro</italic> (commerce with neutral states), which not only dismantled the legal commercial monopoly long claimed by Spain, but also unleashed an unprecedented torrent of smuggling in the Caribbean, difficult to keep out once conditions changed. One of the golden threads of their book is how policy was constrained by the dictates and demands of war. Here the case study approach reveals its strength, as the Steins reconstruct the decision-making process and the ‘official mind’ of Bourbon colonialism. Among the other outstanding features of <italic>Edge of Crisis</italic> is its masterly description of the court intrigues involving Godoy in the years leading up to the occupation of Spain by Napoleon’s armies. These intrigues are often recounted in convoluted fashion by political historians, or have suffered under the tabloid treatment of court historians. The Steins manage to situate the seemingly personal disputes compellingly against a backdrop of impending imperial crisis. Also commendable is the use of French sources, especially those which shed light on the motivations and intentions of Napoleon and his lieutenants.</p>
<p>While the Steins do tell an Atlantic story – how the different parts of the empire exerted a major force on one another – it is largely limited to New Spain (modern Mexico) and Cuba. It is unclear whether it is wise to allow analysis of the dynamics in New Spain to serve as a proxy for the empire as a whole. As other recent historians have noted, including Jeremy Adelman in his 2006 landmark <italic>Sovereignty and Revolution</italic>, the last decades of the eighteenth century were a dynamic period in areas of the Spanish empire far from the core viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru. Asymmetrical development, galvanized by the slave trade, meant that the Southern Atlantic world was flourishing on its own when the political crisis of 1808 hit. The Steins’ assumption, that peninsular relations with New Spain are representative of a broader dynamic elsewhere in South America, is far from self-evident.</p>
<p>Like the previous two volumes in the trilogy, <italic>Edge of Crisis</italic> is defined by the richness of the archival research, the acuity of the historical analysis, and the high quality of its prose. It is not, however, an easy read, and the argument often gets lost amidst the wealth of data. But it will prove invaluable for any scholar seeking to understand the dynamics at play in the Spanish empire on the eve of its disintegration.</p>
