<p>The advent of the Internet has changed the way in which buyers and sellers interact. Although access to information seems unlimited, nonexpert agents find it difficult to identify the information they can use with confidence. A third-party expert, or cybermediary (online intermediary), can help sort out the information for the potential buyers. In this article, we study the case of the online hotel market. We claim that online travel agents (OTAs) such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> play an important role in building hotel reputation and encourage hoteliers to put effort into service quality. We provide empirical evidence that information supplied by past guests through the OTA generates a price premium for hotels with good reputations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The adverse selection or “lemons” problem, first noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400611">Akerlof’s (1970)</xref> seminal paper, arises when there is asymmetric information in a market: buyers do not have information on the quality of the goods sold in the market whereas sellers do. The result is that buyers only pay low prices and sellers only sell low-quality products or services (e.g., “lemons” in the used-car market). The adverse selection problem and its inevitable market inefficiency are more common in markets where buyers cannot inspect the quality of the good (“kick the tires”). One example of such markets is the hotel market, where guests often cannot inspect the quality of the service at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>A firm’s reputation for quality can compensate for this inefficiency and contribute to the firm’s profitability and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400611">Klein and Leffler 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400611">Shapiro 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400611">Kreps 1990</xref>). Firms may build their reputation by horizontal increase of their output, as large chains do (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400611">Guttman and Yacouel 2006</xref>). This option is common in the hotel market and promotes reputation in two different ways. First, guests may diversify, choosing different locations each time they travel, but still book from the same trusted chain, and second, when many people are familiar with a chain, they tell their friends, and those friends tell their friends, and soon this information is available to many potential future guests. Another option for mitigating the adverse selection problem is to sell goods through intermediaries such as dealers (travel agents) or professional certifiers (star-ranking systems). In addition to assisting in the search and matching process, intermediaries also provide information on firm quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511400611">Diamond (1984)</xref> was the first to suggest reputation as a coherent explanation for the existence of financial intermediaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400611">Biglaiser (1993)</xref> showed how an expert middleman can improve product quality and total market welfare when adverse selection is present.</p>
<p>The advent of the Internet has improved buyers’ access to information. However, they still have a difficult time sorting out the reliable data. Internet sites such as eBay, where people share their satisfaction from a transaction conducted through the site, may serve as a reputation system for both buyers and sellers. In their review of 15 papers studying the effect of eBay’s reputation system on transaction outcome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511400611">Resnik et al. (2006)</xref> found that buyers pay more to sellers with a better reputation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400611">Melnik and Alm (2002)</xref> reported that the difference between 452 positive comments and one positive comment yields a price premium of 5%.</p>
<p>The hotel market is a global one, extending both geographically and culturally, in which transaction and consumption differ in both time and place. The information is asymmetric and in many cases, transactions do not repeat themselves. Thus, we would expect prospective tourists to have very little information on a hotel’s quality (except for cases of repeat visits, e.g., business tourists). In this case, adverse selection might occur, meaning that hotels with high-quality service cannot charge higher prices than low-quality hotels and, therefore, will eventually provide only low-quality service. To avoid this “lemons” problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400611">Akerlof 1970</xref>), national five-star rating systems were developed. However, these rating systems reflect mainly physical attributes, they are not always reliable, and each country can choose different standards for them. Before the advent of the Internet, the traditional travel agent and tour operators served as intermediaries between hoteliers and prospective guests, helping with the search and match process, and thus mitigating the information problem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511400611">Clerides et al. (2008)</xref> examined the role of tour operators as quality assessors in the offline hotel market: they found that the tour operators’ rating of hotels was better matched with prices than with the national five-star system.</p>
<p>The Internet provides consumers with a lower cost, more effective way of gathering information. Today, transactions in the hotel market are conducted both online and offline. However, online trading is rapidly gaining importance, with online travel agents (OTAs) replacing traditional ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287511400611">Kuom and Oertel 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400611">Buhalis and Licata 2002</xref>). Today’s consumers can easily, and at almost no cost, observe hotel attributes online, thus lowering the cost of searching and matching. The Internet enables consumers to book a hotel room directly through the hotel’s web page or via an OTA such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Expedia.com">Expedia.com</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link>. Consumers can easily find most of the information they need online to compare hotel attributes and choose the most suitable one for them (information such as prices, star rating, location, facilities, and so on). However, consumers still find it hard to trust information appearing on the hotels’ or tourists’ sites (e.g., Tripadviser), especially information regarding hotels’ past performance (e.g., hotels’ reputation for service quality), since anyone can write a review on these sites, including the hoteliers themselves.</p>
<p>A more reliable source for reviews of hotels’ past performance is the OTA. We claim that OTAs provide the prospective guests with a reliable channel through which to track hoteliers’ past service quality. This enhances the hotelier’s incentive to put effort into service quality and, consequently, increases the profitability of both hotels and OTAs. We claim that one main role of cybermediaries is to provide buyers of experienced goods with reliable information regarding sellers’ past performance. Other roles may be to provide packages of complementary products, mitigate sellers’ risk, and help in the searching and matching process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511400611">Jin and Kato 2006</xref>). This source of reliable information enhances the sellers’ incentive to put effort into improving the good’s quality and thus the level of welfare.</p>
<p>There is a strong relationship between reputation and trust. Trust may be based on personal familiarity (which is more common with social relationships) or on reputation, which is the economic reasoning for why agents respect agreements in order to enjoy future profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511400611">Ba and Pavlou 2002</xref>). In our case, if the hotelier has a reputation for high-quality service, the travelers will trust him, and be willing to pay a price premium. The economic reasoning for hoteliers to actually provide the high-quality service is based on availability and credibility of information. We suggest the OTA as a credible channel.</p>
<p>How does this process work? OTAs publish reviews from past guests who booked a hotel room through them. OTAs only allow guests who actually stayed at the hotel to write reviews. Thus, unreliable reviews only rarely penetrate the OTAs’ websites. The OTAs also monitor the hotel descriptions published on their websites, ensuring that the hotels’ actual informative data match those that are published. Why do the OTAs make this effort to monitor the data? Or in other words, who monitors the monitor? An OTA conducts transactions with a large number of tourists and hoteliers; its relationship with both groups of players repeats itself. If an OTA does not deliver reliable information, it will lose future customers. Thus, the mechanism that guarantees the OTA’s credibility is the OTA’s own reputation. Since the hoteliers’ behavior is immediately observed by the hotel guests, the hoteliers now have an incentive to expend extra effort in serving them. As a result, the OTAs enhance service quality in the hotel market, and the hoteliers are compensated by being able to charge higher prices.</p>
<p>In the online hotel market, similar to eBay, even though the incentive for free-riding is clear, guests still provide feedback. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400611">Bronner and de Hoog (2011)</xref>, in their review of the different motivations for participating in electronic word-of-mouth channels, presented 37 specific motivations. A few of these were: a sense of belonging, affiliation, a sense of community, and the responsibility of quality control in the online environment. In the case of eBay, it was found that there is a tendency to write positive feedback: only 2% of the feedback was negative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400611">Bajari and Hortaçsu (2004)</xref> explained this as being due to fear of retaliation by the sellers, since sellers can write feedback on buyers as well. This is not the case in the hotel market. Hotels do not write feedback and there is therefore no reason not to write a negative review. Moreover, in many cases, this is a one-time transaction and thus guests are not engaged in a strategic game. Based on these observations, there is no incentive to publish only positive or nonreliable feedback. This is a more reliable source of information since, as we show later, these online agencies have incentive to supply reliable data.</p>
<p>Despite the accumulation of studies on the role of online travel intermediaries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400611">Buhalis and Licata, 2002</xref>) on one hand and on the role of online reviews in markets such as eBay (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400611">Bajari and Hortaçsu 2004</xref>) on the other, the roles of OTAs and the reviews they publish in the hotel market have never been studied. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400611">Vermeulen and Seegers (2009)</xref> did study the role of online hotel reviews on consumer choice, they focused only on the relationship between reviews and the likelihood of a hotel being chosen. They found that good reviews improve the chances of a hotel being chosen.</p>
<p>This article seeks to establish the role of OTAs in the online hotel market. We want to show that by revealing the hotel’s level of service quality to future customers by publishing review scores from past guests, OTAs can mitigate the adverse selection problem by affecting both the market price and service quality. This is done by:</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>The purpose of the model presented here is to show that OTAs produce a price premium for high-quality service, compared to standard travel agents (TAs). Before the formulation of the mathematical model, we provide a description of the assumptions and structure of the model. We follow the common practice in mathematical modeling in economics by making assumptions that simplify the more complex reality, allowing us to focus on the specific core problem under study. These assumptions enable us to develop a parsimonious model that focuses on hotel reputation. This parsimony comes at some cost, as the model does not take into consideration horizontal differentiations (how the guests’ preferences affect their choices and the price they are willing to pay). However, a more complex model with different types of guests will not yield qualitatively better results.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400611">Klein and Leffler (1981)</xref>, there has been much theoretical literature on the reputation mechanism, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400611">Shapiro (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400611">Kreps (1990)</xref>, and many others.</p>
<p>The model presented here is a simplification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400611">Tirole’s (1996)</xref> basic reputational model, adjusted to the case of the online hotel market. The reputational mechanism, in all of these studies, is based on the availability of past information. Without sufficient information, a reputation cannot be maintained. In our study, the information of past service quality is available through guests’ reviews on OTA websites, and that is how the hotel’s reputation is built and maintained.</p>
<p>Let us assume only two possible cases for booking a hotel room: through a traditional TA or online, through an OTA. When a guest books a hotel through a TA, the TA offers a hotel that suits the guest’s requirements. However, since the TA is local and relatively small, the guest needs to rely on the agent’s, or friends’, past experience with that hotel, which in many cases is not extensive. Since the guest does not have a reliable channel to count on, she or he can only expect a standard hotel and that is what she or he is willing to pay for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400611">Akerlof 1970</xref>). However, guests booking a hotel through an OTA can choose a hotel, by themselves, from a large list. They can observe all of the data published by the hotels on that site, and most importantly, they can observe all of the reviews posted by past guests. When they observe a sufficient number of good reviews for the same hotel, they may believe that the hotel truly offers a high-quality service and hence be willing to pay a higher price for it.</p>
<sec id="section3-0047287511400611">
<title>Model Formulation</title>
<p>We compare two cases: in the first, all guests book through local TAs, and in the second, all guests book through one OTA. We assume two possible quality levels of hotel service, <italic>standard</italic> and <italic>extra</italic> (i.e., low-quality service and high-quality service), and we define two groups of players, hoteliers (the sellers) and guests (the buyers). All guests in the model are identical, with all preferring extra service over standard service. A guest’s utility from standard service is <italic>s</italic> and her utility from extra service is <italic>s</italic> + <italic>e</italic> (<italic>e</italic> &gt; 0). All hoteliers in the model are identical (except for their type, as will be discussed further on); hence we assume no horizontal or vertical differentiation. Each hotel sells at most one room in each time period to one guest, and a guest demands at most one room in each time period.</p>
<p>There are two hotel types. An Extra type with proportion α € (0, 1) and a Standard type with proportion 1 – α. We denote the Extra Hotelier as EH and the Standard Hotelier as SH. The use of hotelier types is essential for obtaining equilibrium with high-quality service (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400611">Kreps et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400611">Kreps 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400611">Tirole 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The SH can provide only the standard service. The EH provides the standard service if he does not invest in service quality, but if he invests a periodic cost <italic>c</italic> per room (by choosing and training the staff, and by monitoring service quality standards), he provides the extra service with probability θ € (0, 1). An agent’s own type is his own private knowledge, but the proportion of extra type α, and the probability of providing extra service, θ, are public knowledge. Neither the guests nor the OTA observe hoteliers’ investment behavior.</p>
<p>The hotel market is complex and dynamic, and mostly influenced by seasons. In a low season, there are vacancies and hoteliers offer special deals to their guests. However, in a high season, the first guest who books a room (for a specific date) may obtain the best offer (price and room), while the last guests may book only the leftovers. Our structure captures the high season intentionally, since if we show the reputation effect in a high season, it will also be true for a low season for which past reviews are much more important to the guests and to the hoteliers. Hence, when a guest is searching for a hotel room, she cannot bargain on the hotel price, but she can choose between available offers on the OTA’s website. As a result, in a high season, the hoteliers may differentiate room prices between guests, by quoting the maximal prices the guests are willing to pay, or the price for which the guest is indifferent between buying and not buying. Hence, in the following model</p>
<p>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0047287511400611">

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In each transaction between hotelier and guest, the hotelier pays a fee, <italic>f</italic>, to the OTA that is proportional to the room price. Our model is a two-period game; thus, the hotelier’s expected payoff depends on his investment today plus the expected revenues of tomorrow. For convenience of notation we set the discount factor to 1. Then</p>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We study a pure Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium for this game that specifies when extra hotelier invests in service quality, and the prices each type obtains as a function of previous quality realizations. We call this EE, that is, the Extra-quality Equilibrium. Trivially, there always exists a pure equilibrium where the guests believe that no hotelier invests, which makes it optimal for hoteliers not to invest. Below we present the two cases: booking through TAs and booking through an OTA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287511400611">
<title>Case 1: Booking through TAs</title>
<p>Before the advent of the Internet, the guests had no reliable channel through which they could observe hoteliers’ past service quality. To make it simple, we assume that a guest has no information about the past record of the recommended hotel, and also has hardly any experience with the TA (any successes or failures in the past are too scarce to be relied on). Hence, the EH had no incentive to invest, and a guest’s expected utility is <italic>s</italic> (the utility from standard service). In turn, the room price (the maximal price a guest is willing to pay or the maximal price a hotelier may quote) is also <italic>s</italic>. Thus, the EE does not exist and we obtain a market with low quality and low prices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287511400611">
<title>Case 2: Booking through an OTA</title>
<p>We now introduce an OTA, which gathers the information of hoteliers’ past service quality and reveals it to future guests by publishing past guests’ reviews. We employ a two-period model in which qualitative properties extend in a straightforward manner to any length of horizon. We assume that the OTA provides a reliable channel of information to the guests (allowing only guests who actually booked a room from a hotel to write a review, eliminating unreliable effects on the presented data).</p>
<p>Hence, if a hotelier does not invest, the guest observes a rating of zero, whereas if the hotelier invests, the guest observes a rating of one with probability θ, and zero with probability 1 − θ. Recall that θ is the random probability of the EH providing the extra service. Under perfect monitoring, in EE, if a guest observes a rating of one, the hotel invests for certain, but if she observes a rating of zero, the hotel invests only with probability σ, calculated using Bayes’ rule (we denote “investing” by <italic>I</italic>, and “not investing” by <italic>N</italic>):</p>

<p>As expected, the gain from investment increases with the probability of success; that is, <italic>c</italic>* increases with θ.</p>
<p>The main results of the theoretical model are as follows: (1) the existence of an OTA, which carries the information of the hoteliers’ past performance, produces extra service quality in the market; (2) the extra service is rewarded by a price premium charged by the hotelier with a good record, compared to the hotelier with a bad record. These results show the contribution of the OTAs to the hotel market in promoting extra service, compared to traditional TAs.</p>
<p>In addition, we receive the following two results: (3) the high-quality equilibrium (EE) is more likely to exist when the hoteliers’ probability of success in serving the extra quality increases, (4) an increase in the proportion of the honest-type hotelier increases the level of guests’ trust in hotels, and hence the need for an OTA as an intermediary becomes less important.</p>

<sec id="section7-0047287511400611">
<title>Evidence for the Relationship between Price and Reputation</title>
<p>In the theoretical model, we show that when the OTA reveals the level of service quality, the hotelier can charge accordingly. Thus, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400611">Melnik and Alm (2002)</xref>, one would expect to see a price premium for a good review. This means that high review scores are expected to be positively associated with high prices, holding everything else constant.</p>
<p>To collect the data, we chose the OTA site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> and the cities of Paris, London, and Barcelona. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> was chosen because relative to other large OTAs, it has a large number of hotels receiving reviews and a large number of reviews per hotel. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> specializes in online hotel reservations and thus it is in its best interest to provide reliable data on the hotels listed on its site.</p>
<p>Paris and London were chosen because they had the largest number of hotels, about 800 and 700, respectively, appearing on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link>. Barcelona was chosen randomly from medium-size touristic European cities. A special program was written facilitating data collection from each site in less than an hour. This short time span minimized the problem of price changes while the data were being collected. We collected data from a few future dates, chosen at random, to up to half a year from the time of data collection. We show the results of the analysis based on data collected on July 23, 2008, for the night of September 16, 2008, for two persons. We chose this two-month period between booking and staying at the hotel and the low season date in September in order to have as many hotels as possible in our data collection. Since only available hotels appear on the site, a shorter period of time would not show the very popular hotels, which would already be completely booked. It should be noted that there were no significant differences in the analysis results when it was conducted based on data collected on different days for different future dates. Thus, the results reported in this article are robust and do not depend on the timing and dates of data collection.</p>
<p>The number of hotels in Paris, London, and Barcelona for this date was 758, 610, and 316, respectively, of which 687, 501, and 275, respectively, were used for the analysis. Hotels that did not have a star ranking or review scores were eliminated. Many of the hotels that did not have reviews were new to the site (a label “new” appears next to the hotel listing) and we therefore saw no reason for sample-selection bias. The data collected from the site included the lowest price in euros for an available double room; number of stars (provided by the hotel and set according to a national standards system); and the score for staff performance, services provided at the hotel, cleanliness, comfort, value for money, and average total score. In their reviews, the lowest grade a guest can give is 1 and the highest is 10. We chose to use only the staff performance score (score_staff) in the analysis to reflect service quality. Cleanliness, services, and comfort are not known to the guest at the time of booking a room but we found them to be highly correlated with score_ staff; thus, they were excluded from the regression analysis in order to prevent multicollinearity. Value for money depends on the price at the time of the stay and thus we decided not to use it.</p>
<p>Additional collected information included number of rooms, inclusion of breakfast in the price, and affiliation with a hotel chain. Another explanatory variable was “popularity,” which represents the location of the hotels on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> site. The first hotel on the list receives the value 1, the second 2, and so forth. However, we could not obtain any explanation as to what “popularity” is based on and we believe that it might reflect promotional efforts by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link>. Descriptive statistics of these variables appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287511400611">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The theoretical model implies that a price premium exists for extra-quality hotels in the online hotel market. To detect the existence of this price premium, we estimated a reduced-form hedonic equation with the log of future price as the dependent variable. Score_staff is the reputation variable, and the rest of the variables are controls.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400611">Table 2</xref> suggest that score_staff has a positive and significant effect on room price in all three cities. The level of score_staff describes the information on the quality of the hotel’s service and is revealed by past guest reviews according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link>’s grading system. With an increase in score_staff level, the price charged is higher because of higher reputation. Notice that score_staff does not measure present service quality but rather past quality reported by other guests, that is, it reflects the reputation for high quality. The present customers use this information for their expectations of present quality and are therefore willing to pay a higher price for higher reputation. This result serves as evidence for a price premium for reputation, which is the main purpose of this study. Note that a review reflects the utility of the guest with respect to the cost she pays and her expectations. This means that for two identical hotels, one charges higher price than the other, it is most likely that the hotel with the higher price will receive lower score. However, despite these opposing influences, our statistical results show that guests pay a premium when good reviews are presented. Considering this effect strengthens our results.</p>

<p>The control variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400611">Table 2</xref> provide a rich set of results in and of themselves. The number of stars conveys information on the physical attributes of the hotel according to a set of standards. This information is revealed to the guest at the time of booking a room. With an increase in the number of stars, the price charged is higher because of the higher standards. We chose to use a series of dummy variables for the number of stars (the reference group consisting of one-star hotels) in order to assess the functional form of the relationship. In Paris, there is a significant difference in price between one-star hotels and two-, three-, and four-star hotels (there are no five-star hotels in the data set). The relationship between star ranking and price is exponential, that is, the difference in price increases faster than the increase in stars. The average difference between the price of one-star hotels and two-star hotels is about 30%, between one-star and three-star hotels about 70%, and between one-star and four-star hotels about 110%. In London and Barcelona, there is no significant difference between the prices of one- and two-star hotels. If we consider the one- and two-star hotels as one group, then the difference in price between this combined group and the other star-ranking hotels is similar to what we saw in Paris. The average price rises by about 30% when a hotel is ranked three stars, between 60% and 70% when it is ranked four stars, and between 100% and 120% when it is ranked five stars.</p>
<p>The number of rooms is positive in all three models but only significant in London. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400611">Guttman and Yacouel (2006)</xref>, we can interpret this coefficient as an indicator of reputation. The larger the size of the firm, the better its reputation and, accordingly, the higher the price it charges. Another possible reputation variable is chain affiliation. In Paris and London, chain affiliation leads to a price premium of 4% and 14%, respectively. In Barcelona, there is no significant difference between the price of hotels affiliated with a chain and those that are not affiliated with a chain. A check of the different chains that use <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> in the three cities revealed that in Barcelona, mostly local chains use this site, whereas in Paris and London, more international chains use it. This would explain the lack of price premium for chain affiliation in Barcelona.</p>
<p>The rest of the variables, breakfast and popularity, vary in their impact on hotel prices and their level of significance. Two other possible variables that might affect hotel room prices are the location of the hotel and the type of room. Although it might be possible to collect information on the hotel’s location, we were not able to determine which locations are better than others since there is horizontal differentiation in location preferences. The rooms for which we collected data are considered double rooms but some can be defined as standard double rooms and some as luxury double rooms. It was impossible to form a variable describing the type of room because of the different definitions used by hotels to describe the rooms they are offering. However, we do not see any reason for a correlation between these omitted variables and the other dependent variables used in the regression and thus we do not expect a bias in the estimated coefficients. Moreover, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is relatively high for cross-sectional data, which means that the model explains a large part of the variance, even without the information on location and room type.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article presents a case study in which the Internet plays an important role in improving efficiency in the hotel market. The OTAs provide reliable information regarding hotels’ past service quality by allowing only guests that actually stay at a hotel to write a review on their site. Since the information on hotels’ past quality is revealed to the guests, the guests are willing to pay higher price to hotels with a good record (hotels that they expect to keep on providing high service quality). This price premium for a good reputation motivates the hoteliers to actually invest in providing high standards of service quality. Surely hotels offering high-quality service charged higher prices even before the emergence of OTAs. However, OTAs have improved information transmission to allow for an even better matching of price with quality. It follows that OTAs contribute to the improvement of service quality in the hotel market. All of the guests who stay in the hotels, that is, those who booked a room via the OTA and those who did not, enjoy the improved level of service since the staff cannot distinguish between the two groups. Thus, although the OTAs are intermediaries in the online market, they affect both the online and offline hotel markets.</p>
<p>In the theoretical model, we prove that the existence of an extra-quality equilibrium is possible if the investment costs of the hotelier are not too high. In such a case, we show that there is a price premium for hotels with good records. Evidence for this was found in the analysis of online hotel prices as a function of their attributes and review scores. Hotel rooms in Paris, London, and Barcelona that are traded on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</ext-link> and have received high review scores charge higher prices, holding everything else constant. Each point in the score review is worth approximately one-third of a star in Paris and London and one-sixth of a star in Barcelona. The implication of this finding is that the standardized star system, which requires governmental funding, may become obsolete as transactions in the online market start to dominate the hotel market as a whole. Because the star system is based on physical attributes of the hotel that can be published in detail on the site, there is no need to rank them. Each prospective guest can decide which of the hotel’s physical attributes fits her needs. Moreover, information on the quality of the service in the hotel is revealed in the reviews published on the OTA sites. This means that the OTAs not only improve market efficiency but can also save on the public resources currently allocated to the standardized star system.</p>
<p>The model presented here is simple and provides the expected results. However, further study of other issues that could not all be included in this paper is warranted, such as the reputational incentives of the OTA itself, incorporating horizontal differentiation into the model, and modeling the case of chain hotels.</p>
