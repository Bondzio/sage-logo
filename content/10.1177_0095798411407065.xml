<abstract>
<p>The present study examines the impact of experiences with individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism on susceptibility to stereotype among African-descent persons within the United Kingdom (<italic>n</italic> = 103). Results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that (contrary to hypotheses) experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism were not significantly or marginally related to susceptibility to stereotype threat when entered together in Model 1. However (consistent with hypotheses), experience with collective racism was a significant positive predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat after controlling for the effects of experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism in Model 2. Moreover (and unexpectedly), once experience with collective racism was added, experience with cultural racism emerged as a marginal negative predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat. Implications for the continuing relevance of Erving Goffman’s symbolic interactionist theory and construct of stigma, along with Claude Steele’s construct of stereotype threat, to the field of Black psychology is discussed.</p>

<p>The third edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411407065">Lindzey &amp; Aronson, 1985</xref>) was the first edition to include substantive coverage of <italic>symbolic interaction theory</italic>, a sociological theory that emphasizes the extent to which individuals not only may determine their own actions but also may directly or indirectly instigate social change through their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095798411407065">Stryker &amp; Statham, 1985</xref>). One of the best-known proponents of symbolic interaction theory was Erving Goffmam, whose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411407065"><italic>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</italic> (1959)</xref> dealt primarily with efforts by social actors to convey positive impressions to social perceivers. Although social actors’ motive to convey positive impressions to social perceivers is distinct from social actors’ motive to view themselves positively, the two motives do not necessarily contradict each other (e.g., most individuals think and feel positively about themselves and are likely to communicate that information to other persons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095798411407065">Robins &amp; John, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798411407065">Gilbert, Fiske, &amp; Lindzey, 1998</xref>) was devoid of any substantive coverage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> symbolic interaction theory in general but did include substantive coverage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1963)</xref> concept of <italic>stigma</italic>, or an attribute that is devalued within a particular society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411407065">Crocker, Major, &amp; Steele, 1998</xref>). In <italic>Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman (1963)</xref> contended that evidence of social actors’ membership in racial, religious, and/or national minority groups within a given society (e.g., skin color, religious ornaments, linguistic accent) constitutes one or more “tribal stigmas” that put those social actors at a distinct disadvantage when trying to convey positive impressions to social perceivers from racial, religious, and/or national majority groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095798411407065">1</xref></sup> Even though evidence of membership in a racial, religious, or national minority group is not inherently negative, the stereotyping that such evidence triggers in the minds of many (if not most) members of racial, religious, and/or national majority groups can undermine minority group members’ attempts at impression management.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examine the impact of experiences with various aspects of individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism on susceptibility to stereotype threat—a concept developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411407065">Claude Steele (1997)</xref> and derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1963)</xref> theorizing with regard to the negative social and psychological consequences of stigma—among persons of African descent within the United Kingdom. Previous research on stereotype threat has focused primarily on the academic performance of African-descent persons in the United States, partly because of the popularity of Steele’s research within the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411407065">Blascovich, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Steele, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798411407065">Deaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095798411407065">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>) and partly because of the popularity of a different research tradition regarding intergroup relations operating within the United Kingdom (i.e., research on contact between members of experimentally created groups based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095798411407065">Henri Tajfel’s (1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095798411407065">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>) social identity theory and drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798411407065">Gordon Allport’s (1954)</xref> contact hypothesis from <italic>The Nature of Prejudice</italic> (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411407065">Crisp &amp; Abrams, 2008</xref>). However, given the increasingly multiethnic composition of the U.K. population (e.g., members of racial minority groups currently comprise approximately 8% of the U.K. population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095798411407065">U.K. Office of National Statistics, 2004</xref>), we believe that the time is overdue for research on stereotype threat within the United Kingdom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095798411407065">Gaines &amp; Reed, 1994</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0095798411407065">
<title>Susceptibility to Stereotype Threat Among African-Descent Persons Within the United Kingdom</title>
<p><italic>Stereotype threat</italic> refers to the anxiety and, potentially, impaired performance resulting from stigmatized individuals’ belief that they will be evaluated in a domain where members of their group historically have been expected to perform poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411407065">Steele, 1997</xref>). For example, within the United States, women historically have been expected to perform poorly on mathematics tests relative to men; when women are reminded of this expected sex difference, women tend to underperform relative to men in actual mathematics testing situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411407065">Carr &amp; Steele, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095798411407065">Pronin, Steele, &amp; Ross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095798411407065">Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>). In addition (and especially relevant to the present study), within the United States, persons of African descent historically have been expected to perform poorly on academic tests relative to persons of European descent; when African-descent persons are reminded of this expected racial difference, African-descent persons tend to underperform relative to European-descent persons in actual academic testing situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411407065">Blascovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798411407065">Deaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095798411407065">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>To what extent do findings with regard to racial stigmatization and stereotype threat generalize from the United States to the United Kingdom? Surprisingly, few large-scale, quantitative studies of racial stigmatization and stereotype threat have been published in British journals; the studies that have been published (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411407065">Marx &amp; Goff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411407065">Osborne &amp; Walker, 2006</xref>) generally have been conducted using American, rather than British, samples. Thus, our empirical basis for generalization essentially is nonexistent. However, results of a series of small-scale, qualitative studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095798411407065">Howarth (2006)</xref> suggest that racial minority group members’ experience of stigmatization—if not stereotype threat (which Howarth did not directly examine)—is a common phenomenon in the United Kingdom. Assuming that racial stigmatization and stereotype threat tend to covary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411407065">Steele, 1997</xref>), we anticipate that stereotype threat will be a relevant issue for many, if not most, African-descent persons in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>So far, we have implied that all African-descent persons in the United States or, for that matter, in the United Kingdom will experience stereotype threat. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of studies regarding racial stigmatization and stereotype threat appear to be guided implicitly (and, perhaps, explicitly) by such a premise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411407065">Crisp &amp; Abrams, 2008</xref>). However, not all members of a socially stigmatized group experience stereotype threat to the same degree, within or across situations. We use the term <italic>susceptibility to stereotype threat</italic> to refer to individual differences within a stigmatized group regarding the tendency to experience stereotype threat. Rather than manipulate stereotype threat (as is usually the case in studies of stereotype threat), we opted to measure susceptibility to stereotype threat as an individual-difference variable with a range of scores along a continuum (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095798411407065">Marx, Stapel, &amp; Muller, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Impact of Experiences With Individual, Institutional, and Cultural Racism on African-Descent Persons’ Susceptibility to Stereotype Threat Within the United Kingdom</title>
<p>Why are some African-descent persons more susceptible to stereotype threat than are other African-descent persons within a given society? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Janet Helms (2006)</xref> hypothesized that the more often African-descent persons experience anti-Black racism in its myriad forms, the more likely it is that African-descent persons will be susceptible to stereotype threat. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798411407065">James Jones’s (1972)</xref> distinction among prejudice at various levels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Helms (2006)</xref> reasoned that repeated experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism will make African-descent persons increasingly likely to experience anxiety and to underperform when they are placed in situations that evoke societal stereotypes regarding African-descent persons’ ostensibly limited academic aptitude (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411407065">Jones, 1997</xref>). <italic>Individual racism</italic> refers to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination on the part of specific persons toward racially stigmatized individuals; <italic>institutional racism</italic> refers to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination on the part of specific organizations toward racially stigmatized individuals; and <italic>cultural racism</italic> refers to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination that might not be attributable to particular persons or organizations but that nonetheless occur within a given society and can affect racially stigmatized individuals via mass media and other forms of communication.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798411407065">James Jones’s (1972)</xref> conceptualization of individual, institutional, and cultural racism not only expanded on Allport’s <italic>The Nature of Prejudice</italic> (1954) but also represented a major contribution to the literature on race relations during the early 1970s. However, it was not until the mid- to late 1990s that Shawn Utsey developed the original Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095798411407065">Utsey &amp; Ponterotto, 1996</xref>) and the Index of Race-Related Stress–Brief Version (IRRS-B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095798411407065">Utsey, 1999</xref>) to measure individual differences in African-descent persons’ experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism. Results of subsequent studies by Utsey and his colleagues indicate that experiences with racism are negative predictors of African-descent persons’ subjective well-being within the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095798411407065">Utsey &amp; Constantine, 2006</xref>), although the specific experiences with racism that are significantly related to well-being may vary across studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095798411407065">Utsey, Chae, Brown, &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095798411407065">Utsey, Payne, Jackson, &amp; A. Jones, 2002</xref>) and may be moderated by other variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095798411407065">Utsey, Lanier, Williams, Bolden, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). Research is scant regarding the links between individuals’ experiences with racism and subjective well-being in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Helms’s (2006)</xref> individual-differences model identifying individual, institutional, and cultural racism as positive predictors of susceptibility to stereotype threat shows promise as a means toward understanding the circumstances under which some African-descent persons manage to succeed academically, despite the odds. Given that some American and British psychologists historically have lent support to societal myths regarding African-descent persons’ ostensibly limited academic potential (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095798411407065">Yee, Fairchild, Weizmann, &amp; Wyatt, 1993</xref>), empirical tests of Helms’s hypotheses could help debunk those myths. However, to our knowledge, no published study has tested Helms’s hypotheses concerning the impact of individual, institutional, or cultural racism on African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat in the United States or in the United Kingdom.</p>

<sec id="section3-0095798411407065">
<title>Experience With Collective Racism: An Additional Predictor of African-Descent Persons’ Susceptibility to Stereotype Threat Within the United Kingdom(?)</title>
<p>So far, we have considered three aspects of African-descent persons’ experiences with racism. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798411407065">Philomena Essed (1990)</xref> added a fourth aspect of racism—namely, <italic>collective racism</italic>, or the stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination on the part of specific groups of persons toward racially stigmatized individuals. This fourth aspect of African-descent persons’ experiences with racism does not appear in either the original edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798411407065">1972</xref>) or in the revised edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411407065">1997</xref>) of James Jones’s classic, <italic>Prejudice and Racism</italic>.</p>
<p>Several items constitute the subscale of collective racism in the original IRRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095798411407065">Utsey &amp; Ponterotto, 1996</xref>). However, only two items constitute collective racism in the IRRS-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095798411407065">Utsey, 1999</xref>). Utsey and his colleagues have continued to measure collective racism but generally have not commented on the impact of collective racism on subjective well-being or on other variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095798411407065">Utsey, Chae, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095798411407065">Utsey &amp; Constantine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095798411407065">Utsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095798411407065">Utsey, Payne, et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike individual, institutional, or cultural racism, collective racism does not appear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Helms’s (2006)</xref> model of experiences with racism as predictors of susceptibility to stereotype threat among African-descent persons. Given the apparent lack of predictive validity (as distinct from construct validity; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411407065">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>) regarding the collective racism subscale of the IRRS-B, we were not as confident in making predictions concerning collective racism as we were in making predictions concerning individual, institutional, or cultural aspects of racism as positive predictors of African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat within the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, we anticipated that if collective racism were to exert any impact on susceptibility to stereotype threat, then the impact likely would be positive.</p>

<sec id="section4-0095798411407065">
<title>Goals of the Present Study</title>
<p>In the present study, our primary hypotheses were that experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism would be significant positive predictors of African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat within a U.K. sample. Our secondary, more tentative hypothesis was that experience with collective racism would be a significant positive predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat, explaining variance in susceptibility to stereotype threat beyond that explained by individual, institutional, or cultural racism. We tested our hypotheses via hierarchical multiple regression analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798411407065">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Experiences with individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism</title>
<p>African-descent persons’ experiences with racism were measured via the 22-item IRRS-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095798411407065">Utsey, 1999</xref>). The IRRS-B measures four constructs: (a) experiences with individual racism (6 items), (b) experiences with institutional racism (4 items), (c) experiences with cultural racism (10 items), and (d) experiences with collective racism (2 items). Each item was scored according to a 5-point, Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>this event never happened to me</italic>, 5 = <italic>the event happened to me, and I was extremely upset</italic>), with higher scores indicating greater frequencies and greater resulting distress with which individuals experienced racism). Sample items include the following: “Sales people/clerks did not say thank you or show other forms of courtesy and respect (e.g., put your things in a bag) when you shopped at some European-descent/non-African-descent businesses” (individual racism); “You have been given more work, or the most undesirable jobs at your place of employment, while the European-descent/non-African-descent people of equal or less seniority and credentials are given less work, and more desirable tasks” (institutional racism); “You notice that crimes committed by persons of European descent tend to be romanticized, whereas the same crime committed by persons of African descent are portrayed as savagery, and the African-descent persons who committed it, as animals” (cultural racism); and “You were the victim of a crime and the police treated you as if you should just accept it as part of being a person of African descent” (collective racism). Results of reliability analyses indicated that with the exception of the collective racism scale, the IRRS-B scales were internally consistent (Cronbach’s α = .83 for individual racism, .77 for institutional racism, .88 for cultural racism, and .51 for collective racism).</p>

Items included the following: “I worry that my ability to perform well on academic tests in general is affected by my social group membership(s)”; “I worry that if I perform poorly on academic tests in general, then the persons who administer the tests will attribute my poor performance to my social group membership(s)”; and “I worry that, because I know the negative stereotype about my social group membership(s) and academic tests, my anxiety about confirming the stereotype will negatively influence how I perform on the tests.” Items were scored according to a 5-point, Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of susceptibility to stereotype threat. Results of a reliability analysis indicated that the scale measuring susceptibility to stereotype threat was internally consistent (Cronbach’s α = .69).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. Prior to conducting the present study, the first author obtained ethics approval from an appropriate research ethics subcommittee. The present study was conducted in accordance with the Code of Conduct, Ethical Principles, and Guidelines of the British Psychological Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798411407065">BPS, 2005</xref>). The BPS ethics guidelines are similar to APA ethics guidelines in terms of stringency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095798411407065">Kimmel, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were recruited within the West London area, largely (though not exclusively) on the campus of Brunel University. Snowball sampling was used, in which the researchers not only approached acquaintances but also followed leads provided by those acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411407065">Bryman, 2001</xref>). Participants read and signed the informed consent document, after which they completed the study surveys and were given a debriefing form.</p>

<p>In contrast to Model 1, results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were significant for Model 2. Consistent with our secondary hypothesis, experience with collective racism was a significant positive predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat, after controlling for experiences of individual, institutional, and cultural racism as predictors: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> increase for experience with collective racism = .05, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98 <italic>df</italic>) = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Furthermore (and unexpectedly), once experience with collective racism was entered as a predictor, experience with cultural racism emerged as a marginal <italic>negative</italic> predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .08). Beta weights for experiences with individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism in Model 2 are presented in the second half of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095798411407065">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Experiences with individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism accounted for a combined 8% of variance in individuals’ scores on susceptibility to stereotype threat, a percentage that was marginal: <italic>F</italic>(4, 98 <italic>df</italic>) = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .09. With <italic>p</italic> = .05 as the basis for power calculations (obtained via G*Power 3.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411407065">Faul, 2006</xref>), the effect size was small to moderate (<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> = .09), and the achieved power was low (power = .64), for Model 2 as a whole. In addition, with <italic>p</italic> = .05 as the basis for post hoc power calculations (obtained via SPSS 15.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095798411407065">SPSS, 2007</xref>), effect sizes were small (partial η<sup>2</sup> = .00 for experiences with individual racism, .00 for institutional racism, .03 for experiences with cultural racism, and .05 for collective racism), and the achieved power was low (power = .06 for experiences with individual racism, .05 for experiences with institutional racism, .44 for experiences with cultural racism, and .59 for experiences with collective racism) for the separate Model 2 predictors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most striking result of the present study was the significant positive effect of experience with collective racism on African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat in the regression analysis. Not only was this effect significant after controlling for the effects of experiences with individual, institutional, and cultural racism on susceptibility to stereotype threat; but this effect emerged in spite of the low reliability of the scale measuring experience with collective racism. If the reliabilities of the scales measured susceptibility to stereotype threat and (especially) experience with collective racism, then the effect for collective racism probably would have been even higher (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411407065">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). All in all, African-descent persons’ experience with collective racism is unique among predictors of susceptibility to stereotype threat, possibly because of historical as well as contemporary associations with acts of vigilantism and terrorism by White mobs toward Black individuals in the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411407065">Back, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike the effect of experience with collective racism, the effect of experience with cultural racism on African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the marginal <italic>negative</italic> effect of experience with cultural racism on susceptibility to stereotype threat is worth further consideration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411407065">James Jones (1997)</xref> noted that within American society, elements of cultural racism coexist alongside elements of cultural antiracism. Perhaps elements of cultural racism and cultural antiracism similarly coexist within British society; the potential for such coexistence suggests that when African-descent persons encounter examples of cultural racism (e.g., encountering yet another showing of the relentlessly stereotypical <italic>Gone With The Wind</italic>), they may fight back symbolically by actively seeking examples of cultural antiracism (e.g., purchasing the stereotype-challenging <italic>Roots</italic> for viewing at their leisure, prompting them to turn on the television; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798411407065">Briley, 2008</xref>) and, thus, reduce their susceptibility to stereotype threat.</p>
<p>Experience with institutional racism was unrelated to African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat. Given that much of the impetus for the present study came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411407065">Steele’s (1997)</xref> studies of experimenter-manipulated stereotype threat in educational settings, the lack of a relationship between experience with institutional racism and susceptibility to stereotype threat is surprising. Perhaps, African-descent persons have learned to traverse many, if not most, institutional terrains by anticipating experiences with racism and neutralizing their effects when those experiences occur (no small task in some institutional settings, e.g., the police force; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798411407065">Cashmore, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, experiences with individual racism were unrelated to African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat. Given the attention that social and personality psychologists historically have paid to expressions of individual racism by European-descent persons in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798411407065">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798411407065">Allport, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman, 1963</xref>), the lack of a relationship between experiences with individual racism and susceptibility to stereotype threat is especially surprising. Perhaps, African-descent persons, whether in the United Kingdom or in the United States, inoculate themselves against individual racism by maintaining a state of constant alertness while navigating their social-psychological environment, thus reducing (if not eliminating) the sting that otherwise would accompany experiences with individual racism—a skill that also may be well developed among those European-descent women who either “marry Black” or who give birth to mixed-race offspring (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798411407065">Harman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-0095798411407065">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Present Study</title>
<p>Certain strengths characterize the present study. First, to our knowledge, the present study is the first study to measure experiences with racism and susceptibility to stereotype threat, whether separately or together, among African-descent persons within the United Kingdom. Second, the significant positive effect for experience with collective racism and the marginal negative effect for experience with cultural racism lend support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Helms’s (2006)</xref> argument that individual differences in experiences with racism are relevant to understanding individual differences in susceptibility to stereotype threat among African-descent persons.</p>
<p>By the same token, certain shortcomings characterize the present study. First, given that the magnitude of the correlation between collective racism and institutional racism was somewhat higher than was the reliability coefficient for the collective racism scale, the discriminant validity of the IRRS-B could be called into question (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798411407065">Kenny, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095798411407065">Seaton, 2003</xref>). Second, the achieved power for each of the predictor variables (including experiences with collective racism and with cultural racism) was low, thus raising questions concerning the practical significance of the results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095798411407065">Sun, Pan, &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>All in all, we believe that the strengths outweigh the shortcomings in the present study. Regarding discriminant validity of the IRRS-B, the scales measuring experiences with collective racism and with institutional racism were quite divergent in terms of their predictive validity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411407065">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Regarding low achieved power, the low effect size and associated low achieved power for experience with collective racism in particular may have been because of the low reliability for that scale, rather than inherently low practical significance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798411407065">Ferguson, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0095798411407065">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Future researchers should attempt to collect longitudinal data on experiences with racism as predictors of susceptibility to stereotype threat among African-descent persons. Given that the present study was limited to data from one point in time, we cannot make definitive statements regarding experiences with racism as causes of susceptibility to stereotype threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798411407065">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). Such research could help clarify whether cultural racism attains significance as a predictor of susceptibility to stereotype threat.</p>
<p>In addition, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411407065">Helms’s (2006)</xref> individual differences model, future researchers should examine academic performance as a consequence of susceptibility to stereotype threat. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095798411407065">Hunt and Carlson (2007)</xref>, “There are signs that the debate over racial and gender differences in intelligence is about to begin again” (p. 194). Hunt and Carlson expressed ambivalence toward the manner in which the results of studies of stereotype threat have been interpreted. Nevertheless, Hunt and Carlson acknowledged the constructive role that studies of stereotype threat can play in informing past, present, and future debates regarding race and cognitive ability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At the outset of the present study, we noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> symbolic interactionist theory in general received considerable attention in the third edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095798411407065">Stryker &amp; Statham, 1985</xref>); whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1963)</xref> concept of stigma in particular received considerable attention in the fourth edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411407065">Crocker et al., 1998</xref>). In the most recent, fifth edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095798411407065">Fiske, Gilbert, &amp; Lindzey, 2010</xref>), virtually the only sustained coverage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> symbolic interactionist theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411407065">Goffman’s (1963)</xref> concept of stigma, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411407065">Steele’s (1997)</xref> concept of stereotype threat <italic>combined</italic> consists of slightly more than one page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798411407065">Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2010</xref>). As mainstream social psychology increasingly turns its collective attention away from Goffman’s symbolic interactionist theory, we hope that the present article will inspire scholars within the field of Black psychology to continue drawing on Goffman’s theory, especially as reflected in research on stigma and stereotype threat.</p>
