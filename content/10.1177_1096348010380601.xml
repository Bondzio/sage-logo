<p>This study extended the technology acceptance model (TAM) by applying it to the context of biometric systems in the hotel industry and by introducing a consumer-oriented construct, perceived innovativeness, as an antecedent of perceived ease of use. Using data collected from hotel guests who traveled during a 12-month period prior to the study, the model explained 79% of the variability in guests’ intentions to use biometric systems in hotels. The results showed that the TAM is an appropriate theoretical framework for the examination of adoption of biometrics in hotels, and that hotel guests are ready to adopt biometric systems, especially if they are perceived as useful.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past several years have been rather turbulent for the hotel industry, especially in terms of technology adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010380601">Buhalis &amp; Law, 2008</xref>). In the beginning of the current decade, hotels adopted a passive role vis-à-vis technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1096348010380601">Lumsden &amp; Beldona, 2006</xref>), which allowed for radical transformations (i.e., disintermediation, reintermediation) to occur in their value chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010380601">Carroll &amp; Siguaw, 2003</xref>). Later, hotels became involved more actively in technology adoption and found ways to encourage their guests to use technologies such as websites, reservation, recommendation, and in-room entertainment systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1096348010380601">Law &amp; Jogaratnam, 2005</xref>). Recently, despite a slower pace of technology adoption relative to other industries (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>), the hotel industry has become open to novel technologies (i.e., RFID keycards—“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1096348010380601">VingCard and Aloft Hotels,” 2010</xref>; touch screen door locks—“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1096348010380601">Marriott Secures Prestige,” 2010</xref>; virtual meeting systems—“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1096348010380601">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Goes Live,” 2010</xref>), as their benefits are increasingly evident, especially in terms of cost reduction, operational efficiency, and overall value to guests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380601">Huh, Kim, &amp; Law, 2009</xref>). However, another novel technology, biometrics, has yet to be adopted enthusiastically by both guests and hotel companies.</p>
<p>The history of biometrics in the hotel industry is relatively short, since, traditionally, hotels have generally been slow to offer them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010380601">Adams, 2002</xref>). Some of the pioneering applications used in hotels included biometric in-room safes, and iris scanning and face recognition systems designed to allow staff and guests access to certain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010380601">Adams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1096348010380601">Simon, 2004</xref>). To date, except for a small number of properties, hotels have not offered biometric systems, arguably because of prohibitive factors such as reliability, lack of standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1096348010380601">Vijan, 2004</xref>), perceived intrusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1096348010380601">Singh &amp; Kasavana, 2005</xref>), and privacy concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010380601">Adler, 2008</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1096348010380601">Kim, Brewer, &amp; Bernhard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1096348010380601">Tsai, 2007</xref>). In spite of such barriers, it is generally agreed that biometric systems could add value to guests’ hotel stay experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>), as they are viewed as superior to traditional identification and access technologies. For hotels, biometric systems appear to be promising, as they can reduce costs and fraud, and increase accuracy in transaction processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>), while offering users security and convenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010380601">Ives, Du, Etter, &amp; Welch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones, Williams, Hillier, &amp; Comfort, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As most of today’s hotel guests seek convenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1096348010380601">Law &amp; Chen, 2000</xref>), biometrics appears to be one of the most promising technologies of the future, allowing guests to check in/out, access guest areas, and make payments with unprecedented convenience and speed. However, despite a recent decrease in the overall price of biometric hardware (i.e., basic fingerprint systems cost as low as $300, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010380601">Biometrics, 2010</xref>; whereas sophisticated hand and face recognition [three-dimensional] systems cost beyond $5,000 per unit, J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1096348010380601">Kirby, 2008</xref>) at a hotel’s scale, biometric systems represent considerable investments (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>). In the absence of strong adoption from guests, the return on such investments may not be substantial for hotels. In this context, understanding the circumstances under which guests adopt biometric systems may provide hotels with insight into the types of systems to be offered and the characteristics that biometric systems should have to be adopted enthusiastically by guests. Thus, this study examines whether the extended theoretical base provided by the technology acceptance model (TAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380601">Davis, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">1989</xref>), augmented with the construct of perceived innovativeness toward information technology, serves as an appropriate foundation for the study of hotel guests’ perceptions of biometric systems in hotels. Specifically, this study has three objectives:</p>

<title>Biometrics: Definition and Applications</title>
<p>Biometric systems are technologies that use “measurable physical, biological, or behavioral characteristics that can be processed to establish identification, to perform identity verification, or to recognize a person through automation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010380601">Ives et al. 2005</xref>, p. 472). Biometric systems require two operational dimensions: (a) enrollment, in which biometric data are obtained and linked with a person’s identity and (b) authentication or recognition, in which new biometric data are compared with the stored data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1096348010380601">Langenderfer &amp; Linnhoff, 2005</xref>). A typical biometric system consists of a reader/scanner, a software application that converts a scanned human characteristic into biometric data (i.e., set of features), and a database that is used for storage and, later, for authentication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). First, users register a physical (i.e., fingerprint, iris image) or behavioral (i.e., signature handwriting pattern) characteristic with the database and a template is created, which is known as enrollment. Then, the system compares current biometric data with data stored in the database. Authentication is based on the similarity of data from any current reading with the template stored in the database, which, theoretically, should match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional (i.e., password based) authentication systems, where a perfect match between two sets of characters (features) is necessary for authentication, biometric systems rarely encounter two samples of a user’s biometric that generate the same set of features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380601">Jain &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>). This is because even the same user providing the same biometric is rarely able to generate exactly the same set of features. Moreover, many technical (i.e., improper lighting conditions, faulty sensors) or medical factors (i.e., respiratory issues affecting voice) may exacerbate the differences between sets of features belonging to the same user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380601">Jain &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>). The sets of features extracted from users’ biometrics are compared by the system to calculate a “similarity score,” which is further compared with a preset system threshold to generate a decision to accept/reject a user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010380601">Chollet, Dorizzi, &amp; Petrovska-Delacretaz, 2009</xref>). A similarity score matching sets of features for the same user is known as a “genuine score,” whereas a score matching sets of features for different users is known as an “impostor score” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380601">Jain &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>). If an impostor score exceeds the threshold, the system produces a false accept (an incorrect user is accepted), whereas if a genuine score falls below the threshold, the system produces a false reject (a correct user is rejected; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010380601">Chollet et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, as a measure of their performance, biometric systems are characterized by false acceptance rates (FARs; probability that the system will accept an incorrect user) and false rejection rates (FRRs; probability that the system will reject a correct user; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380601">Jain &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>). Current biometric systems vary in their performance (i.e., FRR, FAR), based on the characteristics of the biometric being used and the level of development of the technology used to capture biometric data. For example, systems based on iris scanning are very accurate (i.e., FAR rates below 1%), whereas systems based on face (especially bidimensional) and hand recognition are relatively less accurate (i.e., FRR of approximately 10% and 4%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380601">Jain &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An inventory of biometric systems includes fingerprinting, face and voice recognition, hand geometry, handwriting pattern recognition, and iris and retinal scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010380601">Ives et al., 2005</xref>). Biometric systems use characteristics of humans that hardly change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1096348010380601">Koltzsch, 2007</xref>). Thus, they are considered more reliable than the traditional recognition and identification systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>), even though they may occasionally lead to erroneous acceptance/rejection decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). A small number of historically common and popular biometric identification methodologies (i.e., fingerprinting, face recognition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1096348010380601">Pons &amp; Polak, 2008</xref>) remain the most popular today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010380601">Bolle, Connell, Pakanti, Ratha, &amp; Senior, 2004</xref>), although other systems, such as hand/palm geometry, are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>The academic literature on biometric systems is mostly limited to discussing various technical aspects of biometric systems design and application, such as authentication accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010380601">Araujo, Sucupira, Lizarraga, Ling, &amp; Yabu-Uti, 2005</xref>), technical and legal challenges in implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010380601">Chandra &amp; Calderon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348010380601">Deane, Barrelle, Henderson, &amp; Mahar, 1995</xref>), and ethical issues related to biometric identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010380601">Alterman, 2003</xref>). To date, only a few authors have discussed biometric systems from a consumer adoption perspective, both in mainstream business (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010380601">Giarimi &amp; Magnusson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1096348010380601">James, Pirim, Boswell, Riethel, &amp; Barkhi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1096348010380601">Langenderfer &amp; Linnhoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1096348010380601">Laux, 2007</xref>) and hospitality (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the adoption of biometrics presents conflicting findings. For example, investigating Swedish students’ perceptions of biometric systems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010380601">Giarimi and Magnusson (2002)</xref> found that a large majority had a positive attitude toward biometric systems and would use them at some point in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1096348010380601">James et al. (2006)</xref> found that users’ intentions to use biometric systems are influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived invasiveness of biometric systems. However, in a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1096348010380601">Pons and Polak (2008)</xref> warned that consumer emotions such as fear, hesitation, and comfort regarding biometric systems might lead to improper use and result in consequently to substantial operational problems for organizations. It has been eventually agreed that the use of biometrics is driven by two main reasons: (a) the appropriateness of allowing the correct person to rightfully access restricted areas, resources, or products and (b) the convenience of not carrying a card or memorizing a password (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1096348010380601">Koltzsch, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Especially since the terrorist acts on September 11, 2001 and the London bombings in July 2005, an increased awareness of security has driven a proliferation of biometrics in various contexts, including nonbusiness (i.e., government, military; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010380601">Ives et al., 2005</xref>) and business (i.e., retail, airlines; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010380601">Heracleous &amp; Wirtz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). Recognizing the benefits of biometrics, many organizations experimented with some of these technologies to improve security and attendance control, and to offer more convenience to their employees. For example, because of the sensitive nature of their activities and data, organizations such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, IBM, and Pfizer, began using hand scanners to improve the accuracy of their employees’ access to sensitive areas and data, while simplifying their access protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010380601">Agnvall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1096348010380601">Tsai, 2007</xref>). Several organizations began using biometrics to improve attendance control while offering convenience to employees. With hand scanning taking less than a second to perform, and with capabilities of linking employee access/attendance data from biometric systems to payroll and other human resource management systems, organizations such as the Hilton Waterfront Beach Resort derived important benefits from using biometric systems by eliminating unethical practices (i.e., employees fraudulently clocking in/out each other; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010380601">Agnvall, 2007</xref>) while providing greater convenience to their employees (i.e., speed, no access card to be carried).</p>
<p>Although biometric technology implementations for employees use have been quite popular, to date, consumer-oriented applications have not enjoyed the same level of popularity. Although consumer-oriented biometric systems have been sporadically adopted in the past, their application has increased in recent years. For example, retailers such as Piggly-Wiggly, General Nutrition Center, and Blockbuster implemented fingerprint scanning and offered their customers increased levels of convenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010380601">Best, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348010380601">International Biometric Group, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1096348010380601">Lucas, 2005</xref>). Other applications include check-cashing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1096348010380601">Wolfe, 2008</xref>) and access systems at sports venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010380601">Den Hartog &amp; Van Munster, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the hotel industry, adoption and dissemination of technologies has been relatively complex, as it critically impacts both internal and external components of business processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1096348010380601">Wang &amp; Qualls, 2007</xref>). Biometrics made no exception: The hotel industry has been slow in implementing biometrics (K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>). As documented by the literature, to date, biometric systems have been sporadically adopted by hospitality organizations and offered predominantly to staff rather than to guests. An increasing number of hospitality operations, ranging from high-end resort hotels to fast-food restaurants such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and Dunkin’ Donuts, began using biometric systems to improve the accuracy in managing their employees and provide more convenience to their staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010380601">Agnvall, 2007</xref>). Upscale properties such as the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel and Hilton Beachfront Beach Resort have offered biometric systems to their staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010380601">Agnvall, 2007</xref>), but so far only a few companies have made them available to guests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Hospitality organizations that offered biometric systems to their guests include Harrah’s Entertainment, Walt Disney World Resort, and the Nine Zero Hotel in Boston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1096348010380601">Kirby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1096348010380601">Sturgeon, 2005</xref>). After introducing biometric systems based on fingerprint and facial recognition to their employees at their Las Vegas locations and recording substantial savings in key management and replacement costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1096348010380601">Miller, 2005</xref>), Harrah’s Entertainment decided to offer guests biometric systems. At the Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Harrah’s Entertainment offered guests a novel biometric system designed to handle their debit card withdrawals, credit card cash advances, and cash checking based on facial recognition, called the automated cash machine (ACM). After an initial facial scan is performed, guests can access cash by using any ACM without any help from a cashier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1096348010380601">Miller, 2005</xref>). Another company that seems to be using consumer-oriented biometric systems successfully is the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. At Disney, visitors provide their fingerprint along with their tickets, and a system links the ticket with the visitors’ fingerprints for later use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>). According to Jain, Disney’s system can handle approximately 100,000 visitors a day with efficiency and works accurately in a variety of weather conditions. The Nine Zero Hotel in Boston offers two suites equipped with biometric systems based on iris scanning as an alternative to traditional access (i.e., key based) systems. This way, the hotel offers convenience to guests, as enrollment takes approximately 4 minutes, whereas authentication usually takes a matter of seconds to complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1096348010380601">Kirby, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A few large-scale examples of consumer-oriented applications can be found in the travel industry. In 2004, to build and sustain competitive advantage, Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport initiated the implementation of a biometric system (fully automated seamless travel—FAST) to integrate processes such as airline check-in, preimmigration security checks, and immigration clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010380601">Heracleous &amp; Wirtz, 2006</xref>). In 2008, several major U.S. airports (i.e., Washington DC Dulles, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago O’Hare) offered travelers the possibility of obtaining cards after undergoing background checks, and fingerprint and iris scans to expedite airport security checks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010380601">Craver, 2008</xref>). A similar system, called the iris recognition immigration system (IRIS), has been implemented by the U.K. government to allow enrolled travelers to expedite immigration checks at major airports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>). Moreover, Japan uses an immigration-based biometric system based on fingerprinting and face recognition. Perhaps one of the most famous consumer-oriented biometric systems is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, which is based on recognition of fingerprint and facial images of visitors to the United States. The system is capable of matching a visitor’s fingerprints and face image against a list of more than 2 million records in a matter of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380601">Jain, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature on general technology adoption in the hospitality industry is rich, and despite a few studies published during the past 3 years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348010380601">Jackson, 2009</xref>; K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>), the literature on the adoption of biometrics in this industry is rather scarce. A review of executives’ opinions about the future of technology in the hotel industry revealed that biometric systems are less likely to be used by hotels in the near future, but they might have a high probability of being largely offered by 2027 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1096348010380601">Singh &amp; Kasavana, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1096348010380601">Lumsden and Beldona (2006)</xref> examined the benefits and drawbacks of biometric systems in hotels and noted that the use of such systems could become more widely accepted by hotels, in areas beyond security.</p>
<p>Examining hotel guests’ intentions to use fingerprint-based door locks, J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim (2009)</xref> found that such intentions are influenced by guests’ perceptions of system’s usefulness, ease of use, subjective norms, data and property security, and personal characteristics such as their demographic profile and hotel stay behavior. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> identified two segments of hotel guests with antagonistic views, “advocates” and “opponents” of biometric door locks, and found that convenience, physical security, data security, and personal concerns were important discriminating variables for segmentation purposes. That is, guests who expected superior convenience, physical security, and data security from fingerprint-based door locks could be classified as “advocates,” whereas guests who did not expect these benefits while increasing their personal security concerns could be classified as “opponents” of biometric door locks (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy and Rottet (2009)</xref> explored hotel guests’ adoption behaviors in Switzerland and found correlations between different processes (i.e., booking, access, payment) and different biometric technologies. For example, they found that guests prefer to use fingerprint-based systems for payment, confirmation of identity, access, and activation, and they prefer voice/speech recognition–based systems for booking and information requesting. Interestingly, from a list of seven biometric systems that could be used in hotels, the highest ranking was attributed by Swiss hotel guests to iris scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348010380601">Jackson (2009)</xref> provided a discussion of earlier predictions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1096348010380601">Singh and Kasavana (2005)</xref>, arguing that the hospitality industry could soon deploy a variety of applications of biometric systems.</p>

<title>Research Model and Hypotheses</title>
<p>In spite of a general slow pace of technology adoption in the hospitality industry, hotels eventually recognized the critical importance of technology, in both consumer settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan &amp; Jeong, 2008</xref>) and employee settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380601">Huh et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, hotels can use information technologies to improve internal functions (i.e., employee productivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1096348010380601">Law &amp; Jogaratnam, 2005</xref>) and their relationships with their guests, while building and sustaining competitive advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010380601">Connolly, Olsen, &amp; Moore, 1998</xref>). Thus, a process as important and multidimensional as the adoption of technology in hospitality generated a strong interest from the research community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010380601">Buhalis &amp; Law, 2008</xref>). Such an extensive interest was geared toward providing the community with the best theoretical and practical insight into technology adoption in particular industrial contexts. Consequently, the resulting hospitality/tourism industry literature provides ample discussions on technology adoption, both from an institutional and consumer perspective (T. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1096348010380601">Kim, Lee, &amp; Law, 2008</xref>). For example, in an earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1096348010380601">Wober and Gretzel (2000)</xref> discussed adoption of marketing decision support systems in the tourism industry and established links among concepts such as usefulness, ease of use, experience, and attitudes toward information technologies. Later, numerous scholars focused on adoption of technologies such as front office systems (T. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), reservation systems (H. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1096348010380601">Lee, Kim, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>), general information technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1096348010380601">Lam, Cho, &amp; Qu, 2007</xref>), and websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010380601">Chung &amp; Law, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1096348010380601">Kaplanidou &amp; Vogt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan &amp; Jeong, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, technology adoption has been a major topic for many scholars because of its importance in understanding technology diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1096348010380601">Oh, Kim, Lee, Shim, &amp; Park, 2009</xref>). In this context, a multitude of theoretical frameworks have been used, many of them being variants derived from the same class of attitudinal/behavioral models (i.e., technology acceptance model [TAM], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380601">Davis, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">1989</xref>; theory of planned behavior [TPB], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010380601">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010380601">1991</xref>). All these models explained adoption behavior by linking individuals’ beliefs to their attitudes and intentions to use new technologies, of which, the TAM seems to stand out as the most influential and valid in both employee and consumer settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1096348010380601">Oh et al., 2009</xref>). TAM’s solid theoretical foundation and its ability to parsimoniously link beliefs to behavior made it a simple, yet robust theoretical framework, which led to its wide replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1096348010380601">Schepers &amp; Wetzels, 2007</xref>). TAM has been validated in a variety of technological contexts, with samples of students and nonstudents, and in Western cultures and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Karahanna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348010380601">Devaraj, Fan, &amp; Kohli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010380601">Hsu &amp; Lu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1096348010380601">Koufaris, 2002</xref>). Moreover, a number of meta-analyses concluded that TAM is very useful model to examine adoption of new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1096348010380601">Legris, Ingham, &amp; Collerette, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1096348010380601">Ma &amp; Liu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1096348010380601">Schepers &amp; Wetzels, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The classic TAM was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380601">Davis (1986)</xref> and has its origins in attitudinal/behavioral models such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348010380601">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) and TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010380601">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010380601">1991</xref>). The model parsimoniously explains users’ new technology adoption behavior via four constructs: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitudes, and intentions to use the new technology. The model theorizes that users would adopt a new technology if that technology is perceived to help them perform a task better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">Davis, 1989</xref>), referred to as “perceived usefulness.” In addition, users would adopt a new technology if the technology is perceived as easy to use and requires little effort to perform a task, referred to as “perceived ease of use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">Davis, 1989</xref>). Both perceived usefulness and ease of use affect users’ attitudes toward new technologies, which in turn, affect their intentions to use the new technologies. Thus, the TAM proposes a direct belief–attitude–intention relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1096348010380601">Oh et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite occasional divergent opinions favoring theoretical models other than the TAM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1096348010380601">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995</xref>), most scholars who examined technology adoption in a variety of contexts extensively employed the TAM during the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1096348010380601">Oh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1096348010380601">Schepers &amp; Wetzels, 2007</xref>), giving it an extensive empirical support in mainstream business research (K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; G. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1096348010380601">Kim &amp; Park, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1096348010380601">Stern, Royne, Stafford, &amp; Bienstock, 2008</xref>) and hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380601">Huh et al., 2009</xref>). Particularly, in hospitality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380601">Huh et al. (2009)</xref>, studying three competing models, (i.e., TPB, decomposed theory of planned behavior [DTPB], and TAM) in terms of overall model fit, explanatory power, and path significance, concluded that, among the three models, TAM was the most preferable in predicting employees’ intentions to adopt hotel information systems. To date, there are no known comparisons of competing models that could explain biometric adoption by guests in hospitality. However, two studies focusing on guests’ adoption of fingerprint-based door locks (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>) and overall biometric system adoption in Swiss hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>) used variants of TAM as theoretical foundations. Thus, given its parsimony, robustness, and broad empirical support (H. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1096348010380601">Lin, 2007</xref>), the TAM has been used in this study to predict guests’ intentions to use biometric systems in hotels.</p>
<p>The literature on technology adoption recognizes various extensions of TAM to fit various technological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1096348010380601">Schepers &amp; Wetzels, 2007</xref>), as some scholars argue that TAM, despite its broad validation, needs to be extended in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of technology adoption. In an effort to understand what else drives consumers’ adoption of technologies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal and Prasad (1998)</xref> using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1096348010380601">Rogers’s (1983)</xref> diffusion of innovation framework, posited that the most immediate influences on an individual’s cognitive assessment of information technology are represented by factors unique to the individual. Rogers found that individuals who are highly innovative are active seekers of new ideas, can cope with higher levels of uncertainty, and develop more positive intentions toward acceptance. Agarwal and Prasad viewed personal innovativeness as expressing the risk-taking propensity that certain individuals possess, and defined it as an individual’s willingness to try out a new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1096348010380601">Midgley &amp; Dowling, 1978</xref>). Thus, in an effort to increase the model’s explanatory power by including personal factors (perceived innovativeness toward information technology), the TAM has been extended in this study by adding a new hypothesized relationship between perceived innovativeness toward technology and perceived ease of use. The conceptual model and its hypothesized relationships are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010380601">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Perceived usefulness is a fundamental component of technology adoption in the hotel industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010380601">Christou &amp; Kassianidis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1096348010380601">Law &amp; Jogaratnam, 2005</xref>). The predominant belief is that users will adopt a technology if they perceive it to be useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1096348010380601">Premkumar, Ramamurthy, &amp; Liu, 2008</xref>). For hotel guests, usefulness of biometric systems is linked to the extent to which biometric systems help them in performing tasks (i.e., check in/out, access, payment) better than alternative technologies (i.e., keycards). The literature on biometrics provides evidence that biometric systems improve transaction speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380601">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1096348010380601">Kirby, 2008</xref>) and employee recognition and payment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010380601">Heracleous &amp; Wirtz, 2006</xref>). In the hospitality industry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy and Rottet (2009)</xref> emphasized the importance of biometric systems in improving efficiency for hotel guests. Moreover, J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim (2009)</xref> confirmed that a relationship existed between perceived usefulness and guests’ intentions to use biometric door locks in hotels. Thus, in the light of the existing literature, the following hypothesis has been developed:</p>
<list id="list2-1096348010380601" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: There is a positive relationship between guests’ perceived usefulness and their attitudes toward using biometric systems in hotels.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second fundamental construct of TAM is perceived ease of use. It refers to an individual’s assessment of the amount of effort needed to perform a task using a new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu, Liu, Yu, &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">Davis (1989)</xref> put more emphasis on the relationship between perceived usefulness and attitudes than between perceived ease of use and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380601">Huh et al., 2009</xref>), he posited that users would not adopt a new technology unless it is easy to use. In the hospitality industry, the relationship between perceived ease of use and attitudes toward new technologies has been validated in several studies (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan &amp; Jeong, 2008</xref>). Overall, biometric systems are believed to enhance convenience for users in hospitality (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1096348010380601">Lumsden &amp; Beldona, 2006</xref>) and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010380601">Heracleous &amp; Wirtz, 2006</xref>), and their ease of use and transparency are key in adoption by the consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1096348010380601">Pons &amp; Polak, 2008</xref>). Thus, based on the above, the following hypothesis has been developed:</p>
<list id="list3-1096348010380601" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: There is a positive relationship between guests’ perceived ease of use and their attitudes toward using biometric systems in hotels.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The literature on TAM provides overwhelming evidence of a strong, positive relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1096348010380601">Ruth, 2000</xref>). In the hospitality/tourism industry, this relationship has been validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1096348010380601">Wober and Gretzel (2000)</xref> and recently by J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan and Jeong (2008)</xref>. Thus, the following hypothesis has been developed:</p>
<list id="list4-1096348010380601" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: There is a positive relationship between guests’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of biometric systems in hotels.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Attitudes refer to an individual’s inclination to display certain responses toward concepts or objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1096348010380601">Vijayasarathy, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010380601">Fishbein (1963)</xref> generally viewed attitudes toward objects as outcomes of an individual’s beliefs about an object and evaluative responses associated with these beliefs. In the context of TAM, positive attitudes toward new technologies have been validated as antecedents of strong intentions to adopt such technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1096348010380601">Legris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1096348010380601">Shih, 2004</xref>). The relationship between the attitudes toward technologies and the intention to use those technologies has been well documented in both mainstream marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1096348010380601">Walczuch, Lemmink, &amp; Streukens, 2007</xref>) and hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan &amp; Jeong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1096348010380601">Wang &amp; Qualls, 2007</xref>). Thus, the following hypothesis has been developed:</p>
<list id="list5-1096348010380601" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: There is a positive relationship between guests’ attitudes toward biometric systems and their intentions to use biometric systems in hotels.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the widespread acceptance of TAM by scholars, there is a substantial deal of dissent in terms of the final level in the TAM: intentions to use or actual use. Although an objective measure of behavior would be ideal, most TAM studies used intentions as surrogate measures of adoption behavior, grounded in the belief that intentions are, in fact, strong predictors of actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1096348010380601">Legris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1096348010380601">Shih, 2004</xref>). This assertion has been validated in mainstream marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010380601">Bruner &amp; Kumar, 2005</xref>) and hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1096348010380601">Wang &amp; Qualls, 2007</xref>). In this study, however, intentions to use rather than actual use have been used, as the offering of biometric systems to hotel guests is still in infancy. Such an approach to measuring the final level in TAM has been popular in studies of adoption of technologies being in early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature on technology adoption is rich in applications of TAM, recent studies recognized the deficiency of the classic TAM to capture all aspects of adoption in various industry or application contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1096348010380601">Moon &amp; Kim, 2001</xref>). Most studies extended TAM by adding antecedents to perceived usefulness and ease of use and focusing on the effects of such external variables on TAM’s original constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010380601">Bruner &amp; Kumar, 2005</xref>). Some of these antecedents included constructs related to human and social change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1096348010380601">Legris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1096348010380601">Premkumar et al., 2008</xref>), such as playfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010380601">Chung &amp; Tan, 2004</xref>), enjoyment, and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1096348010380601">Yu, Ha, Choi, &amp; Rho, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies using extended versions of the TAM in the hotel industry focused on the supply side, by adding organizational factors (i.e., technology climate, technology characteristics, strategic orientation of the organization; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1096348010380601">Wang &amp; Qualls, 2007</xref>), information quality, system quality, service quality, perceived value (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), and task, career, and organizational fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1096348010380601">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). For example, studying the general information technology adoption in hospitality organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1096348010380601">Wang and Qualls (2007)</xref> examined the impact of organizations’ technology capacity and technology characteristics as moderators of the classic TAM constructs. They have also focused on finding the antecedents of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use from internal and external perspectives and challenged the popular assumption that no other factors affected the relationship between perceptions and adoption behavior. However, despite the predominant supply-side orientation of technology adoption research in the hotel industry, a recent study has been found to focus on the demand side by using an extended TAM. For example, studying consumers’ adoption of hotel reservation websites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1096348010380601">Morosan and Jeong (2008)</xref> found that playfulness can provide additional explanatory power to the adoption of reservation websites and that perceived playfulness was a strong predictor of attitudes toward adopting reservation websites.</p>
<p>Defined as the extent to which an individual is willing to try out any new product (i.e., technology; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1096348010380601">Midgley &amp; Dowling, 1978</xref>), perceived innovativeness is one of traditional factors in the innovation diffusion research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1096348010380601">Rogers, 1983</xref>) that is believed to influence an individual’s adoption of innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1998</xref>). Generally, perceived innovativeness measures the extent to which an individual is open to technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1096348010380601">Rogers &amp; Shoemaker, 1971</xref>). Since the early 1970s, studies showed that perceived innovativeness had a substantial impact on the practice of marketing, especially on segmentation, allowing marketers to divide consumer populations into groups such as “innovators” and “noninnovators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1998</xref>). The mainstream marketing literature eventually recognized the conceptual and operational distinction between “global” and “domain specific” innovativeness, with tremendous implications for the study of adoption behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010380601">Flynn &amp; Goldsmith, 1993</xref>). On one hand, global innovativeness has been viewed as a characteristic that humans may possess to a greater or lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1998</xref>). However, it has been argued that global innovativeness had a low prediction power in certain domain-specific adoption contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380601">Goldsmith &amp; Hofacker, 1991</xref>). On the other hand, domain-specific innovativeness may have a substantial influence on adoption behavior in specific, narrower domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380601">Goldsmith &amp; Hofacker, 1991</xref>). Since this study focused on a narrower context (technology adoption), perceived innovativeness toward information technology has been used in this study.</p>
<p>Earlier operationalizations of domain-specific innovativeness have been based on a “time-of-adoption” methodology, measuring the time elapsed from the introduction of a product until its adoption by the consumers. However, such methodologies have been severely criticized for not being able to accurately measure the underlying construct they were designed to measure, and therefore lacking reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348010380601">Hurt, Joseph, &amp; Cook, 1977</xref>). In response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380601">Goldsmith and Hofacker (1991)</xref> developed and tested a six-item measurement self-reported scale for the domain-specific innovativeness. This scale has been used extensively and has been adapted to measure innovativeness toward novel domains, such as the information technology.</p>
<p>Perceived innovativeness toward information technology has been used in a variety of contexts, often as an extension of the classic TAM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348010380601">Karahanna, Straub, and Chervany (1998)</xref> argued that, generally, as individuals are more innovative, the less complex their belief sets about the new technologies. Viewing innovativeness as a trait, which is not influenced by environmental or internal variables, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1096348010380601">Walczuch et al. (2007)</xref> found a significant relationship between perceived innovativeness and perceived ease of use of technology by employees of a Belgian multisite financial service provider. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1096348010380601">Lu, Yao, and Yu (2005)</xref>, studying the adoption of wireless Internet services via mobile technology, found significant relationships between perceived innovativeness toward information technology and perceived ease of use. In their study of adoption and use of Internet technologies by faculty and instructors in their teaching activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1096348010380601">Lewis, Agarwal, and Sambamurthy (2003)</xref> confirmed a hypothesized relationship between perceived innovativeness and perceived ease of use.</p>
<p>It is generally expected that individuals with high innovativeness would also be naturally inclined in finding their way around a novel technology. In the context of biometric systems in hotels, it is believed that, given the natural inclination of highly innovative individuals to learn how to use technologies easily, they would easily learn how to use biometric systems. Thus, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380601">Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1096348010380601">Walczuch et al., 2007</xref>), a relationship between perceived innovativeness toward IT and perceived ease of use of biometric systems is expected. Therefore, the following hypothesis has been developed:</p>

<p>The measurement scales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1096348010380601">Appendix A</xref>) have been adapted from the rich literature on TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">Davis, 1989</xref>) and related models (TRA, TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010380601">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010380601">1991</xref>) to fit the context of biometric systems in hotels. To measure perceived usefulness, the scale included four items, measuring the extent to which biometric systems in hotels would enhance the effectiveness of guests’ interactions with the hotel (i.e., check in/out, guest area access, food/beverage payment; S. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1096348010380601">Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1096348010380601">Lopez-Nicolas, Molina-Castillo, &amp; Bouwman, 2008</xref>), improve the quality of stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010380601">Ahn, Ryu, &amp; Han, 2007</xref>), and allow guests to do things better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1096348010380601">Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2008</xref>). This scale concluded with a fourth item, which was a general statement about the overall usefulness of biometric systems in hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). The scale for perceived ease of use included four items, measuring the extent to which learning to use biometric systems in hotels would be easy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1096348010380601">Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2008</xref>), the interactions between guests and biometric systems would be clear and understandable, and would not require a lot of mental effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, the fourth item on this scale was a general statement about the overall ease of use of biometric systems in hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1096348010380601">Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2008</xref>). Both scales were Likert-type and were anchored in 5 points, with values ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>
<p>To measure attitudes toward biometric systems in hotels, a 5-point semantic differential scale was used. The anchors were <italic>good idea</italic>–<italic>bad idea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010380601">Ahn et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>wise</italic>–<italic>foolish</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010380601">Ahn et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>beneficial</italic>–<italic>not beneficial</italic> (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1096348010380601">Lee &amp; Kozar, 2008</xref>), and <italic>enjoyable</italic>–<italic>not enjoyable</italic> (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1096348010380601">Lee &amp; Kozar, 2008</xref>). The scale for intentions to use biometric systems in hotels was similar to the scales used to measure perceived usefulness and ease of use. The scale included three items, measuring the extent to which the respondents intend to use biometric systems in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1096348010380601">Shin, 2009</xref>), whether it would be one of their favorite technologies to use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010380601">Im, Kim, &amp; Han, 2008</xref>), and whether the user would recommend the use of biometric systems in hotels to others. A 5-point Likert-type scale with values ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> was used for these items.</p>
<p>In this study, perceived innovativeness toward the specific domain of information technology was used. The scale for perceived innovativeness toward information technology was adapted from the existing literature on domain-specific innovativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380601">Goldsmith &amp; Hofacker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1096348010380601">Lu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1096348010380601">Walczuch et al., 2007</xref>).

All items have been anchored in 5 points, with values ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The survey concluded with a section on guests’ travel behavior (i.e., type of hotel used, trip purpose, number of nights spent in a hotel during the past 12 months) and a brief demographic section (i.e., gender, age, marital status, and income) to create a profile of respondents.</p>
<p>An online survey was conducted with respondents who traveled during a period of 12 months prior to the survey. The sample frame of 621 valid email addresses was provided by the administration of a small private university located in a metro area in southwestern United States. The sample frame included email addresses of students enrolled in the MBA program as of the spring semester of 2008. In March 2009, an invitation email to participate in the online survey was sent out, and, after two reminders, a number of 185 respondents completed the survey. Only the respondents who stayed at least one night in a hotel during a period of 12 months prior to the study were kept in the analysis. After removing the records containing heavily missing values, a total of 162 responses remained in the analysis, accounting for a response rate of 26%. The respondents were asked to refer to a scenario (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1096348010380601">Appendix B</xref>), in which they had to imagine being guests in a hotel that offered biometric systems as well as traditional systems (i.e., electronic cards) for guest-area access and payment. The biometric systems offered by the hotel in the scenario were the most commonly discussed systems found in the current literature (i.e., fingerprinting, face recognition, iris scan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Analysis</title>
<p>Since a permanent concern in survey research is the possibility that respondents may have different opinions than nonrespondents, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted by comparing groups of early with late respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010380601">Ary, Jacobs, &amp; Razavieh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010380601">Connors &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>). The respondents were divided into three groups (early, mid, and late respondents) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess if there are any significant differences among these groups. As nonsignificant differences were found, it was concluded that nonresponse bias is not a concern in this study. The results of the ANOVA can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1096348010380601">Appendix C</xref>.</p>
<p>The demographic profile of respondents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010380601">Table 1</xref>) revealed that most of them had annual household incomes between $50,000 and $79,999, although the sample was almost evenly split among income categories. The proportion of males and females was approximately even, with slightly more females in the sample. Most respondents were relatively young, with the majority being between 25 and 34 years old. A large majority of respondents (57.9%) were single, whereas a total of approximately 40% were couples.</p>

<p>The examination of convergent validity requires scrutiny of factor loadings and squared multiple correlations (SMCs) of the measurement items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010380601">Bollen, 1989</xref>). All factor loadings had values between .630 and .942 on their underlying constructs and were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, the SMCs were calculated for all items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1096348010380601">Table 3</xref>). All items had SMC values greater than the suggested value of .4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010380601">Bollen, 1989</xref>), whereas one item (PEOU4), had a SMC value of .397, which is within 0.5% from .4. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010380601">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</xref>, discriminant validity is established if, for any two constructs, A and B, the average variance extracted (AVE) for A and the AVE for B exceed the squared correlation between A and B. The inter-construct correlations were calculated based on the averaged scales for these constructs, that is, items pertaining to each underlying construct were averaged. In this case, all AVE scores, ranging from .538 to .832, were greater than the suggested cut-off value of .5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010380601">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1096348010380601">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, the AVE scores for any two constructs were greater than their corresponding squared interconstruct correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010380601">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). In addition, the composite construct reliabilities (CCRs) were calculated for all constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1096348010380601">Table 3</xref>). The composite reliability is a measure that depicts the extent to which a number of items indicate a common construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010380601">Hair et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, all CCR values were greater than the acceptable level of .7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010380601">Hair et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, the conditions for convergent and discriminant validity were met for all constructs.</p>

<p>The research model was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), using the Amos 5.0 software package. Fitting the model to the sample resulted in a chi-square value of 277.11 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with 147 degrees of freedom, and a normed-χ<sup>2</sup> of 1.88. Furthermore, the model had a GFI value of .85, an AGFI value of .81, a NFI value of .90, an IFI value of .94, a TLI value of .93, and a RMSEA value of .07. All the fit measures exceeded their suggested values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1096348010380601">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993</xref>), and thus, it was concluded that the model fit was good.</p>
<p>Significance of the path loadings provided results for hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1096348010380601">Figure 2</xref>). Perceived usefulness (β = .72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) was a significant predictor of attitudes, thus providing support for Hypothesis 1. In hotels, guests’ use of biometric systems that are perceived as useful (i.e., perceived to be performing tasks for consumers better than alternative technologies) are likely to lead to the development of positive attitudes toward using biometric systems. For example, as guests perceive that biometric systems increase the effectiveness of their interactions with the hotels (i.e., check in/out, guest area access, food/beverage payment), it is likely that they recognize the benefits of biometric systems and start liking the idea of using them. Perceived ease of use (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) had a significant direct impact on attitudes toward using biometric systems in hotels, providing support for Hypothesis 2. In hotel settings, users who perceive biometric systems as easy to use are likely to develop positive attitudes toward using biometric systems. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> pointed out that a technology that is perceived as easy to use might help users redirect unused effort to other tasks. Similarly, as biometric systems require minimal effort to interact with a hotel, guests can redirect their unused effort toward other tasks or leisure/entertainment activities.</p>

<p>The TAM literature documents inconsistent results with regard to the direct relationship between perceived ease of use and attitudes (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Several scholars could not validate a direct relationship between perceived ease of use and attitudes, and indicated that in certain technological contexts this relationship appeared to be mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1096348010380601">Kim &amp; Forsythe, 2008</xref>). J. Kim and Forsythe further argued that the existence of a direct relationship between perceived ease of use and attitudes might vary by technology. However, in the context of the hotel industry, this study indicated that a direct relationship exists between perceived ease of use and attitudes toward using biometric systems. As indicated by the SMCs, perceived usefulness and ease of use together explained 80% of the variability in attitudes toward biometric systems in hotels. Hotel guests will develop positive attitudes toward using biometric systems if such systems are perceived as useful and easy to use. The path coefficients of the two predictors of attitudes indicated that perceived usefulness was a stronger predictor of attitudes than was perceived ease of use. Guests’ attitudes toward use of biometric systems in hotels seem to be more strongly influenced by perceptions of usefulness (i.e., performing tasks better than alternative systems) than by perceptions of effort-free use. Furthermore, perceived ease of use was a significant predictor of perceived usefulness (β = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), explaining 48% of the variability in perceived usefulness, and thus, providing support for Hypothesis 3. The easier to use a biometric system is perceived to be by hotel guests, the more likely it is that they find it useful.</p>
<p>The direct relationship between attitudes toward use and intentions to use has been at the heart of theory, both in innovation diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1096348010380601">Rogers, 1983</xref>) and technology adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380601">Davis, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">1989</xref>). In this study, attitudes toward use of biometric systems explained approximately 79% in the variability of intentions to use biometric systems in hotels (β = .89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), thus providing support for Hypothesis 4. This result suggests that guests who develop positive attitudes toward the use of biometric systems in hotels are likely to use these systems.</p>
<p>Although explaining only 9% of variability in perceived ease of use, perceived innovativeness (β = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was found to be a significant predictor of ease of use, thus supporting Hypothesis 5. A fit seems to exist between guests inclined toward technology and their perceptions of ease of use of biometric systems. That is, for guests with a general inclination toward technology, biometric systems would eventually seem easier to use than it would be for guests not inclined toward technology. As expected, all the hypotheses were supported providing empirical validation of this variant of TAM, which can be used to examine guests’ intentions to use biometric systems in the hotel industry.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The research presented here was motivated by the fact that biometric systems are becoming increasingly present in all aspects of modern life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1096348010380601">Langenderfer &amp; Linnhoff, 2005</xref>). This research advances the current knowledge in the theory and practice of hospitality by empirically validating the TAM in the context of adoption of biometric systems in the hotel industry. In addition, this study could be considered one of the first steps in the examination adoption of biometric systems by hotel guests in the United States, which has seen relatively more applications of biometrics than other nations. To this end, an ampler discussion of several important theoretical and practical implications and recommendations of this research is following.</p>
<p>From a theory advancement perspective, a first key contribution of this study is that it validates the historical robustness of the TAM within the context of a novel technology—biometrics—in the hotel industry. Thus, this study advances the scholarly effort in hospitality aimed at finding the most appropriate theory for the study of adoption of biometric systems in hotels. The overwhelming empirical support for the first four hypotheses confirms that, as expected, the TAM methodology is a parsimonious, yet robust framework to explain hotel guests’ attitudes and intentions to use biometric systems via classic perceptions such as usefulness and ease of use. Thus, this study offers researchers an unambiguous methodology, which can become established as a compelling theoretical foundation to further study various aspects of biometric systems’ adoption in hospitality.</p>
<p>A second key contribution of this research is the extension of the classic TAM by adding perceived innovativeness. This study hypothesized and found support for a theoretical model in which individual differences influence guests’ attitudes toward using biometric systems in hotels through their influence on perceptions about this technology (i.e., perceived ease of use). Thus, this study offers an improved theoretical base for the study of adoption of biometric systems in hotels, given that many studies on innovation diffusion and technology adoption focused on explaining attitudes and intentions to use based mostly on perceptions of the system under study (i.e., usefulness, ease of use, security, safety). Thus, by adding the user’s personal technology inclination dimension, this study provides a superior theoretical basis to study technology adoption, yet retaining a parsimonious structure.</p>
<p>Third, this study contributes to the increasing body of theoretical and empirical evidence by validating the TAM as an appropriate theoretical base for the study of voluntary technology adoption. The TAM was originally designed by to predict technology adoption in mandatory (i.e., work related) settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380601">Davis, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380601">1989</xref>). Since then, a variety of replications and extensions have been developed, most of them in mandatory settings. In mandatory settings, users’ adoption of technology may be influenced by managerial presence, organization-specific circumstances, including broader organizational goals (C. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1096348010380601">Lin, Shih, &amp; Sher, 2007</xref>). In contrast, in voluntary settings, users may have multiple system choices, and adoption may be truly voluntary. For this reason, the examination of biometric systems adoption in voluntary settings remains more challenging than in mandatory settings, but it may provide very important insight into the free formation of attitudes and intentions to use new technologies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this study contributes to the continuous paradigmatic advancement of the TAM framework by focusing on the relatively less understood context of users’ adoption of biometric systems. As today’s interconnected society offers more occasions for the use of biometric systems, the research community can use this extended TAM framework to investigate consumer adoption in industries such as travel, foodservice, recreation, and general retail. This way, a gap in the current research could be filled, as most biometric system research focuses on the technical aspects of biometrics, largely neglecting user adoption aspects.</p>
<p>Overall, a large percentage (79%) of the variability in intentions to adopt biometric systems in hotels was explained by its predictors, indicating that this extended variant of TAM is an appropriate theoretical framework to examine guests’ intentions to use biometric systems in hotels. In hotel guests, perceived innovativeness had a significant impact on perceived ease of use. In turn perceived usefulness and ease of use had significant impacts on attitudes toward using biometric systems, and further, on intentions to use biometric systems in hotels. Thus, it can be concluded that, in spite of their limited use by hotels, biometric systems are ready to be adopted by guests.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>An objective of this study was to determine the manner in which guests’ perceptions of usefulness and ease of use affected their attitudes toward and intentions to use biometric systems in hotels. As the results indicated, the strongest predictor of attitudes was perceived usefulness. In the hotel industry, this may be indicative that, to be adopted, biometric systems must provide evidence of superiority relative to the alternative systems. As biometric systems become increasingly available, hotels might explain potential benefits to guests in an effort to stir their curiosity about these systems. This approach might stimulate guests’ cognitions related to system performance, which might strengthen their perceptions of the system’s latent potential. In turn, this may trigger exploratory use, which is believed to impact perceived usefulness, with a direct impact on attitudes and intentions to use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1096348010380601">Saeed &amp; Abdinnour-Helm, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To increase usefulness, hotels could pursue the integration of biometric systems with other information systems that are offered to guests (i.e., reservations, entertainment). In that sense, a number of advantages can be foreseen, especially in terms of value to guests, accessibility, and cost. First, a fully integrated system that allows guests to use the same biometrics at multiple properties would definitely add value to guests’ hotel stay experiences, especially in terms of optimization of interactions with the hotel. Furthermore, such fully integrated systems could set up switch barriers, which, in the long term, could result in an increase in guests’ purchasing behavior of a particular hotel brand. Coupled with strong attitudes toward the brand, this may result in a true, strong sense of loyalty toward the property/brand. Second, an integration of biometrics into other systems that guests have already adopted would eventually result in an easier adoption of the biometric component, as their perceptions of usefulness may transfer from the existing (i.e., traditional access or payments methods) to the new (i.e., biometric systems) parts of the integrated system. However, from an operational perspective, the issue of compatibility between the existing and new is critical. For example, most of today’s vendors of biometric systems use proprietary algorithms for capture and authentication. Thus, as the standards related to these systems are still in infancy, it is indicated that hotels avoid vendors using proprietary algorithms, as it would limit future system interoperability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1096348010380601">Kleist, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another factor that might contribute to the enhancement of beliefs, especially of usefulness, of biometric systems is their popularity and extensive usage in other contexts. As biometric systems are more widely spread in contexts such as airport and border security, users might diminish some of their concerns associated with the use of biometric systems. With increasing use and resulting familiarity with biometric systems while traveling, it is anticipated that more users would eventually become convinced of the efficiency, convenience, and harmlessness of such technologies, contributing to the development of more positive beliefs and attitudes toward biometric systems. Although when crossing borders or entering certain countries travelers might find the use of biometrics to be mandatory, they might eventually develop attitudes that could be strong enough to stimulate curiosity and voluntary use in further settings, such as hotels. Thus, hotels might embrace and at least explore the offering of biometric systems to guests, with the expectation that they would eventually recover the cost associated with the implementation of such systems.</p>
<p>Although perceived ease of use was not a strong predictor of attitudes, it strongly impacted perceived usefulness, thus supporting one of the fundamental hypotheses of TAM. In the context of biometric systems in the hotel industry, it means that guests who learn easily how to use biometric systems also may see more clearly their benefits in performing tasks such as check in/out, access, or payment. Thus, once hotels offer biometric systems, they need to convince guests about the convenience and usefulness of such systems. As perceived ease of use was a weaker predictor of attitudes than was perceived usefulness, hotels need to implement biometric systems that are high in ease of use. At the same time, they must emphasize that such systems would eventually optimize their interactions with a hotel. However, one may speculate that, as biometric systems are not currently widespread in the hotel industry, their benefits, especially in terms of ease of use, may be underestimated by guests.</p>
<p>Perceived innovativeness toward technology was found to be a strong predictor of perceived ease of use. This seems to suggest that innovative people, who have a natural inclination toward technology and are willing to take risks, would easily learn how to use such systems, and in turn, their beliefs about system usefulness may strengthen. As guests may develop their beliefs about technology from a variety of sources (including mass media and interpersonal channels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1096348010380601">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>), hotels should use all media to encourage them to try out the new systems once they are offered. Such an approach might work well in hotel settings where guests already use a variety of other technologies (i.e., self check in/out, in-room entertainment). Stimulating guests who possess higher degrees of personal innovativeness toward information technology might increase the rate of adoption. However, this might be a challenging task for hotels as it is difficult to distinguish and classify guests based on their innovativeness. One way in which hotels can move a step closer to identifying the most innovative guests is to examine their previous behavior in terms of technology adoption and usage. For this, information such as the type of distribution channel used (i.e., online vs. offline), requests for Internet service in the room, or usage of other available technologies could provide substantial hints into guests’ perceived innovativeness toward information technologies.</p>
<sec id="section11-1096348010380601">
<title>Limitations and Directions for Further Research</title>
<p>Because of several limitations, the results of this research should be interpreted with caution. A first limitation is the sample. Although a sample of the general traveler population would have been desirable, a sample of MBA students and graduates was used in this study. Thus, the demographic and behavioral characteristics of this sample of respondents may reflect the attitudes and intentions of early adopters (i.e., they may be younger and more highly educated than the general population). However, since early adopters are particularly important in driving innovation diffusion in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010380601">Goldsmith, Flynn, &amp; Goldsmith, 2003</xref>), this sample is viewed as adequate. More important, given the purpose of this study to test theoretical relationships between constructs rather than making point and interval estimates of those relationships, the nature of the sample does not constitute a great concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010380601">Calder, Phillips, &amp; Tybout, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010380601">Cowart, Fox, &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). Finally, this sample should be viewed as adequate for at least two additional reasons: (a) respondents’ familiarity with computerized systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010380601">Brackett &amp; Carr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1096348010380601">Stern et al., 2008</xref>) and (b) prior use of this type of sample in theory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010380601">Calder et al., 1981</xref>). Further research should replicate the results of this study with general population samples to improve generalizability to other traveler groups.</p>
<p>A second limitation is the task setting. Respondents had been given the task to imagine a scenario in which they would stay in a hotel that offered biometric systems. This task environment allowed for better control of some of the outside factors that otherwise could have induced bias. For example, to diminish the effect of security concerns, the respondents have been instructed to consider that the systems in the given scenario are 100 percent safe and secure and no harm or fraud could result from their usage. In addition, the TAM methodology is weak outside of the task environment. A direction for further research is to apply this theoretical framework to examine adoption in controlled hotel settings where a limited variety of biometric systems is in use.</p>
<p>The relationship between intentions to perform a behavior and actual behavior is a critical issue addressed in previous research. In this study, intentions are the final stage in the model, assuming, based on overwhelming evidence from literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010380601">Bruner &amp; Kumar, 2005</xref>), that intentions lead to actual behavior. This might constitute a third limitation of this study. Although using actual measures of behavior would be insightful, the practicality of such an approach may be limited, especially since today, biometric systems are still in their infancy in the hotel industry. Thus, further studies could replicate this setting and use measures of actual behavior once biometrics are more widespread in the hotel industry.</p>
<p>Because of the very limited research in the area of biometrics in the hotel industry (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1096348010380601">Lumsden &amp; Beldona, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1096348010380601">Murphy &amp; Rottet, 2009</xref>), this study provides a foundation for further studies on the adoption of biometric systems in this industry. As biometric systems become increasingly present in hospitality settings, the research community should concentrate on understanding not only how guests adopt such systems but also how organizations (i.e., managers, staff) adopt and offer them. In addition, given that this study employed an extended variant of TAM, it would be interesting to further explore how other social or personal factors (as extensions of TAM) influence the adoption of biometric systems in hotels.</p>
<p>One of such personal factors may be the users’ natural concerns (i.e., physical harm, identity theft, loss of privacy) related to the use of novel technologies. All novel technologies are believed to carry some degree of risk, which may be perceived by users as being hidden or unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1096348010380601">Mordini, 2007</xref>). In the case of biometrics in hotels, some of the most critical concerns are users’ privacy and fear of physical harm (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380601">Kim, 2009</xref>, J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1096348010380601">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Outside hospitality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1096348010380601">Schouten and Jacobs (2009)</xref> found that the most common privacy issues associated with biometrics included storage of biometric data, identity theft as a consequence of biophishing (fraudulently obtaining someone’s biometric data), and tracking/tracing of individuals. Such concerns may exacerbate technophobia (fear of technology) in some users, which may influence the dynamics of their adoption of biometric systems. Thus, a promising direction for further research is to explore consumers’ privacy concerns associated with biometric systems as a possible factor that may influence biometric systems adoption in hotels. Furthermore, from a marketing standpoint, it would be interesting to find how adoption of biometric systems varies across guest segments.</p>
<p>The current literature provides increasing evidence that biometric systems will be eventually widely adopted by guests and enthusiastically offered by hotels. However, the choice of biometric systems may be largely dictated by characteristics such as usefulness, ease of use, and by users’ personal characteristics. Thus, it would be the role of the research community to further investigate the implications for both guests’ hotel stay experiences and hotels’ profitability indicators once the dynamics of wide scale biometric system adoption are set in motion.</p>

<title>Scenario</title>
<p>Imagine that you are a guest in a hotel that offers the possibility of using biometric systems (i.e., fingerprint readers, voice recognition systems, iris scan systems) as an option to simplify your check-in/out, access guest areas, pay for food and beverages, and facilitate other aspects of your hotel stay (i.e., accessing the business center or the pool).</p>
<p>For example, imagine that on arrival to your hotel, your fingerprint is recorded by a biometric system. Then, you can use your fingerprint as an electronic ID to check in/out, access guest areas, and make purchases instead of using a credit card or interacting directly with the hotel staff.</p>
<p>Also, imagine that fingerprint readers installed conveniently throughout the hotel allow you to access your guestroom and other guests-only areas (i.e., pool, sauna, gym, business center), and pay for food and beverages without carrying a hotel key or credit card with you all the time. Also, imagine that the hotel allows you to use your fingerprint as a digital ID to simplify your future stays at that property or hotel chain.</p>
<p>Assume that the hotel also offers traditional means of guest access (i.e., key card) and payment (i.e., credit card, cash) available through the hotel’s staff.</p>
<p>Assume that using biometric systems is 100% safe and secure and no harm can be done to you as a user.</p>
