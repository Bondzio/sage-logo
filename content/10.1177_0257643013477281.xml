<p>Modern statecraft has continued to grapple with citizenship discourse in the legal-constitutional domain and India has been no exception. A reading of citizenship debates in India reveals the ‘ambivalences’ which produce ‘disturbed zones of citizenship’ and Anupama Roy in this fascinating work, <italic>Mapping Citizenship In India</italic>, not only identifies the disturbed zones of citizenship but also shows the ‘conflict between contending practices of citizenship’ (p. 13). She shows that modern statecraft in the making of a ‘citizen’ has constantly defined who is a ‘non-citizen’ in various phases and ‘how the legal-juridical framework of membership have expressed, articulated or, alternatively addressed the “crisis in citizenship”’ (p. 27) through three specific moments in the history of citizenship in India. In this context she draws our attention to how the figure of ‘migrant’ features across these three decisive moments and informs the making of a ‘citizen’. The three decisive moments are: enactment of the Citizenship Act of 1955, amendment of the Citizenship Act in 1986 and amendment of the Citizenship Act in 2003 and again in 2005. The uniqueness of the book lies in the way Roy uses the ‘migrant’ to analyze the ‘territorial and political demarcation of citizenship’ and in a way reveals the latent paradox within ‘citizenship’. In her words (pp. 12–13):
<disp-quote>
<p>An inherent paradox lies within citizenship between its simultaneous unfolding as a momentum concept with a liberatory promise and citizenship’s hierarchical aspects which emerge from state practices of citizenship as well as the socio-economic contexts in which these practices are embedded and unfold. The dominant framework of citizenship as an aspect of western modernity, as well as its relationship in its origin and synchronous development with the nation-state, capitalism and liberalism, continue to shape its content and trajectory in present times.</p>

<title>Making of the Nation-state</title>
<p>The nascent Indian state as Roy argues, did not define who is a ‘citizen’ of India, but clearly addressed the question of identification of Indian citizens and provided a scope for people migrating between India and Pakistan between the constitutional deadlines of 19 July 1948 and 26 January 1950 to be recognized as citizens. In this context she illustrates that the period marking the commencement of the constitution of India (1950) and the Citizenship of India Act (1955) was a zone of liminality. What is interesting is the way the constitutional provisions for enframing the citizen and the Citizenship Act both took into cognizance the migration movements post–partition. This showed that ‘citizenship’ was about territoriality in a fixed time span. In this context Roy brings to our attention how the choice to migrate was seen as a way of ‘exclusion’ from constitutional and later legal provision. The lack of choice and the ascriptive nature of citizenship become evident in the way women were restored to their ‘homes’, which moved beyond the ‘domestic’ to the ‘national boundary’ through the Abducted Persons (Recovery and Restoration) Act. Feminist writings on state formation and sovereignty had criticized the paternalistic attitude of the state towards ‘forced marriage’ where the state failed to recognize that a longer period had ‘lapsed between abduction and recovery’ (p. 45). The act of recovery of abducted women adopted by the nascent Indian state was to ensure the nation-state’s honour, where the ‘order of family’ became a subject of state jurisdiction. What is interesting is the way the Citizenship Act of 1955 was implemented in case of displaced (Hindu) minorities from Pakistan compared to registration of ‘wives’ as citizens (p. 61). Through a series of legal cases Roy illustrates the ‘prejudiced’ practices of citizenship following partition through the Abducted Persons Recovery and Restoration Act and also registration of wives as citizens. Not only did the ‘migrant’ become a defining feature to delimit citizenship, but also to practice exclusionary and arbitrary ways of defining citizenship through enactment of Citizenship Act 1955, where the following categories were considered to be essential for the making of a citizen: ‘birth, descent, registration, naturalization, and by incorporation of foreign territory into India’ (p. 96). Hence, state formation began with defining the citizen vis-à-vis a ‘migrant’ and this continued even through the first amendment of the Citizenship Act in 1986.</p>

<title>Politics of Place-making and Citizenship Debate</title>
<p>The first amendment of the Citizenship Act in 1986, added Article 6 A, which in a way added a sixth category to the five essentials of the Citizenship Act of 1955, specific to the region of Assam. The amendment created a provision of ‘deferred citizenship (for those who arrived between 1966 and 25 March 1971) through the determination of legality by the Foreigners Act. The rest who arrived in India after 25 March 1971 were aliens, and the illegality of their presence was to be confirmed by the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act (IMDT) Act’ (p. 96). Roy takes a close look at the protest movement in Assam against the Bangladeshi migrants and sees how the case of exception created for Assam ‘reaffirmed Assamese difference and cohabitation with Indian citizenship, the exception in procedures of identification, as manifest in the IMDT Act, marked a contradiction in this cohabitation, since the Central Government retained the power to determine illegality on its own terms’ (p. 106). She looks at the way the various regimes responded to the IMDT Act before it was scrapped by Supreme Court as unconstitutional and also points out that ‘the court described migration not only as “illegal” entry into foreign territory, but as an act of aggression’ (p. 97).</p>
<p>She examines in detail the case of Chakma refugees in Arunachal Pradesh who had approached the Supreme Court for citizenship following the amendment. She takes up two famous landmark cases of claiming citizenship rights: National Human Rights Commission versus State of Arunachal Pradesh and Another (AIR 1996, SC 1234), where they appealed to register citizens under 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act; and State of Arunachal Pradesh versus Khudiram Chakma (AIR 1994, SCI 1461), where the Chakma families claimed citizenship on the basis of Section 6 A, which applied solely to the state of Assam. What is significant to note here, as Roy points out, are ‘…the competing claims to protection by the Chakmas and the Arunachalis generated distinct idioms of citizenship’ (p. 132). The two competing claims: one of assertion of legal citizenship (in the case of chakmas) which would erase their ‘differentiated citizenship’ status as well as constantly being in the ‘liminal state’ of ‘no-where people’ vis-à-vis the claim of Arunachalis to retain ‘differentiated citizenship’ for the Chakmas shows the way in which the constitutional provisions were being interpreted to delimit the rights of the ‘migrant’ as ‘illegal’.</p>

<title>De-territoriality and Beyond</title>
<p>In the third chapter Roy discusses in detail that though ‘the return of the citizen’ in discourses influenced by globalization work argue for trans-national citizenship and multi-cultural citizenship, in reality, ‘the global trend … to inclusive and border-free citizenship are accompanied by closures’ (p. 136). She draws on the recent amendments of the Citizenship Act—the Citizenship (Amendment) Acts of 2003 and 2005—which introduced the category of the Overseas Indian Citizenship. What is interesting to note is that the Act in its definition of Indian origin continues to retain the clauses that were applicable post-partition: ‘excision of those who had become Pakistani citizens (and later Bangladeshis)’ (p. 143).</p>
<p>In other words, the legal-political practices of citizenship to address the ‘crisis’ in citizenship shows the way in which the state continues to de-limit the movement of individuals, while also defining citizens vis-à-vis the migrant thereby producing differential experiences of citizenship. This book very skilfully captures the contradiction inherent in the practices of citizenship through legal constitutional measures and shows that the making and unmaking of a citizen can run parallel to each other.</p>
