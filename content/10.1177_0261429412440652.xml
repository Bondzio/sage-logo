<abstract>
<p>The focus of the article is the validation of an instrument to assess gifted students’ affect after mathematical problem solving tasks. Participants were 225 students identified by their district as gifted in grades four to six. The Chamberlin Affective Instrument for Mathematical Problem Solving was used to assess feelings, emotions, and dispositions after students solved model-eliciting activities in groups of three. Through the use of principal component analysis, it was determined that three factors should be retained. The instrument holds promise because it may be used to assess affect, which has implications for identification and curricular adjustments to optimize affect.</p>

<p>Several impetuses exist for developing instruments to assess psychological constructs. Some researchers develop such instruments to come to a greater understanding of a construct and others develop such instruments with commercial and entrepreneurial objectives in mind. Perhaps the most compelling reason, and the particular reason for this instrument, is to help teachers adequately serve gifted students. In this case, the needs of students of promise may best be served through accurate data on affect in mathematics. An additional reason for this instrument is to enable (gifted) educators the opportunity to maximize learning through positively impacting student affect in mathematical problem solving.</p>

<title>Conception of affect in mathematics education</title>
<p>No single concept of affect seems to exist in mathematics education, gifted education, or in the general field of educational psychology. As a result, myriad conceptions of affect exist. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429412440652">Hart and Walker (1993</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429412440652">Hoffman (1986</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429412440652">McLeod and Adams (1989</xref>) have referred to affect in mathematics using words such as motivation, dispositions, emotions, beliefs, and attitudes. These words appear to be common overtones in the general educational psychology literature as well. Not surprisingly, other theorists have referred to it in other manners, but most definitions contain some variation of the aforementioned terms. It is therefore imperative that one conception be adopted as the framework for what constitutes affect. A commonly accepted conception of affect, and the one adopted for this research, is one provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440652">Anderson and Bourke (2000</xref>). In their conception, they refer to affect as being comprised of eight sub-components. These sub-components are anxiety, aspiration, attitude, interest, locus of control, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261429412440652">
<title>History of affect</title>
<p>For approximately a century, educators have suggested that cognition is not merely one’s ability to think (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429412440652">Binet and Simon, 1916</xref>). They have stated that effective cognition partially comprises feelings, emotions, and dispositions. In 1916, Binet and Simon referred to the construct of affect as non-intellectual factors and they cited the ability to assess affect in school learning as of paramount importance. In fact, they stated that non-intellectual characteristics were of equal importance to intellectual characteristics. Binet and Simon further claimed that the development of non-intellectual characteristics was a prerequisite to the development of intellectual characteristics. In short, they suggested that without the optimization of affect, learning conditions may be compromised or altogether absent.</p>
<p>Several decades later, non-intellectual characteristics came to be known as non-cognitive characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429412440652">Chamberlin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429412440652">Messick, 1979</xref>). Non-cognitive characteristics gained the attention of social psychologist researchers near the beginning of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429412440652">Thompson, 1992</xref>) and they have held a place of prominence since that time. The main reason for the interest in affect was due to the emphasis on behaviorism. At the time, behaviorists, logically and correctly so, felt that individuals’ emotions, dispositions, and feelings may impact behavior. As behavior is closely tied to thought process, it was natural for these psychologists to desire additional information about what is today called affect.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge facing researchers at the time, and undoubtedly the biggest problem facing researchers today, is the notion of quantifying a psychological construct. In essence researchers are faced with the question, “How do we measure something that does not readily lend itself to being measured?” In mathematics, mass, height, and force are quite easy to quantify because agreed-upon metrics exist, but what about psychological constructs such as interest, attitude, and value? How are these quantified?</p>
<p>As a result of the difficulty in measuring psychological constructs as well as the constraints of elementary statistical procedures in the early 1920s to 1950s, the field of psychology had a rather long hiatus in between the time psychologists called for instruments to assess affect and the time that they actually created them. As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429412440652">Binet and Simon (1916</xref>) iterated the significance of non-intellectual characteristics, as did many of their disciples, but it was not until nearly 55 years later that a reputable instrument was created. In 1970, the National Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Abilities (NLSMA) released results from a study they had conducted on a curriculum developed by the School Mathematics Study Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429412440652">Higgins, 1970</xref>). When using their instrument, psychologists could assess student attitude with the use of 18 scales. The instrument had strong reliability coefficients (0.59 to 0.85), but validity was not reported in the study. Shortly thereafter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429412440652">Richardson and Suinn (1972</xref>) created an oft-used instrument called the Math Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS), which was designed to assess student anxiety, and it was regarded as a pivotal instrument in the field of assessment of affect. Reliability coefficients were high for this instrument (0.85 to 0.97) and the instrument’s validity was normed relative to the Differential Aptitude Test, but unfortunately it was validated on college-age (tertiary) students and may have had little value in assessing younger (elementary) students.</p>
<p>Initial affective instruments had been created to assess only one component of affect (e.g. attitude or anxiety). Hence, it came as quite a welcome addition to the field of psychology when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429412440652">Aiken (1974</xref>) not only promoted the idea that attitude may comprise enjoyment and value, but he actually followed up his theory with an instrument to assess each component. Similar to the NLSMA, the instrument may not have had a significant impact per se. The true impact came with the idea of the study, i.e. that affect is multifaceted, in that Aiken had promoted a new theory worthy of investigation. Like the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429412440652">Richardson and Suinn (1972</xref>) instrument, the reliability was strong (0.6 to 0.85), but the validity of the instrument was highly questioned (0.10 to 0.40).</p>
<p>The instrument with perhaps the biggest impact on affect assessment is the Fennema–Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429412440652">Fennema and Sherman, 1976</xref>). It was composed of nine scales that are ostensibly separate, but in reality are closely connected to one another. Four scales appear to help researchers investigate student affect and five additional scales provide data on teacher and parent affect as well as the gender of the participant and the usefulness of mathematics as a domain. Two contributions arose from the development of this instrument. The first was that gender issues were brought to the fore of mathematics education and the second was that four components of affect were assessed at one time. A cursory accomplishment was that the Fennema–Sherman attitude instrument was truly the first one to be widely used by researchers. Seemingly, endless master’s and doctoral candidates have used this instrument to investigate various issues related to mathematics. The instrument was validated in 1976, but the validity coefficients were called into question some time later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261429412440652">Suinn and Edwards, 1982</xref>) because they were difficult to ascertain. The scale was revised and revalidated in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429412440652">Forgasz et al., 1999</xref>). To this day it is considered a seminal instrument in the assessment of affect.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429412440652">Tapia and Marsh (2004</xref>) subsequently created an instrument referred to as the Attitude towards Mathematics Inventory (ATMI). Not nearly as well known as the Fennema–Sherman scale, this instrument enables researchers to investigate self-efficacy, anxiety, value, enjoyment, motivation, and parent and teacher expectations. The statistical coefficients for this instrument are extremely high with reliability estimates at 0.97.</p>
<p>Only one study can be found that pertains to assessing gifted students’ affect in mathematics. In 1996 Pajares conducted a study, though it did not actually result in an instrument to assess affect with gifted students. This is because when he completed the study on mathematical problem solving of gifted students, he used his self-efficacy instrument that had never been validated with gifted students so the results may be suspect. The reason that the results may be suspect is because he validated the instrument with one sample (general population students) and used it to assess another sample (gifted students). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440652">Huck (2007</xref>) states, estimates are simply estimates when validating an instrument with one sample and using it with an altogether different sample. Ironically, in an earlier publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429412440652">Pajares and Miller (1995</xref>) strongly urged researchers to use instruments that match closely with their target sample. Despite all of this work, quite literally, no instruments have been created or validated for use with gifted students in mathematics. More specifically, no instruments have been created to assess affect during or after the process of mathematical problem solving with gifted students as most have been created generically to assess affect in mathematics. Consequently, the need for an instrument that has been designed for use with gifted students that focuses on affect and mathematical problem solving is imperative for the field of mathematics and gifted education.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The discipline context for validating this instrument is mathematics and the task is mathematical problem solving. The rationale for using mathematical problem solving is that it is the focus of doing mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429412440652">National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429412440652">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429412440652">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440652">2000</xref>). Given the high priority of mathematical problem solving, it was determined that an instrument was necessary to monitor student affect after the process.</p>
<sec id="section5-0261429412440652">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the study came from grades four to six throughout the inter-mountain region in the United States. There were 225 participants from a potential sample of 250 for a 90% response rate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261429412440652">Table 1</xref> provides demographic information of students in the target sample as well as the name of the mathematical activity used. The respective number of boys and girls in the actual sample is not known because all data were collected anonymously and gender was not recorded as per the schools’ requests. However, there is no indication that a gender bias existed among non-participants, indicating that the actual sample was similar to the target sample, which contained 51% girls and 49% boys.</p>

<title>Identification procedures</title>
<p>Prior to soliciting participation by schools, the first author carefully investigated the identification procedures to see that similarity existed from district to district. Each school had highly similar identification procedures that were predicated on multi-modal procedures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429412440652">
<title>Implementation of problems</title>
<p>All of the problems administered had more than one solution (process) and more than one product as potential responses. Moreover, students were given no direction regarding what mathematical procedure should be employed to solve the problem. To that end, all implemented tasks were considered highly open ended. For each task, students were asked to read the newspaper article that accompanied the handout at home the night before the task was implemented and to complete a series of questions designed to create conversation about the topic. On the day of the activity, students met as an entire class, discussed responses to the comprehension questions with the facilitator (i.e. the first author), and read the problem statement. Once the first author was assured that all students understood what was asked in the problem statement, students worked with peers in groups of three to solve the problem. Solving the problems and writing up the solutions typically required 50–70 minutes so some class periods were extended to accommodate the research protocol. When students completed the problem-solving task, they were asked to complete the instrument designed to assess affect. All instrument data were collected immediately following completion of the task. This was done in an attempt to garner accurate data regarding student affect after the mathematical problem-solving process. Following data collection, solutions that students created were discussed as a whole class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429412440652">
<title>Tasks used</title>
<p>The tasks used were a special type of mathematical problem-solving activity called model-eliciting activities (MEAs). To date, the most comprehensive review of MEAs (i.e. their purpose and general characteristics, who created them, how they were created, some examples, characteristics of student interpretations, four disclaimers, the six principles for design, common misconceptions, and questions about them) is detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440652">Lesh et al. (2000</xref>). The design principles, explicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429412440652">Chamberlin and Moon (2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440652">Lesh et al. (2000</xref>), provide a basis for understanding what comprises all MEAs. The six principles used to design MEAs are the Model-construction principle, the Reality principle, the Self-assessment principle, the Construct Documentation principle, the Construct Shareability and Re-usability principle, and the Effective Prototype principle.</p>
<p>Examples of MEAs may be found online at: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Research/SGMM/CASESTUDIESKIDSWEB/casestudies/phone/CASESTUDIESKIDSWEB/case_studies_table.htm as well as at http://crlt.indiana.edu/research/csk.html. The activities used for this research were ones that have traditionally been perceived by teachers and researchers as free of or with significantly reduced gender bias. This was done in an attempt to increase the likelihood that affective ratings may be similar for boys and girls. The names and focus of the activities are:</p>
<sec id="section9-0261429412440652">
<title>On-time arrival</title>
<p>This is an activity that focuses on students identifying airline companies’ punctuality in landing. The premise behind this task is to have students use measures of central tendency, including range, to identify the most <italic>on-time</italic> airline. In the end, the mathematical activity provides an opportunity for teachers to discuss standard deviation with students. This activity was used with all classes from East Side and some classes from South Side (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261429412440652">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429412440652">
<title>Track programs for sale</title>
<p>This is an activity that focuses on students creating a system to accurately count attendees at a world-class grand prix track event. The mathematical task involves looking at a small section of data, represented by several thousand attendees in a stadium, creating a grid system, and scaling up the data to fit a stadium with 80,000 seats. In the end, students are expected to provide a recommendation to event organizers regarding how many programs should be printed in English, French, Italian, and German. This activity was used with all classes from West Side.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429412440652">
<title>Summer reading</title>
<p>This is an activity that focuses on students designing a rating system that is equitable for all students in a summer reading program. Factors that are instrumental in designing the point system are length of book(s), number of books, variety or genre of books, reading level of books, and book report grades. In the end, the mathematical concept is weighing variables in a fair manner so that students in all grades have an equitable opportunity to compete with students in higher or lower grades. This activity was used with some classes from North Side.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261429412440652">
<title>Amusement park</title>
<p>This is an activity that focuses on students designing a scheduling system so that all students from one school on an amusement park field trip have an opportunity to ride all the rides that they want to ride. Individuals doing the problem need to group the students according to their ride preferences and make sure that everyone gets to ride at least their top five rides. Students doing the problem need to pay attention to the scale of the amusement park to make sure that all students can transfer from ride to ride in a timely manner and attend the aforementioned concert. The mathematical concept is scheduling. This activity was used with some classes from North Side.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0261429412440652">
<title>Track and field teams</title>
<p>This is an activity that focuses on students creating equitable teams for a track and field competition. In the problem, students at a summer camp need to find an equitable manner in which to divide teams so that the competition will be a close competition. The impetus for the problem stems from past competitions that have not been close competitions once the points are tallied. Students doing the problem are provided quantitative data (e.g. how high individuals can jump, how far they can throw a shot-put, how fast they can sprint and run middle-distance events) as well as qualitative data in the form of comments from various schools’ physical education teachers. The mathematical concept in this problem is designing an equitable rating system and weighing performances based on the scoring system provided in the problem. This activity was used with one class from South Side.</p>

<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The Chamberlin Affective Instrument for Mathematical Problem Solving (CAIMPS) was designed for mathematics students in grades four to six who are identified as gifted. It is important to note that students in the convenience sample were not all identified as gifted in mathematics pending their school’s identification procedures. The 40-item instrument was initially designed to assess eight factors of affect with five items in each scale. The eight factors that comprise affect are anxiety, aspiration, attitude, interest, locus of control, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440652">Anderson and Bourke, 2000</xref>). For a description of each factor, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0261429412440652">Appendix C</xref>. Respondents were provided with five Likert scale options regarding how they would respond to each item: strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, and strongly disagree.</p>

PCA is a “variable reduction technique used when variables are highly correlated and it reduces the number of observed variables to a smaller number of principal components which account for most of the variance of the observed variables” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429412440652">Suhr, 2005</xref>: 1). The number of factors retained was determined by the Cattell Scree-plot Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429412440652">Cattell, 1966</xref>). Based on the component factors of the scree (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261429412440652">Figure 1</xref>), the analysis proceeded to extract three principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429412440652">Stellefson and Hanik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429412440652">Tanguma, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>As a reminder, the initial hypothesized constructs were anxiety, aspiration, attitude, interest, locus of control, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and value. It is important to note that experts agree that these factors are very closely intertwined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440652">Anderson and Bourke, 2000</xref>). For that reason, it is highly unlikely that any instrument designed to assess all eight factors is likely to come up perfectly with eight factors following PCA. This is the case because the items from one component of affect, e.g. self-efficacy, are inclined to correlate strongly and positively with items from another component of affect in mathematics, e.g. self-esteem, and therefore they cannot be pulled apart from one another. Given the methods used in PCA, strong positive correlations mean factors will load strongly together and perhaps collapse to form a new factor.</p>
<p>A varimax roation was utilized to extract the three principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429412440652">Bauer et al., 2006</xref>). The Keiser–Meyer–Olkin test determined acceptable sampling adequacy (0.916), indicating that few common factors were shared in the three factors. Bartlett’s test of sphericity confirmed that the data were non-collinear. Based on the items that loaded onto each factor, the researchers identified the three factors as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>attitude/value/interest (AVI);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>self-esteem/self-efficacy (SELF); and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>aspiration (ASP).</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Additionally, three items did not load onto these factors. Although each item was intended originally to investigate anxiety, their internal reliability of 0.519 was not satisfactory to identify them as a stand-alone constructs and the items were consequently discarded from the analysis. Each factor is described below.</p>
<sec id="section17-0261429412440652">
<title>Factor 1: AVI</title>
<p>The first factor is composed of the items associated with attitude, value, and interest. The construct comprises 14 items: 1, 2, 6, 9, 13, 20, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, and 37 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261429412440652">Appendix A</xref>). The measure of internal reliability, alpha coefficient, was very high (α = 0.918).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261429412440652">
<title>Factor 2: SELF</title>
<p>The second factor is composed of the items associated with self-esteem and self-efficacy. The construct comprises 14 items: 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19, 26, 29, 33, 36, 39, and 40 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261429412440652">Appendix A</xref>). The measure of internal reliability was also high (α = 0.908).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0261429412440652">
<title>Factor 3: ASP</title>
<p>The third factor is composed of the items associated with aspiration. The construct comprises eight items: 8, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, 35, and 38 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261429412440652">Appendix A</xref>). The alpha coefficient was moderate (α = 0.805), but certainly within acceptable levels.</p>

<title>Implications for instruction</title>
<p>Some suggest that the best research impacts practice. This research has implications for gifted teaching and general classroom teachers in mathematics.</p>
<sec id="section21-0261429412440652">
<title>Implication 1: Use of instrument</title>
<p>This instrument was designed for use with gifted students in grades four to six at the immediate conclusion of an open-ended mathematical problem-solving task. Despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440652">Huck’s (2007)</xref> admonition that instruments normed with one group should be used with a very similar group, it may be safe to assume that this instrument may have some applications to general population students in mathematics because it was normed with students generally identified as gifted (not students gifted in mathematics per se). As such, providing accurate and reliable data on student affect in mathematics after problem-solving activities could have great implications for helping teachers and parents improve student affect. In turn, increasingly positive attitude, interest, self-efficacy, and so on, would likely prove fruitful and could greatly impact students’ perception of mathematics by maximizing their potential in learning situations. To support this claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429412440652">Chamberlin’s (2002</xref>) research is offered in which he found that model-eliciting activities have similar reports of interest to general population and gifted students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0261429412440652">
<title>Implication 2: Use of instrument for identification procedures</title>
<p>In recent years, gifted coordinators and administrators have begun to consider affect as an important characteristic in identifying students of advanced capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429412440652">Chamberlin, 2006</xref>). This instrument may have particularly strong implications for identifying advanced mathematicians and it may point to prospective success in mathematics by identifying a wider range of candidates (e.g. creatively gifted students) though that claim cannot be verified with this data set. If students possess substantive aptitude in mathematics in addition to positive affect, e.g. feelings, emotions, and dispositions, the likelihood for success in a gifted teaching program is likely increased over what it currently is, with affect being largely neglected. Identification of students who have the greatest likelihood of success in a program is a necessary and perhaps the ultimate objective in strong identification procedures. If seeking very high intellect were the only emphasis in gifted teaching programs, then the intelligence (test) quotient alone would suffice.</p>
<p>Hence, using the instrument described in this study may have applications to a host of areas in mathematics education and gifted education, not least of which is identification. In addition, the use of such an instrument may help enhance identification procedures by making them multi-modal. Similar to implication number one, identifying a wider range of students of promise in mathematics may enable gifted educators the opportunity to decrease prejudice and to maximize the potential of underserved students. Though this instrument was not designed specifically to identify underserved and/or culturally diverse students, as an additional tool used in the identification process, it will assist in making the identification process multi-modal. Theoretically, the use of multi-modal approaches in identifying gifted students increases the likelihood of gaining a wider variety of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429412440652">Lidz and Macrine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429412440652">Romey, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0261429412440652">
<title>Implication 3: Ease of use</title>
<p>A positive attribute of this instrument is that it is readily accessible and the results are easy to interpret. The only thing one needs to do after the implementation of the instrument is to interpret the data using <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0261429412440652">Appendix B</xref>. Given the relative ease with which this instrument may be implemented, it is noted that teachers of the gifted can have the ability to make immediate changes in an effort to maximize learning. Moreover, this investigation of affect, through the use of an empirically proven instrument, may be used with certainty given the quality of the data attained. The caveat is that using this or any affective instrument only one time may prove problematic. Results attained over a sustained period of time would likely be more stable than those attained with a one-time administration. Unlike constructs such as intelligence, which is believed to be somewhat stable, affect can vary from situation to situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440652">Anderson and Bourke, 2000</xref>). Once ratings reach a consistent point (i.e., ratings from repeated implementation of the instrument), they are said to be stable. In other words, some students will report mixed affect pending a number of factors. However, once similar results are attained, it is believed that affect will be stable and not subject to change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0261429412440652">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with all studies, limitations exist. The means by which to rectify these shortcomings is addressed in the areas for future research. The first limitation is that the sample that completed the problem-solving activities and the instrument were students identified as gifted in general (not gifted specifically in mathematics). As a result, some students were truly advanced in mathematics and some were simply average-ability students in mathematics. A redeeming quality about this population, however, is that the instrument may have applications to general population students. Second, the method for analyzing data was principal component analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis is often regarded as a more powerful approach to solidifying results and would therefore be the more preferential of the two approaches. An additional shortcoming of the instrument is that it may theoretically be used with underserved students in an attempt to increase identification of such students. However, the instrument can only purport to have theoretical value in this respect as it was not field tested with said individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0261429412440652">
<title>Areas for future research</title>
<p>Given the instrument creation, data collection, and data analysis, two aforementioned limitations existed. First, data were collected with students identified as gifted in general; not students gifted exclusively in mathematics. For subsequent data collection procedures, the more specific population of individuals gifted only or at least in mathematics should be explored, although this potentially nebulous construct may prove problematic in assessing students. In short, what one may consider gifted in mathematics may not be what another considers gifted in mathematics. Second, some limitations are evident with PCA. Chief among the concerns is that the process of PCA is quite similar to exploratory factor analysis, which is just as the name implies—exploratory. Consequently, the revised instrument must be used with a new sample of students with the intent of using confirmatory factor analysis to investigate the statistical strength of the instrument.</p>

<italic>Interest</italic>, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429412440652">Getzels (1966</xref>), is “a disposition organized through experience which impels an individual to seek out particular objects, activities, understandings, skills, or goals for attention or acquisition” (p. 98).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Locus of control</italic> is known as “the extent to which individuals tend to accept responsibility for their own behavior, the results of their behavior, or both” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429412440652">Messick, 1979</xref>: 285).</p>

<italic>Self-efficacy</italic> is known as “A person’s belief in his or her capability of performing a behavior required to reach a goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440652">Weiner, 1992</xref>: 861). A synonym often used for self-efficacy is confidence.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Self-esteem</italic> is known as “the affective component of self-concept.
