<abstract>
<p>This study explored cognitive elaboration as a moderator of the impact of injunctive and descriptive normative messages on behavioral intentions. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 246) received a message advocating a student health program that stressed either descriptive norms or injunctive norms under conditions of low elaboration or high elaboration and then responded to a series of behavioral intention questions. To determine whether the effects of type of normative message and elaboration varied across personality traits, participants’ level of self-monitoring and extraversion were measured 1–6 months prior to the experimental session. Analyses revealed a 2-way interaction between message type and elaboration, suggesting that descriptive messages were more successful under low-elaboration conditions, whereas injunctive messages were more successful under high-elaboration conditions. This 2-way interaction was not qualified by a 3-way interaction among extraversion, message type, and elaboration or a 3-way interaction among self-monitoring, message type, and elaboration.</p>

<body>
<p>Compliance (i.e., acquiescence to a request from another person) has long been a topic of interest to social psychologists, consumer researchers, health psychologists, and social scientists in a host of other disciplines. Research has indicated that one of the ways in which attempts at compliance are often effective is via some form of social validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611420481">Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611420481">Cialdini, 2009</xref>). That is, people look to similar others to guide their own behavior in various situations. One of the central ways appropriate behavior is understood is through assessment of social norms, because this is an efficient and simple way to choose one’s own actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611420481">Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611420481">
<title>Distinguishing Between Descriptive and Injunctive Norms</title>
<p>When using normative explanations for behavior, theorists have often distinguished between at least two general categories of norms that serve as useful guidelines. Injunctive norms reflect behavior that most people perceive to be correct, whereas descriptive norms reflect behavior in which most people engage in a situation, regardless of the injunctive norms. Essentially, injunctive norms are what one “ought” to do, while descriptive norms are based on what others are actually doing at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611420481">Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998</xref>). An example of these different norms in action would be the issue of littering; most people believe that we should not litter, that it is bad for the environment, and that it is socially reprehensible. This is the injunctive norm at work. However, a look at any park or public space in a large city would tell us that littering is often a problem. Because we see others littering, and litter is already present in public spaces, in many contexts littering behavior seems normative at the descriptive level.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of empirical evidence has accumulated, indicating that both of these types of norms can have a substantial impact on behavior, sometimes in divergent and surprising ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611420481">Cialdini et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611420481">Goldstein, Cialdini, &amp; Griskevicius, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611420481">Jacobson, Mortensen, &amp; Cialdini, 2011</xref>). Thus, there is clear evidence that is meaningful to distinguish between descriptive and injunctive norms and that both can influence behaviors and intentions. However, one issue that has received comparatively little attention in this literature is the conditions under which one of these types of norms might be expected to exert more influence than the other. Such a question is obviously of theoretical interest, in that understanding the moderators of the impact of different types of norms can provide greater insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible for their effects. Moreover, such a question also has applied relevance, given that in some behavioral contexts these norms might be in conflict and thus it could be difficult to construct messages that effectively use both norms.</p>

<title>Elaboration as a Moderator of the Impact of Norms</title>
<p>When considering potential moderators of the influence of descriptive and injunctive norms in compliance to persuasive messages, one candidate suggested by past theorizing is the extent to which people have to carefully think about (i.e., cognitively elaborate) the message conveying the norms. Theories such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model ([ELM] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611420481">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611420481">1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611420481">Petty &amp; Wegener, 1999</xref>) and the Heuristic-Systematic Model ([HSM] see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611420481">Chaiken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611420481">Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611420481">Chen &amp; Chaiken, 1999</xref>) have demonstrated that variables affecting persuasion and social judgments can have different effects when information is extensively elaborated versus processed only superficially.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini (2003)</xref> has speculated that descriptive norms may require less effortful cognitive processing than injunctive norms. In the case of descriptive norms, one simply has to look to those around one’s self to judge appropriate behavior, whereas injunctive norms might require some understanding of the morals of a group in order to act upon injunctive norms, and this would require more cognitive elaboration. If these speculations are correct, one would predict that in nonthoughtful conditions descriptive messages should be more effective than injunctive messages. Conversely, when people engage in extensive consideration of a message, the advantage of descriptive norms over injunctive norms might be expected to decrease and perhaps the relative efficacy of these messages might reverse.</p>
<p>To date, these predictions have never been directly tested. Moreover, such a set of predictions might be too simple in that it is possible that the effects of these two types of messages, as well as their efficacy under different levels of elaboration, may be conditional on characteristics of the message recipient. That is, perhaps the content of descriptive messages could coordinate well with certain personal tendencies, whereas injunctive messages could coordinate well with others. For example, the personality literature has identified several traits that reflect in various ways the extent to which people look to their social environment for guides to their behaviors or rely on internal cues such as values and attitudes.</p>
<p>Two of the most widely studied of these types of traits are extraversion and self-monitoring. Individuals who score high on the trait of extraversion tend to be characterized by concern with, and attention to, things outside the self; with good social skills and numerous friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611420481">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1999</xref>). Conversely, those scoring low on the extraversion scale tend to direct their attention inward and are more focused on their own thoughts and feelings rather than outward experiences. Likewise, self-monitoring is a personality trait that relates to self-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611420481">Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 1986</xref>). Individuals who are high self-monitors tend to adapt their responses to social cues readily and are highly keen to cues of others and the situation. In contrast, low self-monitors are more likely to express themselves based on their inner attitudes, thoughts, and feelings and are less influenced by external cues and the desire to be viewed in a certain way.</p>
<p>It is plausible that the effects of descriptive norm and injunctive norm messages might vary across these personality traits. For instance, one might expect descriptive messages to be especially effective for people who are dispositionally inclined to look to other people as a guide to their actions (e.g., extraverts and high self-monitors), whereas people who do not naturally look to others as a guide to their actions (e.g., introverts and low self-monitors) might not be particularly influenced by such messages. Likewise, injunctive messages, with their focus on values, might be especially compelling for people who rely on internal cues such as values, but less effective for people who are externally focused.</p>
<p>At a more complex level, these traits might also interact with level of elaboration to moderate the impact of descriptive and injunctive messages. For example, it could be that descriptive norms are, as speculated, especially effective under low elaboration because they provide an easy cue for how to act. However, the heuristic that others’ behaviors are a valid guide to action might be much more strongly held by extraverts and/or high self-monitors than introverts and/or low self-monitors. Thus, the advantage of descriptive messages over injunctive messages under low elaboration might be expected to be particularly pronounced for extraverts and/or high self-monitors. Conversely, perhaps injunctive norms are more successful than descriptive norms under high elaboration, but it may be that this advantage is most evident for people who are likely to see value-based appeals as central and compelling argument for action. Thus, the greater efficacy of injunctive messages over descriptive messages in high-elaboration conditions might emerge most strongly for introverts and/or low self-monitors. The objective of the present research was to explore the impact of descriptive and injunctive messages on behavioral intentions under high and low elaboration as well as to examine whether these effects differ as a function of the personality traits of extraversion and self-monitoring.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1948550611420481">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were undergraduate psychology students (<italic>N</italic>
<italic>=</italic> 246, 74% female) who completed measures of extraversion and self-monitoring in a separate pre-screening session at the start of the academic year. The mean age of participants was 18.51 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.78) and the majority of participants were Caucasian (74.4%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550611420481">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was a 2 (Elaboration: High/Low) × 2 (Message Type: Descriptive/Injunctive) between-participant design. Assignment to elaboration and message conditions was random. Participants were told that they were participating in a university survey designed to gather information on students’ attitudes toward various university programs being considered for implementation. All participants were presented with written descriptions of two different fictitious programs being offered. The “Diversity in University” program was given first as a filler task to make the cover story believable. Responses to questions regarding this program were not used in any analysis but were simply included to maintain the cover story and make the filler task appear similar to the target task, the “Healthy You” message.</p>
<p>The second program described was the “Healthy You” program. For both the injunctive and descriptive “Healthy You” message, the program was described as being a large and rather unpleasant commitment for the typical undergraduate student (early morning weekday and Saturday classes). This was done to avoid ceiling effects on behavioral intentions. Both the descriptive and injunctive message were nearly identical in terms of content and length, however the normative aspect of the final appeal to participate was altered. The descriptive version of the message featured information ostensibly from surveys indicating that large percentages of students planned to register for the program and testimonials ostensibly from various university students citing their intent to sign up and that they had heard many other people were also going to be participating in the program. The message ended with an appeal to “follow the lead of their peers” and join the program. The injunctive message focused on information ostensibly drawn from surveys regarding the fact that people see a healthy lifestyle as reflecting important values and the decision to adopt such a lifestyle reflects important personal qualities such as self-discipline, self-respect, and responsibility to society. The message ended with an appeal to “do the right thing” and join the program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1948550611420481">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because both ability and motivation are necessary for extensive elaboration to occur, we combined manipulations of both of these determinants of elaboration to maximize differences in our high and low-elaboration conditions. Participants in the high-elaboration condition read about both programs and completed all of the measures without any deliberate limits placed on their cognitive abilities. They were also highly motivated to process the message because personal relevance was manipulated to be high in this condition by telling participants that the programs were going to be available at their own university in the upcoming year. Conversely, in the low-elaboration condition participants were presented with an eight-digit number to remember immediately after having read the general description of each program in the filler and target tasks, under the auspices that we were pairing the study with a study on memory. Participants were told that they would need to recall this number at a later time, which required them to hold the number in mind as they were viewing the normative message (in the case of the target task) and responding to the measures. Further, participants were told that the program in question would be offered at another university, thus reducing personal involvement. After reading the target message, all participants completed a set of behavioral intention measures and then a cognitive response task in which they reported the thoughts they had as they were reading the normative message. They then rated these thoughts as positive, negative, or neutral with respect to the program.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1948550611420481">
<title>Extraversion</title>
<p>Participants completed the 12-item extraversion subscale of NEO Five-Factor Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611420481">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2004</xref>). Each item used a 5-point strong <italic>disagree/strongly agree</italic> response scale (with responses coded 1–5). Responses to items were summed to arrive at a final score (<italic>M</italic> = 40.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.77, skewness = −.13, kurtosis = −.04, α = .80).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611420481">
<title>Self-Monitoring</title>
<p>Participants completed the 18-item Self-Monitoring scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611420481">Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 1986</xref>). Participants received a point for every statement that would endorse high self-monitoring (<italic>M</italic> = 10.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.37, skewness = −.14, kurtosis = −.56, α = .68).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550611420481">
<title>Intentions to participate</title>
<p>Participants rated on a 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very</italic>) scale how interested they would be in joining the “Healthy You” program, how committed they would be to the program if they joined, and how likely they would be to participate in the program if it were to be offered the following year. These items were averaged to form a single postmessage intention index (<italic>M</italic> = 3.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03, skewness = −.49, kurtosis = −.49, α = .90.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550611420481">
<title>Cognitive response</title>
<p>Upon completion of the intention measures, participants completed the thought-listing task ([TLT] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611420481">Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1981</xref>), where they were provided with up to 10 boxes to record any thoughts that came to mind while they were reading the message, placing 1 thought per box. They were then asked to rate the thought as favorable, unfavorable, or neutral in regard to the target program. These thoughts were later coded by an independent judge as relevant or irrelevant to the message topic.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section12-1948550611420481">
<title>Elaboration Manipulation</title>
<p>Before undertaking the primary analyses, it was important to ascertain whether the elaboration manipulation was successful. The success of this manipulation was assessed in two ways commonly used to evaluate level of elaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611420481">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986a</xref>). First, the total number of relevant thoughts for each participant was examined across elaboration conditions. Consistent with expectations, participants in the high-elaboration condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.75) had significantly more relevant thoughts than participants in the low-elaboration condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.15), <italic>t</italic>(243) = 2.21, <italic>p</italic> = .03. Second, an analysis of the proportion of relevant thoughts also supported the success of the manipulation; those in the high-elaboration condition (<italic>M</italic> = .96, <italic>SD</italic> = .14) had a higher proportion of relevant thoughts compared to participants in the low-elaboration condition (<italic>M</italic> = .87, <italic>SD</italic> = .25), <italic>t</italic>(235) = 3.31, <italic>p</italic> = .001.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1948550611420481">
<title>Behavioral Intentions</title>
<p>To test our key hypotheses regarding the impact of type of message, elaboration, extraversion, and self-monitoring, a 2 (Elaboration: High vs. Low) × 2 (Message Type: Descriptive vs. Injunctive) General Linear Model with mean-centered extraversion and self-monitoring included as continuous predictor variables and intentions as the dependent variable was specified. The model also included all possible interactions among the two manipulated variables and the two personality trait variables as predictors in the model.</p>
<p>None of our speculations explicitly suggested the emergence of any main effects. This expectation was largely supported, as three of the possible main effects failed to reach significance. However, there was a significant main effect of extraversion on intent to join the program, <italic>F</italic>(1, 230) = 7.81, <italic>p</italic> = .01. An examination of the correlation between extraversion and intentions revealed that increased extraversion was associated with higher intentions to participate in the program (<italic>r</italic> = .11).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini’s (2003)</xref> speculations imply that a 2-way interaction between Message Type and Elaboration should occur, such that descriptive messages should be more persuasive than injunctive messages under conditions of low elaboration because they require less cognitive processing. What is less clear from this view is how descriptive and injunctive messages should perform relative to one another under high elaboration. There are two plausible patterns either of which would be consistent with this perspective. First, it is possible that descriptive and injunctive messages could be equally persuasive under conditions of high elaboration. Alternatively, a reversal could occur such that in conditions of high elaboration, the injunctive message is actually more persuasive than the descriptive message. Interestingly, consistent with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini (2003)</xref> perspective, a significant 2-way interaction did emerge, <italic>F</italic>(1, 230) = 6.53, <italic>p =</italic> .01. The means associated with this interaction are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611420481">Figure 1</xref>
. As can be seen on the left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611420481">Figure 1</xref>, as predicted, the descriptive message led to greater intentions to join (<italic>M</italic> = 3.86, CI<sub>.95</sub> = [3.61, 4.12]) than the injunctive message (<italic>M</italic> =3.48, CI<sub>.95</sub> = [3.20, 3.76]) when elaboration was low. Interestingly, under high elaboration, the injunctive message (<italic>M</italic> = 3.67, CI<sub>.95</sub> = [3.41, 3.94]) was significantly more effective than the descriptive message (<italic>M</italic> = 3.36, CI<sub>.95</sub> = [3.09, 3.63]).</p>

</fig>
<p>Also of interest was a significant 2-way interaction between message type and self-monitoring <italic>F</italic>(1, 230) = 5.04, <italic>p</italic> = .03. To further clarify this interaction, we computed the simple slopes reflecting the association between self-monitoring and intentions under the two message conditions. These analyses indicated that for injunctive messages, increases in self-monitoring were associated with lower intentions to participate in the program (<italic>b</italic> = −.06, <italic>p</italic> = .03). Conversely, for the descriptive message, there was a nonsignificant positive association between self-monitoring and intentions (<italic>b</italic> = .03, <italic>p</italic> = .29).</p>
<p>No other effects in the model reached statistical significance. Of particular interest was the nonsignificant interaction between extraversion, message type, and elaboration, <italic>F</italic>(1, 230) = .26, <italic>p</italic> = .61. Equally important, the interaction between Self-Monitoring, Message Type, and Elaboration was also not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 230) = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> = .11. Thus, the moderating effects of elaboration on the relative efficacy of the types of messages were not qualified by either extraversion or self-monitoring.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present research was to examine whether the impact of descriptive versus injunctive normative messages differed depending on the level of cognitive elaboration, extraversion, and self-monitoring. The emergence of a significant Message Type × Elaboration Interaction and the fact that this 2-way interaction was not qualified by any higher-order interactions fits well with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini’s (2003)</xref> speculations regarding the role of elaboration as a moderator of the relative efficacy of normative messages. Thus, the data in the present research are probably the most direct evidence to date for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini’s (2003)</xref> suggestion that descriptive norms require less processing than injunctive norms in order to exert their impact. Extending his speculations, the present experiment suggested that, under conditions of high elaboration, intent to join the program was higher for those who read the injunctive rather than the descriptive message. As was noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini’s (2003)</xref> prior theorizing never explicitly addressed whether injunctive messages should be superior to descriptive messages under high elaboration or that the advantage of descriptive messages over injunctive should simply decrease or disappear.</p>
<p>Of course, one issue that the present study cannot definitively address is why descriptive norms work better than injunctive norms under low elaboration. It is unlikely that the present results can be attributed to the complexity of the two messages, because these were carefully constructed and edited to be of near identical length and layout, with similar language and phrasing used throughout. Another possible explanation could be that something idiosyncratic to our specific manipulations of elaboration produced the outcome. We used a combination of two common methods of manipulating elaboration: personal involvement and a cognitive load task. Our manipulation checks suggested that these manipulations created differences in elaboration. However, it is possible they also influenced other processes. Most notably, one might argue that our manipulation of personal involvement (i.e., whether the program was planned for immediate implementation at the participant’s university or another university) also altered the social rewards/punishments of adhering to the norm. Injunctive norms in particular have been postulated to play an important role because of their implications for social rewards and punishments. Perhaps the high involvement condition produced greater sensitivity to social rewards/punishments because the peer group was more immediate to the participant.</p>
<p>Although plausible, there are at least two reasons to doubt this explanation. First, normative impact as a result of social rewards/punishments tends to be most pronounced in public settings where adherence to the norm can be directly assessed by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611420481">Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955</xref>). The present study involved behavioral intention measures that were completed in an anonymous setting and for a program where adherence would be difficult for peers to assess. Moreover, failure to participate did not involve a violation of the injunctive norm per se (a healthy life style) and indeed adherence to norm in the present context could be achieved by many behaviors in addition to the advocated program. Thus, concrete social rewards/ punishments in either condition do not seem to be especially likely. A second objection to this explanation for the present results is that it cannot really account for the effect of elaboration on the descriptive message, which was, if anything, more pronounced than that on the injunctive message.</p>
<p>Thus, we think the most likely reason for the present effects is that descriptive norms require less scrutiny and so when cognitive resources are limited, looking to others’ behavior as a guide is a quick heuristic to make a decision. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611420481">Kallgren, Reno, and Cialdini (2000)</xref> have found that personal norms (injunctive norms related to individual values) are weak predictors of behavior <italic>unless</italic> they are at the forefront of one’s attention when the norm-relevant behavior arises. Therefore, conditions of high elaboration would be the ideal for injunctive norms to be effective. Further, because injunctive norms deal with values, it is probable that the individual must actively cognitively process these messages to assess whether they fit with their own values.</p>
<p>Assuming this interpretation is correct, the present study in many respects complements recent findings on other moderators of normative messages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611420481">Jacobson, Mortensen, and Cialdini (2011)</xref> found in two studies that when people engaged in an ego-depletion task prior to exposure to very brief normative messages, descriptive messages were more effective than injunctive messages. In contrast, people who were not ego-depleted prior to exposure showed a reverse pattern of effects. Interestingly, past research has suggested that ego-depletion can lead to decreased cognitive elaboration of messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611420481">Wheeler, Brinol, &amp; Hermann, 2007</xref>). This previous finding along with those of the present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611420481">Cialdini’s (2003)</xref> earlier speculations raise the possibility that elaboration might have been the proximal causal mechanism underlying the effects of ego-depletion on normative messages in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611420481">Jacobson et al. (2011)</xref> studies. However, no measures of elaboration were included in these ego-depletion studies so it is impossible to know whether elaboration was altered, and of course, it is possible that ego-depletion could have altered other mechanisms responsible for the effects.</p>
<p>Conversely, one might argue the effects of our elaboration manipulation were caused by ego-depletion. However, given that ego-depletion is known to reduce cognitive elaboration and cognitive elaboration was clearly altered in our study, such an alternative interpretation would only be different from our present interpretation if the effects occurred as a result of some unmeasured mechanism that was independent of the observed differences in elaboration. Additionally, given that the elaboration manipulation occurred during exposure to the message rather than prior to message exposure (as is typically done in ego-depletion research), one must assume ego-depletion occurred sufficiently rapidly during exposure to have its effects.</p>
<p>A final point of interest worth noting were the results involving extraversion and self-monitoring. Neither of these traits moderated the interaction between message type and elaboration, suggesting that the relative advantages of the messages across elaboration conditions were robust across variations in these traits. That being said, these traits did produce some effects of interest. A main effect of extraversion suggested that increases in this trait were associated with greater intentions to participate. Such an effect suggests that extraverts simply found the general program more appealing or that extraverts are more responsive to normative messages of both types, which makes sense in that both types of normative messages are a form of social validation. Interestingly, self-monitoring produced no main effect but interacted with message type. This interaction suggested that low self-monitors were more influenced than high self-monitors by the injunctive message and that there was a nonsignificant reversal of this effect for the descriptive message. Such an effect demonstrates yet another moderator of the efficacy of different types of normative messages and is sensible in light of past research suggesting that low self-monitors are more likely to respond to internalized guides to behavior such as values that are stressed in injunctive messages.</p>
<p>Taken together, at the most basic level, these findings further highlight both the theoretical and applied value of distinguishing between descriptive and injunctive normative messages. By demonstrating that the impact of elaboration on the efficacy of these two types of messages is quite different, the present study serves to confirm past theorizing that these messages exert their effects via different psychological processes. At the applied level, this key finding suggests that when attempting to shape behavior, practitioners should carefully consider the likely level of elaboration that will occur in the targets of their messages when deciding whether to stress injunctive or descriptive norms in their messages. Thus, it is hoped that this study can serve as a foundation for further theoretical and applied investigations of the effects of descriptive and injunctive norms.</p>
