<abstract>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which news story format (narrative vs. non-narrative) can initiate empathic processes that produce more favorable evaluations of stigmatized groups. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 399) read one of two versions of a story that described health care–related dilemmas for either immigrants, prisoners, or the elderly. Narrative-formatted stories produce more compassion toward the individuals in the story, more favorable attitudes toward the group, more beneficial behavioral intentions, and more information-seeking behavior.</p>

<p>Scholars and journalists have long noted that news stories do more than merely present information. Rather, the way that information is stressed or downplayed and the examples provided to illustrate issues play important roles in readers’ understanding and retention of information, as well as the perceptions and beliefs that follow from exposure.</p>
<p>The preponderance of research on news-format effects has focused on issue framing—how attributes about an issue are highlighted or underplayed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012439020">1</xref></sup> However, researchers are beginning to recognize the importance of format in affecting not only engagement with information, but also the extent to which attitudes and beliefs are changed by information that is presented or implied by the story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012439020">2</xref></sup> This research generally suggests that information presented in narrative or story formats may be particularly engaging and may, therefore, be a potent means of influencing judgments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012439020">3</xref></sup> To the extent that this effect is a general one, variations in news format have the potential to favorably or unfavorably influence evaluations of stigmatized groups and their members. The primary motivation for this project was to provide an empirical test of that idea. Our general expectation was that stories in a narrative format describing challenges that specific individuals face would engender more favorable judgments of stigmatized groups than would news stories in non-narrative formats focused on issues such as policy. But, in addition to tracing the impact of story design from message exposure to behavior, we also sought to better understand the process that explains the impact. To achieve these goals, we considered three conceptually distinct accounts of the effects of story format on attitudes toward stigmatized groups: narrative engagement, empathy and compassion, and other positive and negative emotions. A graphic summary of the hypotheses and research questions proposed is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012439020">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Literature Review and Rationale</title>
<sec id="section2-1077699012439020">
<title>Narrative engagement</title>
<p>The field of communication has witnessed a recent surge of research on a phenomenon known variously as <italic>narrative persuasion</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012439020">4</xref></sup> or <italic>entertainment education</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012439020">5</xref></sup> Regardless of its name, empirical results consistently demonstrate the power of narrative to alter beliefs and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012439020">6</xref></sup> And, although it is frequently argued that this effect is the product of multiple mechanisms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012439020">7</xref></sup> the umbrella concept that is often called upon to account for the process is <italic>engagement with the narrative</italic>, a term that is roughly synonymous with absorption and immersion. Perhaps the most commonly invoked subtype of engagement is <italic>transportation</italic>, which has been defined as “an integrative melding of attention, imagery, and feelings, focused on story events.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012439020">8</xref></sup> Using Green and Brock’s eleven-item transportation scale, several investigations have shown that narrative format produces higher levels of transportation and that higher levels of transportation are associated with stronger beliefs and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012439020">9</xref></sup> In line with theory and previous findings, we anticipated similar results. Specifically:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012439020" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> News stories about stigmatized groups will be more effective at inducing transportation when the story is presented in a narrative as opposed to non-narrative format.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Assuming that the story does not attribute unattractive motives to the characters, then:</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012439020" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> Transportation will show a positive association with attitudes toward the stigmatized group.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077699012439020">
<title>Empathy and compassionate affect</title>
<p>Prior research has shown the induction of empathy to be an effective means of changing attitudes toward members of stigmatized groups. In work reported by Batson et al., participants received instructions, prior to a story/interview, that encouraged or discouraged perspective taking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012439020">10</xref></sup> This manipulation produced two results germane to the project at hand. First, the high-empathy instructions yielded correspondingly higher scores on self-reports of sympathy, compassion, and tenderness toward the particular individual in the story. Second, feelings toward the specific individual correlated positively with attitudes toward the stigmatized group generally.</p>
<p>The commonalities between the experimental instructions regarding perspective taking and variations in news format are readily apparent. By virtue of its focus on facts, statistics, and social aggregates, the non-narrative (policy) format is naturally akin to suggesting that individuals view the issue “objectively.” To the extent that emotion and reason are viewed as antipodal, the non-narrative format suggests critical, rather than compassionate, analysis is the preferred means of understanding story content. In contrast, by presenting the problems, experiences, and feelings of individual social actors, the narrative format brings the perspective of the central character to the fore. Following this logic, we expected that:</p>
<list id="list3-1077699012439020" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H3:</bold> News stories about members of stigmatized groups will be more effective at inducing compassion toward the stigmatized group when the story is presented in a narrative as opposed to non-narrative format.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<bold>H4:</bold> The intensity of compassionate feelings for members of stigmatized groups will show a positive association with attitudes toward the stigmatized group.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077699012439020">
<title>Other positive and negative affects</title>
<p>In addition to examining the role of compassionate affective reactions, this study also considered the role of additional positive and negative affective responses. However, the specific manner in which these additional affects were assumed to operate was not specified, as there are multiple roles that they could feasibly play.</p>
<p>On the one hand, more negative affective reactions could be associated with diminished empathic responses. This perspective grows out of the recognition that stigmatized groups are collections of individuals who are negatively evaluated (by some) on the grounds that they share some common and undesirable characteristic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012439020">11</xref></sup> Consequently, negative affect may signify lower levels of empathy and greater attributions of blame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012439020">12</xref></sup> On the other hand, more negative affective reactions could be associated with perceptions of injustice, discrimination, or undeserved suffering reflecting perceptions of wrongful circumstances or events experienced by the stigmatized groups. From this perspective, then, anger, fear, or diminished feelings of happiness may be associated with greater concern for others’ suffering and may therefore be associated with greater empathy.</p>
<p>In either scenario, it would seem that news stories about stigmatized groups, regardless of format, may arouse a host of positive and negative emotions in, at least, some consumers. But, there is the likelihood for stories in a narrative format to arouse stronger affective reactions, precisely because of their close focus on members of the stigmatized group and the heightened salience of their experiences. Consequently, we asked:</p>
<list id="list4-1077699012439020" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> To what extent, if any, do news stories about stigmatized groups in a narrative format versus a non-narrative format evoke negative and positive emotions?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>RQ2:</bold> To what extent, if any, do those negative and positive emotions influence attitudes toward the stigmatized group?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077699012439020">
<title>Downstream effects of format: intentions and behavior</title>
<p>Like several recent investigations of narrative, we were interested in assessing the extent to which story format might exert an influence on variables that are typically viewed as downstream from attitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012439020">13</xref></sup> Our thinking was guided by research in the reasoned action tradition that locates attitude as causal antecedent to intention, which in turn causes behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012439020">14</xref></sup> Although there is strong evidence for the validity of this three-variable sequence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012439020">15</xref></sup> we know of no study to date that has traced the process from its origins in story format to the endpoint of behavior. As predicted by the theory of reasoned action and its progeny:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012439020">16</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list5-1077699012439020" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H5:</bold> Attitude toward stigmatized groups will be positively associated with intentions to perform behaviors that are beneficial to the group.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H6:</bold> Intentions will be positively associated with behavior.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1077699012439020">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The initial sample consisted of 453 undergraduate students. Participants were provided with a URL and instructions for participants to complete the study at their convenience over a two-week time period. All data collection and stimulus presentations were conducted online employing Inquisit software.</p>
<p>Screening was conducted prior to analysis to filter cases that signaled potential problems related to stimulus exposure. Specifically, unbeknownst to participants, the amount of time that participants spent reading the experimental news story was recorded. Reading times of less than ten seconds were interpreted as signifying that the participant simply clicked past the story without reading it, whereas times greater than 180 seconds were interpreted as indicative of distraction. Using these criteria, forty-four participants were filtered from all analyses. The resultant sample (<italic>N =</italic> 399) was 46.1% male, ranging in age from 18 to 40, M = 19.76, SD = 1.60.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077699012439020">
<title>Procedures and design</title>
<p>This study employed a 2 × 3 between-subjects experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to read and rate one of six different versions of a newspaper story that varied the story format (narrative vs. non-narrative) and the target group featured in the story (elderly persons, immigrants, and prisoners). Three groups were included in order to test the degree to which the hypothesized processes generalized across specific contexts.</p>
<p>Upon beginning the study, participants completed a number of background measures, including demographic information. Subsequently, participants read a newspaper story, rated their perceptions of the story, and rated their attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding the target group featured in the story (elderly persons, immigrants, or prisoners). Finally, before ending the study, participants were informed that they could either end the study and exit the questionnaire, or spend a few moments viewing websites of advocacy organizations for the target group, with credit being awarded in either case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077699012439020">
<title>Stimulus materials</title>
<p>The news stories employed as stimuli were all created for use in this study. To increase the authenticity of the stories, a former professional journalist was involved in the creation of the news stories. In an attempt to equate the stories’ general topic, all stories focused on issues of health care. Within each target condition, the same specific health care issue was presented, as was the same general substantive and factual information about the health care issue. However, in the narrative versions, the health care issue was illustrated using a specific person and his or her experiences to frame the information, whereas in the non-narrative versions, the health care issue was presented in terms of the presentation of policy with quotes from experts. Story length was similar across stories, ranging from 528 words for the shortest story to 549 words for the longest story. Story location (Washington, DC) was the same for all stories, and no story was identified by the name of a news source. For illustration purposes, the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1077699012439020">Appendix</xref> contains the narrative and non-narrative (policy) versions of the story focused on immigrants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077699012439020">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Two items were employed to assess the effectiveness of the narrative-story format on perceived focus: “The story emphasized a character’s actions” and “The story emphasized a character’s experiences,” <italic>r</italic> = .62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 4.94, SD = 1.20.</p>
<p>To assess transportation into the story, Green and Brock’s eleven-item narrative transportation scale was employed, with responses recorded on scales ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012439020">17</xref></sup> However, as in other projects that have employed this measure,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012439020">18</xref></sup> our exploratory factor analysis revealed that the scale was not unidimensional and that many items cross-loaded or did not load well on any factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012439020">19</xref></sup> After removing unreliable items, an exploratory analysis using principal-axis factoring and promax rotation revealed two factors explaining 42.77% of the variance. The first factor we labeled “story impact,” and it was associated with four items pertaining to the reader’s experience of picturing himself or herself in the story, of believing that the story would change the reader’s life, of experiencing an emotional response to the story, and of believing that the story was relevant to the reader’s life, M = 3.14, SD = 1.15, α = .69. The second factor, which we labeled “story involvement,” was associated with three items pertaining to being mentally involved in the story, to being distracted while reading (reverse coded), and to having one’s mind wander while reading (reverse coded), M = 4.87, SD = 1.22, α = .64.</p>
<p>Participants indicated their affective reactions to the story via the use of ten affect terms, rated on scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>). Five discrete affective states were assessed: two were positively valenced (happiness, contentment), two were negatively valenced (anger, fear), and one reflected the primary affect of interest in this research, compassion. Happiness was assessed via the items <italic>cheerful</italic> and <italic>happy</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 1.73, SD = 0.90), contentment via <italic>calm</italic> and <italic>content</italic> (<italic>r</italic> =.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 3.35, SD = 1.23), anger via <italic>angry</italic> and <italic>irritated</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 3.54, SD = 1.46), fear via <italic>afraid</italic> and <italic>scared</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 2.64, SD = 1.49), and compassion via <italic>compassionate</italic> and <italic>sympathetic</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, M = 4.51, SD = 1.44).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012439020">20</xref></sup> Because the correlation between the items assessing contentment was unacceptably low, this affect was not further analyzed.</p>
<p>Attitudes toward the target group featured in the news story were assessed using five items adapted from Batson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012439020">21</xref></sup> Examples include “Compared with other social problems we face today (e.g., crime, education, the economy), how would you rate the importance of helping [immigrants/elderly people/prisoners]?” and “Our society should do more to protect the welfare of [immigrants/elderly people/prisoners].” The response scale ranged from 1 to 7, with higher scores reflecting more favorable attitudes, M = 4.07, SD = 1.37, α = .91.</p>
<p>Behavioral intentions were assessed via a modified version of Peng, Lee, and Heeter’s measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012439020">22</xref></sup> Using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>), participants indicated their willingness to donate money, sign a petition, discuss the situation with friends/family, or forward a link to others regarding the target group in the story, M = 4.07, SD = 1.37, α = .91.</p>
<p>Finally, a behavioral measure was assessed at the end of the study providing participants the opportunity to learn more about advocacy groups who assist the target populations described in the story. The online software recorded whether the participant engaged in information seeking (i.e., clicked on the link to get more information) or opted to end the study. Of the 399 participants, 8.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 32) sought additional information.</p>

<title>Preliminary tests for potential mediators</title>
<p>The process model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012439020">Figure 1</xref>considers four possible mediators: transportation, compassionate affect, positive affect, and negative affect. In order for any of these variables to qualify as mediators, they should manifest a significant relationship with news format. Consequently, prior to examining the model as a whole, we conducted a 2 (Story Format) × 3 (Target Group) multivariate analysis of variance using the two transportation factors (involvement and impact) and the four affective reactions to the story as dependent variables (compassion, happiness, anger, and fear). In addition to establishing each variable’s potential as a mediator, this analysis enabled tests of <bold>H1</bold> (i.e., format influences transportation), <bold>H3</bold> (format influences compassion), and <bold>RQ1</bold> (i.e., does format influence positive and negative emotions?).</p>
<p>Importantly, this analysis revealed a significant multivariate main effect of story format, <italic>F</italic>(6, 388) = 13.77, Λ = .82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula4-1077699012439020">

<p>Neither the multivariate effect nor any of the univariate effects for the Story Format × Target Group interaction were significant, signifying that the effects of story format on affect and transportation were not significantly different across the target populations. In sum, the significant effects of format on compassion and story involvement indicated that these two variables qualified as potential mediators, while the remaining variables—impact, happiness, fear, and anger—did not.</p>

<title>Model Testing</title>
<p>Given these results, the hypothesized model was reduced to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012439020">Figure 1</xref> minus the nonqualifying potential mediators. This model was tested using MPlus 5.21.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012439020">24</xref></sup> Because the final outcome variable (i.e., information seeking) was a dichotomous variable, a robust mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least squares estimator (WLSMV) was employed, with the path leading to the final binary outcome measure employing a probit distribution. Except for story format and information seeking, all of the variables were modeled as single-indicator latent constructs with errors estimated as (1 – α) σ<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The initial model suggested an acceptable fit using commonly employed criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012439020">25</xref></sup> χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 12.86, <italic>p</italic> = .01, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .08. However, the modification indices suggested model improvement with the addition of a direct path from story involvement to behavioral intention. Further, this initial model showed no significant path from story involvement to attitude, β = −.09, <italic>p</italic> = .19. Consequently, this path was dropped.</p>
<p>In addition, this initial model conceptualized the relationship between story involvement and compassionate reactions as mere correlation. However, a revised (albeit equivalent) model that retained the role of involvement in the causal chain leading to heightened empathic attitudes was considered. Namely, rather than suggesting that involvement and compassion were related only in terms of correlation, the revised model suggested that these two variables were related via a direct path from involvement to compassion. This revision reflected the idea that transportation/involvement occurs prior to compassion and that transportation/involvement is frequently a precursor of compassion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012439020">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077699012439020">Figure 2</xref> displays the final model. This model produced acceptable fit statistics: χ<sup>2</sup> (5) = 10.38, <italic>p</italic> = .07, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05. As predicted, this model suggests that narrative formats led to higher levels of transportation/involvement (<bold>H1</bold>) and compassion (<bold>H3</bold>). However, attitude was predicted only by compassionate affect, thereby supporting <bold>H4</bold> (i.e., compassion influences attitude) and invalidating <bold>H2</bold> (i.e., transportation influences attitude). Nevertheless, transportation/involvement played an indirect role in attitude change by serving as a precursor to compassion. As predicted by <bold>H5</bold>, attitude was associated with stronger intentions to engage in actions associated with helping the target group. Finally, stronger intentions were associated with greater likelihoods of actually engaging in information seeking, as expected by <bold>H6</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Several additional aspects of this model are worthy of note. First, the model shows a negative correlation between narrative story formats and attitude, suggesting that in the absence of compassionate reactions, narrative formats may actually serve to decrease empathy. Second, there is a direct path from story involvement to behavioral intentions, suggesting that regardless of compassionate affect, greater involvement may motivate readers to take action. Finally, this model implies that narrative formats indirectly may lead to changes in behaviors via the paths involving compassion as a mediator. Consistent with this interpretation, bootstrapping procedures using 2,000 bootstrap samples and bias-corrected confidence intervals revealed a significant indirect path from narrative formats to information seeking via compassionate affect, β = .09, 95% confidence interval (CI) .03, .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p>The final test employed multiple-group analysis to examine the invariance of the structural weights between stories concerning elderly, immigrant, and prisoner populations. This analysis reflected no significant differences between the constrained and unconstrained models, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (11) = 5.17, <italic>p</italic> = .92. Consequently, the final model was the same across the target groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On the basis of theory and prior research, we expected that news stories in narrative (vs. non-narrative) format could instigate a process leading to relatively more favorable evaluations of stigmatized groups. On the broadest level, the results were wholly compatible with this expectation: The data showed that narrative news stories produced changes in emotions, attitudes, intentions, and behavior that were beneficial to members of stigmatized groups. We proposed three complementary processes that might account for the effect of narrative, some of which fared better than others in the empirical tests. Next, we consider the implications of the results for each of the three.</p>
<sec id="section16-1077699012439020">
<title>Narrative engagement</title>
<p>Narrative engagement theory generally,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012439020">27</xref></sup> and transportation-image theory specifically,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012439020">28</xref></sup> predicts that immersion in a story produces changes in beliefs and attitudes that are consistent with the narrative. Our final results suggested that transportation played a role in changing attitudes, but one that was different and more limited than anticipated. But, crucial to understanding the results is an appreciation of the manner in which transportation was measured. Similar to other researchers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012439020">29</xref></sup> our analysis suggested that the eleven-item measure was not unidimensional. However, across these studies, the specific items that compose the different dimensions show variation. Given consistent evidence of multidimensionality, at a minimum, researchers should avoid the practice of uncritically summing the items without any attempt to evaluate the dimensionality of the scale. Understanding of narrative persuasion might benefit if future research included additional or alternative measures of transportation, such as the scales developed by Busselle and Bilandzic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012439020">30</xref></sup> Specifically, their measure conceptualizes and assesses four specific aspects of transportation, including narrative understanding, attentional focus, narrative presence, and emotional engagement.</p>
<p>With this significant conceptual limitation in mind, the involvement factor included in the final model is a much narrower concept than transportation. In contrast to transportation theory, involvement as a standalone measure is not consistent with the notion of “an integrative melding of attention, imagery, and feelings.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012439020">31</xref></sup> Rather, similar to appraisal theories of emotion,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012439020">32</xref></sup> our model suggests that cognitive engagement precedes affective response. In terms of understanding the narrative processes, this is not a trivial role: Involvement is important, but it is distinct from and much smaller than the concept of transportation as it is typically discussed in the literature on narrative persuasion.</p>

<title>Empathy and compassionate affect</title>
<p>Batson et al. outlined a two-stage model in which (a) taking the perspective of stigmatized individuals evokes feelings of compassion, which, in turn, (b) bring about more favorable attitudes toward those groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012439020">33</xref></sup> The data were consistent with every aspect of this formulation and, thus, provide a valuable replication of their model. However, the current research also extends our understanding of empathy toward stigmatized groups in several ways not achieved in previous work.</p>
<p>First, whereas previous work has relied on experimental instructions to induce perspective taking, our study demonstrated that news stories in a narrative (vs. non-narrative) format can function as an ecologically valid means of instigating empathic processes. Such results have powerful ramifications for journalists who must, of necessity, choose a format for their work. This is not to say that stories delivered in non-narrative formats might not have other beneficial effects not addressed in this study. But, the data clearly point to the potency of narrative formats for inducing compassionate affect. In addition, they align with the broader claim that no format is neutral. Journalistic choices always involve highlighting certain aspects of a story while simultaneously backgrounding others.</p>
<p>Second, as with research by Batson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012439020">34</xref></sup> our data showed a relationship between compassion for a specific individual (i.e., the character in the story) and attitude toward the group. That this process of generalization from individual to group would occur is hardly a foregone conclusion, but, nonetheless, is consistent with prior research examining counter-stereotyping<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012439020">35</xref></sup> and an essential part of changing attitudes toward the stigmatized. In light of evidence of its occurrence across six different topics—persons living with AIDS, homeless persons, murder convicts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012439020">36</xref></sup> immigrants, the elderly, and prisoners—it seems likely that the process is a general one that might be utilized to change attitudes toward other stigmatized groups as well.</p>
<p>Third, our work demonstrated that the two-step model of empathic processes could be extended beyond attitude toward the group. Attitude showed a positive association with intention to behave in ways that benefitted the group, and intentions showed a similarly positive association with actual behavior (i.e., information seeking about the group). These downstream effects imply that variations in news format have the potential to promote favorable social and behavioral change toward stigmatized groups, though additional research is needed to examine how to increase the magnitude of these effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077699012439020">
<title>Unexpected findings</title>
<p>In addition to providing general support for the hypothesized role of narrative formats, our study also revealed some additional, unexpected findings that are worthy of attention. First, the total effect of narrative format on empathic attitudes was positive, though this positive relationship was due entirely to the indirect effect via compassion. In contrast, the direct effect of narrative format on empathic attitudes was weakly negative when compassion was present in the model.</p>
<p>Although this finding can be readily interpreted statistically in terms of a suppressor effect, the conceptual interpretation provides potentially interesting insights into the role of narrative formats on affecting readers’ attitudes. In short, narrative formats may instigate empathy, but only insofar as they succeed in evoking compassion. In contrast, if the effects of compassion are removed, then narrative formats may be detrimental to enhancing empathic attitudes. As such, narrative formats that fail to elicit compassion may simply make salient the stigmatized groups per se, highlighting what may be unappealing or distasteful to some readers—an interpretation worthy of future investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077699012439020">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>As with all research, it is important to be explicit about the strengths and limitations of the research design insofar as they circumscribe the boundaries of inference. One feature of our study that may limit the results is our dependence on a sample of undergraduate students. However, given their ability to form attitudes and engage in issue-relevant behaviors of the sort that were tapped by the intention measures, undergraduate students are as “real” as any other segment of society. Nonetheless, it would be desirable to demonstrate that the observed processes operate similarly in samples of different age or socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>An additional issue concerns the nature of the experimental stimuli. We made use of three stories, all of which described some problem related to health care. Regardless of format, the cause of the problem was not attributed to members of the stigmatized group. This feature of the story may enhance the potential for empathy in ways that other story types would not. Indeed, many news stories have identification of the cause of a societal problem as their goal, and on some occasions that cause may be the individual, as Iyengar notes regarding thematic versus episodic coverage and the attribution of responsibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012439020">37</xref></sup> This does not invalidate our stimuli, but it qualifies the findings, while underscoring an important claim of narrative theory: Narrative format does not invariably create either favorable or unfavorable reactions in consumers. Rather, relative to non-narrative format, it amplifies various responses in ways that are consistent with the story line.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge the limitations associated with the behavioral measure that we employed. Not only is clicking for more information arguably a weaker indicator of empathy than actual helping behaviors, the small number of participants who clicked for more information is reason for possible concern. At minimum, future research should explore additional means of assessing empathic behaviors and should look for additional ways to enhance the likelihood that people will engage in such behaviors.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that, with the exception of information seeking, all of the variables employed in our study were self-report measures. However, a long history of research in stereotyping and social cognition demonstrates that self-report measures can be readily controlled given sufficient motivation and ability, thereby potentially obscuring participants’ actual beliefs and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012439020">38</xref></sup> Consequently, more subtle assessments of implicit attitudes that are more difficult to control but that can nevertheless have profound effects on behaviors will provide an important direction for extensions of this research.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is one central conclusion to this work: Relative to non-narrative-formatted news stories, narratives instigate empathic processes that can substantially improve evaluations of stigmatized groups. Our data demonstrate the generality of these processes across three groups—immigrants, prisoners, and the elderly—as well as illustrate the potential for behavior change. All told, the results point the way for members of the media to carry out their work in ways that lead to the betterment of society.</p>

<p>Policy Story: Immigrants</p>
<p>Undocumented Workers in Health Jeopardy</p>
<p>WASHINGTON—Undocumented workers in the United States are receiving far less health care than their naturalized counterparts and full citizens, according to a Harvard University study published Thursday.</p>
<p>Undocumented workers are typically unable to afford health insurance or provide the necessary paperwork to receive coverage, said Professor Stacey Ward, who led the study. As a result, a large percentage of immigrants’ total interaction with a doctor begins and ends in the emergency room.</p>
<p>“When most people get sick or hurt they go to a doctor,” Ward said. “This is not always the case for people without health insurance.”</p>
<p>The study estimates that about 30% of the 9.3 million undocumented workers in this country have not seen a doctor in the last two years.</p>
<p>Many immigrants cannot apply for health insurance as they cannot afford it, Ward said. Since most employers who hire undocumented workers do not provide health insurance, workers often avoid medical treatment until an illness or an injury has become acute, at which point they are left with few other choices, she said.</p>
<p>“Many of the problems that will bring undocumented workers to the emergency room arise as a result of allowing a smaller and less serious problem to go untreated,” said Leonardo Cuello, director of the Washington, DC, Health and Law Project. This form of care is far more expensive than a routine visit to a primary care physician.</p>
<p>“Many times immigrants hurt the taxpayer more when they use emergency rooms for medical care than when they see a primary care physician,” said Cuello.</p>
<p>Medical problems can go undiagnosed for weeks or months at a time, often allowing for small health problems, like a few cuts on a finger, to fester and grow into much more debilitating conditions, said Ward.</p>
<p>Alejandro Martinez, 36, of Leesburg, Va., was working for Northern Apparel, a clothing manufacturer, when he cut two of his fingers while trimming fabric. He said because he did not have health insurance, he treated his injury at home. When his fingers later became infected, he had to have them amputated in a hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>The reliance of undocumented persons on emergency rooms can be traced to a 1986 federal law, requiring hospital emergency rooms to treat everyone regardless of their ability to pay or citizenship status. It makes hospital emergency rooms one of the few places that undocumented persons can receive care, no questions asked. The trouble, according to advocates, is that this care often comes at too high a price, both for the taxpayer and the patient.</p>
<p>According to Ward, having a portion of the population utilizing emergency rooms as primary care centers can also cause problems both for the uninsured and the rest of the population.</p>
<p>“If there is some emergency or natural disaster, emergency rooms need to be able to handle a large influx of patients all at the same time,” said Ward. “You can’t have that if you have people in there that really should be seeing a general practitioner.”</p>
<p>Not all of the uninsured individuals in the country are immigrants. According to the non-partisan Kaiser foundation, about 46.3 million people that live in the United States are currently uninsured.</p>
<p>Narrative Story: Immigrants</p>
<p>Living Without Health Insurance</p>
<p>WASHINGTON—Alejandro Martinez, 36, of Leesburg, Va., fumbles with the buttons on his shirt, clumsily working around two missing fingers. Some mornings his heavily bandaged hand seems to have a will of its own.</p>
<p>“Let me get those,” his wife, Mariana, 35, told Martinez. “You’ll be late to drop the kids off.” She reaches up and deftly finishes off the last two buttons.</p>
<p>“It’s days like these when I miss my old life,” Martinez said. “Days when I can still feel those missing fingers are the hardest.”</p>
<p>Three weeks ago Martinez cut two of his fingers at work while trimming a roll of fabric as a floor worker at Northern Apparel, a large clothing manufacturer. He says he probably should have gotten stitches right then but small injuries are not uncommon and slow down the production line.</p>
<p>Last month Martinez had a well paying job at a clothing manufacturer and had recently been promoted to floor manager. The new position meant more time at home to spend with his wife and two children, Montoya, 5, and Isabel, 1, along with a much needed pay raise.</p>
<p>All of the things he once envisioned for himself and his family are no longer possible, Martinez said.</p>
<p>“When most people get sick or hurt they go to a doctor,” said Leonardo Cuello, Director of the Washington, DC, Health and Law Project. “This is not always the case for people without health insurance.”</p>
<p>Most employers who hire undocumented workers do not provide health insurance, and workers often avoid medical treatment until an illness or an injury has become acute, said Harvard University Professor Stacey Ward.</p>
<p>At this point they are left with few other choices.</p>
<p>A large percentage of immigrants’ total interactions with a doctor begin and end in the emergency room, Ward said. She said about 30% of the 9.3 million undocumented workers in this country have not seen a doctor in the last two years.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking immediate medical attention, Martinez treated the wound at home because he is an undocumented worker from Mexico and cannot afford health insurance.</p>
<p>“It was such a small cut, I thought I would be able to take care of it myself,” Martinez said.</p>
<p>His fingers became swollen and painful within a few days, looking more like fat sausages than human appendages. He realized that he needed to see a doctor and went to the emergency room for treatment. The news the doctors had for him was not good: It had been too long since the infection had set in and he would need an amputation.</p>
<p>“It was devastating,” Martinez said.</p>
<p>He said the knowledge that all of this could have been prevented is even more painful than the loss of his fingers. Because he could not see a doctor in time, he is now unable to help his son practice for the little league baseball team, carry his newborn daughter, or even dress himself in the morning.</p>
<p>“This whole thing has been such a heartbreaking experience. Alex used to love so much to play with our children when he got home from work,” Mariana Martinez said. “Now he can barely get himself dressed in the morning. It just breaks my heart.”</p>

<p>Prior to testing the hypothesized model, several preliminary analyses were conducted to examine if compassionate reactions to the story and empathic attitudes toward the groups varied as a function of story format, target group, and individual differences reflected in gender and political attitudes.

<p>The second set of analyses employed multiple regression to examine both main effects of individual differences on compassion and empathic attitudes, and also to examine whether or not individual differences moderated the effect of story format on these outcomes of interest. The first analysis examined compassionate reactions and the second empathic attitudes. Both analyses included gender, political attitudes, story format, and target group as predictors, with hierarchical regression employed to examine both direct and conditional effects of these variables. The analysis of compassionate reactions revealed that females reported greater compassion than did males in response to the story (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and that greater conservatism was associated with lower levels of compassion (β = –.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). No other significant effects involving these variables were obtained in this analysis. The analysis of empathic attitudes revealed that more conservative political attitudes were associated with lower levels of empathy toward the target groups (β = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, a Political Attitudes × Target Group interaction was also obtained, <italic>F</italic>-Change (2, 388) = 10.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This interaction reflects that conservatism was associated with lower levels of empathy for both immigrants (<italic>r</italic> = −.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and prisoners (<italic>r</italic> = −.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but slightly higher levels of empathy for elderly persons (<italic>r</italic> = .16, <italic>p</italic> = .08). No other significant effects involving these variables were obtained in this analysis.</p>
<p>Together, these analyses show that target group, gender, and political attitudes play a role in predicting compassionate reactions to news stories and empathic attitudes toward the groups. However, none of these variables moderates the effect of story format on outcome related to compassion or empathic attitudes.</p>

<p>If this assumption is plausible, then three scenarios should be expected: low involvement/low compassion, high involvement/high compassion, and high involvement/low compassion. The scenario that should occur least frequently should be low involvement/high compassion. To test the viability of this assumption, median splits were employed to create high and low groups on each variable, and a 2 (Involvement) × 2 (Compassion) chi-square test was conducted. This test revealed a significant effect, χ<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 399, df = 1) = 18.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Follow-up tests confirmed the idea that lower levels of compassion occurred with comparable frequency for both high and low levels of involvement, χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> = .12, whereas higher levels of compassion occurred more frequently with high rather than low levels of involvement, χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 20.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Consequently, in the final model, the correlation between the error variances for compassion and involvement was replaced with a direct path leading from involvement to transportation.</p>
