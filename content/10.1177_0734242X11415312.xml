<p>State parks are highly sensitive areas of great natural importance and tourism value. Herein a case study involving a basic survey of solid waste which was carried out in 2006 in Agua Blanca State Park, Macuspana, Tabasco, Mexico with two sampling periods representing the high and low tourist season is presented. The survey had five objectives: to find out the number of visitors in the different seasons, to consider the daily generation of solid waste from tourist activities, to determine bulk density, to select and quantify sub-products; and to suggest a possible treatment. A daily average of 368 people visited the park: 18 862 people in 14 days during the high season holiday (in just one day, Easter Sunday, up to 4425 visitors) and 2092 visitors in 43 days during the low season. The average weight of the generated solid waste was 61.267 kg day<sup>−1</sup> and the generated solid waste average per person was 0.155 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. During the high season, the average increased to 0.188 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> and during the low season, the average decreased to 0.144 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. The bulk density average was 75.014 kg m<sup>−3</sup>, the maximum value was 92.472 kg m<sup>−3</sup> and the minimum was 68.274 kg m<sup>−3</sup>. The sub-products comprised 54.52% inorganic matter; 32.03% organic matter, 10.60% non-recyclable and 2.85% others. Based on these results, waste management strategies such as reuse/recycling, aerobic and anaerobic digestion, the construction of a manual landfill and the employment of a specialist firm were suggested.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>State and national parks are highly sensitive areas; they can be of great natural and tourist value for a region and promote the conservation of species and the natural habitat. None-the-less, tourist visits <italic>en masse</italic> must be controlled, because beyond certain limits, visitors can disturb the ecological balance, particularly when there are no appropriate waste management strategies and waste can remain indefinitely in the parks. Therefore, an awareness of tourist numbers is required in order to reduce the intensity of the impact. There is a need for a management programme, which implies planning, preparation and assessment in advance to move from set-aside thinking to local participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11415312">Lu et al., 2005</xref>) with legislation, education and social responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11415312">Erdogan and Tosun, 2009</xref>) that influence attitudes towards environmental concerns such as waste reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11415312">Liu et al., 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>The tourist carrying capacity, which is defined as the capability that an ecosystem has to preserve organisms by maintaining productivity, adaptability and capacity of regeneration, represents the maximum level of use by visitors that an area can sustain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11415312">Ceballos, 1996</xref>); if it is exceeded, the resources, and the quality of life of local people will deteriorate (Castellanni and Sala, 2006). Therefore, the determination of tourist carrying capacity constitutes a planning tool for management decisions which include the calculation of environmental, physical, social, economic and cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11415312">Acevedo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11415312">Cifuentes, 1992</xref>). The environmental factor is the only factor considered in the present study.</p>
<p>There are different methodologies for the management and regulation of tourist visits: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11415312">Tchobanoglous et al. (1994)</xref> recommend studying the origin, composition and properties of waste to make its transformation possible; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11415312">Loomis and Graefe (1992)</xref> suggest visitor impact management; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11415312">Stankey et al. (1985)</xref> identify the limits of acceptable change and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11415312">Cifuentes (1992)</xref> defines the tourist carrying capacity.</p>
<p>Many natural protected areas (NPAs) have experienced waste disposal problems. In Hawf, Yemen, plastic bags covered shrubs and cattle and camels ingested them. The park has improved the collection, disposal in the dump, recycling, and raising awareness among tourists and residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11415312">UNDP, 2006</xref>). In Turkey, the authorities have improved the legislation in the protected areas by applying the principles of the European Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) 99/31/EC by considering waste management strategies for preventive actions and to remedy the environmental damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11415312">Başak Taşeli, 2007</xref>). These strategies include solid waste separation at source, using recycled paper, composting the organic waste, purchasing materials with recyclable features and cooperating with recycling firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11415312">Erdogan and Tosun, 2009</xref>). In Santa Elena Canyon, in Texas, USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11415312">INE, 1997b</xref>) waste bins were misplaced, and waste ended up in open dumps or being burnt. Now, there is a waste management programme based on the results of a survey to identify and control contamination sources.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in Mexico, many NPAs are not properly prepared for receiving visitors as they do not have suitable environmental management of waste. Although very little is written on the topic, there is a strong emphasis in the importance of protecting the environment. For example, Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatán (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11415312">INE, 1995</xref>), Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in Sonora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11415312">INE, 1995</xref>), Isla Contoy National Park in the Caribbean Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11415312">INE, 1997 a</xref>), Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve in Querétaro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11415312">INE, 1999</xref>) and Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl National Park all reported that there was no waste disposal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11415312">Simon 2007</xref>). The productive activities (daily work of fishermen, raising livestock, agriculture and tourism) have caused deteriorated in these areas because there was no control over waste management. Inorganic waste (glass and plastic) have remained indefinitely in open dumps or been thrown into rivers, canyons or abandoned fields or else burnt. Dumps associated with human settlements have also contaminated the areas as there has been no coordination between the reserve and the municipality waste collection staff.</p>
<p>In Querétaro, in 1999, visitors generated 45 tons of solid waste each day, which represents a total of 16 465 ton year<sup>−1</sup>. In 2007, the Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl National Park received an average of 128 000 visitors during the year and the waste generated was 0.010 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11415312">Simon, 2007</xref>). In the same year, Chapultepec Park in Mexico City received an average of 175 000 visitors every week; generating 35 000 kg of solid waste per week, which is equivalent to 0.2 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11415312">SMADF, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, in Sonora, it is prohibited to throw waste in the NPA and visitors have to use containers outside the reserve. In Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl National Park, regular mountain climbers organize cleaning journeys to collect tons of waste on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In 1986, the State of Tabasco created a system to protect the biologically rich natural areas to guarantee their conservation and to regulate human activities. One of these areas was Agua Blanca State Park (PEAB, abbreviation in Spanish), a beautiful place with caverns for eco-touristic activities and recreational facilities. The park is located in the west and north-east part of the Agua Blanca Mountains, in Macuspana municipality. It has an area of 2025 hectares, is located between the parallels 17° 35′ and 17° 38′ North, and 92° 25′ and 92° 29′ West, at altitudes of 100 to 200 m above sea level.</p>
<p>Within this context, a basic survey was carried out as part of the project Determination of the Tourism Carrying Capacity of Agua Blanca State Park in Macuspana, Tabasco, which was funded from 2005 to 2007 by Consul of Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACyT, in Spanish), the Government of the State of Tabasco and the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco.</p>
<p>The park faced several environmental problems; one of which was the lack of suitable environmental solid waste disposal. There was no information about how much tourism development affected the park in terms of solid waste generation; although such information was needed in order to make appropriate decisions related to the carrying capacity of the park. To propose possible management strategies, it was necessary to find out the number of visitors the park received throughout the year, the kind of solid waste generated, the daily generation and the bulk density of solid waste, and the composition and properties of sub-products.</p>
<p>Thus, to obtain basic data and to be able to recommend environmental management strategies, the research question for this case study was: What arethe origins, composition and properties of the waste generated by visitors in Agua Blanca State Park? The basic survey had five objectives: (1) to find out the number of visitors in the different seasons; (2) to consider the daily generation of solid waste from tourist activities; (3) to determine the bulk density; (4) to identify and quantify sub-products; and (5) to suggest possible waste treatment strategies.</p>

<title>Methods and materials</title>
<p>To accomplish the field work, the methodology, materials and equipment used were according to the Mexican norms: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11415312">NMX-AA-015-1985</xref>, (the quarter method), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11415312">NMX-AA-019-1985</xref>, (bulk density), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11415312">NMX-AA-022-1985</xref>, (the quantification and selection of sub-products), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11415312">NMX-AA-061-1985</xref>, (waste generation).</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X11415312">
<title>Sampling periods</title>
<p>Sampling periods were selected in the high and low tourist seasons by considering frequency of visits. The first period involved two weeks in March and two weeks in April (the warmest time of the year), and the second period, during the low season, from September to December, involved one week in September, two in October, one week in November and two in December.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X11415312">
<title>Cleaning operation</title>
<p>Waste containers for different material fractions were placed all around the park. Daily waste collection began at the parking lot, then at the restaurant, the dressing rooms, rest rooms, and along the waterfalls. The bins were lined with a polyethylene bag, the sampling periods took place during the morning and the bags from the bins that contained solid waste from the previous day were removed and the data were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X11415312">
<title>Sample collection</title>
<p>A new polyethylene bag was set in each of the 15 cement bins (2.5 m<sup>3</sup> capacity). The containers did not have a lid but they had a rudimentary device to contain leaching (cement bottoms). They were distributed along the waterfall area, at the entrance, near the rest rooms and the picnic areas to store waste during the next 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11415312">Figure 1</xref>). From the second day to the last day of the sampling period, waste was collected daily and new polyethylene bags were placed in the bins for the following day.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, during the Easter holidays, the capacity of the bins located in the park was not enough to contain the amount of rubbish generated by tourists. During the high season, up to ten people were assigned to collect the bags between 0700 to 1700 h (several times a day).</p>
<p>The total of the collected solid waste throughout the day was weighed wet and the results recorded to generate an inventory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X11415312">
<title>Number of visitors</title>
<p>The tourists were counted every sampling day to find out the generation of waste per capita. A person was stationed at the entrance to count every visitor and the data were confirmed by comparison with numbers of the entrance tickets sold.</p>

<sec id="section7-0734242X11415312">
<title>Estimation of per capita generation of solid waste</title>
<p>The value of per capita generation of solid waste in kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> units corresponding to the date of collection was calculated by means of the following formula:</p>

<title>Quarter method</title>
<p>The quarter method was used to get the final 50 kg sample to be analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11415312">Kunitoshi, 1983</xref>). The whole daily collected waste was placed in a pile in a paved area on a large plastic sheet to avoid adding extra dust or soil to the materials; the pile was homogenized using a shovel and/or winnowing fork. Subsequently, the pile was separated into four equal parts (A, B, C, D); and parts A and D, located at opposite quarters were chosen to form a new smaller pile. The material was mixed again, and was divided into four parts, to obtain the next sample, once more from quarters A and D. This procedure was repeated until the 50 kg sample of solid waste was left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11415312">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Bulk density</title>
<p>In order to determine the <italic>in situ</italic> bulk density, following the Mexican norm, two significant aspects were verified: if the waste bins were clean and free of dents and if the scale was balanced. Afterwards, an empty bin was weighed taking this feature as the tare of the container. The bin was filled up with the homogenized solid waste dropping it three times onto the ground from a height of 10 cm, but without pressing the materials to avoid altering the bulk density. In order to obtain the net weight of the solid waste, the value of the tare was subtracted. When the amount of solid waste material was not enough to fill the bin, the height it reached was marked on it, and the volume was determined. The bulk density of the solid waste was calculated by means of the following formula:</p>

<title>Management strategies and treatment technologies</title>
<p>Three management strategies were proposed: (1) an appropriate positioning and signing of classified bins: organic, PET, cardboard and paper, glass and polystyrene; (2) a daily clean-up system with bins that control leaching and a well-equipped storage area in a closed infrastructure to avoid the penetration of rainwater and puddles; and (3) an agreement with a specialist company for recycling of materials and disposal of the hazardous waste. In addition, three treatment technologies were suggested: (1) reuse/recycle for inorganic matter; (2) aerobic and anaerobic digestion for the organic matter; and (3) final suitable disposal of waste.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The reported average of 128 000 visitors per year in Itzaccihuatl-Popocatépetl National Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11415312">Simón, 2007</xref>) is comparable with the average of 134 320 visitors per year in Agua Blanca State Park; neither of them had a waste disposal system. Agua Blanca Park is not, however, comparable with the 175 000 visitors per week in Chapultepec Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11415312">SMADF, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of waste generation, the value for Itzaccihuatl-Popocatépetl National Park was 0.010 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11415312">Simón, 2007</xref>) whereas in Chapultepec Park, it was 0.2 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> per capita and in Agua Blanca Park it was 0.155 kg person<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. Taking account of the number of visitors and waste generation, Agua Blanca Park generates in a year the same amount of waste as Chapultepec does in a week!</p>
<p>Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve generates a total of 16.5 ton year<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11415312">INE, 1999</xref>), Chapultepec 1819.9 ton year<sup>−1</sup>, Itzaccihuatl-Popocatépetl 1.3 ton year<sup>−1</sup> and Agua Blanca Park 20.8 ton year<sup>−1</sup>. These data show that there is a major tourist carrying capacity problem in NPAs. In the three non-urban NPAs, which differ from Chapultepec Park that is located in Mexico City, waste was left in open dumps, burnt, or thrown into rivers, canyons or abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Related to bulk density, in the reviewed literature, there was no information for comparison. However, these data are important because they provide data for the calculation of the bin volume required, the design of a landfill for this NPA and a basis for possible environmental management strategies.</p>
<p>In other countries, e.g. in Hawf, Yemen, the NPA has improved the collection, disposal in dumps and recycling, and has raised awareness among tourists and residents (UNEP, 2006); in Turkey, the legislation has been improved in terms of waste management strategies for preventive actions and for remedial environmental damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11415312">Başak Taşeli, 2007</xref>); in Texas, USA, there is a waste management programme based on a survey to identify and control contamination sources.</p>
<p>In Mexico, Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere prohibits throwing waste in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11415312">INE, 1995</xref>), so visitors have to use bins outside the reserve. In Itzaccihuatl-Popocatépetl, regular mountain climbers organize cleaning trips to collect tons of waste on aregular basis, in contrast to Agua Blanca where there are no strategies to solve the waste environmental problem yet.</p>
<p>It was observed that there were two kinds of visitors: families, during the high season and school groups during the low season. Families organized picnics whereas children in school groups took sandwiches and drinks for lunch. The families generated more organic matter waste and collected empty aluminium cans to takethem home, whereas schoolchildren left more aluminum cans because they did not collect them and more paper waste.</p>
<p>Aluminium was the only sub-product removed from the park, the rest were thrown onto open dumps to be burnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11415312">Figure 3</xref>). A ditch (guardarraya in Spanish) was dug at the right side of the entrance of the park to prevent fire invading the area. It was a kind of open landfill where the daily accumulated waste was burnt continuously, without any control.</p>

<title>Management strategies and treatment technologies</title>
<p>To choose the best conditions for the community three key aspects were considered: the community needs; the costs and system requirements; and the investment risk and flexibility in the operation, bearing in mind future changes.</p>
<p>The suggested strategies to manage the sub-products are based on the low implementation cost, and its easy application. For re-using waste materials, the craft abilities of the local people are taken into account. Agreements with specialist companies for both recycling of materials and disposal of the hazardous waste are necessary due to the lack of information and experience of the staff on these topics.</p>
<p>The three treatment technologies proposed are those that have the lowest cost per ton according to a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11415312">FEMISCA (2009)</xref> report in Mexico: the treatment cost for the aerobic digestion was of US$30 dollars ton<sup>−1</sup>; US$115 ton<sup>−1</sup> for the anaerobic digestion, and from US$6–8 ton<sup>−1</sup> for a landfill.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This case study evaluated the solid waste generated at Agua Blanca State Park, so that the people in charge of the NPA can make good decisions for appropriate environmental management.</p>
<p>The origin of waste generated was mostly from local visitors. Its composition was mainly inorganic matter followed by organic matter. The properties studied in this research were related to the bulk density. This information makes it possible to choose the appropriate kind and number of bins, the equipment, the means of transportation and the treatment of the sub-products. It is also necessary to identify and to control contamination sources, and to raise visitor awareness, for example by campaigns for preventive actions.</p>
<p>It is necessary to adjust the Mexican regulations because none of them consider the solid waste generated in a natural protected area.</p>
<p>The basic survey allowed recommendations of possible environmental management strategies to be made. The amounts of solid waste generated must be controlled, because beyond certain limits, visitors can disturb the ecological balance of the park.</p>
<p>This basic survey is regarded as a starting point to plan the way to resolve the environmental problems in the park. The next step is to convince the authorities, staff and visitors to consider it.</p>
<p>New research questions arise for further research to design a suitable holistic management programme which implies planning, preparation and assessment in advance to move from set-aside thinking to local participation: What kind of bins are appropriate to replace the current cement ones?, Is the resulting bulk density enough or should more adequate bins be provided?, Will Mexican tourists accept new proposals, and if not, how can tourists be persuaded to accept new regulations?, What kind of landfill design is suitable considering biotic and abiotic factors?, How to eradicate open burning of waste from the ancestral Mesoamerican culture?, Is it possible to persuade local authorities to improve the existing monitoring of solid waste?, What method would be useful for the degradation of the organic fraction, aerobic or anaerobic?, Is an inorganic waste recycling centre appropriate for the park?</p>
