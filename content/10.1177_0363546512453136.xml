<title>Osteoarthritis Grant Available</title>
<p>AOSSM, in partnership with Sanofi Biosurgery, is pleased to again offer a research grant to fund investigations related to early osteoarthritis (OA) and/or prevention of OA progression. This grant reflects the growing recognition of the importance of osteoarthritis within sports medicine and orthopaedics. The program is an outgrowth of the Society’s conferences on post–joint injury OA held in December 2008 and 2010, and it underscores Sanofi’s longstanding commitment to osteoarthritis research and therapy. The grant will be for $50,000 to support a lab/basic science study. Proposed studies need not relate specifically to sports injuries and should also have broad applicability to OA in the general population. Projects involving viscosupplementation will not be considered for this grant.</p>
<p>Applications will be reviewed for their potential impact on the field, the quality of study approach, and ability of investigator and site(s) to conduct and complete the proposed research. The principal investigator or at least one co-investigator on all applications must be an AOSSM member who has completed his or her training. It is expected that grantees will submit the results from their funded study to AOSSM for podium presentation and to <italic>AJSM</italic> for publication.</p>
<p>The submission deadline is August 1, 2012. The award notice will be made on or after October 15 with a start date of January 1, 2013. Inquiries can be directed to Bart Mann, AOSSM Director of Research, at <email>bart@aossm.org</email>.</p>
<p>To begin the application process, please review the guidelines specific to this grant and complete all information as described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sportsmed.org/researchgrants">www.sportsmed.org/researchgrants</ext-link>. All information should be submitted in a single pdf document to Bart Mann, AOSSM Director of Research, at <email>bart@aossm.org</email>.</p>
