<abstract>
<p>This study examined adults’ self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication measured through dual survey modes (random digital dial and mail). Even while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, significant differences in regard to adults’ responses to survey variables emerged as a function of survey mode. While the analyses do not allow us to pinpoint the underlying causes of the differences observed, they do suggest that mode of administration should be carefully adjusted for and considered.</p>

<p>Nationally, survey participation is declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312470125">Berk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312470125">Morton et al., 2006</xref>), and as a result, mixed-mode data collection designs (i.e. combination of mail, telephone, Internet-based) have been employed in an attempt to increase response rates and thereby limit response bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312470125">Link and Mokdad, 2005</xref>). However, while mixed-mode data collection strategies can improve overall response rates, issues pertaining to nonresponse bias remain because some population subgroups (e.g. low socioeconomic status) are still less likely to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312470125">Beebe et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, studies have documented significant differences in participants’ responses to health-related survey items as a function of data collection mode. For example, significant differences in self-reported health assessments emerged among a sample of Danish adults randomized to complete a survey by either questionnaire or telephone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312470125">Feveile et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, patients completing the Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CAHPS<sup>®</sup>) via telephone were significantly more likely to provide favorable evaluations of their hospital care than were those who completed the survey by mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312470125">DeVries et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) was administered to samples of participants by both telephone (using random digit dialing (RDD)) and mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470125">National Cancer Institute, 2007</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have assessed the equivalence of survey mode on participants’ responses to health literacy- and numeracy-like screening items and/or self-reported autonomy with health-care provider questions. Therefore, to address this gap in the literature, the purpose of this study was to compare adults’ self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication measured through dual survey modes (RDD and mail). As individuals have different strengths in learning and communication styles—some learn by listening, whereas others learn visually—mode of data collection (e.g. telephone versus mail) could influence the way in which individuals respond to survey-type questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312470125">Schonlau et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Data source</title>
<p>Data used in this cross-sectional study were obtained from the 2007 HINTS, sponsored and made available to the public by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470125">National Cancer Institute (2007)</xref>. The HINTS, fielded every 2–3 years since 2003, measures cancer information–seeking behaviors, cancer-related knowledge, and health behaviors among a nationally representative sample of civilian, noninstitutionalized American adults ≥ 18 years of age. Data for the 2007 HINTS were collected from January to May 2008.</p>
<p>The 2007 HINTS used a dual-frame sampling design—RDD telephone survey and mail—to achieve a higher response rate than could be expected from employing one data collection technique exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312470125">Link et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the dual-frame sampling design allowed for cellular telephone-only households to be included within the sample. Two separate samples of participants were drawn to partake in the HINTS survey either by RDD or mail. All participants were sent a letter introducing the study and explaining that their household would receive a call from an interviewer (RDD sample) or a written questionnaire in the mail (mail sample) approximately 1 week later.</p>
<p>The RDD sample, which included 4092 respondents, was conducted by a live interviewer using a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview format. Using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview format, the interviewer follows a software-generated script that is customized based on respondents’ answers. RDD participants were selected from a random sample of all working banks in US telephone exchanges. RDD interviews averaged 33.6 minutes in total (range = 16–126.8 minutes) with participants completing interviews between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. 7 days a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470125">National Cancer Institute, 2007</xref>). The mail sample, which included 3582 respondents, was selected from a random list of addresses from United States Postal Service (USPS) administrative records with oversampling of minorities. The response rate for the RDD sample was 24 percent, while the response rate for the mail sample was 31 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312470125">Cantor et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Variables</title>
<p>The formatting and wording of all survey items and response options included within our study were identical (word-for-word) for both RDD and mail respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105312470125">
<title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>The following sociodemographic characteristics were assessed: sex (male; female), age (18–34 years; 35–39 years; 40–44 years; ≥45 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; non-Hispanic other; Hispanic), education (less than high school; high school; some college; college or more), household income (&lt;US$20,000; US$20,000–US$34,999; US$35,000–US$49,999;US$50,000–US$74,999; ≥US$75,000), health insurance status (insured; uninsured), health-care (HC) access (has regular HC provider; no regular HC provider), and self-rated health status (poor/fair; good; very good/excellent).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105312470125">
<title>Self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics</title>
<p>Three items examined respondents’ understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics. The first item, from the STAT-Confidence scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312470125">Woloshin et al., 2005</xref>), assessed understanding of medical statistics, <italic>In general, how easy or hard do you find it to understand medical statistics?</italic> Participants responded to this item using a 4-point scale (very easy, easy, hard, very hard). For the purposes of our analyses, responses to this item were categorized as either “very easy/easy” or “hard/very hard.” This categorization approach was used in a prior study where this survey item was examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312470125">Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second item, <italic>In general, I depend on numbers and statistics to help me make decisions about my health</italic>, was assessed using a 4-point scale (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree). For the purposes of our analyses, responses to this item were categorized as either “strongly/somewhat disagree” or “somewhat/strongly agree.”</p>
<p>The third item, modified from the Subjective Numeracy Sale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312470125">Fagerlin et al., 2007</xref>), assessed formatting preferences of medical information, <italic>When people tell you the chance of something happening do you prefer they use words or numbers?</italic> Response options were “words,” “numbers,” and “no preference.” For the purposes of our analyses, responses to this item were categorized as either “words/no preference” or “numbers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312470125">
<title>Self-reported confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health-related advice or information</title>
<p>Two items measured respondents’ confidence in self-care and their ability to obtain health-related advice or information. Both items, <italic>Overall, how confident are you about your ability to take good care of your health?</italic> and <italic>Overall, how confident are you that you could get health-related advice or information if you needed it?</italic>, were measured on a 4-point scale (very confident, completely confident, somewhat confident, not confident). For the purposes of our analyses, responses to these items were categorized as either “very/completely confident” or “somewhat/not confident.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105312470125">
<title>Perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication</title>
<p>Respondents reporting visiting a health-care professional within the last 12 months completed five items relating to the perceived quality of their interaction: “During the past 12 months, how often did doctors, nurses, or other health professionals: (1) give you the chance to ask all the health-related questions you had? (2) give the attention you needed to your feelings and emotions? (3) involve you in decisions about your health care as much as you wanted? (4) make sure you understood the things you needed to do to take care of your health? and (5) help you deal with feelings of uncertainty about your health or health care?” All items were measured on a 4-point scale (always, usually, sometimes, never). For the purposes of our analyses, responses to these items were categorized as either “always” or “not always” (usually, sometimes, never). Approximately half of the respondents reported “always” to each of the five items, and the other half were distributed over the other three responses. So, for the purposes of conducting logistic regression analyses, the responses were dichotomized as “always” and “not always,” constructing two relatively equal groups. This categorization approach has been used in prior studies using similar survey-type items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312470125">DeVoe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312470125">Wallace et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105312470125">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A priori, statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Descriptive statistics were conducted to depict the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample and responses to self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health-related advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication. Differences in participants’ sociodemographic characteristics and responses to self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health-related advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication by survey mode were compared using chi-squared (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>) analyses.</p>
<p>The SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure in SAS software was used to obtain weighted estimates of effects and request variance estimation. The SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure was designed to analyze categorical data from surveys using complex sampling designs such as the HINTS. In order to calculate appropriate population weight and design adjusted population estimates, all models were implemented using replicate jackknife weighting estimate of variance to account for the multistage sampling design of the HINTS survey.</p>
<p>A series of multivariate logistic regression models were performed to explore the independent influence of survey mode (sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, health insurance status, health-care access, and self-rated health status)—while simultaneously controlling for all other sociodemographic characteristics—on respondents’ self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health-related advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication. Results of the multivariate logistic regression models are reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the predictor variable (i.e. survey mode).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sociodemographic characteristics of the sample overall and by survey mode are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312470125">Table 1</xref>. Overall, women accounted for more than half (51.4%) of the sample. There were no significant differences between RDD and mail respondents in regard to sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and health insurance status. However, education, household income, health-care access, and self-reported health did vary significantly between the two groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In today’s communication age, survey researchers are compelled to use multiple modalities to reach a truly representative sample of the population. It is therefore imperative to understand whether and how survey mode is associated with responses to specific types of questions. The purpose of this study was to compare adults’ self-reported understanding and formatting preferences of medical statistics, confidence in self-care and ability to obtain health advice or information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication measured through dual survey modes. These findings suggest that RDD participants responded more favorably to items tapping perceived health numeracy abilities, confidence regarding one’s ability to take good care of his/her health, and autonomy with health-care providers as compared to those completing the 2007 HINTS via mail. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312470125">Erinosho et al.’s (2011)</xref> analyses of the 2007 HINTS. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312470125">Erinosho et al. (2011)</xref> reported significant differences, while controlling simultaneously for potential confounding variables, in respondents’ self-reported fruit and vegetable intake as a function of survey mode.</p>
<p>The observed results could be the result of two survey mode–related mechanisms: differential response rates or differential responses. Consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312470125">Beebe et al., 2012</xref>), different population subgroups were captured in the two survey modes. The samples differed significantly on education, household income, and health insurance status. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that a mail survey reaches the same sociodemographic group as a phone survey. If differential response rate, by sociodemographic groups, was the primary driver of observed differences between mail and RDD responses, we would, however, expect response differences to be attenuated after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. This was not the case, suggesting that differential responses are occurring beyond the observed population differences.</p>
<p>An interesting question suggested by these results concerns the role of health literacy and how it may differentially associated with responses in different survey modes. For instance, completing a mail survey requires a certain level of both prose and document literacy. Respondents must be able to read and interpret the written word and navigate multiple pages with imbedded skip patterns. Limitations in prose and document literacy could lead to issues of questions being misinterpreted or skipped due to respondent burden. While a respondent does not have to read written information to complete a RDD survey, his/her oral and aural literacy skills may influence the way in which items are interpreted and ultimately answered. Additional research, randomizing respondents of varying health literacy levels to different survey modes, would be required to explore of these questions.</p>
<p>We also note that higher self-reported health-related numeracy and confidence regarding one’s ability to take good care of his/her health in the RDD sample may be a product of social desirability bias. Similarly, RDD respondents were more likely to report that their health-care provider “always” involved them in decisions about his/her health care as much as he/she wanted, made sure that he/she understood the things he/she needed to do to take care of his/her health, and helped him/her deal with feelings of uncertainty about his/her health or health care as compared to mail respondents. Respondents may have felt some discomfort or shame in telling an interviewer that they struggle with numeracy-related tasks, lack confidence in their ability to take care of their health, and/or have less perceived autonomy with their health-care providers leading them to be less forthcoming than when completing a paper questionnaire.</p>
<p>Our study findings should be considered within the context of several limitations. First, although the 2007 HINTS is representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population, the cross-sectional format limits causality. Second, as with all observational studies that rely on self-reports, response bias remains a possibility. Third, because of the nature of secondary analyses, we could not revise 2007 HINTS that pertained to the objectives of our particular study. Fourth, survey response options were collapsed into two groups to allow for multivariate logistic regression analyses to be performed. Therefore, it is unknown whether our results would have varied if a different statistical analytic strategy was employed. Finally, while this discussion considers factors including differential nonresponse bias, social desirability bias, and health literacy has potential mechanisms for the observed differential responses, the cross-sectional nature of this data source did not allow us to test or prove any underlying mechanism that would explain the association between survey mode and responses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, modal differences should be assessed and, when necessary, controlled statistically in any analyses where similar-type questions are employed. While the analyses do not allow us to pinpoint the underlying causes of the differences observed, they do suggest that mode of administration should be carefully adjusted for and considered. Perhaps, future studies should randomly select individuals for participation in either a mail or RDD survey to tease out whether unaccounted factors influence participant responses to certain self-reported statistical confidence, ability to obtain health information, and perceptions of patient–health-care provider communication.</p>
