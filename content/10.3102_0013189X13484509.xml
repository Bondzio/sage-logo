<p>In the historiography on curriculum reform during the progressive era, one interpretive lens has dominated the study of 20th-century reform for more than 40 years: the idea of the <italic>social efficiency</italic> doctrine. In this historiographical essay, the authors briefly trace the rise of social efficiency as an idea in curriculum history, identify the four common assertions on which it is based, review the recent studies that challenge these assertions, and finally, suggest some ways to rescue the term from overuse and abuse. The authors argue that, historically speaking, <italic>social efficiency</italic> was a widely used, poorly defined, highly problematic term that had multiple uses for multiple scholars between the 1890s and the 1930s. Historiographically speaking, the authors argue the idea of the social efficiency doctrine has been an inconsistent, heterogeneous, and imprecise lens through which to explain long-term curriculum change.</p>

<p>In the field of curriculum studies, one historiographical idea has dominated the research of 20th-century curriculum reform for more than 40 years: the pervasive influence of the <italic>social efficiency</italic> doctrine. This historiographical lens has had many manifestations in curriculum history and in the broader study of 20th-century educational reform, but in its most popular and potent form, it is based on four assertions. First, scholars argue that a group of early 20th-century curriculum theorists, including but not limited to Edward Thorndike, John Franklin Bobbitt, W. W. Charters, and David Snedden, were directly influenced by the scientific management techniques of Frederick W. Taylor. Second, these educators applied Taylor’s management techniques to curriculum design by forging a coherent and distinct social efficiency doctrine, which espoused that all curricular material needed to be directly tied to students’ perceived social worth and projected future occupations. The third assertion is that the social efficiency doctrine had a direct and pervasive influence on educational reports, textbooks, and teaching materials of the 1910s, 1920s, 1930s, and beyond. Finally, scholars argue that the social efficiency approach to curriculum design was the most influential and dominant one of the progressive educational reforms. Although few historians have drawn from all four assertions simultaneously, these ideas have appeared repeatedly in different combinations in the literature on early 20th-century curriculum reform. While these four assertions were problematic from the start, only recently have curriculum historians challenged each one directly. As result, the idea of social efficiency as both a historical phenomenon and a historiographical lens has become highly problematic. In this historiographical essay, the authors briefly trace the rise of the idea of social efficiency doctrine, reflect on some reasons for its popularity, review the recent studies that challenge it, and finally, suggest some ways to use the term with more accuracy and nuance.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013189X13484509">
<title>The Rise of the Social Efficiency Doctrine</title>
<p>The birth of social efficiency as a focus of historical inquiry can be traced to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13484509">Callahan’s (1962)</xref> <italic>Education and the Cult of Efficiency</italic>, in which the author detailed the influence of Frederick W. Taylor’s scientific methods of management on educational administration and, to some degree, curriculum. Callahan did not employ the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> in his study, and he merely mentioned figures such as Bobbitt, Snedden, and Charters in passing. Nevertheless, Callahan focused attention on the “more powerful forces at work than ‘progressive education’ in undermining the intellectual atmosphere of American schools” by outlining the pervasive application of scientific techniques to school management. (p. 263). Two years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X13484509">Haber’s (1964)</xref> influential study of progressive reform, <italic>Efficiency and Uplift: Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920</italic>, provided further evidence for the “rise of the efficiency craze” in American thought and practice during the early 20th century (p. ix). However, Haber barely addressed educational reform in his study, and in a footnote, he mentioned that he found Callahan’s study “not completely convincing” (p. 171). Callahan and Haber both drew attention to the pervasive use of term <italic>efficiency</italic> in the reform literature during the Progressive Era and pointed to its use by elites as a way to expand and rationalize their authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug’s (1964)</xref> <italic>The American High School</italic> first explicitly identified <italic>social efficiency</italic> as a distinct and coherent “doctrine” of curriculum design during the early 20th century that, according to Krug, “conquered all” (p. 276). Krug identified Snedden as the leader of the social efficiency doctrine in education and asserted that between 1905 and 1915, “every subject and every part of every subject had to meet the test of social usefulness or efficiency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug, 1964</xref>, p. 282). Furthermore, Krug argued that the social efficiency ideology exerted an enormous influence on the 1918 “Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education” (hereafter Cardinal Principles) report, one of the most significant documents of the period. Krug’s doctoral student, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13484509">Drost (1967)</xref> further developed the social efficiency thesis in his biography <italic>David Snedden and Education for Social Efficiency</italic>. Drost defined <italic>social efficiency</italic> as the “the position in education that calls for the direct teaching of knowledge, attitudes, and skills, intended to shape individuals to predetermined social characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13484509">Drost, 1967</xref>, p. 3). Although Bobbitt and Charters were also in the “social efficiency camp,” Drost argued that Snedden delineated “most boldly and . . . most forcefully an ever-present possibility in curriculum making, education for social efficiency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13484509">Drost, 1967</xref>, pp. 3–4). Drawing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X13484509">Haber (1964)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013189X13484509">Joncich’s (1968)</xref> biography of educational psychologist Edward Thorndike, <italic>The Sane Positivist</italic>, made explicit connections between his educational approach and Taylor’s scientific management, because “Taylorites and Thorndikeans [<italic>sic</italic>] seek precise measurements and analytic reduction of either bricklaying or learning to spell into all its calculable atoms of behavior” (p. 308). Thus, by the end of the 1960s, the pieces of the social efficiency doctrine were firmly in place, although its influence was still limited.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, the so-called radical revisionist historians, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013189X13484509">Spring (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X13484509">Katz (1975)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13484509">Karier (1973)</xref>, expanded the definition of <italic>social efficiency</italic> to one synonymous with social control. They argued that the 20th-century public school curriculum was a result of the metaphorical and literal manifestation of scientific management techniques, leading to a bureaucratic, racist, and inequitable educational system. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X13484509">Katz (1975)</xref>, progressive educational reforms, “operated as social sorting mechanisms supportive of existing social patterns and social inequalities” (pp. 122–123). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13484509">Karier (1973)</xref>, “by the 1920s . . . general education was organized and developed along lines of social efficiency and control” (p. 19). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013189X13484509">Spring (1973)</xref> argued that “the quest for social control turned the school into a custodial institution designed to maintain the social order” (p. 39). These critical accounts of progressive educational reform drew from a reassessment of the entire Progressive Era by historians such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013189X13484509">Kolko (1963)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013189X13484509">Hayes (1964)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X13484509">Wiebe (1967)</xref>, who portrayed the social and political reforms of the period as technocratic, conservative, and elitist. Collectively, these scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X13484509">Haber, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13484509">Karier, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X13484509">Katz, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013189X13484509">Kolko, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013189X13484509">Spring, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X13484509">Wiebe, 1967</xref>) depicted Progressive Era reformers as being more concerned with social control and efficiency than with social justice and uplift, signifying a paradigm shift in views on the expansion of public schooling. Although many historians ultimately rejected these radical interpretations as too excessive, this work solidified social efficiency as a major component of progressive reform, even among subsequent historians who took a more moderate approach.</p>
<p>Throughout the reassessment of Progressive Era reforms in the 1960s and 1970s, John Dewey’s ideas were considered a key component in the ascent of the social efficiency doctrine, because any convincing account of Progressive Era reform had to somehow account for his ideas. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X13484509">Wiebe (1967)</xref>, Dewey was an important catalyst in the social transformation from a face-to-face, local-oriented society to a more bureaucratic, corporate one. “Bureaucratic thought and pragmatism,” Wiebe argued, met only after Dewey had transformed pragmatism “into a theory that made individuals the plastic stuff of society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X13484509">Wiebe, 1967</xref>, p. 151). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13484509">Karier (1973)</xref> agreed that Dewey was implicit in the movement toward a more bureaucratic and corporate approach to social problems, arguing that “ideas, sentiments, and words become the force vehicles of social control in Dewey’s great community” (p. 102). However, subsequent historians were not comfortable aligning Dewey with the social efficiency doctrine, revealing the amorphous nature of the term. For example, in their popular postrevisionist textbook, <italic>Education in the United States</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X13484509">Church and Sedlak (1976)</xref> separated progressive educational reformers into two camps: “a smaller group we can call liberals and far greater group which we may identify as conservatives. The first group’s ultimate goal was social justice; the second’s, social order” (p. 255). Church and Sedlak aligned Dewey’s ideas with the liberal, social justice camp and Snedden’s idea with the conservative, social order camp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug (1964)</xref> had originally made a similar distinction by identifying Dewey’s version of social efficiency as “social service,” as opposed to the “social control” approach of Snedden (p. 255). Furthermore, in his classic study of the administrative consolidation of schools during the Progressive Era, <italic>The One Best System</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013189X13484509">Tyack (1974)</xref> separated Dewey from the administrative efficiency experts by identifying Dewey and his followers as “pedagogical progressives” and the subjects of his study as “administrative progressives” (pp. 196–197); Tyack reiterated this distinction a few years later in <italic>Managers of Virtue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013189X13484509">Tyack &amp; Hansot, 1982</xref>). Significantly, Tyack distinguished the structural-institutional reforms of educational administrators—which could be easily observed—from the pedagogical-curriculum reforms of Snedden and Dewey—which were much more difficult to determine and trace. Tyack’s distinction also avoided the conservative–liberal and social justice–social control dichotomies of Krug and of Church and Sedlak by instead choosing apolitical language. However, just as Tyack’s historiographical distinction was being made, a new generation of scholars specializing in curriculum studies largely adopted the conservative–liberal, social justice–social control dichotomies of earlier scholars.</p>
<p>Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013189X13484509">Sivertson (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013189X13484509">Lybarger (1983)</xref> explored the pervasiveness of the social efficiency doctrine in the history of social studies reform. As Lybarger argued, the impulse that drove the origins of the social studies was “not a democratic one. Rather it sought to legitimize social, economic, and political inequity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013189X13484509">Lybarger, 1983</xref>, p. 466). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13484509">Apple’s (1979)</xref> <italic>Ideology and Curriculum</italic> included a chapter coauthored with Franklin, in which they outlined the historical roots of the “ideological hegemony” of the American curriculum (p. 61). Apple and Franklin identified Bobbitt, Charters, and Snedden as “the curriculum field’s most important early members,” but Dewey’s role in progressive curriculum reform was glossed over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13484509">Apple, 1979</xref>, p. 68). The historiographic interest in social efficiency continued into the 1980s. In 1982, Rodgers identified social efficiency as one of three “languages” in his influential essay defining the ideological core of the Progressive movement, providing further support for its usefulness as an interpretive paradigm. The Rodgers essay influenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1995)</xref> to identify social efficiency advocates as one of four interest groups who competed for control of the American curriculum in the 20th century in his influential book, <italic>The Struggle for the American Curriculum</italic>, first published in 1987. Kliebard’s interest group framework temporarily solved the problem of how to fit significant progressive educational theorists, such as Dewey, Harold Rugg, and William Torrey Harris, into the broader movement to reform schools while not connecting these scholars with the alleged social efficiency advocates, such as Bobbitt, Charters, and Snedden. By portraying the American curriculum as a compromise among competing visions for U.S. schooling, including social efficiency doctrine, Kliebard absorbed some of the rhetoric of the radical revisionists but demonstrated that the social efficiency doctrine was only one strand among many. Nevertheless, Kliebard explicitly connected the approach of the social efficiency advocates to Taylorism and contrasted their approach with the ideas of Dewey, thus reinforcing the conservative–liberal, social justice–social control dichotomy.</p>
<p>Despite its heterogeneous nature, the pervasive use of the social efficiency doctrine continued into the 21st century as it was applied by a diverse group of historians. In <italic>Left Back</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch (2000)</xref> agreed with Krug and Kliebard that the 1918 Cardinal Principles report demonstrated that “social efficiency had become the reigning ideology of the education profession” (p. 123). Ravitch considered the Cardinal Principles report as a betrayal of Dewey’s vision for a democratic curriculum, but she also blamed Dewey for laying the ideological groundwork for the social efficiency doctrine that spawned the report because Dewey’s writings “encouraged those who thought that education could be made into a science”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch, 2000</xref>, p. 59). The overriding goal of the Cardinal Principles report, Ravitch argued, “was social efficiency, not the realization of individual desire for self-improvement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch, 2000</xref>, p. 125). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X13484509">Labaree (2010)</xref> identified social efficiency along with social mobility and democratic equality as one of three historic goals of American education (p. 16). While employing Tyack’s distinction between administrative and pedagogical progressives, Labaree nevertheless argued that “social efficiency carried the day during the progressive era and continued into the latter part of the century as a central theme in the politics of American education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X13484509">Labaree, 2010</xref>, p. 112). However, by tracing the ascendency of the sociopolitical uses of <italic>social efficiency</italic>, Labaree was careful to distinguish the rhetoric of social efficiency from the actual impact of the doctrine at the classroom level, which, he argues, was limited. Furthermore, in the only chapter on curriculum history in the recent collection <italic>Rethinking the History of American History</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X13484509">Franklin (2008)</xref> identified social efficiency as the most influential approach in the subfield. Franklin suggested that curriculum history itself almost emerged hand-in-hand with the <italic>social efficiency</italic> historiographical lens because it
<disp-quote>
<p>is not unusual for today’s curriculum scholars of a critical bent to trace the origins of a host of what they see as inegalitarian school practices to the penchant for social control that revisionist oriented curriculum historians attribute to many early twentieth-century educational leaders. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X13484509">Franklin, 2008</xref>, p. 228)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In one recent example of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X13484509">Au (2011)</xref>, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1995)</xref>, identified Taylorism as the “dominant” ideology in the early part of the 20th century, an approach, Au argues, that “has resurfaced 100 years later” (p. 25). Thus, the idea of the social efficiency doctrine continues to provide explanatory power for many scholars searching for the origins of the American curriculum (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X13484509">Doll, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X13484509">Pinar &amp; Reynolds, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X13484509">Pinar, Reynolds, Slattery, &amp; Taubman, 2006</xref>), despite the inconsistent conclusions about its definition, scope, and impact.</p>
<p>Although significant variations exist, four assertions in particular continue to be associated with the idea of the social efficiency doctrine. First, scholars argue that Bobbitt, Charters, Snedden, and Thorndike were directly influenced by the scientific management techniques of Taylor. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1995)</xref> explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>those educational leaders who forged the new [social efficiency] doctrine made no secret of the source of their ideas, self-consciously and conspicuously following the principles of Taylorism in the effort to make the curriculum a direct and potent force in the lives of future citizens. (p. 83)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X13484509">Doll (2002)</xref> reiterates, “Direct connections can be made between Taylor’s scientific management theories and the curriculum ideas of Franklin Bobbitt, [and] . . . W. W. Charters” (p. 35). Second, scholars argue that Thorndike, Snedden, Bobbitt, and Charters applied Taylor’s ideas to curriculum design by forging a coherent and distinct social efficiency doctrine characterized by the sorting of students into their projected future occupations and providing them with a corresponding differentiated curriculum. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X13484509">Pinar and Reynolds (1992)</xref> explain, “social-efficiency advocates narrate a story of curriculum as an assembly line, children as raw material, and graduates as marketable products” (p. 1). Third, the social efficiency doctrine—whether or not it was influenced by Taylor—is said to have had a direct influence on educational reports and materials in the 1910s, 1920s, and the 1930s. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug (1964)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X13484509">Herbst (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X13484509">Labaree (2010)</xref> directly identified the Cardinal Principles report as the representative document of the social efficiency doctrine, although Herbst identified both democracy and social efficiency as the most significant ideological influences on the report. In addition, popular textbooks on educational history drawing from this research reiterated that “social efficiency enthusiasts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013189X13484509">Reece, 2005</xref>, p. 200) and “social efficiency educators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013189X13484509">Urban &amp; Wagoner, 2000</xref>, p. 236) authored the Cardinal Principles report. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013189X13484509">Sivertson (1972)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013189X13484509">Lybarger (1983)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch (2000)</xref> identify the 1916 report of the Committee on Social Studies—the document that was part of the Cardinal Principles and commonly believed to have launched the field of social studies education—as reflecting a social efficiency ideology. Finally, scholars have argued that the social efficiency doctrine was the most influential and dominant idea of the progressive educational movement. Contrasting the social efficiency advocates with the more humane ideas of Dewey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1987)</xref> concludes that “figures like Snedden and Franklin Bobbitt . . . magisterially steered the course of American schooling. . . . Poor Dewey, I am afraid, always seemed to be pointing in the other way” (p. 141). As the idea of the social efficiency doctrine became the dominant paradigm through which to explain the history of the American curriculum, these four assumptions took on the guise of established fact. In different forms and combinations, these four assertions appeared uncritically in leading works of educational history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X13484509">Herbst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X13484509">Labaree, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013189X13484509">Reece, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013189X13484509">Urban &amp; Wagoner, 2000</xref>), curriculum history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13484509">Drost, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X13484509">Franklin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013189X13484509">Kliebard, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch, 2000</xref>), and curriculum theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13484509">Apple, 1979</xref>; Au, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X13484509">Doll, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X13484509">Pinar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X13484509">Pinar &amp; Reynolds, 1992</xref>). However, scholars applied the idea of social efficiency in such inconsistent and heterogeneous ways that its meaning had become unfocused and incoherent.</p>

<title>Social Efficiency as Historiographical Lens</title>
<p>There are many reasons for the rise, pervasiveness, and endurance of the social efficiency idea in the field of curriculum studies for nearly a half century. First, in the 1960s and 1970s, historians and social scientists launched an overall reassessment of the progressive reform movement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013189X13484509">Rodgers, 1982</xref>). A period that historians once identified with the extension of democracy and egalitarian reform was recast as a time of corporate consolidation, organizational revolution, and the imposition of middle-class values on immigrants, minorities, and the poor. The idea of the social efficiency doctrine drew from and reinforced this emerging new interpretation of the Progressive Era.</p>
<p>Second, in late 1960s, bottom-up accounts of urban schools by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013189X13484509">Hentoff (1966)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X13484509">Kozol (1967)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013189X13484509">Kohl (1970)</xref> depicted the inner-city curriculum as irrelevant, bureaucratic, and inflexible. Seeking to influence policy reform, curriculum historians sought provocative answers to complex issues surrounding the origins of current state of “crisis” in American education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X13484509">Karier, Violas, &amp; Spring, 1973</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013189X13484509">Tyack (1970)</xref> suggested in his review of the emerging revisionist literature, “while it has been traditional in America to see education as the <italic>answer</italic> to social problems, today many disfranchised groups regard the schools <italic>part of the social problem</italic>” (p. 28; emphasis in original). Thus, many educational scholars began to identify more with the marginalized students and parents who were frustrated with the rigidity of the bureaucratic system than they did with the educational elites who had created the system. As a result, the social efficiency doctrine provided a useful answer to what had allegedly gone wrong with inequitable American school system, especially in inner cities.</p>
<p>Third, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X13484509">Franklin (2008)</xref> argues, the field of curriculum history itself arose almost in concert with the social efficiency doctrine because the ideology captured the hegemonic and hidden curriculum on which the emerging field of curriculum studies was focusing its attention. The social efficiency doctrine not only offered a plausible explanation for the curriculum of the past, but it also offered a convincing lens through which to view the curriculum of the present, which had replaced its initial focus on the cultivation of civic virtue with an emphasis on the intellectual mobilization of manpower for the modern economy. Although Dewey continued to have his proponents and detractors in the field of curriculum studies, no scholars defended Bobbitt, Charters, and Snedden for what historians viewed as their excessive emphasis on preparation for the workplace. Consequently, curriculum historians cast these so-called conservatives as educational villains and reached a virtual consensus that these figures had betrayed the promise of a humane and democratic progressive education. Many scholars expanded the social efficiency doctrine to later figures and movements, such as Ralph Tyler, Charles Prosser, and life adjustment education.</p>
<p>Fourth, the social efficiency doctrine proved to be a remarkably malleable historiographical tool for scholars with diverse ideological outlooks. Marxists, libertarians, moderates, liberals, and neoliberal historians all found ways to employ the social efficiency doctrine in their narratives. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013189X13484509">Spring (1973)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X13484509">Katz (1975)</xref>, the social efficiency doctrine represented yet another instance of employing U.S. schools to impose social control on the poor. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X13484509">Ravitch (2000)</xref>, social efficiency educators were to blame for overturning the academic curriculum established by the Committee of Ten. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13484509">Callahan (1962)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard (1995)</xref>, social efficiency educators diverted progressive education away from the democratic ideas of John Dewey and Harold Rugg. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X13484509">Labaree (2010)</xref>, social efficiency became yet another objective hoisted unfairly on U.S. schools. Throughout this collective literature, the social efficiency doctrine was like a historiographical accordion that could be expanded to encompass the entire progressive education movement or could be compressed to refer only to the specific curriculum ideas of Snedden, Charters, and Bobbitt. Historians had employed the idea of social efficiency in so many ways to make so many divergent arguments about the direction and purpose of U.S. schooling that its definition had become amorphous, if not ambiguous.</p>
<p>Finally, and most significantly, there was substantial amount of historical evidence to support the existence of the social efficiency doctrine: Progressive educators did use the terms <italic>efficiency</italic> and <italic>social efficiency</italic> repeatedly throughout the early 20th century, administrative progressives did apply scientific management techniques to schools (although not necessarily curriculum), progressives did repeatedly espouse the social and biological inferiority of immigrants and the poor, and progressive educators repeatedly called for a more relevant and utilitarian curriculum. Despite this evidence, the idea of social efficiency has been applied too broadly and heterogeneously. As a result, the social efficiency doctrine has been problematic both as a coherent historical phenomenon and as historiographical lens through which to view the educational reforms of the Progressive Era and beyond.</p>

<sec id="section3-0013189X13484509">
<title>Problems With Social Efficiency</title>
<p>The term <italic>social efficiency</italic> was complex and heterogeneous from the beginning. In his influential study of progressive reform, <italic>Efficiency and Uplift</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X13484509">Haber (1964)</xref> identified four definitions of <italic>social efficiency</italic> used during the period: personal effectiveness, the output-input ratio of a machine, the output-input ratio of dollars, and “social harmony and leadership of the competent” (pp. ix-x). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug (1964)</xref> suggested that the term had two possible meanings for educators, social control and social service, although those who cited Krug tended to focus exclusively on the social control definition. Citing Haber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013189X13484509">Joncich (1968)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013189X13484509">O’Neill (1975)</xref> recognized multiple definitions of <italic>social efficiency</italic>, but nevertheless, both historians linked the term narrowly to the technocratic ideas of Taylor. As early as 1982, Franklin began to question the pervasiveness and simplicity of the social efficiency doctrine. But rather than overturn it, Franklin sought to determine to what degree the ideology actually affected local curriculum and to what degree it reproduced social inequalities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X13484509">Franklin’s (1982)</xref> study drew from local data in Minneapolis to demonstrate that the real changes to curriculum came much later than previously thought. Franklin’s case study also demonstrated how it was middle-class parents who resisted and ultimately overturned the social efficiency reforms, complicating the idea that the social efficiency doctrine represented the imposition of middle-class values on the poor. However, in the past decade and a half, scholars such as Fallace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13484509">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X13484509">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X13484509">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X13484509">2011b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X13484509">Knoll (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X13484509">Null (2004)</xref>, and Wraga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013189X13484509">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013189X13484509">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013189X13484509">2007</xref>) revealed additional problems with the idea of social efficiency.</p>
<p>First, the direct or even indirect influence of Taylor’s management techniques on curriculum design has been questioned. On the basis of his research tracing the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> among educators from 1894 to the 1920s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X13484509">Knoll (2009)</xref> concluded, “Frederick Taylor’s bestseller the <italic>Principles of Scientific Management</italic> . . . had no identifiable influence on the discourse about the ends of education and the social mission of the school” (p. 376). A search through the major works of the so-called social efficiency advocates by the authors confirms that Taylor was not cited as an influence. For example, Taylor was not cited a single time in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X13484509">W. W. Charters’ (1923)</xref> <italic>Curriculum Construction</italic> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013189X13484509">Thorndike’s (1905)</xref> <italic>Elements of Psychology</italic>. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013189X13484509">Snedden (1921)</xref> does not cite Taylor in his text <italic>Sociological Determination of Objectives in Education</italic>. Despite his application of the factory metaphor to education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13484509">Bobbitt (1918)</xref> cited Taylor in only one instance in <italic>The Curriculum</italic>, in which he directly critiqued the Taylor system for its top-down style of management. As Bobbitt explained, “The relative failure of the Taylor system seems to result from insufficient attempt to enlist the intelligence and initiative of the men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13484509">Bobbitt, 1918</xref>, p. 84). This evidence contradicts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard’s (1995)</xref> assertion that “Taylor’s ideas . . . ultimately provided the language and hence the conceptual apparatus by which a new a powerful approach to curriculum development would be wrought” (p. 83). Although Taylor may have had a direct influence on school administration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13484509">Callahan, 1962</xref>), his impact on curriculum—even among the so-called social efficiency advocates— has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Second, the idea that social efficiency constituted a coherent doctrine, even among curriculum theorists, is highly problematic. In his historical study of uses of the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> by progressive educators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X13484509">Null (2004)</xref> identified three consistent uses, each with divergent meanings. Null argued that progressive scholars such as William Bagley and Michael Vincent O’Shea used the term to connote that “individuals should learn so that they could contribute to the improvement of society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X13484509">Null, 2004</xref>, p. 123). Scholars such as Dewey—who devoted an entire chapter to the term in <italic>Democracy and Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X13484509">Dewey, 1916/1997</xref>)—used the term to connate the idea that “a socially efficient society was a society that released human potential for the good of society, but did not dissolve individual aims and desires” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X13484509">Null, 2004</xref>, p. 123). Scholars such as Snedden and Bobbitt used the term to connote “training for adult occupations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X13484509">Null, 2004</xref>, p. 123). In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X13484509">Knoll (2009)</xref> traced the origins of the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> to British scholar Benjamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013189X13484509">Kidd’s (1894)</xref> <italic>Social Evolution</italic>, not William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X13484509">Bagley’s (1905)</xref> <italic>The Educative Process</italic> as had previously been asserted by Krug. According to Knoll, “social efficiency as an integral, self-contained concept began its career not in the US but in the UK, . . . and it was imbued with democratic values and humanitarian ideals even before it became part of the educational discourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X13484509">Knoll, 2009</xref>, p. 363). Significantly, Knoll demonstrated how the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> predated the introduction of the Taylor scientific management system. Like Null, Knoll also traced multiple, conflicting uses of the term, concluding that
<disp-quote>
<p>efficiency, or social efficiency, is not <italic>per se</italic> anti-democratic, anti-liberal, anti-humanistic, or anti- social. On the contrary, for most educators of the progressive era, efficiency was the prerequisite for the realization of the “common good” the “just society” and the “worthy life.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X13484509">Knoll, 2009</xref>, p. 382)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a study that traced the uses of Dewey’s ideas in the educational discourse between the years 1903 and 1951, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X13484509">Fallace (2011b)</xref> discovered that Dewey’s work was “used to support reform agendas aimed at social control, social adjustment, social reconstruction, and social justice” (p. 488). In fact, progressive educator reformers often cited <italic>both</italic> social control and social justice as educational outcomes. For example, Fallace demonstrated how Harold Rugg’s ambitious project to reform the school curriculum was grounded in a theoretical framework that drew equally from Thorndike and Dewey; in other words, Rugg did not recognize major distinctions between Dewey’s allegedly liberal, social justice–oriented approach and Thorndike’s allegedly conservative, social efficiency approach. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> appeared in much of the literature on progressive education, but its use was so imprecise, shifting, and, at times, contradictory that it could not be aligned with a specific doctrine.</p>
<p>The third assertion, that the social efficiency doctrine had a direct influence on educational reports and materials in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s has been challenged as well. Scholars do not question the pervasive use of the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> by educational and social reformers. However, this new scholarship challenges the tendency to reduce the complex ideologies of progressive education to a single doctrine, which can then be applied to lengthy, multidimensional reform documents. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013189X13484509">Wraga (2001)</xref> questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug’s (1964)</xref> assumption that the Cardinal Principles report was guided by the ideologies of anti-intellectualism and social control. On the basis of archival research and his close reading of the Cardinal Principles report, Wraga concludes that “progressive, even Deweyan principles far outweigh language that smacks of narrow social control ideology” (Wraga, 2011, p. 517). Wraga also directly challenged Krug’s assertion that Snedden’s former student, Clarence Kingsley, was the major influence on the Cardinal Principles report. Instead, Wraga argued, Alexander Inglis, author of <italic>Principles of Secondary Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X13484509">Inglis, 1918</xref>), was the primary influence on the document. The ideas expressed in Inglis’s book did not necessarily align with the social efficiency doctrine. In fact, in a later biographical study, Wraga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013189X13484509">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013189X13484509">2007</xref>) demonstrated how during Inglis’s career, he drew from numerous influences and participated in a variety of professional activities, some of which could be aligned with social efficiency doctrine (e.g., conducing educational surveys) but much of which could not (e.g., teaching Latin). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X13484509">Fallace (2009)</xref> questioned the alleged influence of the social efficiency doctrine on the 1916 Committee on Social Studies report. Although the report identified social efficiency as the main purpose of education, it also employed the phrase “needs of present growth”—a phrase borrowed from Dewey<italic>—</italic>nearly two dozen times, more than the term <italic>efficiency</italic>. Fallace concluded that “the members of the Committee agreed upon a core of shared beliefs that reflected [Dewey’s] philosophical ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X13484509">Fallace, 2009</xref>, p. 601). Therefore, Dewey’s influence was much greater on the Cardinal Principles and Committee on Social Studies report than historians had previously recognized. A closer consideration of the context and authors of these major documents demonstrate that the use of the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> has been applied too narrowly and too simplistically. Although both reports had direct connections with Snedden and were to some degree influenced by the idea of social efficiency, there were other significant ideological influences on these documents as well.</p>
<p>Finally, that assertion that the social efficiency doctrine was the most influential and dominant one of the progressive educational movement is the most difficult to prove or disprove. Knowledge of local curriculum and classroom practice is notoriously hard to access, and important studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X13484509">Cuban (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013189X13484509">Zilversmit (1993)</xref> have demonstrated the resiliency of the teacher- and textbook-directed pedagogy, despite meaningful efforts to reform it. Nevertheless, recent research assessing course enrollments, course offerings, and local and state curriculum guides has complicated the simplistic picture of “social efficiency triumphant” outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X13484509">Krug (1964</xref>, p. 249). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13484509">Angus and Mirel (1995)</xref> studied changing course enrollments on the basis of available statistical survey data. They discovered that American students did enroll in fewer academic classes during the course of the 20th century, but these changes were gradual and seemingly disconnected from the educational rhetoric, including the ascendance of social efficiency. Angus and Mirel argue that “high school curriculum changes were more rapid during the Depression than any other period before or since” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13484509">Angus &amp; Mirel, 1995</xref>, p. 303). They attribute the curriculum reform in the 1930s to increasing student enrollments as a result of the dismal job market, not to the social efficiency doctrine. In a subsequent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13484509">Angus and Mirel (1999)</xref> reiterated that in the years prior to the Great Depression, “the overwhelming proportion of high school courses taken by most students were in the traditional academic fields” (p. 53). Although progressive educators offered a more utilitarian curriculum to students and their parents in the 1920s and 1930s, “the great majority [of students] did not flock to vocational training” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13484509">Angus &amp; Mirel, 1999</xref>, p. 53). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13484509">Fallace (2008)</xref> looked at national and local survey data to challenge the idea that the “straight” history curriculum was allegedly displaced by social efficiency–inspired social studies courses. He found that classes in chronological history constituted the majority of the course offerings and student enrollments throughout the first half of the 20th century, not the interdisciplinary social studies classes commonly aligned with social efficiency doctrine. Thus, the impact of the social efficiency doctrine on actual classrooms was not as great as had been assumed. In another study on progressive rhetoric, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X13484509">Fallace (2011b)</xref> explored the uses of Dewey’s ideas in local and state curriculum guides between the years 1903 and 1951. He found that it was common for local curriculum designers to cite Dewey’s major texts, such as <italic>Democracy and Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X13484509">Dewey, 1916/1997</xref>) and <italic>How We Think</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X13484509">Dewey, 1910/1997</xref>), in support of critical thinking and the social function of schooling, but they also employed the objective-driven outcomes approach of alleged social efficiency advocate Ralph Tyler. Fallace confirmed that “divisions between proponents of social justice and social efficiency were not necessarily apparent to Dewey’s contemporaries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X13484509">Fallace, 2011b</xref>, p. 472). Overall, the impact of the social efficiency doctrine—if it ever even existed in any coherent ideological form—did not make a clear, consistent, or sustained impact on the educational discourse, course offerings, student enrollments, and classroom practices at the local level.</p>
<p>In summary, the scientific management techniques of Taylor were not cited as an influence by the leading social efficiency curriculum theorists; social efficiency did not represent a coherent ideology constituting a “doctrine,” nor was the term used in a consistent manner by progressive educational reformers; arguments about the impact of the social efficiency doctrine on the influential documents of the Progressive Era, such as the Cardinal Principles and Committee on Social Studies reports, have been too simplistic; and the pervasive impact of the social efficiency ideology on course offerings, student enrollments, and local and state curriculum guides has been overstated.</p>
<p>Generally, the overapplication of the social efficiency doctrine as a historiographical lens rested on four methodological shortcomings. First, scholars have been excessively deductive in identifying broad influences in the secondary literature on progressive ideology, urban reform, administrative consolidation, and bureaucratic expansion and then applying them to the history of the curriculum without establishing direct lines of evidence. Specifically, scholars of the social efficiency doctrine have conflated administrative and curriculum reforms by imposing ideas that appeared in the former on the latter. Second, scholars have deprived teachers, parents, and local authorities of agency by casting them as passive victims of the ideological dictates of the elites, when in fact they exerted considerable power by either enrolling or not enrolling in offered courses or by adopting or not adopting suggested curriculum reforms at the local level. Third, Dewey’s role and influence in progressive education has not been convincingly reconciled with the alleged pervasiveness of the social efficiency doctrine. Writing in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X13484509">1915</xref> during the supposed high tide of social efficiency, progressive educator William Bagley declared, “Contemporary educational theory in America is dominated by America’s foremost philosopher—John Dewey” (p. 3). Although Bagley is likely exaggerating, his estimation demonstrates clearly that Dewey’s ideas were not completely overturned or displaced by social efficiency advocates. In fact, many well-known historical studies have argued that Dewey’s ideas were the <italic>most</italic> influential on the progressive education movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X13484509">Cremin, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X13484509">Egan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X13484509">Hirsch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013189X13484509">Hofstadter, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013189X13484509">Zilversmit, 1993</xref>), and other historians have depicted Dewey as being implicit in social efficiency and social control ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13484509">Karier, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X13484509">Wiebe, 1967</xref>). Fourth, with rare exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X13484509">Franklin, 1982</xref>), scholars have failed to trace the influence of the social efficiency doctrine on local curriculum and teaching materials. When local ideas and curricula are examined, it is clear that social efficiency was one of many ideas being employed, often in contradictory ways.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Clarifying Social Efficiency</title>
<p>If historians and curriculum theorists continue to employ the idea of the social efficiency doctrine, we suggest that they deepen and broaden its meaning as a historical phenomenon but, paradoxically, narrow and limit its use as a historiographical lens. First, broadly speaking, if 20th-century schooling in the United States shifted away from the 19th-century political concerns for civic virtue and intellectual nourishment toward the creation of an internationally competitive workforce, then indeed the curriculum has become more “conservative.” However, it is not clear that this long-term trajectory can be linked to the ideas of three or four social efficiency theorists, such as Bobbitt, Charters, Snedden, and Thorndike, especially when one considers that testing, tracking, and vocational education all existed prior to the Progressive Era (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X13484509">Herbst, 1996</xref>) and that subsequent developments, such as life adjustment education, the ideas of Ralph Tyler, <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic>, and No Child Left Behind, did not employ the term social efficiency. Instead of projecting the term <italic>social efficiency</italic>, which fell out of use by the 1930s, onto the remainder of the 20th century, scholars need to develop more nuanced language for discussing the shift toward the mobilization of schools for international competition and cultivation of the workforce. Perhaps, <italic>curriculum utilitarianism</italic> or even <italic>curriculum efficiency</italic> are preferable terms to depict these long-term developments, because these terms are not affiliated with a specific period of time.</p>
<p>Second, Taylorism may not be a useful lenses through which to view the rise of scientific curriculum making that has been affiliated with social efficiency, because influential “essentialist” thinkers, such as William Bagley, and Dewey-inspired thinkers, such as Harold Rugg and Carleton Washburne, all engaged in the quantitative, scientific study of curriculum early in their careers, yet these figures espoused divergent visions for the American curriculum (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X13484509">Kliebard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013189X13484509">Zilversmit, 1993</xref>). The application of statistical approaches to curriculum and the use of the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> were so widespread in the 1910s and 1920s that these activities tell one very little about the period. Much like the widespread use of the term <italic>diversity</italic> today, it was not a matter of whether or what reformers believed in <italic>social efficiency</italic> but rather how and why <italic>all</italic> reformers believed in some form of social efficiency. Therefore, scholars must begin with the assumption that there was no distinct clique of social efficiency educators who formulated and implemented a coherent doctrine; rather, almost everyone during the period was a social efficiency educator to some degree and in some way.</p>
<p>Third, scholars should consider that the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> not only had a technocratic element, but it also had an evolutionary and biological component as well—the belief that the mind of the human race had become more biologically and socially adept than its ancestors had been. The term <italic>social efficiency</italic> originated in a book about social evolution, Thorndike began his career as a comparative and genetic psychologist studying the origins of human intelligence, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13484509">Bobbitt (1918)</xref> began his classic, <italic>The Curriculum</italic>, not with an overview of the ideas of Taylor but, rather, with a brief history of the “evolution of our social order” (p. iii). Exploring the application of biological and evolutionary models of behavior to social efficiency will historicize the term, making it less applicable to earlier and later developments in curriculum, but it may also capture the sprit of the times more accurately than simply reducing the zeitgeist to Taylorism.</p>
<p>Finally, the idea of social efficiency needs to be reconciled with the studies of race and racial theory during the period (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X13484509">Barkan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X13484509">Cravens, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013189X13484509">Gossett, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X13484509">Jacobson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013189X13484509">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013189X13484509">McKee, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013189X13484509">Richards, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013189X13484509">Schafer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013189X13484509">Stocking, 1968</xref>). Recent studies on educational reform in the Progressive Era have focused more on race than class as a salient feature of the time, and this work has largely avoided using social efficiency as an interpretive lens (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X13484509">Alridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X13484509">Burkholder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X13484509">Fallace, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X13484509">Goodchild, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013189X13484509">Mirel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013189X13484509">Olneck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013189X13484509">Selig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013189X13484509">Weiner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0013189X13484509">Zimmerman, 2002</xref>). However, by contextualizing the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> within its relationship to evolving racial theory, pragmatism, and the multiple strands of progressive education, the term will, again, become historicized, but it will also broaden understanding of how progressive reformers employed different manifestations of the idea.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we argue that using the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> in a more nuanced and accurate way will likely make the term less of a catchall for the idea of vocational education broadly conceived, but it will rescue the term from the overuse and abuse it is now experiencing. Historically speaking, <italic>social efficiency</italic> was a widely used, poorly defined, highly problematic term that had multiple uses for multiple scholars between the years 1890s and the 1930s. Historiographically speaking, the idea of the social efficiency doctrine has been an inconsistent, heterogeneous, and imprecise lens through which to explain long-term curricular change. In both cases, the term <italic>social efficiency</italic> in its present form obscures as much as it reveals.</p>
