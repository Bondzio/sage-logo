<abstract>
<p>We study the extent to which the characteristics of universities and technology transfer offices located within different regional contexts affect the transfer of scientific knowledge, both in the form of licensing and spin-off firm creation. By using data from Spain for the period 2005 to 2008, we show that technology transfer offices with more experienced and expert staff teams and universities with clearly established rules for creating academic startups and with higher patenting records are more likely to obtain better university technology transfer results (i.e., licensing and spin-off firm outcomes). Although the effects of R&amp;D investment and venture capital available in the local region were not significant, the (subnational) regional context seemed to matter for explaining the variation in academic spin-off and licensing outcomes across universities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past three decades, academic entrepreneurship—defined as the commercialization of knowledge stemming from university research—has played an important role in fostering regional economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412471847">Acs, Audretsch, &amp; Feldman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471847">Audretsch &amp; Feldman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412471847">Audretsch &amp; Lehmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412471847">Audretsch, Lehmann, &amp; Warning, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412471847">Fini, Grimaldi, Santoni, &amp; Sobrero, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471847">Grimaldi, Kenney, Siegel, &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412471847">Hegde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412471847">Lendel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891242412471847">Steinnes, 1987</xref>). Encouraged by the rise of scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations, universities around the world have become increasingly involved in the transfer of knowledge to the marketplace, thereby enhancing economic growth and regional competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412471847">Shane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242412471847">Wright, Clarysse, Mustar, &amp; Lockett, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Academic knowledge is transferred through several mechanisms, such as licensing of intellectual property (patents, know-how, trade secrets, etc.), university-based startups, research joint ventures, university–industry collaborative research, contract research, and consulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471847">Grimaldi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242412471847">Phan &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>). Licensing agreements between universities and private firms have been historically the most important channel for the commercialization of university-based intellectual property. Yet, in the past two decades, the creation of new ventures started by university scientists has become instrumental in the transfer of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412471847">Feldman, Feller, Bercovitz, &amp; Burton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412471847">Shane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412471847">Siegel, Veugelers, &amp; Wright, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although both licensing of intellectual property and spin-off creation are key contributors to the creation of new technology-based firms, they are not always equally suitable to align the incentives of universities, industry, and faculty in the quest for knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412471847">Feldman et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A key facilitator in the process of commercialization of scientific knowledge, both through licensing and spin-off-creation, is the technology transfer office (TTO) that assists universities in the commercialization of scientific research by assessing the commercial viability of new technologies, managing and protecting intellectual property, fostering research partnerships with the business sector, and supporting the creation of university spin-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, Atwater, &amp; Link, 2003</xref>). The remarkable influence of TTOs on the process of technology transfer has been noted recently through several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891242412471847">Mowery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242412471847">Shane, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242412471847">Siegel &amp; Phan, 2005</xref>). Another important factor is the regional context in which the university-based innovation takes place (i.e., R&amp;D activities of local firms, the existence of local networks of innovation, regionally based innovation policies, community of angels investors and availability of venture capital, etc.), which has been found not only to influence but also to interact with the transfer of new knowledge into valuable commercial usages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412471847">Fini et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The present article deals with the study of three main factors (namely the TTO, the university, and the subnational regional context) to identify the determinants of the creation of academic spin-offs and the licensing of new technology. Building on previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412471847">Clarysse, Wright, Lockett, Van de Velde, &amp; Vohora, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>), we examine the concomitant impact of resources operating at these three levels on both spin-off creation and the licensing of new technologies.</p>
<p>We contribute to the literature in two ways. First, since little is known on this phenomenon in an academically and economically “developing” (rather than “advanced”) context, we conduct our study in a country (Spain) that lags behind in terms of R&amp;D investment and in the capacity of yielding returns from innovation-driven economic activities. Clearly, Spain lacks the tradition of the United States and other European countries for commercializing the knowledge generated in academic institutions (TTO and university institutions). Hence, it is interesting to test whether conclusions and findings obtained in studies conducted in more advanced economies also hold in (academically and economically) less developed environments. Second, we aim at capturing the effect of the heterogeneity of regional (subnational) contexts embedded within a country. More specifically, we complement the widely investigated institutional view (i.e., university/TTO framework) with an unconventional contextual view (i.e., subnational regional framework) to identify more accurately the determinants of university technology transfer.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In the following section we examine the determinants of university technology transfer. Next, we describe the data and methods used for our empirical study. After discussing the main results, we conclude with final comments and policy implications.</p>

<title>Determinants of University Technology Transfer</title>
<sec id="section3-0891242412471847">
<title>Resources of Technology Transfer Offices</title>
<p>TTOs manage and protect the university intellectual property. This involves evaluating the technological and commercial feasibility of the inventions disclosed to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891242412471847">Vohora, Wright, &amp; Lockett, 2004</xref>). To accomplish these tasks, TTOs need qualified personnel with specific expertise, knowledge, and skills. The role of professional staff is particularly critical in the case of the creation of spin-offs, as university researchers usually do not have the necessary skills to bring their inventions to the market or, for that matter, to spot new opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891242412471847">Lockett, Wright, &amp; Franklin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242412471847">Markman, Gianiodis, Phan, &amp; Balkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, &amp; Link, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, Atwater, &amp; Link, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies link the resources and capabilities of TTOs to the commercialization of innovation-driven activities by looking at the team composition of TTOs (in the form of both total staff and specialized staff), its capabilities (namely, its coordination and information processing capacity), its structure (its degree of autonomy), its system of incentives (the rewards to involvement in new venture creation), and the extent of collaboration with industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412471847">Feldman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242412471847">Markman, Gianiodis, et al., 2005</xref>). The vast majority of these studies find a positive relationship between the resources of TTOs and the propensity of faculty to commercialize their research work. For these reasons, we expect the presence of professional staff of TTOs, and in particular their human-capital characteristics, to be conducive to the transfer of technology. Indeed, the experience accumulated by the TTO team is the result of a process subject to path dependencies and historical trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412471847">Arthur, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412471847">2009</xref>). The success achieved in technology transfer along this historical path has been proved to be a key explanatory factor of start-up formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891242412471847">O’Shea, Allen, Chevalier, &amp; Roche, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0891242412471847">
<title>Resources of Universities</title>
<p>Past studies show that university-related resources also matter. For instance, the technological infrastructure provided by the university, quality of its faculty, and networks developed with industry and other academic partners seem to be critical for channeling new technologies to the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471847">Cohen, Nelson, &amp; Walsh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412471847">Rothaermel, Agung, &amp; Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891242412471847">Thursby &amp; Kemp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242412471847">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). Undoubtedly, universities differ in their capacity and involvement in technology transfer activities at least in three ways. First, a key resource into the whole process of technology transfer is the stock of technological knowledge embedded in a university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412471847">Arrow, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412471847">Arthur, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891242412471847">Nelson, 1959</xref>). Knowledge is mostly generated by research faculty at universities and spills over the economy under appropriate conditions concerning the geographical distance and the absorptive capacity of existing organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412471847">Acs et al., 1992</xref>). The knowledge emanating from university research reaches existing firms in the form of patents, know-how, and other forms of technology transfer. Interestingly, innovation-driven entrepreneurial activities often tend to concentrate in regions with a strong knowledge base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471847">Audretsch &amp; Feldman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the existence within a university of an appropriate regulatory framework guaranteeing the disclosure of inventions is fundamental to encourage technology transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412471847">Bercovitz, Feldman, Feller, &amp; Burton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412471847">Geuna &amp; Rossi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412471847">Kenney &amp; Patton, 2011</xref>). From an institutional perspective, we expect the existence of a system of norms regulating licensing and spin-off activity to be of great importance for academic entrepreneurship. Scientists at universities are primarily motivated by the academic recognition within their communities and have usually scant interest in commercializing their output. The choice of starting a career as an entrepreneur involves considerable risk and a costly downside. In this respect, licensing offers a less risky strategy, since the commercialization of the research output does not conflict that much with the academic career.</p>
<p>Empirical studies show that the passage of the legislation regulating the ownership of intellectual property has proved crucial for the emergence of academic entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242412471847">Phan &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412471847">Rothaermel et al., 2007</xref>). By giving the universities the rights to exploit their research, it encouraged them to engage in commercialization activities. Thus, the number of spin-off companies has been found to be positively associated with the expenditure on intellectual property protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>). Although the existence of regulations concerning intellectual property contribute to licensing, regulations ruling the spin-off creation foster new venture creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, Atwater, et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the infrastructure for innovation and technology transfer of the university includes, in some instances, business incubators and science parks. The mission of business incubators is to assist and promote the creation of new firms through technical and financial support and through a network of valuable links to the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412471847">Clarysse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412471847">R. Jensen &amp; Thursby, 2001</xref>). Business incubators also enable an exchange of knowledge between the entrepreneur and university researchers during product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>). Likewise, science parks are an important element leading to the creation of new technologies and their orientation toward commercially viable products and services. The existence of science parks and business incubators has been found to exert a positive impact on spin-off creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242412471847">Link &amp; Scott, 2003</xref>).</p>
<list id="list2-0891242412471847" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The knowledge accumulated within a university (i.e., patents), the existence of rules governing intellectual property rights (i.e., licensing and university spin-off norms), and the university endowment of infrastructure (i.e., business incubation and science parks) are positively associated with technology transfer activities (i.e., both licensing and spin-off activity).</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0891242412471847">
<title>Resources of Regions</title>
<p>The innovation and entrepreneurial capabilities vary across regions within a country. The strengths of a regional innovation system are its favorable intellectual property scheme, strong local links between university and industry, strong relationship between large companies and new firms, immediate availability of venture capital and business angels, and supportive local government policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242412471847">Wright et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study states that regional innovation systems are designed differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412471847">Rothaermel et al., 2007</xref>) and this may explain why certain regions obtain distinctive technology transfer results. In addition to these institutional factors, regional differences in social norms, entrepreneurial culture, and interfirm collaborative behavior have been also postulated to affect technology transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, &amp; Link, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242412471847">Siegel, Waldman, Atwater, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242412471847">Siegel et al., 2004</xref>). Our conjecture is that all the aforementioned intangible regional assets determine the knowledge base embedded within a region.</p>
<p>High uncertainty and strong information asymmetries prevent high-tech firms from acquiring financial resources through conventional channels. Therefore, they are highly dependent on the availability of formal and informal risk capital investors who provide not only financial resources but also experience and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891242412471847">Shane &amp; Stuart, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio and Shane (2003)</xref> show that venture capitalists are increasingly investing in ventures relying on basic research motivated by superior (yet riskier) expected performance. To mitigate moral hazard problems, venture capital and business angel investors focus mostly on personal interaction, thereby acting within the confines of their regions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett and Wright (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891242412471847">Wright et al. (2006)</xref> found evidence for a positive impact of venture capital on spin-off activity. The above-mentioned reasons lead us to formulate our last hypothesis.</p>
<list id="list3-0891242412471847" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The innovation potential (i.e., R&amp;D investment per firm) and funding availability for start-ups (i.e., venture capital investment per firm of a region) in the subnational region where the university is located are positively associated with university technology transfer activities (i.e., both licensing and spin-off activity).</p></list-item></list>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891242412471847">Figure 1</xref>, we aim at testing the effect of each of the three levels of resources (i.e., TTO team, university, and regional context) on academic licensing and spin-off activity.</p>

<title>Data and Methodology</title>
<p>In this section, we describe the data, variables, and estimation methods applied to test our hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section7-0891242412471847">
<title>Database</title>
<p>Most data used in the present study come from the Annual Survey on Knowledge and Technology Transfer conducted by the Spanish Network of University Knowledge Transfer Offices (RedOTRI by its Spanish acronym). This survey is administered on a yearly basis to all members of the network, which not only include public and private universities but also public research institutes and hospitals. Since our research interest is focused on university technology transfer, the sample selected for the analysis is made up of only universities. The number of universities belonging to RedOTRI comprises more than 85% of the total number of universities in Spain. Hence, the RedOTRI’s annual survey sufficiently covers the population under study, which makes it the most comprehensive source of information on technology transfer from universities in Spain. In particular, it collects information on intellectual property protection, licensing, funding, and spin-off creation, as well as other relevant information about universities and their TTOs. Furthermore, its design is aligned with that of the annual survey carried out by the European Knowledge Transfer Association (ProTon-Europe).</p>
<p>We assembled a data set that contains pooled cross-sectional data from the RedOTRI’s annual survey corresponding to years 2005 to 2008. These data were complemented with information on the availability of venture capital at the regional level from the Spanish Venture Capital Association (ASCRI by its Spanish acronym), as well as regional information on the stock of technological knowledge that was estimated using data provided by the Spanish Institute of Statistics (INE by its Spanish acronym).</p>
<p>Since some universities did not respond to all questionnaires from the RedOTRI’s annual survey during the period of analysis (2005-2008), the data set is an unbalanced panel of 62 universities over an average period of 3.5 years, with a minimum of 1-year observation and a maximum of 4-year observations per university, respectively. This yields an overall sample of 216 university-year observations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412471847">1</xref></sup> Universities included in our sample represent 48 of the 50 public universities and 14 of the 24 private universities existing in Spain in 2008. Therefore, we are confident about the representativeness of our sample.</p>

<sec id="section8-0891242412471847">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The knowledge created in universities has been commonly commercialized through two main ways, namely spin-offs creation and licensing agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242412471847">Macho-Stadler &amp; Pérez-Castrillo, 2010</xref>); accordingly, we employ measures for both of them to capture the activity of technology transfer carried out by Spanish universities.</p>
<sec id="section9-0891242412471847">
<title>Number of spin-offs</title>
<p>As in previous studies, we use the count of the total number of spin-offs created in a given year by a university TTO in order to measure technology transfer via spin-off activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412471847">R. A. Jensen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>). For the purpose of this article, university spin-offs are defined as newly created ventures that are founded to commercialize knowledge or technology produced in an academic institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412471847">Shane, 2004</xref>). These new ventures are often, but not always, started by or with the involvement of members of the university that own the intellectual property rights of the underlying technology. Accordingly, this definition does not include new ventures that are not dependent upon assignment or licensing technology from universities, even if founded by university researchers or graduates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0891242412471847">
<title>Number of licensing agreements</title>
<p>Technology transfer via licensing agreements is measured by the count of the total number of licensing agreements signed with third-party firms in a given year through a university TTO. Licensing agreements are contracts that grant someone permission to use, exploit, or modify knowledge or technology, which, in the case of the present study, has been produced by an academic institution. The terms under which licensing agreements grant permission are different for each case, but in general they assign limited-use rights excluding ownership of intellectual property. Apart from private firms with no close ties with the university, spin-offs usually rely on licensing agreements that enable them to commercialize university-based technologies. We analyze licenses, however, granted only to third-party firms and not those granted to university spin-offs, because the latter are being considered in the study of technology transfer via spin-offs.</p>
<p>Date for both the number of spin-offs and the number of license agreements are based on the information reported by university TTOs in the RedOTRI’s annual survey.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-0891242412471847">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>We distinguish three sets of explanatory variables: variables related to TTO characteristics, university characteristics, and regional characteristics.</p>
<p>We assess the profile of the team of TTOs by using the number of <italic>total staff</italic> and <italic>professional staff</italic>. The variable <italic>total staff</italic> is measured by the full amount of employees quantified in full-time equivalencies (FTEs) that work for the TTO in a given year. Given that the commercialization of scientific innovations requires the application of specific knowledge and expertise, we also include the variable <italic>professional staff</italic> to describe the amount of technical employees in FTEs who have expertise in, and are dedicated exclusively to, a specific area of knowledge such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, ICTs, clean technologies, and so forth.</p>
<p><italic>Experience</italic> is measured by the number of years the TTO has been operating, which represents the experience in terms of the time the TTO has been involved in technology transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471847">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>). This variable was calculated by subtracting the year the TTO was founded from the current year.</p>
<p>As far as university-related variables are concerned, we examine the influence exerted on technology transfer by the amount of accumulated knowledge, the existence of specific regulations for spin-offs creation and intellectual property rights, and the access to relevant innovation infrastructures such as business incubators and science parks.</p>
<p><italic>Accumulated knowledge</italic> is proxied by the amount of patents protecting scientific inventions emerged in a university that are still valid in a given year. The rationale behind the choice of this variable is that intellectual property needs to be protected against imitation to appropriate the rents derived from such valuable resource and facilitate technology transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891242412471847">Nagaoka, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>USO regulation</italic> reflects whether spin-off creation is a formalized and planned activity for the university. This variable takes the value of 1 if the university has a specific regulation for spin-off activity and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p><italic>IPR regulation</italic> implies that the university is engaged in providing the environment and incentives to create and protect intellectual property in its premises. This variable also takes the value of 1 if the university has a specific regulation for intellectual property and the management of copyrights, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p><italic>Business incubator</italic> indicates whether the university can provide specialized support to spin-offs during their early startup stage. This variable takes the value of 1 if the university has access to a business incubator and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p><italic>Science park</italic> is indicative of physically close ties between the university and firms within an industry network. This variable takes the value of 1 if the university has access to a science park and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Finally, we expect to find evidence on the influence caused by the regional factors that characterize the geographical context of the university, such as the availability of venture capital and the stock of technological knowledge in the region.</p>
<p><italic>Regional venture capital per firm</italic> is measured as the total amount of venture capital in thousand Euros invested during the two preceding years in the autonomous community (subnational Spanish regions at the NUTS-2 level) in which the university is located, divided by the total number of existing firms in that region. Data on venture capital were obtained from the annual survey on Venture Capital and Private Equity in Spain elaborated by ASCRI, whereas data on existing firms come from the Companies Central Directory maintained by INE. We applied a natural log transformation to this variable to smooth its skewed distribution.</p>
<p><italic>Regional stock of knowledge per firm</italic> refers to the knowledge accumulated per firm over time in the autonomous community in which the university is located and quantified in thousand Euros in a given year. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242412471847">Soete and Patel (1985)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412471847">2</xref></sup> this variable was estimated using data on R&amp;D expenses and existing firms for regions at the NUTS2-level that were obtained, respectively, from the Statistics about R&amp;D activities and the Companies Central Directory maintained by INE. Because the distribution of stock of knowledge per firm across regions was skewed, we used a natural log transformation of this variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0891242412471847">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>The variable <italic>autonomy</italic> takes the value of 1 if the TTO is an external unit of the university and 0 otherwise. The degree of autonomy of the TTO has been consistently found to have an effect on the commercialization strategy. The reason is that financial independence facilitates the fulfillment of TTOs’ mission as technology transfer intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412471847">Bercovitz &amp; Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242412471847">Markman, Phan, Balkin, &amp; Gianiodis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Technical university</italic> means the university is specialized in a specific area, specifically engineering and science. Although technical universities are characterized by generating substantial, often market-oriented knowledge, generalist universities focus on a wide range of areas of knowledge. This variable takes the value of 1 if the university is fundamentally technical and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>Since our count-dependent variables are overdispersed and there is the risk of omitting unobserved variables not accounted for by our data, we ran a negative binomial regression using generalized linear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891242412471847">Winkelmann, 2008</xref>). In particular, we chose a flexible functional form of negative binomial regression based on generalized estimating equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412471847">Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986</xref>) with an exchangeable correlation structure that allows constant correlation between error terms across time for each individual to avoid the problem of autocorrelation derived from unobserved heterogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242412471847">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix for all variables included in the analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242412471847">Table 1</xref>. On average, the sample exhibits a technology transfer activity of 1.92 spin-offs and 2.95 licenses agreements per university and year. These figures range from 0 to 22 spin-offs and from 0 to 72 licenses agreements, respectively. The proportion of universities reporting zero spin-offs created in a given year represents 50% of the sample, whereas in the case of universities, 41% of universities reported zero license agreements signed in a given year. Universities that in a given year report at least 5 spin-offs or license agreements represent roughly 11% and 13%, respectively. This means that the knowledge spillover activity via licensing and firm spin-offs is concentrated in nearly a half of all Spanish universities.</p>

In both cases, Model 1 includes variables related to TTO’s resources; Model 2 adds Model 2 adds variables related to university’s resources; Model 3 takes into consideration all the variables under study; and finally, Model 4 contains regional dummies to control for unobserved heterogeneity across regions. As suggested by their respective deviance difference and increase in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, Models 1 and 2 show that TTO resources and university resources significantly affect the spillover of knowledge from universities via both spin-off and licensing. In contrast, Model 3 reflects that the two regional factors emphasized in our study (i.e., local availability of venture capital and regional R&amp;D investment) do not have any significant impact on technology transfer in terms of spin-off creation and licensing agreements. Interestingly, Model 4 improves the goodness of fit of the previous models, implying there are some time-invariant elements specific to the region that explain the variation of our dependent variables.</p>

Similarly, the TTO’s experience has a positive and significant impact on the number of university spin-offs. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the total number of TTO staff is negatively associated with the number of university spin-offs. Note that the estimated coefficients for this variable become significant when regional variables are included in Models 3 and 4. These findings suggest that the technical qualification, expertise, and experience of the TTO team matter much more than the size of the team for university spin-off activity.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of the characteristics of the university, the accumulated knowledge (i.e., patenting activity of the university) has a positive and significant influence on the number of spin-offs. The number of spin-offs is also influenced by the existence of regulations that formalize the spin-off activity within the university. According to Model 3, holding ceteris paribus other variables, universities that are deliberately involved in technology transfer via spin-offs and have regulations specifically designed for spin-off creation are expected to have a spin-off rate that is 2.4 times that of the universities without any regulation on this regard. These results are notably consistent in all model estimations since the sign and significance of the estimated coefficients for the above-mentioned variables remain equal as we include more variables into the analysis. While universities with a business incubator are more likely to create spin-offs, those with a science park are less likely to do so. A business incubator is an infrastructure for innovation specifically oriented to fostering entrepreneurial activity in terms of startups; according to our results, the availability of these facilities within a university exerts a positive influence on the number of academic spin-offs. Therefore, we support Hypotheses 1 and 2 to a large extent for the case of technology transfer via spin-offs.</p>
<p>With regard to <italic>licensing activity</italic>, our results suggest that the TTO’s experience has a positive and significant impact on the number of licensing agreements signed in a given year. The university’s accumulated knowledge also has a positive and significant effect on licensing agreements. On the other hand, the link between universities and science parks has a positive effect in the case of licensing agreements. Universities with a science park are expected to have a multiplier effect 1.5 to 3.2 times greater for the number of licensing agreements compared with universities without this kind of infrastructure for innovation (Models 3 and 4). The sign and significance of the estimated coefficients for the above-mentioned variables are consistent in all estimated models. Therefore, we also find extensive support for Hypotheses 1 and 2 for the case of technology transfer via licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we found differences among the determinants of spin-off creation and licensing agreements. While accumulated TTO experience and university accumulated knowledge have a positive and significant influence on both types of technology transfer activities, the size of a TTO’s professional staff, the existence of specific regulations, and business incubators affect only spin-off creation (but not licensing activity). In contrast, universities with a science park are less likely to create spin-offs, but more likely to license technology.</p>
<p>We found no evidence of a significant effect of venture capital availability on spin-off creation. A plausible explanation is that the lack of venture capital does not constrain spin-off activity because of the “too early-stage” nature of the projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, even when the risk capital market in Spain has been continuously growing, it is still relatively small and characterized by a short history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242412471847">Alemany, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the effect of R&amp;D investment in the region on both university spin-off creation and licensing was not significant. In fact, most of the coefficients showed a negative sign. We interpret that the R&amp;D effort by public institutions (i.e., grants and support programs for innovation) is not yielding market returns via university spin-offs and licensing. With these two (nonsignificant) findings concerning the influence of venture capital availability and R&amp;D investment in the region where the university is located, we cannot accept (neither reject) Hypothesis 3.</p>
<p>But interestingly, we found that (subnational) regional characteristics matter for explaining the variation in university technology transfer activity. In Model 4, the explanatory power of the model is substantially improved as we introduce regional dummies in our test. For the university spin-off creation model, the pseudo-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> rises from 0.14 to 0.22 with a significant deviance difference of 60.38, whereas for the university licensing model the pseudo-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> goes up from 0.13 to 0.17 with a significant deviance difference of 32.78. This means that there are other regional characteristics, beyond the two that we used in our tests (i.e., Hypothesis 3), which can be useful to understand the behavior and capacity of regions for technology transfer.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The economic development of regions depends mainly on their capacity to reinvent and rejuvenate themselves. In this context, many (subnational) regions struggle to shift from an “efficiency-based” toward a “knowledge-based” economy. The innovation activity developed in universities and research centers is fundamental to explain this transition, and ultimately, to achieve a more innovative and entrepreneurial society.</p>
<p>Our study is an attempt to unveil the knowledge spillover “black-box” by analyzing the determinants of technology transfer via university spin-offs and licensing. Faculty and research teams employed by the university generate the capability to absorb, create, and disseminate knowledge. In parallel, academic institutions develop the ability to yield value from R&amp;D activities through TTOs. The (subnational) regional context in which the technology transfer takes place also plays an important role as this local innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystem can favor the knowledge spillover flow toward the marketplace. All these elements together (i.e., universities, TTOs, and subnational regional conditions) are critical to enhance the capacity to innovate and, hence, to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>Academic spin-offs and licensing activities are a means, rather than an end, of the developmental process by which innovation is transformed into economic value. Our study contributes to filling the gap in the literature on academic entrepreneurship and economic development in two ways. First, we frame our study in an economically less-advanced region, an issue that has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. Second, a multilevel approach has been applied for our empirical work by testing the simultaneous effect of three units of analysis: the (subnational) region, the university, and the TTO team. The inclusion of all of these levels in our analysis reflects the complexity of the knowledge spillover phenomenon. By applying this comprehensive view, we have gained a better understanding of the key factors leading to academic spin-offs and licensing activity, which are important engines of innovation and economic development.</p>
<p>Well-known scholars claim that “to date we have no systematic explanation for why some universities generate more new companies to exploit their intellectual property than do others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471847">Di Gregorio &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>, p. 210). As with many other complex phenomena, there is a plethora of elements affecting the spin-off activity of academic institutions. Our evidence, based on Spanish data for the period 2005 to 2008, points at the relevance of university resources devoted to it (in the form of specialized staff of TTOs and business incubation centers), institutional factors (in the form of university spin-off rules), and key intangible factors (in the form of accumulated technology transfer experience and capacity of knowledge generation). We also found that the experience of the TTO staff, the existence of science parks at the place where the university is located, and the knowledge accumulated by the university via patents seem to provide a significant account of cross-university licensing variation. As in many other countries, technology transfer outcomes seem to be region specific, to some extent.</p>
<p>Although this article provides some insights into the determinants of university technology transfer, it has some limitations that must be acknowledged. It would be desirable to test for spin-off performance (e.g., survival, growth, profitability, etc.), rather than spin-off formation, per se. By considering the amount of patents, we are leaving aside issues concerning their quality since not every invention disclosed to the TTO is equally patentable and enforceable. Being aware of the aforementioned limitations, overall, we believe that our results are consistent and ultimately reveal the existence of key university and regional resources.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, our findings signal a warning against the expectation of immediate results, but at the same time, an encouragement toward the implementation of appropriate policies. In recent years, universities in Spain have increased their patenting, licensing, and firm spin-off activity. Most TTOs are going through an experiential learning process within their respective regional contexts. This learning process takes time, and a close supervision of the technology transfer outcomes by government authorities may result in more effective policies to support university decision makers and academics.</p>
<p>We conclude with a couple of recommendations for further research. The extant literature suggests that the individual level of analysis matters in building more complete models of technology transfer effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242412471847">Phan &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>). We suggest to include in future studies a unit of analysis representing the individual level (i.e., the academic entrepreneur) into the general multilevel regression analysis. An additional suggestion is to assess the economic impact of academic entrepreneurship on regional development by testing direct and indirect effects.</p>

<p>Although the questionnaires from the RedOTRI’s annual survey are addressed to university TTOs, we consider universities as the unit of analysis because all universities included in the sample have one TTO, and each TTO serves a single university. Likewise, it is worth noting that a university represents an academic institution with one or more campuses that operate under the same policies and procedures. Thus, different campuses from the same university are considered as a single unit of observation despite the fact that they may differ in terms of the variables under examination.</p></fn>

<p>These authors assumed that R&amp;D expenses in a given year take an average period of 5 years to be completely assimilated as part of the stock of technological capital. Apart from that, they also take into account the depreciation—because of the obsolescence—of the knowledge accumulated in previous years. Accordingly, the stock of technological knowledge is estimated as follows:</p>
