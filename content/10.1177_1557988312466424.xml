<abstract>
<p>The primary purpose of this two-phased study was to examine the structural validity and statistical utility of a racism scale specific to Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who resided in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and Baltimore, Maryland. Phase I involved pretesting a 10-item racism measure with 20 Black MSM. Based on pretest findings, the scale was adapted into a 21-item racism scale for use in collecting data on 166 respondents in Phase II. Exploratory factor analysis of the 21-item racism scale resulted in a 19-item, two-factor solution. The two factors or subscales were the following: <italic>General Racism</italic> and <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic>. Confirmatory factor analysis was used in testing construct validity of the factored racism scale. Specifically, the two racism factors were combined with three homophobia factors into a confirmatory factor analysis model. Based on a summary of the fit indices, both comparative and incremental were equal to .90, suggesting an adequate convergence of the racism and homophobia dimensions into a single social oppression construct. Statistical utility of the two racism subscales was demonstrated when regression analysis revealed that the gay-identified men versus bisexual-identified men in the sample were more likely to experience increased racism within the context of intimate relationships and less likely to be exposed to repeated experiences of general racism. Overall, the findings in this study highlight the importance of continuing to explore the psychometric properties of a racism scale that accounts for the unique psychosocial concerns experienced by Black MSM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prejudice and discrimination can occur between (inter) and within (intra) racial groups. The discriminatory practices of White Americans against Black Americans with regard to higher education, the restaurant industry, housing rentals and sales, and hiring practices are examples of intergroup racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312466424">Clark, Anderson, Clark, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557988312466424">Yetman, 1985</xref>). Based on skin tone variation and hair texture, intragroup racism has occurred within Black American families, fraternities, sororities, business and social organizations, churches, preparatory schools, and historically Black colleges and universities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557988312466424">Harvey, LaBeach, Pridgen, &amp; Gocial, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557988312466424">Keith &amp; Herring, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, many in the Black community supported the idea that darker-skinned Black Americans with coarse hair were inherently inferior to lighter-skinned Black Americans with straight hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312466424">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557988312466424">Yetman, 1985</xref>), and notably, to date, intragroup racism is still a strong form of discrimination within the Black community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557988312466424">Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557988312466424">Harrell, 2000</xref>). In effect, experiences of both inter- and intragroup racism could become precursors to psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312466424">Sellers, Caldwell, Schmeelk-Cone, &amp; Zimmerman, 2003</xref>) and internalized racism (i.e., self-abomination because of being Black; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557988312466424">Speight, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to successfully predicting the extent to which racism could have an impact on negative health and social outcomes, whenever possible, it is imperative to use racism measures that have been validated on the targeted research population (i.e., homosexually active Black males vs. heterosexually active Black males). In many instances, however, the psychometric properties of racism scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557988312466424">Green, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557988312466424">Terrell &amp; Terrell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557988312466424">Utsey &amp; Ponterotto, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557988312466424">Utsey, Ponterotto, Reynolds, &amp; Cancelli, 2000</xref>) have been explored based on data collected on the general Black population—but not specific to Black sexual minorities, such as Black men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>
<p>Since the experiences of racism faced by Black MSM are different from the general Black population, the instruments used to assess those issues should be distinct. As such, experiences of racial prejudice and discrimination among Black MSM may be exacerbated by struggles with gender roles, sexual identity, homophobia, and heterosexism. Particularly based on the beliefs of a predominately heterosexual culture, Black MSM are socialized to personify a strong masculine gender role or identity—which oftentimes implies procreating (or producing “babies”) and behaving characteristically “straight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557988312466424">Harawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557988312466424">Malebranche, Fields, Bryant, &amp; Harper, 2009</xref>). Pointedly some Black MSM may preserve their heterosexual identity by engaging in sex with men without any emotional involvement, whereas, comparatively, their heterosexual identity may be maintained as a result of having sex with women while developing a level of intimacy and emotional connectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557988312466424">Miller, Serner, &amp; Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557988312466424">Williams, Wyatt, Resell, Peterson, &amp; Asuan-O’Brien, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, to maneuver within a heterosexist society, Black MSM may feel that circumventing discrimination and alienation, while simultaneously maintaining a straight identity, may necessitate nondisclosure of sexual identity (or sexual behaviors with a man; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557988312466424">Dodge, Jeffries, &amp; Sandfort, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557988312466424">Mays, Cochran, &amp; Zamudio, 2004</xref>). Especially within the Black community, when homosexual behavior is not disclosed—yet tacitly tolerated—stigma, shame, and secrecy may become worse among Black MSM; consequently, nondisclosure or a “code of silence” often force Black MSM into living compartmentalized existences or dual identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557988312466424">Crawford, Allison, Zamboni, &amp; Soto, 2002</xref>). In general, dual identities suggest that Black MSM may identify in varying degrees with their racial–ethnic minority community and with their sexual minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557988312466424">Crawford et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, Black MSM and other racial-ethnic sexual minorities are not only subjected to experiences of racism in a predominately White society but these populations are also subjected to racism within the White lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557988312466424">Greene, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557988312466424">Poon &amp; Ho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557988312466424">Wilson &amp; Yoshikawa, 2004</xref>). As such, there have been reports of racial-ethnic minorities being discriminated against, however subtly, at bars, clubs, and other social functions that are organized and attended by majority White gays and lesbians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557988312466424">Wilson &amp; Yoshikawa, 2004</xref>). Even the dimensions and levels of racism may vary across demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sexual identity, HIV serostatus, socioeconomic status) and sexual behaviors (i.e., number of sex partners) among racial-ethnic sexual minority populations. A gay-identified Black male, for example, may be more cognizant of a dimension of racism that impedes an emotional attachment with another man, whereas a bisexual- or heterosexual-identified Black male may be more concerned with a dimension of racism that may negatively impact educational, career, and economic achievements.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have assessed experiences of racism, homophobia, or heterosexism on negative health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, HIV-risk behaviors, or sexual problems) among racial-ethnic sexual minorities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557988312466424">Chae &amp; Yoshikawa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557988312466424">Diaz, Ayala, &amp; Bein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312466424">Diaz, Ayala, Bein, Henne, &amp; Marin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557988312466424">Jeffries, Marks, Lauby, Murrill, &amp; Millet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557988312466424">Zamboni &amp; Crawford, 2007</xref>), although, comparatively, there is a dearth of research explicating how Black MSM and other racial–sexual minorities manage the negative impacts of social oppression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312466424">Choi, Han, Paul, and Ayala (2011)</xref>, nevertheless, qualitatively examined coping strategies for experiences of racism and homophobia among Black, Latino, and Asian Pacific Islander MSM.</p>
<p>Specific to the Black MSM in the aforementioned research, findings suggested that concealment of sexuality was used to avoid difficult situations related to homophobia within the Black community, whereas dissociation from social settings was used to circumvent experiences of racism in the context of the White LGBT communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312466424">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Other methods used in coping with both racism and homophobia included dismissing the stigmatization (i.e., framing the stigma within the context of broader societal issues that negatively affects others), drawing strength and comfort from external sources (i.e., identifying with a role model within their racial community of origin to cope with racism), and direct confrontation (i.e., establishing boundaries about what is and is not appropriate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312466424">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Critically overall, when experiences of racism among Black MSM are interfaced with homophobia, heterosexism, sexual identity, or gender role conflict, then psychosocial issues become increasingly complex and multidimensional in nature. As a result, validated measures should be used to assess racial prejudice and discrimination in this population. Hence, the primary purpose of this two-phased pilot study included (a) pretesting a racism scale with a small sample of Black MSM for cultural relevance and linguistic appropriateness and (b) examining the extent to which the structural and construct validities as well as the statistical utility of the pretested and adapted racism scale could be tested with a larger sample of Black MSM.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1557988312466424">
<title>Sampling and Procedures</title>
<p>For both phases of this research, data were collected on participants who (a) resided in Washington, DC, metropolitan area (DC and its surrounding Maryland and Virginia areas) or Baltimore, Maryland; and (b) identified as a Black male at least 18 years of age. With a small sample (<italic>n</italic> = 20) of Black MSM, Phase I of this study involved pretesting a 10-item racism scale that had been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312466424">Diaz et al. (2001)</xref> with 912 Latino gay and bisexual men. Face-to-face and telephone pretests (or interviews) were both conducted with respondents in this phase of the research. The telephone option was offered to increase participation in the pretests by providing convenience and comfort for the men.</p>
<p>Respondents were primarily recruited from agencies, social organizations, and events that served or attracted Black MSM. Recruitment materials (i.e., flyers), which described the study and provided the researcher’s contact information, were developed and disseminated at the aforementioned locations. During the pretest interviews, the respondents were asked to (a) repeat the items and response categories in their own words and then indicate what was unclear, (b) suggest how items and response categories could be made more culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate for Black MSM, and (c) suggest items and response categories that needed to be added to or deleted from the scale. Each interview with a participant was between 60 and 90 minutes in duration. Based on the findings from a series of every four pretests, the principal investigator in this study adapted the scale and then tested the revised scale with the remaining respondents. At the end of Phase I, the principal investigator and three other research scientists carefully reviewed all the pretest findings and then finalized the scale for use in Phase II.</p>
<p>Using both paper-and-pencil and online formats, Phase II of this research involved administering the entire survey instrument, including demographic characteristics and sexual behavior items and the revised racism scale, to a larger sample (<italic>n</italic> = 180) of Black MSM. Study respondents were recruited from organizations or agencies, festivals, bars, social events and activities, conference workshops, businesses, nondenominational churches, and support groups that attracted or served Black MSM. In some instances, laptop computers providing access to the online format of the survey as well as the paper-and-pencil format were made available at social events and workshops to collect data on Black MSM. Some of the organizations, which primarily served gay-identified men, posted the link to the online survey on their websites as well as sent the web-link to the survey to their patrons via emails.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1557988312466424">
<title>Pretest Results</title>
<p>Of the 20 Black MSM who were recruited to participate in the pretests (11 via the telephone and 9 face-to-face), 2 identified as heterosexual, 3 identified as bisexual, and 15 identified as gay. Based on the pretesting findings, the adapted scale contained 21 racism-related questions. The majority of the added items appeared to have assessed experiences of racism linked to physical (or phenotypic) characteristics as well as experiences of racism associated with intimate relationships (emotional and sexual). Specific to phenotypic characteristics and racism, items such as “As you were growing up, how often did you hear (or were you told) that light skinned Blacks are smarter than dark skinned Blacks?” and “As an adult, how often have you heard (or been told) that Blacks with “good hair” (e.g., straight hair) are better looking than Blacks with coarse (“kinky” or “nappy”) hair?” were added to the measure. Although related to racism and relationships, questions such as “How often have you felt less physically attractive than men outside your race because you’re Black?” and “How often do you feel you have had trouble finding love relationships with men inside your race because you thought they were not attracted to other Black men?” were added to the scale.</p>
<p>Last, minor modifications were made to the items to enhance their clarity, cultural sensitivity and relevance, and readability. A subtly revised item, for example, read as follows: “As you were growing up, how often did you feel you were made fun of or called names because you’re Black?” instead of “As you were growing up, how often were you made fun of or called names because of your race?”</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1557988312466424">
<title>General demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to report their residency, age, educational attainment, and income level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1557988312466424">
<title>Sexual identity</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to report their sexual identity from the categorical responses coded as follows: (a) <italic>Homosexual/Gay</italic> = 1, (b) <italic>Bisexual</italic> = 2, (c) <italic>Heterosexual/Straight</italic> = 3, and (d) <italic>Other, please specify</italic> = 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1557988312466424">
<title>HIV serostatus</title>
<p>Assessment of HIV serostatus was determined by asking respondents to indicate the following: (a) if they ever received a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test (dichotomous responses, <italic>Yes</italic> = 1 or <italic>No</italic> = 2) and (b) the result of their last HIV test (discrete responses: <italic>Positive</italic> = 1, <italic>Negative</italic> = 2, or <italic>Don’t know</italic> = 3). Respondents’ antibody status was determined by their responses to this second question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1557988312466424">
<title>Number and gender identity of sex partners</title>
<p>To determine the number and gender identity of sex partners the men had within the last year, participants were asked three questions: (a) “In the last year, with how many male sex partners did you have any anal and/or oral sex?” (b) “With how many female partners in the last year did you have any vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex?” and (c) “In the last year, with how many transgender partners did you have any anal and/or oral sex?” Those individuals assessed to have had one male and no female and transgender sex partners in the last year were categorized as having had a sexual encounter(s) with one male partner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1557988312466424">
<title>Psychosocial variables</title>
<p>Among the psychosocial scales, the homophobia measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557988312466424">Smith, 2012</xref>) were employed in testing construct validity of the racism scale, whereas the psychological distress and financial hardship scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312466424">Diaz et al., 2001</xref>) were used in examining the statistical utility of the racism scale. The questions on the measures were assessed on a 4-point rating scale: <italic>Never</italic> = 1; <italic>Once or twice</italic> = 2; <italic>A few times</italic> = 3; and <italic>Many times</italic> = 4. However, the response category, <italic>Does not apply</italic> = 5, was used to assess seven of the racism items. This response category was thought to be inclusive of Black MSM who may not have had certain experiences that were being measured by the racism scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1557988312466424">
<title>Racism</title>
<p>In general, the revised 21-item racism scale was used to assess experiences of inter- and intragroup racism as well as internalized racism in this sample. Cronbach alpha for the scale was .89.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1557988312466424">
<title>Internalized homophobia</title>
<p>This particular subscale was used to explore the extent to which experiences of homophobia were internalized (i.e., self-abomination) among the men in the sample. The five-item subscale (α = .81), for example, included the following questions: (a) “As an adult, how often have you hated yourself because you have had sex with men?” and (b) “As an adult, how often have you thought you would go to hell for having sex with men?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1557988312466424">
<title>Discrimination and homophobia</title>
<p>General experiences of homophobia were presumably measured through this four-item homophobia subscale (α = .71) among the respondents in this study. The subscale, for example, included the following questions: (a) “As an adult, how often do you feel you have been harassed or treated rudely by the police for being homosexual or gay?” and (b) “How often do you feel you have lost a job or a career opportunity for being homosexual or gay?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1557988312466424">
<title>Negative verbal experiences and homophobia</title>
<p>The four-item subscale (α = .73) was used to examine the extent to which Black MSM experienced negative beliefs associated with being homosexual or gay (i.e., hearing that homosexuality is abnormal). The subscale, for example, was composed of the following questions: (a) “As you were growing up, how often did you hear (or were you told) that being gay or homosexual is a sin?” and (b) “As an adult, how often do you feel you have been made fun of or called names for being homosexual or gay?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1557988312466424">
<title>Psychological distress</title>
<p>Among the participants in this sample, the five-item psychological distress measure was employed to explore symptoms of emotional distress such as frequency of suicidal ideation. The subscale (α = .84), for example, was made up of items such as: (a) “In the last year, how often have you felt sad or depressed?” and (b) “In the last year, how often have you thought about killing yourself?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1557988312466424">
<title>Financial hardship</title>
<p>The financial hardship scale was used to assess indicators (i.e., having to borrow money) of economic instability among the men. The four-item subscale (α = .81) was composed of questions such as: (a) “In the last year, how often did you run out of money for your basic needs such as food, rent, or transportation?” and (b) “In the last year, how often did you trade sex for basic needs such as food or rent?”</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section17-1557988312466424">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS 16.00 was employed to conduct descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), reliability analysis, multiple linear regression, and multinomial logistic regression, whereas LISREL 8.8 with SIMPLIS command language was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Percentages, frequencies, and crosstabs generated through descriptive statistics were used in describing the characteristics and behaviors of the men in the sample. EFA was used to identify the underlying dimensions or factors of the 21-item racism measure.</p>
<p>Based on reliability analysis, Cronbach’s alphas were generated to determine the internal consistency of the factors (or subscales) and scales in this research. Alphas were also employed in making a final decision concerning the appropriate placement of items that loaded on multiple factors. Then CFA was employed in testing construct validity of the racism scale. Last, multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to test the statistical utility of the racism factors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section19-1557988312466424">
<title>Data Screening</title>
<p>Of the 180 participants recruited into this study, 14 cases (8%) were dropped because of incomplete data. Two of the remaining 166 cases (52% [86] online vs. 48% [80] paper-and-pencil), however, were retained because their incomplete data were minimal and randomly scattered throughout the psychosocial scales. In those cases that were retained, serial means were used as needed as replacements for missing data.</p>
<p>Specific to HIV serostatus, an unknown status response category (<italic>n</italic> = 18) was formed by adding those individuals who reported never receiving an HIV test (<italic>n</italic> = 11) to those individuals who reported being tested but who indicated not knowing their status (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Furthermore, the “Does not apply” category was recoded into the “Never” category as part of forming a continuous variable for the racism measure. The recoded responses ensured that the categories were the same across all of the items on the scale.</p>

<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1557988312466424">Table 1</xref> presents the percentages and frequencies used in describing the sample. Of the 166 respondents, 71% (118) of the men identified as gay, 20% (33) as bisexual, 8% (13) as “Other, please specify” (i.e., same-gender loving, freak, unidentified), and 1% (2) as heterosexual. Eighty-six percent (142) of the participants resided in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and 14% (24) lived in Baltimore, Maryland. Thirty-two percent (54) of the men ranged in ages from 31 to 40 years, 31% (51) ranged in ages from 41 to 50 years, 19% (31) were 21 to 30 years of age, 13% (22) were 51 years or older, and the mean age of the sample was 39 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11) years. Almost two thirds (61%) of the men reported completing college or beyond, including a fourth (25%) who reported completing graduate school. Slightly more than two fifths (41%) of the men had annual incomes in excess of $60,000, with approximately a fourth (23%) of the sample earning $80,001 or greater. Ninety-three percent (155) of the men in the sample reported having had an HIV test, whereas 7% (11) indicated never having been tested. Of the 93% who tested, 63% (97) reported having received a negative result on their most recent test, 33% (51) reported receiving a positive result, and 4% (7) indicated that they did not know their status. Eighty-three percent (138) reported having had sex with more than one partner during the past year, and the median value for the number (ranging from 1 to 125) of partners was five.</p>

<title>Exploratory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>Based on the correlation matrix generated through EFA, there were strong relationships among the items on the scale; however, no two items correlated at &gt;.80 (such a value would have suggested multicollinearity between items). The significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the high Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sample adequacy value (.84) both indicated that there was a sufficient minimum sample size relative to the number of items needed to conduct factor analysis.</p>
<p>The initial factor analysis resulted in a five-factor solution; although based on suppressing loadings (&lt;.4), some of the items did not conceptually load on rotated factors. A second factor analysis was conducted whereby the factors were constrained to three. Findings revealed that multiple items loaded on more than one factor, and yet, some of the items did not conceptually load on the factors that they appeared; therefore, while constraining the factors to two, a third factor analysis was subsequently performed. Predicated on the third analysis, the item “As an adult, how often have you felt that Black men go against their race when they are dating (or in relationships with) White men?” did not conceptually load on its factor, whereas the item “As an adult, how often have you felt that light skinned Blacks are better looking than dark skinned Blacks?” did not load on either of the two factors.</p>
<p>After the two items mentioned above were dropped from the scale, a fourth analysis was run. The new generated correlation matrix indicated that there were sufficiently strong relationships among the 19 remaining items. In addition, the KMO increased slightly, from .84 to .85, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity remained significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), overall indicating that the 19-item racism scale was factorable. The final two-factor solution accounted for 44.6% of the variance in the racism scale. Although the initial eigenvalues for Factors 1 and 2, respectively, were 6.45 and 2.00, Factor 1 appeared to measure general experiences of racism, whereas Factor 2 suggested that experiences of racism may be linked to intimate relationships (emotional and sexual). Factors 1 and 2, respectively, were labeled <italic>General Racism</italic> and <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1557988312466424">Table 2</xref> presents the racism factors, subscales, Cronbach alphas, factor loadings, and item means and variances.</p>

<title>Reliability Analysis</title>
<p>Reliability analysis indicated that the internal consistency (α = .892) was good for the 19-item racism scale. Specific to the one item that loaded on both subscales, analysis indicated that the internal consistency was good for the General Racism subscale, with (α = .87) the ‘…did you hear (or were you told) that Blacks with “good hair” are better looking…’ item and without (α = .85) it. Also, the internal consistency was good for the <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic> subscale, with (α = .81) the item and without (α = .80) it. The greatest decrease in internal consistency occurred when the item was deleted from the <italic>General Racism</italic> subscale; thus, based on the results, the original item placement was substantiated. In sum, the internal consistencies for the <italic>General Racism</italic> and the <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic> subscales, respectively, were α = .87 and α = .80. Additionally, the corrected item–total correlations (which were moderate to strong) ranged from .36 to .68 for the <italic>General Racism</italic> subscale and from .42 to .64 for the <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic> subscale.</p>

<title>Construct validity</title>
<p>As a form of construct validity, convergent validity of the racism scale was tested in this study. In particular, the two first-order racism latent variables, general racism and relationships and racism, were combined into an oblique model with the three first-order homophobia latent variables internalized homophobia, discrimination and homophobia, and negative verbal experiences and homophobia. Predicated on CFA, the indices indicated a “good” (incremental fit index [IFI] = .90, Bollen, 1989; comparative fit index [CFI] = .90, Bentler, 1990) to “fair” (nonnormed fit index [NNFI] = .89, Bentler &amp; Bonnett, 1990; normed fit index [NFI] = .83, Bentler &amp; Bonnett, 1990; and root-mean square estimate approximation [RMSEA] = .09) fit of model to the data, suggesting an adequate convergence of the racism and homophobia dimensions into a single social oppression construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312466424">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993</xref>).</p>

<p>Specifically within Model 1, increased levels of psychological distress and older adult Black MSM were related to increased levels of general racism. As such, psychological distress and age, respectively, accounted for 6% and 3% of the additional variance in general racism. In comparison, within Model 2, higher levels of psychological distress and educational attainment as well as younger adult Black MSM were all associated with increased levels of relationships and racism. Collectively, psychological distress, educational attainment, and age accounted for 6% (2% each) of the additional variance in relationships and racism.</p>

<title>Summary and Discussion</title>
<p>In Phase I of this research, a 10-item racism scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312466424">Diaz et al., 2001</xref>) was pretested with a small sample of Black MSM. Then, based on those pretest results, the scale was adapted in an effort to reflect the possible experiences of racism in a larger sample of Black MSM in Phase II of this investigation. More specifically, predicated on the pretest findings, the 10-item racism scale resulted in a 21-item measure, which in general appeared to assess inter- and intragroup racism as well as internalized racism. Of the 11 questions added to the measure, many of them were used in examining experiences of racism associated with phenotypic characteristics (e.g., “. . . felt that light skinned Blacks are better looking than dark skinned Blacks?”) and racism linked to intimate relationships (e.g., “ . . . had problems finding love relationships with men inside your race because . . . they were not attracted to . . . Black men?”).</p>
<p>Subsequent to collecting data on the larger sample of Black MSM in Phase II, factor analysis was employed to identify the underlying dimensions of the racism construct. Analysis resulted in a 19-item, two-factor solution; the factors (or subscales) with their internal consistency (in parentheses) were the following: (a) <italic>General Racism</italic> (α = .87) and (b) <italic>Relationships and Racism</italic> (α = .80). Moreover, as predicated on CFA, a summary of the goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the model’s fit to the racism and homophobia factored scales’ data was from “good” (CFI, IFI = .90) to “fair” (NNFI = .89, NFI = .83, RMSEA = .09), suggesting an adequate convergence of the racism and homophobia dimensions into a single social oppression construct.</p>
<p>The statistical utility of the two racism latent variables was substantiated through testing regression models. In Models 1 and 2, increased levels of general racism and relationships and racism were significantly associated with higher levels of each other as well as with greater levels of psychological distress. Predictably, as dimensions of the racism construct, the racism latent variables accounted for the majority of the unique variance in each other within their respective models. In Model 1, specifically based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312466424">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312466424">Diaz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557988312466424">Yoshikawa, Wilson, Chae, &amp; Cheng, 2004</xref>), psychological distress was expected to account for a significant portion of the unique variance in general racism. Comparatively, in Model 2, because there is a dearth of research related to psychological well-being and intimate relationships among Black MSM, somewhat surprisingly psychological distress accounted for a notable portion of the unique variance in relationships and racism. For some of the men, nonetheless, the finding suggests that psychological distress could have been manifested as an outcome of intra- and intergroup racial prejudice and discrimination confronted while seeking sexual or emotional relationships with other men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557988312466424">Garofalo, Mustanski, Johnson, &amp; Emerson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557988312466424">Wilson &amp; Yoshikawa, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to psychological distress, age accounted for a significant portion of the unique variance in each of the racism latent variables in Models 1 and 2. Notably, however, the older Black MSM were positively related to general racism in Model 1, whereas the younger Black MSM were inversely associated with relationships and racism in Model 2. More specifically, the older men in the sample may have experienced more general racism than younger men because of greater exposure over time to discrimination and prejudice. Comparatively, the younger men may have been subjected to increased experiences of racism within the context of intimate relationships because of a greater search for sexual and emotional relationships, relative to the older men in the study.</p>
<p>Furthermore, greater levels of educational attainment were significantly associated with higher levels of relationships and racism within Model 2. That is, the finding suggests that the Black MSM with higher educational attainment may have been more sensitive to racism within the context of emotional and sexual relationships, especially in the presence of career and financial success. While similarly within the same model, a trend (<italic>p</italic> = .07) in the data suggests that some of the men may have been more sensitized to or focused on racism within the context of relationships in the absence of worries concerning economic hardships.</p>
<p>In Model 3, analysis revealed that the gay-identified Black MSM versus bisexual-identified Black MSM in the sample were more likely to report experiencing increased racism within the context of intimate relationships and less likely to indicate being exposed to repeated experiences of general racism. These results suggest discernible differences in experiences of racism between the gay- and bisexual-identified men in this study. In particular, gay-identified men are expected to desire emotional connections with another man because of a level of presumed comfort with and acceptance of their sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312466424">Adam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557988312466424">Crawford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557988312466424">Floyd &amp; Stein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557988312466424">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2006</xref>). Non-gay-identified men (i.e., bisexual and heterosexual), however, are expected to primarily search for physical or sexual connections with other men because of the uneasiness with, denial about, and lack of acceptance of their sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557988312466424">Ford et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557988312466424">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557988312466424">Williams et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, predicated on the findings in the aforementioned model, among the gay-identified men in the sample, a desire to be vulnerable and emotionally connected with another man may have precipitated an increased sensitivity to experiences of racism within the context of a relationship(s). Comparatively, a significant portion of the bisexual-identified men in the study may have been primarily searching for sexual experiences with a man in lieu of an emotional attachment—thus struggles with general racism (i.e., “treated rudely because of being Black,” “harassed by police,” or “thought of as less intelligent”) may have been more relevant to the quality of their lives.</p>
<p>The relationships and racism latent variable was significantly related to number of sex partners in Model 4. Specifically, the Black MSM who indicated having had one sex partner versus those who reported having had more than one sex partner in the last year were also those who were less likely to experience increased racism linked to relationships. This finding simply suggests that those who had one sex partner may have experienced less racism because of having had one partner. Conversely, among those who engaged in sex with more than one partner, the likelihood of being subjected to racism within the context of relationships may have increased merely because of having had sex with multiple partners.</p>
<p>Finally, in Model 5, analysis revealed to that the seropositive Black MSM versus seronegative Black MSM in study were more likely to be exposed to reoccurring experiences of general racism. That is, among the positive men, the finding suggests that the perceived experiences of general racism may have been exacerbated by the possible stressors associated with living with HIV/AIDS. Some of positive men in the study, for example, may have experienced racism when accessing medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557988312466424">Peterson &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>). Also, within Model 5, results suggest that the Black MSM with an unknown status versus seronegative Black MSM (although a trend in the data; <italic>p</italic> = .06) were more likely to be exposed to frequent experiences of general racism. Specifically, men in the study with an unknown serostatus may have perceived greater experiences of general racism because of also being concerned about potentially testing positive, especially if they had engaged in a previous high-risk sexual episode(s).</p>
<sec id="section28-1557988312466424">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>First, cultural relevance and linguistic appropriateness in the racism scale may have been improved if the scale had been pretested with larger samples of Black MSM (especially non-gay-identified men), nationally. Second, specific to administering the revised scale with the larger sample of Black MSM, increased numbers of heterosexual- and bisexual-identified men would have allowed the researcher to determine whether the factor structures maintained stability across sexual identities. Third, many of the findings may have been due to chance because cross-sectional nonprobability data were used in the analyses. Fourth, the eliminations of 8% (14) of the cases from the analyses increased the probability that the results may have also been due chance. Fifth, with multiple of samples of Black MSM, valid and reliable measures should have been used in testing the validity and statistical utility of the racism scale. Sixth, some of the responses to the items on the scale may have been due to social desirability bias.</p>
<p>Last, if hypotheses had been tested in this research, then recoding the “Does not apply” category into a “Never” category to form a continuous racism variable could have potentially created Type I and Type II errors—specifically for the items without timeframes or time referents (i.e., “while growing up,” “as an adult,” and “in the past year”). For example, a “Does not apply” response for the item “How often . . . turned down for sex by men outside your race . . . ?” could have indicated that some of the men may have never desired or attempted to have sex with someone outside of their race. Although in the absence of an item time referent, a “Does not apply” response suggests uncertainty about whether having had sex with men outside of their race ever occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1557988312466424">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations of this study, the findings were still very meaningful in understanding the dimensions of racism experienced among a sample of Black MSM. Essentially, this research explored the psychometric properties of a racism scale that included a dimension within the context of relationships specific to Black MSM—which is distinctly different from the dimensions examined in previous research with the general Black population. However, in future studies, to better define the items specific to experiences of racism among Black MSM, the 19 indicators used in this particular research could become part of a pool of items used in conducting elicitation interviews or pretests with multiple samples of Black MSM, nationally. Ultimately, testing and retesting the racism scale should be conducted with randomized, or at the very least multiple, samples of Black MSM.</p>
