<p>Elemental aluminum (Al) powders reinforced with 1–10 wt% of ultra-dispersed nanodiamond (UDD) powders were ball-milled in a Spex<sup>TM</sup> Mixer/Mill between 0 and 120 min followed by consolidation and sintering. X-ray diffraction analyses on the ball-milled powders revealed only α-Al peaks, whereas Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> phase was identified along with α-Al in all sintered composites. Increasing the addition of nanodiamond to Al-matrix resulted in improved hardness of both ball-milled and sintered composites. The wear resistances of the Al-UDD composites were significantly improved with increasing UDD contents. Under similar load and sliding conditions, the wear resistance of Al matrix composite containing 10 wt% nanodiamond enhances about 40 times when compared with unreinforced aluminum.</p>

However, limited investigations have been carried out on the production of nanodiamond particle-reinforced Al-based matrix composites for the purpose of improving friction and wear properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421636">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311421636">20</xref></sup> and thermal properties of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311421636">21</xref></sup> Hanada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311421636">19</xref></sup> compared the friction and wear properties of nanodiamond dispersed Al-Si-Cu-Mg composite with two kinds of detonation nanodiamonds, namely as-synthesized and purified detonation nanodiamonds, using high-energy ball milling. They reported that the composites containing 1 vol.% diamond nanoclusters reduce the friction coefficient and wear loss of the composites dueto the rolling effect. The similar observation wasalso reported by Quyang and Okada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421636">18</xref></sup> Except the polymer-based composites, only a small amount of nanodiamond (1 vol.%) particles have been used in some of these investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311421636">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421636">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311421636">19</xref></sup> in order to avoid increased agglomeration of nanodiamond powders. Inthe study of Livramento et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311421636">22</xref></sup> a homogeneous distribution of nanodiamond particles with high fractions in the range of 10–30 at.% was achieved for Cumatrix using ball milling. However, these powders were not sintered for further microstructural characterizations, physical and wear property evaluations of composites. Currently, there exist no comprehensive studies including the powder and the sinter characterizations of UDD-reinforced Al composites. Therefore, the main objective of this experimental research is to analyze the effect of both ball-milling time and content of nanodiamond particles on the microstructure, hardness, density, and wear properties of Al matrix composites.</p>

<p>In this investigation, Al (Alfa Aesar, &gt;99.7% purity, particle size ∼10 µm) and ultra-dispersed nanodiamond (UDD; up to 99.5% pure diamond, 2–50 nm) powders were used as starting materials. Technical specifications of the UDD powders, supplied by ALIT Co. from Ukraine produced using detonation technique are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311421636">Table 1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311421636">23</xref></sup> and the structure of UDD powders are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421636">Figure 1</xref>. X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of nanodiamond powders resulting from (111), (220), and (311) reflection planes at 2θ = 43.9°, 75.02°, and 91.1°, respectively, are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421636">Figure 1</xref>(a), while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421636">Figure1</xref>(b) is a representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of the UDD powders. XRD peaks are broad and wide owing to very small average crystallite size of UDD powders. Prior to ball-milling experiments, all powder batches were mixed for 3 h in a Labor<sup>TM</sup> turbula shaker mixer. For ball-milling experiments, a powder batch weighing total 8 g of Al powders containing 1%, 5%, and 10 wt.% UDD (now hereafter referred to as Al-1UDD, Al-5UDD, and Al-10UDD, respectively) were sealed in a hardened steel vial in a glovebox filled with argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Zinc stearate (2 wt.%) was used as a process control agent to retard excessive cold welding during the ball-milling process. Ball-milling was carried out for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min in a high-energy Spex 8000D<sup>TM</sup> Mixer/Mill using 6.36 mm stainless steel ballsas grinding media. A ball to powder weight ratio of 7 : 1 was used. The mechanically alloyed powders werelater cold-pressed uniaxially using a constant pressure of 700 MPa in a steel mold to form a 12 mm cylindrical compact. The compacts were degassed at 430°C for 1 h and then sintered at 640°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311421636">24</xref></sup> for 10 h in a Linn<sup>TM</sup> furnace under flowing argon gas condition. Theblended pure Al powders were also consolidated and sintered in order to compare the effects of nanodiamond on theproperties of Al and resulting microstructures. The consolidatedand sintered composites were analyzed in terms of microstructure, density, hardness, and wear properties.

<p>XRD investigations of both mechanical alloyed powders and the sintered samples were carried out using a Bruker<sup>TM</sup> 8D advance instrument with a standard CuK<sub>α</sub> radiation source employing a step size of 0.02° in 2θ. Cold mounted milled powders and hot mounted sectioned sintered samples were ground manually using 400, 600, 800, and 1200 grit SiC paper. After grinding, the alloyed powders and sintered samples were polished using 0.5 µm Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> using soft cloth prior to the XRD measurements. Thermal analyses were performed in TA<sup>TM</sup> differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instruments. Samples of ∼7 mg contained in α-alumina crucible were heated up to 650°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min. During the heating process, a stream of Ar and H<sub>2</sub> gases was introduced into the furnace at a flow rate of 30 mL/min and 5 mL/min, respectively. The particle size measurements of ball-milled powders were conducted using a Malvern<sup>TM</sup> laser particle size analyzer. Powders were dispersed in distilled water using an ultrasonic bath to prevent powder agglomeration and a surfactant was added into the powder slurry.</p>
<p>Microstructural and morphological investigations were conducted using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) JEOL<sup>TM</sup> JSM 7000 F operating at a voltage of 15 kV equipped with an IXRF<sup>TM </sup>energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Prior to SEM investigations, polished samples were etched using Keller’s reagent for 30 s. The specific surface areas (SAs) of ball-milled powders were measured by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Quantachrome<sup>TM</sup> Autosorb 1C apparatus. Before analysis, the milled samples were outgassed in helium for 12 h at 150°C. The sorption isotherms (quantity of argon adsorbed onto the sample surface at various pressures) were measured at 77 K and particle SA measurements were done using the Barret, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421636">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hardness measurements of sintered samples were obtained using a Shimadzu™ hardness tester under a load of 50 g for 15 s. Average hardness values with standard deviations were determined from 15 impressions of the sintered samples. The bulk densities of sintered samples were measured according to the Archimedes’ method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311421636">26</xref></sup> in ethanol as an immersion medium. In addition, a relative density for each sample was determined by using the density ratio of Archimedes density divided by the theoretical density which was calculated using the rule of mixtures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311421636">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wear properties were investigated using a Tribotechnic<sup>TM</sup> dry sliding reciprocating wear instrument by rubbing 1.587 µm steel balls (100 CR6-62 HRC) on the surfaces of the samples. A load of 1 N at normal atmospheric conditions (23°C and at about 50% relative humidity), a sliding velocity 10 mm/s, and a total sliding distance of 5 m were applied. Before wear test, each specimen was ground and polished to make sure that the wear surface was in complete contact with the surface of the steel ball (ISO 3290). The worn surfaces were examined by the SEM. Results of the wear tests were evaluated according to the volume of the material loss measured by a profilometer (Mahr<sup>TM</sup> Perhen S&amp;P Perthometer<sup>TM</sup>).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311421636"><title>Powder characterization</title>
<p>A quantitative information on the ball-milling behavior of powders can be obtained from the particle size distribution analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421636">Figure 2</xref>(a)–(c) shows the influence of increasing milling times on the particle size distribution results of the Al-1UDD, Al-5UDD, and Al-10UDD powders, respectively. For each composition, the particle size distributions shift significantly to the larger particle size values with the ball-milling time indicating the agglomeration of powders. Furthermore, increasing theball-milling time resulted in the narrower particle size distributions in each powder sample, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421636">Figure 2</xref>. In the case of Al-5UDD and Al-10UDD, as the milling time increases, the shape of particle size distribution changed from a mono-modal type to a bi-modal one, while Al-1UDD composite powders have a mono-modal type particle size distribution with ball-milling time. Therefore, it can be suggested that the amount of UDD particle in Al powders affect the shape of particle size distribution with increasing ball-milling time. When particle sizes of initial powders are significantly different,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311421636">28</xref></sup> Al-UDD powders tend to strongly agglomerate with increasing ball-milling durations due to the large SA of UDD particles. Furthermore, the increase in themean particle size (D<sub>50</sub>) of powders with ball-milling time indicates a strong interparticle bonding (physical) in the agglomerates.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311421636" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Particle size distributions of (a) Al-1UDD, (b) Al-5UDD, and (c) Al-10UDD powders ball-milled for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421636-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The effect of agglomeration with ball-milling durations can also be observed by the specific SA measurements performed on Al-1UDD, Al-5UDD, and Al-10UDD composite powders ball-milled for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The values of specific SA and the mean particle size, D<sub>50</sub> (taken as the 50% size of thecumulative particle size distribution), of composite powders as a function of both ball-milling time and UDD content are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311421636">Table 2</xref>. The SA of ball-milled powders decreases with increasing ball-milling time due to agglomeration of Al-UDD powders during ball-milling process. For each ball-milling time, SA of powders increases substantially with increasing UDD contents due to the high SA of the UDD powders (i.e., measured as about 277 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The SA results of composite powders after milling for 30 min increased from a value of 5.25 m<sup>2</sup>/g for the Al-1UDD to 18.57 m<sup>2</sup>/g for the Al-10UDD composite powders.

It should be noted here that similar powder morphologies as a function of ball-milling time were also observed for theAl-1UDD and Al-10UDD composite powders. Asshown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>(a), as-blended Al-5UDD powder particles, mixed for 3 h using a turbula mixer, are mostly elongated and irregular in shape and have a narrow size distribution. As revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>(b), the Al-5UDD powder particles were initially plastically deformed in the early stages of ball-milling resulting in flakes between irregular particles. When the ball-milling duration was increased to 60 min, mostly sharp-cornered powder morphologies were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>(c)). Afterward, particle agglomerates consisting of particles having 2 µm average sizes are noticeable in the SEM micrographs of the Al-5UDD composites ball-milled for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>(d)) and 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>(e)). Such behavior indicates that flake-like particles were cold welded to form larger particles which were maintained after 60 min of ball-milling time. Although mechanical alloying time increases from 90 to 120 min, no significant particle size refinement and morphological changes were obtained. This is likely due to the presence of the strong physical bonding between the fine particles in the agglomerates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311421636">29</xref></sup>

Furthermore, a slight broadening of peaks and diminishing of their intensities with ball-milling are due to decrease in the average Al crystallite size of powders and increase in the lattice strain content. This was explained by the continuous deformation and work hardening of powders during ball-milling process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311421636">31</xref></sup> The change in crystallite size with the increase in ball-milling time was determined by analyzing the broadening of the (111) Al peak, based on the Scherrer equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421636">1</xref></sup> In order to eliminate the instrumental contribution, peak width at half maximum (FWHM) determined from a well-annealed sample (300°C, 3 h) was subtracted from the observed peak width caused by ball-milling. The average grain sizes of the Al-10UDD composite were calculated approximately as 804, 416, and 259 nm for 30, 90, and 120 min of ball-milling times, respectively. This indicates that the average grain size in Al-10UDD composite powder decreased with increasing ball-milling times due to severe plastic deformation during milling process.

<p>As the ductile metal particles undergo severe plastic deformation, fracturing of particles create clean metalsurfaces. Where the powder particles overlap, metallurgical bonds are formed leading to particle growth and the formation of composite particles. Asball-milling process continues, the internal structure of the powders continues to be refined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421636">7</xref></sup> In addition to this, reinforcement phase enhances the hardness values of powders. Hence, the hardness values of Al-1UDD, Al-5UDD, and Al-10UDD powder particles can change during mechanical alloying, which are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421636">Figure 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421636">Figure 5</xref> shows that the hardness of all Al-UDD powders increases up to 90 min of ball-milling time and slightly decreases after this time. Considering hardness plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421636">Figure 5</xref>(a)–(c), it can also be suggested that ball-milling process has a more profound effect on the hardness of powders compared to that of the reinforcement phase. For example, the Al-10UDD powders ball-milled for 120 min are almost two timesharder than the same ball-milled for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421636">Figure 5</xref>(c)). An increment in hardness of milled powders was observed due to work hardening during ball-milling. For all ball-milled powder composites, decrease in hardness values beyond 90 min of ball-milling time suggests that the tendency for cold welding predominates over fracturing after 90 min of ball-milling time. On the other hand, the strain energy accumulates during ball-milling and reaches a maximum value at this stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421636">1</xref></sup> The maximum hardness value was measured as1.4 GPa for the Al-10UDD powders after ball-milling for 90 min.

Similar decrease in the hardness of powders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421636">Figure 5</xref>) after a certain ball-milling time was also observed in the study of Bhaduri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311421636">32</xref></sup> This behavior was explained by recovery and/or recrystallization phenomena which occur due to temperature increases (between 100°C and 200°C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421636">1</xref></sup> during ball-milling.

<p>The heat released measured by DSC during the heating of ball-milled particles is used to obtain useful information in the evolution of the reactions in solid-state during sintering. In this study, DSC analyses were performed to reveal the structural changes of the ball-milled Al-10UDD powders in the heating process. DSC traces of the Al-10UDD powders after ball-milling at different times are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311421636">Figure 8</xref>. The DSC curves of the Al-10UDD powders ball-milled at different durations (30, 60, 90, and 120 min.) display one endothermic peak at about 80°C, due to dehydration and\or decomposition of the process control agent (i.e.zinc stearate for the present work). For the Al-10UDD powders ball-milled for 90 min and 120 min, the areas of this endothermic peak became smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311421636">Figure 8</xref>(c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311421636">8</xref>(d)). This means that the amount of free surfactant decreases after 90 min of ball-milling time. It was noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311421636">36</xref></sup> in a previous work that for a heating rate of 20°C/min, the thermal decomposition of zinc stearate occurred at 128°C corresponding to its melting point. However, in this study, small endothermic peaks observed in the vicinity of 80°C probably correspond to the melting of zinc stearate whose equilibrium melting point decreased due to ball-milling. After ball-milling Al-10UDD powders for 90 and 120 min, sharp exothermic peaks emerged respectively at 603°C and 611°C in the DSC scans, while the same powders ball-milled for 30 and 60 min have low intensity and broad exothermic peaks. These exothermic peaks are likely due to the formation of Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> by a reaction between Al and nanodiamond. A similar exothermic peak was observed in a characterization study on the milled Al/C composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311421636">37</xref></sup> It can be suggested that all elemental phases (i.e., Al and C) react with each other after a certain milling time with temperature. When the ball-milling time increases from 60 to 90 and 120 min, high defect densities induced in the milling lead to large reaction interface areas between Al and UDD particles and shorten the diffusion distances to enable the formation of the Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3 </sub>phase. The exothermic peak temperature slightly increases from about 600 to 611°C when the milling time increases from 90 min to 120 min, and the peak becomes sharper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311421636">Figure 8</xref>(c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311421636">8</xref>(d)).

The relative density value of pure Al (ball milled for 90 min) is also presented in this figure to observe the effect of reinforcement. The sintered density depends on the milling time as well as the UDD content. Clearly, the relative density values increase with increasing UDD contents and reach a value of 95(%) for both the Al-5UDD and the Al-10UDD composites ball-milled for 90 min. The Al-5UDD composite sample prepared from powders ball-milled for 30 min showed the maximum relative density, over 98%, whereas this value reduced gradually with increasing ball-milling times. It is generally expected that the increase in ball-milling time leads to fine powder sizes which provide short diffusion distances between the constituents, and which enhance the densification during sintering. However, in the present study, in spite of increasing ball-milling time, the agglomeration of Al-5UDD powders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421636">Figure 3</xref>) considerably increased which made sintering more difficult. From this point of view, ball-milling time leads to a decrease in density of the Al-5UDD composite with extent of milling. However, homogeneously distributed reinforcement particles within a refined microstructure are desirable to improve the mechanical properties such as strength, elastic modulus, and wear resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311421636">39</xref></sup> Poor mechanical properties owing to the agglomeration of nanodiamond particles (5–30 at.%) in Cu composite were reported by Hanada et. al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311421636">13</xref></sup> although a high densification after fabrication via ball-milling following spark plasma sintering was obtained in the same study.

<p>Variations of wear resistance as a function of both nanodiamond content in Al matrix (i.e., sintered Al-1UDD, Al-5UDD, and Al-10UDD composites prepared from the 90 min of ball-milled powders) and ball-milling time (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) for the sintered Al-5UDD composites are examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>. As expected, the hardness values increase linearly with increasing weight fraction of UDD in the Al matrix, thatis, a maximum value of about 3 GPa is achieved for the Al-10UDD composite while the hardness value of the pure Al is 0.5 GPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>(a)). The increase in hardness can be attributed to the incorporation of UDD particles with increasing content as well as the presence of hard Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> phase particles formed during sintering.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>(a), the wear resistance of the Al-UDD composites increases with increasing content of reinforcement particles. Increasing the content of UDD particles from 0 wt.% through 10 wt.%, the wear resistance increased approximately by 40 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>(a)), whereas about sixfold higher resistance was achieved in the wear of the Al-5UDD composite after 30 min of ball milling than the unmilled Al-5UDD sintered composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>(b)).

The coefficient of friction decreases rapidly with the addition of UDD particles, as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311421636">Figure 12</xref>(a). Al-10UDD composite has the lowest coefficient of friction of 0.33, while sintered unreinforced Al exhibited an average coefficient of friction of 0.75. The friction coefficients of Al-1UDD and Al-5UDD are around 0.4 whereas slightly lower friction coefficient (0.33) is observed forthe Al-10UDD composite, despite the fact that a significant decrease in friction coefficient with increasing content of UDD is to be expected. Therefore, it is believed that friction coefficient values decrease probably due to higher UDD contents and oxides built up on the sliding surface of the Al-10UDD composite. Recently, Hanada and Sano<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021998311421636">42</xref></sup> studied the friction and wear behavior of an Al-Si-based composites reinforced with detonation nanodiamonds under a sliding load of 0.2 N and a sliding speed of 0.5 mm/s.

It was notified that<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311421636">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021998311421636">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998311421636">44</xref></sup> the volume fraction of reinforcement has the strongest effect on the wear and friction performance of reinforced Al composites in addition to the type and size of the reinforcement. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311421636">Figure 12</xref>(b) that friction coefficient (µ) is nearly independent of the milling time for the Al-5UDD composite, although a slightly high µ value was obtained in the composite ball-milled for 60 min compared to those ones milled for 90 and 120 min. It can be suggested that a little high hardness value of the composite ball-milled for 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311421636">Figure 11</xref>(b)) has an effect on the reduction of the friction coefficient. Thus, it can be stated that the incorporation of UDD into the Al-matrix leads to an improvement in the friction behavior of composites. Similarly, Quang and Okada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421636">18</xref></sup> reported that friction coefficient decreased very rapidly with the addition of 10 wt.% diamond clusters to Al and it remained constant for the Al containing 10–50 wt.% diamond clusters. They reported that excellent lubricating ability of ultrafine particles during the sliding friction process could provide low friction and good wear resistances to the Al-diamond composites.

<p>SEM investigations were carried out on the worn surfaces of sintered composites in order to determine the effective wear mechanism. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311421636">Figure 13</xref>(a) and (b) is typical worn surface appearances of Al-5UDD and Al-10UDD composites, respectively. The presence of rougher and deeper grooves parallel to the sliding direction in the microstructure of the Al-5UDD composite indicates that extensive plastic deformation associated with adhesive damage took place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311421636">Figure 13</xref>(a)). The worn surface appearance of the Al-10UDD composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311421636">Figure 13</xref>(b)) is quite different from the Al-5UDD composite sample. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311421636">Figure 13</xref>(b), smooth worn surfaces without large grooves and small amounts of spalling can be observed in the Al-10UDD composite. This is because both high hardness (3.3 GPa) and high UDD content enable the Al-10UDD composite to resist destructive action of the counterface (steel ball) during wear tests. On the basis of the corresponding EDS analysis taken from the region marked as A given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311421636">Figure 13</xref>(c) indicates that the mid-gray regions are belonging to the Al-rich areas with some transferred Fe from the steel counterface. Besides, the high amount of oxygen content detected in the EDS analysis from the frictional heating during the sliding wear. It was reported that<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998311421636">45</xref></sup> this oxide layer includes very fine, crystalline oxide particles, which have been compacted onto the surface of the composite, preexisting surface oxide layers, or compressed coarse wear debris. In addition, presence of large amount of fine particles on the worn surfaces of Al-10UDD composite is characterized by the oxidative wear. Furthermore, the decrease in friction coefficient of the Al-10UDD composite can be attributed to the development of an oxide layer, which acts as a lubricant, on the worn surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021998311421636">46</xref></sup> providing a protective layer preventing metallic contact and lowering wear rate. These kind of worn surface characterizationswere reported in several investigations on the dry sliding wear of metal matrix composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998311421636">47</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021998311421636">49</xref></sup>

<p>In the present study, three different Al-UDD composites were fabricated from Al powders reinforced with 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.% of UDD particles via ball-milling and sintering. Microstructural, thermal, physical, hardness, and wear properties of these composites were investigated. On the basis of the results reported in the present investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn:
<list id="list1-0021998311421636" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>With increasing milling times, the average particle size of ball-milled Al-UDD powders increases with increasing milling time due to powder agglomeration. Their hardness increases with the UDD content and with increasing ball-milling times up to 90 min.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>XRD investigations revealed only α-Al peaks in ball-milled Al-UDD powders and peaks belonging to α-Al and Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> phases in all sintered Al-UDD composites. DSC and XRD analyses verified that the Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> phase forms approximately between 600°C and 615°C in the microstructure of Al-UDD composites.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing the UDD content improves hardness and wear properties of the sintered Al-UDD composites. A maximum hardness value of 3 GPa was measured for the Al-10UDD composite which is six times higher than that of pure Al. The wear resistance of the sintered Al-10UDD composite is 40 times better than unreinforced sintered Al.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The friction coefficient values decrease with the incorporation and increase of UDD contents in the sintered Al-UDD composites, however ball-milling durations have no significant effect on the friction coefficient of the composites.</p></list-item>
