<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2006, an estimated 37 million people in the United States—12% of the population—were 65 years and older. Projections forecast that by 2030, approximately 71.5 million people will be 65 years and older, representing nearly 20% of the total US population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111418778">1</xref>
</sup> As the population continues to age, this group of individuals will make increasing demands on the health care system. Primary care physicians, such as internists and family medicine practitioners, will spend more time in end-of-life (EOL) care planning and discussions with their patients and patients’ families.</p>
<p>In addition, advances in interventions and preventive care have changed the character of the end of life in America. Fewer than 25% of US deaths are now caused by cancer, with the majority of deaths due to chronic conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111418778">2</xref>
</sup> Yet because people are living longer, the likelihood that they reach old age with a multitude of morbid conditions has also increased. Patients often present with a variety of chronic diseases that result in complex care.</p>
<p>Hospice provides excellent EOL care for patients and their families,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111418778">3</xref>
</sup> yet data show that hospice is underutilized and the median length of stay in hospice is declining.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111418778">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111418778">5</xref>
</sup> Two main barriers to physician referral of patients to hospice include issues of prognosis—uncertainty or inaccuracy in predicting death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111418778">6</xref>
</sup>—and issues of communication—how to talk to patients and their families about dying.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111418778">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111418778"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111418778"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111418778">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These difficulties may be magnified in patients with multimorbid medical conditions—often characterized as “debility, unspecified”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111418778">11</xref>
</sup>—where both the timing and content of conversations about EOL issues may pose difficulties for providers. For these patients, there is no single, clear “terminal” diagnosis that precipitates the transition to EOL care, nor is there often a sentinel event that signals a marked and clear decline. Rather, the up and down nature of many of these patients’ medical courses adds to the difficulty in predicting accurately the patients’ deaths.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111418778">12</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, knowing how to refer to this group of patients with sensitive but accurate terminology presents a challenge to practitioners.</p>
<p>There are no data on how the 2 barriers to hospice referral discussed in the preceding paragraph influence physicians caring for patients with this complex medical situation, or whether the nature of the conditions themselves magnifies these barriers. That is, it is unclear how the development and implementation of prognostic tools for patients with multiple chronic conditions could improve predictive accuracy and, as a result, improve the timing of physicians’ EOL conversations with patients and their families. Moreover, there are also no widely known “scripts” available to assist physicians in discussing the appropriateness of hospice or other EOL care with patients and families of patients who have multimorbidities, although structured interviews exist for use with specific medical conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111418778">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In an effort to address these knowledge gaps, we conducted focus group interviews with primary care physicians and house staff to ask them about their experiences with elderly patients who had multiple comorbidities (MCM). Our hypothesis was that both the lack of prognostic certainty and the lack of good communication tools contributed to physicians’ discomfort with initiating EOL conversations with patients and families of patients with these conditions, especially when compared with patients and families of patients who had a single, clear terminal diagnosis (eg, pancreatic cancer).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This pilot study used focus groups to gather qualitative data because of their capacity to stimulate “brainstorming” on a particular topic through the groups’ dynamics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111418778">14</xref>
</sup> A literature review revealed that patients with multiple morbidities presented unique challenges to their providers, but that providers did not ascribe these difficulties to a particular source. In order to design an intervention to address this question, it would be important to understand why providers find it more difficult to have EOL conversations with their multimorbid patients. To that end, we asked participants about prognostic uncertainty and communication issues related to these patients in particular.</p>
<p>This study was funded by the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and approved by local Institutional Review Board (IRB#: 562-08-EX).</p>
<sec id="section3-1049909111418778">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Eligible focus group participants were identified as generalist faculty physicians or house officers in Internal Medicine or Family Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Researchers used both a modified Dillman method<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111418778">15</xref>
</sup> and a “key contact” approach<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111418778">16</xref>
</sup> to recruit participants. Agreement to participate in a focus group constituted informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111418778">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Based on the knowledge gaps about prognostic accuracy and communication difficulties, as well as a review of the literature, the research team developed questions and prompts to guide the focus group discussions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111418778">Table 1</xref>). Focus group questions were semistructured and explored 3 general themes (1) differences between having an EOL conversation with patients/families of patients with a diagnosis “debility, unspecified” versus a single, terminal diagnosis; (2) timing of the EOL conversation with a diagnosis “debility, unspecified” patient and/or family; and (3) approaches to the EOL conversation with a diagnosis “debility, unspecified” patient and/or family.</p>

<p>In January 2009, 4 hour-long focus groups were conducted at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The focus groups were facilitated by one of the study team’s principal investigators, a PhD-trained bioethicist. Three additional research team members assisted conducting the focus groups by running audio equipment, scribing responses on a flip chart, and taking more detailed handwritten notes. The clinician on the research team did not take part in conducting focus groups to minimize possible responder bias. Prior to the start of each focus group, participants were asked to complete a 1-page intake form that collected basic demographic information and previous experience with the study topic. The focus groups began with the facilitator explaining the purpose of the study and reviewing the ground rules for the discussion. All sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909111418778">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data from the completed intake forms were entered into an Excel database for basic descriptive analysis. A modified framework approach<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111418778">17</xref>
</sup> was used to analyze the focus group transcripts. This modified content analysis approach uses a deductive process to develop a basic set of categories for coding, in this case informed by the focus group questions and notes taken during focus groups, and then through constant comparison refines and builds on these categories with inductive analysis of the transcripts. NVivo qualitative software (QSR International’s NVivo 8) was used by 2 qualitative analysts who independently coded each of the focus group transcripts and then used an iterative process to compare coding results until agreement was reached. The qualitative analysts produced a series of finding reports incorporating all the identified categories/themes using NVivo coding summaries. As an additional step to triangulate the findings, the clinical investigator from the research team also performed a separate in-depth analysis of the transcripts utilizing a more inductive approach; again an iterative process was used to reach final agreement of the focus group findings. The focus group finding reports were reviewed and verified by all members of the research team.</p>

<p>Of the 32 participants, 15 (46.9%) had participated in an EOL conversation with a patient, or family of a patient, with a diagnosis of “debility, unspecified.” In addition, 26 (81.3%) had participated in these discussions about EOL care when the diagnosis was debility, unspecified as a friend or family member, and not as a doctor.</p>
<p>Based on the primary questions we asked of focus group participants, 3 themes emerged. They are discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111418778">
<title>Theme 1: Differences in EOL Conversations</title>
<p>Focus group participants overwhelmingly expressed the opinion that it is more difficult for them to have EOL conversations with patients with MCM and their families, as opposed to conversations with families and patients who have a clear, terminal diagnosis. According to the focus group participants, a clear, terminal diagnosis makes EOL conversations easier both for the patients themselves (and their families) and for the physicians charged with their care because this type of diagnosis is more clearly understood by patients and families, and its course is more predictable.<disp-quote>
<p>I think the journey is easier, easier to explain to the patient and the family also when there is a known terminal diagnosis and a known prognosis.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to answer the family’s questions and the patient’s questions, too, when you have somebody who has stage IV lung cancer, you can say this is percent survival at this time and based on what your disease is rather than this conglomeration of all the things that are going wrong. It’s hard to predict for them how long they’ll be around and how to plan for things.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants also believed that this type of diagnosis (that is, a single, prominent disease) is easier for patients and families to accept, because the blame for the patient’s condition can be placed on a clear cause.<disp-quote>
<p>I mean that’s not the sense that I try to portray, but the family sometimes and the patient feel like they need to pin it on something. It’s because of this specifically. And so it’s easier when you have … a specific diagnosis that you can say ‘This is the reason.’</p>
<p>We can treat congestive heart failure. We can treat the decubitus ulcer. We can treat the renal failure. Each of these things in and of itself is potentially treatable if not curable, but when you put them all together and somebody who just seems to be falling like dominos and falling apart like a house of cards. We all know from our experience that person will not do well. But it’s really hard when you get a family member who says ‘You know, I’ve read up on this and a little antibiotics will take care of the pneumonia.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Additionally, participants reported that patients and families with a clear, terminal diagnosis are less likely to seek second opinions than those with MCM. Conversely, in order for patients and families to understand the nature of their condition, more education and more time are required in the MCM context to arrive at EOL care decisions.<disp-quote>
<p>And I think that’s back where the education part is in reviewing with them ‘Well, this happened or when that happened, but that’s part of the process’ and to review this for them to help them create an image of that their parent or loved one is actually dying. So those are the pieces I see in the debility conversation that are critical and do take more time and more effort.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The progression of their condition is often unclear, and because decline is often less obvious, some patients with MCM and their families believe that they are seeing improvement even if that is not the case, which complicates decision making.</p>
<p>For a team of providers caring for patients with a clear, terminal diagnosis (as opposed to those with MCM), it is easier to reach consensus on the prognosis of the patient’s condition and an appropriate plan of care. Participants also believed that it is easier to approach and conduct EOL discussions with these patients and their families, because they are able to use statistical evidence, especially with oncologic disease, and to provide a better timeline. Cancer appears to be a special case in that patients and families seem to understand that cancer is often terminal, while on the other hand patients and families seem to believe that other diseases with comparable life expectancies (eg, heart failure or renal disease) can be treated or cured.<disp-quote>
<p>But people will seem to think there’s a cure for everything but cancer now. But people can somehow accept that ‘I have cancer, I’m going to die.’ But everything else it seems like ‘Well, why don’t you fix that problem’ like ‘There’s medicines, there’s stuff to do.’ And they’re not nearly as accepting of any other diagnosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another important difference between EOL conversations with patients with clear, terminal diagnoses and patients with MCM is that with a clear, terminal diagnosis, providers and patients focus on the diagnosis itself, whereas with MCM, the focus tends to be more on the quality of life of the patient.<disp-quote>
<p>And then you’ll have someone who—of the same age who has all these morbidities and has a terrible quality of life, so it’s kind of simpler talking to them because you can say “Look at Mom, look at Dad, they’ve got—this is their quality of life right now.” As opposed to someone else who is like “Well, I want to fight this” you know, even though they may have a terminal disease.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this case, if quality of life is poor, patients and families tend to be more open to EOL discussions. A patient with better quality of life will generally require more prognostic clarity before embarking on an EOL discussion, while patients with worse quality of life will not need such clarity. It also emerged in the focus group discussions that the presence of dementia is one clear factor that leads to a perceived low quality of life, which might prompt an EOL discussion.</p>
<p>Despite a general feeling that EOL conversations were markedly different with patients with a clear, terminal diagnosis than with patients having MCM, providers did report some similarities. They noted that, overall, the objective of the EOL conversation is the same and that often a “family meeting” style approach was used to arrive at a decision (though families tend to be more involved in EOL discussions involving patients with MCM, perhaps due to the complexity of the decision-making process, or the tendency of such patients to lack decision-making capacity). Because of frequent family involvement in these conversations, the outcomes of these discussions are often dependent on family dynamics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049909111418778">
<title>Theme 2: Timing of the EOL Conversation With MCM Patients/Families</title>
<p>In deciding when to raise the subject of EOL care with MCM patients and their families, participants reported that they rely on a number of signs to prompt these discussions. These signs can take the form of physical and/or social cues. Physical cues may include health status of the patient (especially significant weight loss), frequency of visits (outpatient or inpatient), efficacy of treatment, or decreased functional status. Some participants mentioned that the age of the patient also plays a role in physicians’ willingness to initiate these conversations, and they are more willing to do so with older patients. Participants were unaware of the existence of prognostic tools to aid them in estimating an MCM patient’s prognosis but were interested in learning more. Despite the role of physical cues in prompting these discussions, a major reason for the difficulty that physicians and residents face in initiating these discussions with MCM patients and families is that there is a lack of a clear threshold or prompting event.<disp-quote>
<p>Whereas, at what point do you have the conversation with your patient in the nursing home that has all these co-morbidities? And yes, this, at the time you establish the dementia diagnosis, you talk about a typical course for a dementia patient, although it’s extremely variable. But what, at what hospitalization, at what co-morbidity that pops up, do you then approach them and have this end-of-life conversation?</p>

</p>
<p>An exception to the above mentioned is that at least 1 focus group member was requesting a proceduralist to place a feeding tube in a failing MCM patient.</p>
<p>Social cues, on the other hand, may include establishment of a relationship or rapport with the patient and family, statements of patient readiness, or remarks about quality of life. Importantly, some participants also mentioned that their own perceived level of readiness was a factor in deciding to initiate an EOL conversation with an MCM patient or family.</p>
<p>Participants also discussed the timing of these conversations in terms of what they would consider to be “ideal” timing, versus when these conversations actually occur. Participants believed that EOL conversations should “ideally” take place before the patient gets sick, and the earlier, the better. They felt that sickness only adds to the anxiety felt by both patients and their families in confronting these issues.<disp-quote>
<p>… [I]t’s just I guess super important to have these conversations with patients before it gets to that point where it’s like “We need to make a decision now.” … Just talking about advanced directives and talking about “This is the status of your diabetes this year; this is where it might end up. And these are things we can do, but when it gets to that point, do we change our plan?” And just getting that out on the table, so it’s not a surprise.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For this reason, some participants reported that, if there is potential for improvement in a patient’s condition, they will sometimes wait to get the patient back to baseline before initiating the conversation. Additionally, some participants mentioned that they sometimes choose to have these discussions at post hospital visits, rather than in the hospital.</p>
<p>Despite strong opinions about the ideal timing for EOL conversations with MCM patients and families, participants were candid about when these conversations take place in practice.<disp-quote>
<p>Well, ideally it’s time before any of this comes up. We’re supposed to be doing this like the first time you see the patient, so that you don’t have to have an excuse to have the conversation. I grant you this often gets overlooked in the hectic pace of everything else we do.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They admitted that there is some confusion and uncertainty about the “right” time to initiate these discussions and that they often occur later because there is no obvious catalyst for the conversation; however, a physician may sense the need to broach the subject when a patient’s wishes seem to contradict medical reality (eg, the patient remains on full-code status despite declining over multiple hospitalizations). Also, participants mentioned that EOL issues may need to be brought up several times in order to prime patients and families to make decisions at a later date.</p>

<title>Theme 3: Approaches to the EOL Conversation with MCM Patients/Families</title>
<p>Participants mentioned taking a distinct approach to having EOL conversations with MCM patients and families, as opposed to patients with a clear, terminal diagnosis.</p>
<p>Participants mentioned 3 types of approaches to initiating EOL conversations with these patients and families. The first of these is a direct approach, whereby the physician introduces the topic after gauging the readiness and receptiveness of the patient and/or family to have a discussion about EOL care.<disp-quote>
<p>And giving them the option to ask them that question: ‘Do you want to know your prognosis?’ And if the patient says “no,” then that’s completely—that is a divergence point in your consultation. And there are some people who will flat out say ‘No, I don’t want to know. I want to know what I can do to beat this …’</p>
<p>… [T]hat’s what I do when I tell you I go in and say ‘These are the facts, this is my opinion. But you know what you guys need to take this. If you have any questions, think about it, talk about it with yourselves and talk about it with your doctor.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants noted that these conversations are usually more difficult when driven by the physician, though there are exceptions, such as when a patient’s family declines to bring up the subject of EOL care due to feelings of guilt, or simply because they do not know that engaging in EOL deliberations is an option.<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s affirming sometimes, especially if you’re saying “Maybe you should let it go, maybe you should not do this, maybe you should do hospice” because a lot—I mean everybody knows all the guilt associated with especially if you’re making a decision for your own—for a family member. The guilt of saying “Okay, let’s stop.” So, I think if another person and someone that’s in a position of leadership or that you’re supposed to respect taking care of your family members says “It’s okay to do this and I know you’re going to feel guilty, but it’s okay to make this decision.” I think that it takes a big weight off people’s chests and allows them to even discuss it.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think we just need to empower patients or families. It is okay to forego treatment, to forego burdensome treatment. Sometimes they don’t realize this.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants stated that a more effective option is the second method, the indirect approach, through which the physician attempts to get the patient or family to begin the conversation. Participants mentioned that a physician might do this by asking the patient or patient’s family how they think the patient is doing.<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t say to the families “I think you should consider hospice for their heart failure.” I think its time has come, that they’re so sick that their end of life is near and maybe a different option besides cure is maybe it’s time to have them more comfortable and the focus on their dignity and relieve suffering. And then start talking that way. But I don’t necessarily get into the details of each diagnosis. I don’t talk about the pulmonary pressures or anything. It’s just a very global conversation about what their goals are and what they believe their loved ones would want in this time.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The third option mentioned by participants is a collaborative approach, which was felt by participants to be the most structured approach to initiating these conversations and making EOL care decisions. In the collaborative approach, physicians call a “family meeting.” Participants believed that setting a dedicated time and place for such a meeting allows for a private conversation and involves everyone who should take part in the discussion. Establishing ground rules is an important part of this process so that the opinions of all participants are respected and questions are answered. The physician’s roles in the collaborative approach are to initiate the meeting, provide information for the family to discuss, and serve as the facilitator. An important aspect of the facilitation role is that it is the physician’s responsibility to end the meeting with clear decisions and to try to ensure that everyone is on the same page.<disp-quote>
<p>I think some of the most successful conversations like this that I have seen have been preplanned, so whoever needs to get there has time to get there …. You kind of make it clear and we all agree on it as a group, so that we don’t leave the room and keep rehashing …. So we just make very clear decisions. And kind of make sure that everybody’s on the same page and give everyone a chance to bring things up if they have issues with what’s going on or being said and those kinds of things, and I think giving everyone a voice in the conversation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In describing conversations with MCM patients and families, participants mentioned predictors that helped them ascertain whether these conversations would go well or poorly. They also reported that certain words or phrases could have a considerable effect on the outcome of the conversation. Finally, participants brought up other considerations that played into EOL conversations and decision making, including patient and family education, patients’ wishes, family dynamics, and physicians’ personal experiences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Elderly patients with MCM present unique challenges to their health care providers. For one thing, practice guidelines for one condition may be ineffectual or contraindicated with the presence of another major disease process and its recommended intervention.<sup>

</sup> Yet none of these diagnosis categories properly indicates that the patients in this situation face a terminal prognosis; these patients are dying, and ensuring appropriate EOL care planning requires that both health care providers and patients and their families address this fact. This is made difficult when physicians from various specialties are only able to provide information on a specific body system, and even more difficult still is the coordination and communication between these specialties. Nurses have been pointed to as the “nodal points for exchange of information” in similar situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111418778">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to determine whether, in fact, it is more difficult to engage in EOL care conversations with elderly patients with MCM and their families. The focus group results confirm that providers observe a qualitative difference in having EOL conversations with these patients and their families when compared with patients who have a single, terminal diagnosis. Participants reported requiring additional time to explain the course of the condition and its likely outcome prior to engaging in any sort of EOL care planning. However, research shows that all EOL discussions require additional time: time to develop trust with the patient and family,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111418778">28</xref>
</sup> time for patients to ask questions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418778">29</xref>
</sup> to express needs and preferences,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909111418778">30</xref>
</sup> and to process information before making a decision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909111418778">31</xref>
</sup> Strategies are available to have these conversations more efficiently.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Many of the participants’ comments about the differences in having EOL conversations with elderly patients with MCM when compared with patients with a clear terminal diagnosis reflect assumptions about patients’ and families’ knowledge, dispositions, and attitudes. For example, participants asserted that having cancer is easier to understand (and predict) than having congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and dementia. Yet there are no empiric data to demonstrate that this is the case. One could argue that conversations with patients with cancer and their families are easier for providers because they can rely on statistics and staging to explain complicated medical processes, and that having one clear scapegoat helps to direct patients’ and families’ emotions away from the health care team. Clearly, more research is needed into both patients’ and families’ understanding of their condition, as well as providers’ psychological needs when delivering bad news.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049909111418778">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Timing the EOL conversation optimally remained elusive to most focus group participants. While there was agreement that ideally the conversation should occur prior to acute illness or hospitalization, the reality is that such occurrences are often substitutes for sentinel events like a terminal diagnosis. Participants’ eagerness to learn more about prognostic indices for this population of patients suggests that some of the barriers to initiating an EOL conversation might be alleviated if providers thought they had a clearer picture of the likely course of the patient’s condition. Future research includes educating providers about and evaluating the success of the use of prognostic indices for this patient population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049909111418778">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, despite the vast amounts of literature that exist about health care communication in EOL situations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111418778">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049909111418778">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049909111418778">39</xref>

</sup> the conversation itself remains a barrier for some health care professionals. There are scripts that can help with EOL conversations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049909111418778">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049909111418778">42</xref>

</sup> and it may be feasible to adapt those scripts specifically to this patient population. Alternatively, identifying the unique challenges in the nature of the information being communicated or in the structure of the conversation in these interactions may assist providers in overcoming real or perceived barriers. Identifying and educating health care providers about the skills required for effective communication in these encounters is another way to overcome barriers. One suggestion is to view the process from a “big picture” perspective,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111418778">28</xref>
</sup> and to begin discussing EOL and palliative care at the beginning of the dying “trajectory,” which accounts for emotional, informational, and biographical aspects of the patient and not just physiological features.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049909111418778">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The composition of the focus groups constitutes both a strength and a limitation of this research. We mixed residents and attending faculty, internal medicine and family medicine, and geriatricians and generalists. To the extent that all of the groups indicated above care for older patients with MCM routinely, their mixing is appropriate. In addition, as with all focus groups, we thought that practitioners with varied backgrounds and levels of experience could together create a catalytic account of a common experience. Yet if we truly wanted to investigate the contributions that education, specialty, and experience made to caring for these patients, participants should have been placed in separate focus groups accordingly. It is also possible that house staff were less candid in offering their opinions in the presence of senior physicians in their focus groups.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the current study is its structure. We used a key contact method of recruitment in 2 departments from 1 mid-Western academic medical center. There is no way to guarantee that the views discussed by these participants are representative of the general population of either health care providers or of patients and their families.</p>
<p>In conclusion, future research is needed to determine ways to overcome both the real and perceived barriers to having EOL conversations with older patients with MCM and their families. Facilitating effective communication and optimal times for this patient population may better respect patient autonomy, improve overall quality of life, and enhance provider–patient relationships.</p>
