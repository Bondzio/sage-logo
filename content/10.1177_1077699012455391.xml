<abstract>
<p>Satisfaction is commonly monitored by news organizations because it is an antecedent to readership. In fact, countless studies have shown the satisfaction–readership relationship to be true. Still, an essential question remains: Is satisfaction the only, or even the critical, thing to focus on with readership? This research indicates that the answer is no. Two other related constructs, reader experiences and engagement, affect reader behavior even more than does satisfaction. The discussion provides examples of how to increase engagement and calls for experimental research to understand how news organizations can positively affect engagement and thereby readership.</p>

<p>The preponderance of scholarly attention to the newspaper business—for all the trouble it is in—has focused on economic or structural factors and their impact on democracy and the public sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012455391">1</xref></sup> In the current research, we consider another point of view: that of the reader. Although the reader, or the customer, has received far greater attention in the strategic communication literature, we see a clear need to bring the perspective of the reader to journalists and journalism scholars. The customer’s point of view seems particularly relevant now as customers are continuing to abandon printed news and also adopting alternative news products and services via the Internet, mobile devices, and other media. Despite some good news about increased newspaper circulation revenue, a result of companies raising prices, newspaper circulation fell in 2010—albeit at a slower pace than in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012455391">2</xref></sup> Then in 2011, despite the Audit Bureau of Circulation’s launch of a new circulation measurement, a summary number for total average circulation, the picture was no rosier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012455391">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>What we know for sure is that in a business environment in which the loss of a print newspaper reader is not economically replaced—in terms of the financial contribution to the organization’s business model—by the gain of an online or mobile user, this continues to be troubling. Much has been written about these circumstances and their consequences for reportorial journalism and democracy. The primacy of the focus has been on the key role newspapers have played in original reporting. In its 2010 report on U.S. journalism, the Project for Excellence in Journalism explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>For newspapers, which still provide the largest share of reportorial journalism in the United States, the metaphor that comes to mind is sand in an hourglass. The shrinking money left in print, which still provides 90% of the industry’s funds, is the amount of time left to invent new revenue models online. The industry must find a new model before that money runs out.</p>
<p>The losses are already enormous. To quantify the impact, with colleague Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute we estimate that the newspaper industry has lost $1.6 billion in annual reporting and editing capacity since 2000, or roughly 30%. That leaves an estimated $4.4 billion remaining. Even if the economy improves we predict more cuts in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012455391">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, more cuts did come in 2010. In the 2011 report, “Among the major sectors, only newspapers suffered continued revenue declines last year—an unmistakable sign that the structural economic problems facing newspapers are more severe than those of other media. When the final tallies are in, we estimate 1,000 to 1,500 more newsroom jobs will have been lost—meaning newspaper newsrooms are 30% smaller than in 2000.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012455391">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>So while there are concerted and important efforts to monetize online and mobile use and to reinvent the news business model based on these evolving media, the print newspaper—the industry’s cash cow—should not be neglected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012455391">6</xref></sup> Moreover, we must recognize that new forms of distribution will not solve the problem print newspapers face. If content, however distributed, fails to attract readers/users, no business model can ultimately be successful.</p>
<p>Journalism must thus confront the critical question: How do newspapers stop losing readers and even begin to attract new readers? And this leads specifically to another question: What are antecedents of readership that newspaper practitioners can affect? To answer these questions, we must focus on the reader—or consumer. Traditionally, to the extent that newspapers have focused on the reader as consumer, this has meant measuring and, ideally, improving customer satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012455391">7</xref></sup> Our contribution in this article is to expand this focus to include readers’ experiences with news content and their engagement with it.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012455391">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Marketing practitioners and scholars have long realized the centrality of the consumer in developing strategies for marketing goods and services. While the construct of customer satisfaction has played a prominent role in understanding the behavior of consumers, in recent years a growing body of research has addressed consumers’ experiences with brands. Recently Brakus, Schmitt, and Zarantonello offered a typology of such experiences: the product experience, the shopping and service experience, the consumption experience, and ultimately the brand experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012455391">8</xref></sup> The value of the research of Brakus, Schmitt, and Zarantonello in our work is that, in addition to having proven reliable across studies, it has face validity for application to the news media. It is reasonable to assume that consumers potentially have all these experiences with media outlets or, as we prefer, media brands since many brands, such as the <italic>Washington Post</italic>, distribute content across multiple outlets under one brand umbrella.</p>
<p>The product experience comes from direct or indirect contact with a product. It happens, for example, when a consumer logs onto <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://WashingtonPost.com">WashingtonPost.com</ext-link> to scan the morning’s headlines (direct contact) or when she or he sees the newspaper being carried by a character on a television show or in an advertisement (indirect contact). The shopping and service experience may or may not be intermediated when it comes to media brands. Calling the <italic>Washington Post</italic> to buy a subscription represents an unmediated shopping and service experience, in which there is contact between the customer and the newspaper. However, there is also a shopping and service experience when a customer goes into a local bookstore—its contextual variables of lighting, noise, and service, as examples, are out of the control of the <italic>Washington Post</italic>, but are fundamental to the customer experience. The consumption experience, which can come by way of use or readership, is easily understood. Brakus, Schmitt, and Zarantonello suggested that brand experience, the fourth and final one they highlighted, is different from the others in that it looks beyond “utilitarian product attributes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012455391">9</xref></sup> They “conceptualize[d] brand experience as subjective, internal consumer responses (sensations, feelings, and cognitions) and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand’s design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012455391">10</xref></sup> That is, how does a consumer think and feel about reading the <italic>Washington Post</italic> as part of her or his life? Although there has been a clear resistance on the part of journalists to consider their content as a “brand,” from the perspective of the consumer, media entities are brands (in addition to being content producers).</p>
<p>Thus, if journalism is to adapt a renewed focus on the reader as consumer, we will need to understand consumers not only in terms of satisfaction, but also in terms of the brand experiences readers have in consuming news content in their lives. Both satisfaction and experiences relate to what makes content valuable to readers. Satisfaction, however, relates to how consumers evaluate various aspects of content that they consider important. It is a positive or negative reaction to those aspects of the content. The reader either likes or dislikes a featured columnist. The experience of content, however, is much less narrow. Experiences relate to how content fits into the life of the reader. If a reader often talks to other people about what a columnist has written, the experience is one of gaining social currency that helps the reader to have more meaningful social interactions with others.</p>
<p>Now, both satisfaction and experiences are important. But experiences have been neglected in readership research. The present research seeks to redress this imbalance. Furthermore, we seek to show that, if anything, experiences are the more powerful driver of reader behavior. Before stating formal hypotheses, it is necessary to bring one more important construct into the discussion.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077699012455391">
<title>Understanding Engagement</title>
<p>In both arenas, marketing and journalism, the term <italic>engagement</italic> has been readily used, and often misused—both causing confusion about the definition of the word and affecting the usefulness of the concept in research and in practice. The disagreement regarding the nature of the role of television in civic engagement, whether the influence of television be positive or negative, is an example of how differing definitions, and specifically how the construct of engagement is operationalized, can create different results even in high-quality research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012455391">11</xref></sup> So while researchers tend to rely on mathematically reliable multi-item measures of engagement, as in work by Livingstone and Markham, we cannot be assured that engagement is similarly defined in each body of research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012455391">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>While this is all valuable research, it points up the need to be clear about how the term <italic>engagement</italic> is being used and how it relates to other constructs. The approach here follows previous research conducted by Mersey, Malthouse, and Calder. In that work, they put forth a definition of engagement, “as the collective experiences that readers or viewers have with a media brand.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012455391">13</xref></sup> (As previously discussed, an experience is a specific set of beliefs that consumers have about how some media brand fits into their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012455391">14</xref></sup>) Engagement as employed here simply represents the cumulative experience of the readers across the entire range of ways that content affects their lives. We rely on this definition of engagement in this study. This research extends what was previously done in that it looks at potential consequences of engagement that are relevant to media professionals and scholars. It also addresses the relationship between engagement and satisfaction.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077699012455391">
<title>Engagement, Satisfaction, and Readership</title>
<p>Satisfaction is commonly monitored by newspapers because it is an antecedent to readership. In fact, studies have shown that satisfaction is associated with usage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012455391">15</xref></sup> In addition, researchers have used measures of satisfaction to make comparisons across groups—between local and nonlocal users and between online-only and print-and-online users—and to examine the relationship between news websites’ interactive features and user satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012455391">16</xref></sup> Still, an essential, open question remains: How does a news organization produce satisfaction?</p>
<p>We find some instruction in the marketing literature. Johnson, Anderson, and Fornell identified three antecedents of satisfaction: performance effect, expectation effect, and disconfirmation effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012455391">17</xref></sup> According to the authors, performance effect “refers to the customers’ perceived level of product quality relative to the price they pay” and expectation effect “capture[s] customers’ existing attitudes or beliefs regarding expected levels of performance,” leaving the third antecedent, disconfirmation effect, “in which the principal determinant of individual-level satisfaction is the degree to which perceived performance confirms or disconfirms performance expectations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012455391">18</xref></sup> Expectancy, which plays a key role in the effects pinpointed by Johnson, Anderson, and Fornell, is also essential in the uses and gratifications model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012455391">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The uses and gratifications model is at its root about motivations and their consequences. As noted by Mersey, “The uses and gratifications approach simply asserts that individuals use the mass media to gratify their needs, and it stakes its strength in its ability to allow the study of individual psychological desires and motives across channels and content. The underlying premise of the uses and gratifications model is an active audience composed of self-aware, message-seeking, message-selecting individuals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012455391">20</xref></sup> Despite those who attest that audiences are not sufficiently self-aware to understand exactly why they use media, Stone argued, “People will not attend to messages that have no perceived interest value for them. They will choose among media content offering those items they deem valuable, even if that value is only momentary enjoyment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012455391">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Palmgreen and Rayburn drew attention to the theoretical value of uses and gratifications by drawing connections to expectancy value theory from social psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012455391">22</xref></sup> According to them, expectancy value theory “view[s] either behavior, behavioral intentions, or attitudes (or all three) as a function of (1) expectancy (or belief)—that is, the probability that an attitude object possesses a particular attribute or that a behavior will have a particular consequence—and (2) evaluation—that is the degree of affect, positive or negative, toward an attribute or behavioral outcome.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012455391">23</xref></sup> This theoretical approach has been used by others but some of the most interesting and relevant findings comes from Palmgreen and Rayburn’s early research, which focused on television news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012455391">24</xref></sup> First, they identified antecedents to gratifications sought: “beliefs concerning attributes of media objects along with evaluations of these beliefs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012455391">25</xref></sup> Although Palmgreen and Rayburn were working within television news, their findings may extend to newspapers. Readers’ expectations and evaluations of newspapers influence their gratification-seeking behavior, which in turn influences their newspaper readership.</p>
<p>The existing literature thus supports the hypothesis that satisfaction is related to readership, and the present research aims to confirm this. The goal, however, is to go beyond this to show that engagement, as defined here, is also related to readership. Thus,</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012455391" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> Engagement is positively associated with readership (or use), and the relationship is stronger than the relationship between satisfaction and readership.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> Engagement is positively associated with satisfaction.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second hypothesis is based on the idea that while engagement itself can be a source of satisfaction, satisfaction will ordinarily depend on evaluation of other things as well. The timeliness of newspaper deliveries may well affect satisfaction quite apart from the reader’s engagement with content. Similarly, engagement may reflect factors that do not enter into judgments of satisfaction.</p>
<p>In addition, without specific theoretical instruction as to the role of satisfaction as a potential mediator, the following research question is posed:</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012455391" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> Does satisfaction mediate, either partially or fully, the relationship between experiences and readership?</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data sample comes from the New Readers study conducted by the Readership Institute, funded by the Newspaper Association of America. The details of the survey, including the survey and newspapers studied, are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.readership.org">www.readership.org</ext-link>. The purpose of the study was to examine how newspaper-reading experiences differ for readers of various ethnic and age groups. Because of this focus, newspaper markets with large populations of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians were oversampled. The National Family Opinion marketing research panel was used as a sampling frame. First, fifty-two U.S. markets were identified that would yield sufficiently large samples for the comparisons. Next, they sent screeners to approximately 106,000 households to identify readers of the local newspaper, including 81,000 from the panel and an additional randomly selected 25,000 to augment the panel in some markets. After identifying readers of the papers, they sent a random sample of 19,575 a twelve-page questionnaire with a $2 incentive. They received 10,858 responses, giving a 55% response rate from the list of readers.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077699012455391">
<title>Customer Satisfaction</title>
<p>The single-item measure, labeled <italic>overall satisfaction</italic>, was measured by the question, “Overall, what rating would you give to this newspaper?” Respondents were asked to provide an overall rating for the newspaper on a 5-point semantic differential scale. We believe that a single-item measure is acceptable because of the research of Bergkvist and Rossiter, which demonstrated that single-item measures achieve the same predictive ability as multi-item measures, provided that the focal construct is concrete and singular in nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012455391">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077699012455391">
<title>Experiential Engagement</title>
<p>We organized experiences following Calder, Malthouse, and Schaedel, who conceptualized the aggregate set of experiences that people have with a newspaper as <italic>engagement</italic>, which is a reflective second-order construct manifested in first-order experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012455391">27</xref></sup> Measuring experiential engagement thus requires a sample of experiences from its construct domain. We drew a sample of experiences, measured them with multi-item scales, and factor-analyzed the experience factors to identify a second-order engagement factor.</p>
<p>Calder and Malthouse studied the experiences readers have with newspapers by doing 275 in-depth qualitative interviews, which produced items for a quantitative survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012455391">28</xref></sup> Exploratory factor analysis of the resulting items identified forty-four experiences. We adopt parts of their instrument for the present study, but space constraints did not allow us to measure all forty-four experiences on this survey, and we had to sample from the construct domain.</p>
<p>In selecting a set of experiences, the first step is to define the extent of the engagement construct domain. One characterization of this extent is uses and gratifications. McQuail gives a concise summarization that is often cited, dividing reader experiences with newspapers into the four general areas: information, personal identity, integration and social interaction, and entertainment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012455391">29</xref></sup> The experiences used in this study are meant to span these four main areas. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012455391">Table 1</xref> lists the experiences and items.</p>

<p>The social experience involves talking about and sharing what they have read with others. By reading the paper, readers become more interesting to other people and can better connect with others. The timeout experience is one of having a break and forgetting about everything else, of being transported into a better mood or state of mind. The civic experience is based on people’s belief that news organizations are vital to the well-being of a community because they connect them and make them feel part of the community, and serve as a balance against the powerful. Utilitarian measures the extent that newspapers provide useful information to readers. The identity experience refers to the prosocial relationship between newspapers and people. People use media to craft their identities, and the media reinforce people’s identities.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077699012455391">
<title>Readership</title>
<p>Readership was measured using a reader behavior score (RBS). RBS quantifies a person’s overall pattern of usage of the newspaper with a single numerical value. The RBS allowed comparison of scores of individuals and ordering of people on a unidimensional scale of readership. Although the RBS is a single number, it includes six manifestations of readership, such as the time, frequency, and completion for weekday and Sunday papers. These items were included in the New Readers study. Following Calder and Malthouse, a simple average of the transformed individual items was used.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012455391">30</xref></sup> Each of the six scales was transformed so as to have a maximum value of 7 and a minimum value of 1, where the value of 7 indicates maximum reading. Coefficient alpha is .78 for these six indicators of readership. Prior research has verified the reliability of the RBS scale and demonstrated its superiority over single-question approaches.</p>

<title>Measuring Experiential Engagement</title>
<p>Engagement was conceptualized as a second-order construct that manifests itself in first-order experiences. This conceptualization is tested with a two-step procedure, first by estimating a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) <italic>measurement model</italic> allowing for correlations between all pairs of the five experiences, and then by estimating a <italic>second-order CFA</italic> where the correlations between experiences are hypothesized to be due to the two underlying second-order constructs of positive and negative engagement.</p>
<p>Fit statistics from the measurement model are acceptable, with all goodness-of-fit measures exceeding .9 (GFI = .92, CFI = .91, NFI = .91, RMSEA = .0661). Standardized factor loadings appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012455391">Table 1</xref>. Convergent validity was assessed with the <italic>t</italic>-values of the factor loadings, computed as the ratio of the loading to the standard error of the item. Convergent validity is supported when <italic>t</italic>-values reach an absolute value greater than 2. The minimum <italic>t</italic>-value was 37.3, providing evidence in support of the convergent validity of the indicators. Discriminant validity was assessed with the chi-square difference test. For each of the thirty-six pairs of experiences, a separate measurement model was estimated identical to the one shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012455391">Table 2</xref>, except that the covariance between the pair is fixed at 1. The chi-square statistics between the models were computed and range from 1,401 to 8,286. The differences have chi-square distributions with 1 <italic>df</italic> and are highly significant, supporting discriminant validity. Thus, the experience measurements have acceptable psychometric properties.</p>

<p>The fit statistics for the second-order model are also acceptable (GFI = .90, CFI = .90, NFI = .90, RMSEA = .0693). Instead of including ten parameters, one for the correlation of each pair of experiences (5 choose 2), the second-order model assumes that the correlations are due to a second-order construct as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012455391">Figure 1</xref>, which also shows the standardized factor loading estimates. This model is more parsimonious because it uses only five parameters to model the relationship between experiences. The first-order experience factor loadings are similar to those from the measurement model and omitted. Thus, the measures of positive and negative engagement have reasonable measurement properties.</p>

<title>Mediation Analysis</title>
<p>The results of a mediation analysis, following the Baron and Kenny four-step process, also permit testing of the two hypotheses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012455391">31</xref></sup> The first step is to show that the “initial variable,” engagement, is related to the outcome, readership (<bold>H1</bold>). The second step is to show that engagement is related to the mediator, satisfaction (<bold>H2</bold>). The third and fourth steps are usually accomplished with a single model, where the outcome (readership) is regressed on both the engagement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Regression models assume one stage of sampling, but this sample has been drawn in two stages. The first stage involved a sample of fifty-two newspapers (primary sampling units or PSUs), and the second stage sampled readers of the selected newspapers (secondary sampling units or SSUs). With two-stage samples the SSUs within a PSU can be correlated, violating the assumption of independence in regression. To account for the two stages of sampling correctly, a hierarchical linear model (HLM) was estimated. For respondent j of newspaper i, let yij be the value of the dependent variable and xij be the value of the predictor variable having mean μi for organization i:</p>

<p>where α and β are the intercept and slopes across all ads, ai and bi are normal random variables with means 0 and standard deviations σa and σb quantifying specific effects for newspaper i, and eij is a residual with mean 0 and standard deviation σe. In step 1 the dependent variable y is readership and the independent variable x is engagement. In step 2 the dependent variable y is satisfaction. The model used for steps 3 and 4 will regress readership on both engagement and satisfaction, and there will be a second slope estimate and a second standard deviation of slopes across PSUs.</p>
<p>Parameter estimates for the three models are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012455391">Table 2</xref>. The first step of the mediation analysis is to show that the criterion, readership, is related to the initial variable, engagement. This effect is significant and strong (β = .8740, <italic>t</italic> = 29.11), and so <bold>H1</bold> is supported. Step 2 is to show that engagement is related to the mediator, satisfaction. This effect is also strong (β = .5993, <italic>t</italic> = 33.18). <bold>H2</bold> is supported. Step 3 relates the mediator (satisfaction) to the criterion (readership), after controlling for the initial variable (engagement). The effect of satisfaction on readership is significant (β = .07297, <italic>t</italic> = 3.27), but fairly small in magnitude. Step 4 shows that the effect of engagement on readership, after controlling for the mediator, is very strong (β = .8272, <italic>t</italic> = 27.58), and only slightly smaller than in step 1 (β = .8740, <italic>t</italic> = 27.58). The relationship between readership and engagement is thus partially mediated by satisfaction, although the magnitudes of the coefficients and <italic>t</italic>-statistics indicate that engagement is a much better predictor of readership than satisfaction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Researchers and practitioners looking to curb the tide of newspaper abandonment should focus more of their attention on stimulating reader engagement. As this research shows, engagement is the most significant predictor of readership, even when we consider the effects of satisfaction, which is a significant predictor of readership but only a weak partial mediator of the relationship between engagement and readership. In the multiple regression predicting readership, the <italic>t</italic>-statistic for engagement is 27.6 versus 3.3 for satisfaction, indicating that engagement is a substantially better predicator of readership than satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012455391">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>These findings raise questions about the industry’s exclusive focus on satisfaction measures of reader reactions to newspapers. Both satisfaction and engagement significantly predict readership, and it is therefore reasonable to measure both in monitoring reader perceptions of a newspaper. If space constraints on the survey allow for only one of the two to be measured, engagement would seem to be the preferred metric for both empirical and theoretical reasons. Empirically, we have shown that it is a stronger predictor of readership. Satisfaction, which is the consumer’s fulfillment response, is a summary evaluation of the newspaper per se.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012455391">33</xref></sup> While it is important to know what aspects of a newspaper readers evaluate positively versus negatively, satisfaction is not as critical as engagement. Engagement, as the set of reader experiences characterizing how the newspaper fits into readers’ lives, is the more important measure to consider.</p>
<p>It is important, therefore, to revisit the first-order experiences that beget engagement as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012455391">Table 1</xref>, as well as other experiences from the engagement construct domain that were not sampled here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012455391">34</xref></sup> While newspaper executives may feel powerless to move the needle on a construct as daunting as engagement, they may be quicker to realize that they can affect the specific experiences their product creates, such as the social, timeout, civic, utilitarian, and identity experiences.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the items of the social experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>I bring up things I’ve read in this newspaper in conversations with others.</p>
<p>I like to talk about national news and current events from the newspaper.</p>
<p>I like to give advice and tips based on what I read in this newspaper.</p>
<p>I show things in this newspaper to others in my family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While we tend to think of social opportunities as more relevant to online content, print newspapers should consider creating improved social experiences for readers. This could entail, for example, a question of the day around a major, local, or even barely known but interesting news story that runs on the front page and is designed to encourage conversation among readers and between readers and the newsroom; a “water cooler” spadia, or unbound page that is folded around a section of the newspaper, that can be pulled off and taken to work, highlighting a handful of stories in the paper that are likely to be discussed by others; callouts to actionable advice; in-house ads encouraging readers to pass the paper on to a friend; sticky-note add-ins similar to those used in fashion magazines that allow readers to flag stories with a little note before they leave it for a family member to read.</p>
<p>As another example, the items of the civic experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Reading the newspaper makes me a better citizen.</p>
<p>I think people who don’t read this newspaper are at a disadvantage in life.</p>
<p>Our society would be weaker without newspapers like this one.</p>
<p>I count on this newspaper to investigate wrongdoing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This suggests that newspapers not only should continue to invest in investigative reporting, promoting their investment as a positive aspect of the newspaper, but also should consider ways in which the reader herself or himself can experience greater civic participation based on being a reader.</p>
<p>As with most cross-sectional studies attempting to test causal relationships, it is difficult to evaluate the time order of occurrence: Does the cause (engagement) precede the effect (readership)? A stronger test of the relationship would be to execute a randomized controlled experiment or a longitudinal quasi-experimental design. Future research on engagement should focus on randomized controlled experiments where content is manipulated to understand how to create content that produces certain reader experiences. Such experiments could also be used to determine which experiences have stronger effects on engagement and consequently readership.</p>
<p>Media organizations themselves should focus on understanding how to create experiences across multiple platforms including newsprint, websites, tablets, and mobile phones. Other outcome variables should also be measured, such as intentions to pay subscription fees. The essential point is that engagement and experiences are fundamental to news products in their entirety and that they constitute a framework for achieving synergy across various platforms.</p>

In addition, we also have a multi-item measure of satisfaction that we used for analysis. If we follow a parallel approach to our conceptualization of engagement as a second-order construct manifested in specific experiences and conceptualize satisfaction as a second-order construct manifesting itself in these first-order satisfaction factors, the results using the multi-item measure are essentially identical to those from the single-factor model. We choose to use the single-item measure for parsimony.</p>
