<p>This article surveys the reception of Vatican II among women’s religious orders, especially in Australia. By describing the situation for women religious prior to the Council, and indicating the minimal levels of involvement by women in the Council, the article outlines the radical transformation that Vatican II had for women religious who interpreted and implemented the directions set out in the document <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic>.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1030570X13487966" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Residents of Hampden Road in the peaceful Melbourne suburb of Armadale would have been startled had they known the cause of the banging noises from inside the convent at number 50. It was 1968 and the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament had been living silently, almost invisibly in the street for 18 years. They were enclosed nuns who never set foot outside the convent apart from visits to the dentist, only spoke to each other twice a day during brief periods of ‘recreation’ and their lives were focused on the presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p>Sister Carol Hogan still clearly remembers the commotion that day. The nuns in their long white robes, herself included, were attacking the convent grille with hammers and literally demolishing it. The symbolism of what they were doing was not lost on them. Their Mother General in Europe had sent a French priest to stay with them for a month and explain to them what the Second Vatican Council was about, what changes were happening in the church and, above all, what changes were expected of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1030570X13487966">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unlike most of the women religious in Australia, the Blessed Sacrament sisters knew very little about the Council. Their previous superior thought it did not apply to them, as they were enclosed and, as the nuns did not see any newspapers, or television or listen to the radio, they knew very little about it. Two women in the community were slipped copies of the Council documents by a highly respected Jesuit priest. These were confiscated by the resistant superior but given back with brown paper covering after three weeks. It was Father Garail, the French priest, who enabled the nuns to remove that brown paper. He urged them to rethink their religious lives in accordance with the Council documents.</p>
<p>The dramatic destruction of the grille at the Convent of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in Hampden Road was just the beginning of a total transformation of a way of life that had more in common with medieval monasticism than the contemporary world. More than 40 years later, Carol Hogan, now in her 80s, remains as committed to her religious congregation as she did then but she no longer lives in a large community of women socially and intellectually cut off from the world and emotionally cut off from each other. She lives in a unit in Kensington that is filled with light, colour and books. She wears contemporary clothes, drives a car, runs two feminist theology groups and works with ACRATH – Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking. She has a number of degrees including a PhD. She leads a full and busy life grounded in her current understanding of the spirituality of Eucharist. She is like hundreds of Australian nuns who experienced Vatican II as a revolution of their religious lives leading to personal renewal and transformation.</p>
<p>I met Carol in the course of researching a book with Dr Heather O’Connor on the nuns and Vatican II. We are writing a series of profiles of women from a range of different religious orders who, like Carol, had their religious lives transformed by Vatican II and who continue to live the spirit of the Council.</p>
<p>The first person Heather and I interviewed for our book was Sister Brigid Arthur, a Brigidine sister in Melbourne well known for her work with asylum seekers. She claims that what was expected of the nuns after Vatican II was extraordinary. ‘Sociologically’, she says, ‘I think this would be one of the biggest changes of any group. It was very dramatic.’</p>
<p>This article explores the situation of women religious before the Second Vatican Council, and looks at what the Council asked of them, how they responded and the implications of this response for the church in Australia. Are the 21st-century nuns – strong, independent, deeply spiritual and highly educated women like Carol Hogan and Brigid Arthur – a challenge, an inspiration, or perhaps both?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1030570X13487966"><title>Pre-Vatican II</title>
<p>In the context of the pre-Vatican II world, vocations to religious life were highly revered and religious men and women placed on a pedestal. Theirs was a public path of perfection for whom ‘many are called but few are chosen’. For female religious orders, the restrictions of enclosure and the wearing of habits had been made mandatory by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and re-emphasized by the council of Trent in the 16th century. It was not until Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical <italic>Conditae a Christo</italic> in 1900 that active female religious congregations with simple vows were formally recognized as ‘real’ nuns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1030570X13487966">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A high level of uniformity, however, was imposed on the nuns by the Code of Canon Law in 1917 and strengthened by subsequent legislation. As a result, congregations lost much of their individuality. Constitutions, spiritual formation and the daily semi-monastic routine did not vary greatly from one religious order to the next. This was reinforced by the narrow focus of their ministry. Most nuns in Australia – about 14,000 women at the time of Vatican II – were working in either education or health.</p>
<p>Nuns led lives of humility and obedience in very restricted physical and emotional environments. They were not allowed to visit their families and discouraged from forming close friendships within their communities. A small number, like the Blessed Sacrament Sisters, were living lives of totally enclosed contemplation where, says Carol Hogan, ‘there was total rejection of any relationship, except with Jesus, and no opportunity for human development except through prayer’.</p>
<p>Change, not surprisingly, was already in the air well before the Vatican Council met. In the 1940s the conservative and aristocratic Pope Pius XII suggested that women’s religious orders modify their constitutions, update their qualifications and modernize their way of life. Changes should include greater flexibility in their daily routine and ‘the elimination of out-dated customs and clothing that estranged them from those they served’. In the Apostolic Constitution <italic>Sponsa Christi,</italic> issued in 1950, he pointed out that a number of religious practices were ‘purely extrinsic and historic since they stem from conditions of the past which no longer obtain today’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1030570X13487966">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Australia is a long way from Rome and the Pope’s words did not have the same impact here as they did in America where the Sister Formation Conference was established in the 1950s. This was the first national organization for women religious in America, aimed at facilitating their intellectual, spiritual, psychological and professional development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1030570X13487966">4</xref></sup> More influential perhaps was the work of Cardinal Leon Suenens whose book <italic>The Nun in the World</italic>, published in 1962, was ground-breaking and directly influenced the preparation and promulgation of the Vatican II document <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic>, the ‘Decree on the up-to-date Renewal of Religious Life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1030570X13487966">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cardinal Suenens wrote that nuns were ‘out of touch with the world as it is, an anachronism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1030570X13487966">6</xref></sup> He acknowledged that ‘what one can only call the antifeminist tradition has had a long inning’ but felt that the nuns themselves were partly to blame. They had long held positions of authority and responsibility in the narrow worlds of health and education in which they operated, but, ‘As a nun’, he wrote, ‘she will not allow herself to claim even a few of the rights that women have managed to obtain bit by bit from man in our modern society.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1030570X13487966">7</xref></sup> His suggested remedies included reforming their dress, living arrangements and working conditions as well as rediscovering the charisma of their founders. These ideas would all resurface in <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic> three years later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1030570X13487966"><title>Vatican II</title>
<p>In the meantime, the Council fathers were not thinking of the nuns when they assembled in October 1962. Why would they? In an article on ‘Women in the Church’ published in <italic>The Month</italic> in 1964, Rosemary Goldie, the Australian woman who went to Rome in 1952 to take up a position with the Permanent Committee for International Congresses of the Lay Apostolate, wrote: ‘Nuns – teaching, nursing and missionary nuns especially – exert considerable influence (a formidable influence you may think) over much of the Mystical Body … and yet not one Mother General was called in by the Preparatory Commissions for the Ecumenical Council.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1030570X13487966">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Douglas Horton, a Protestant observer present at the first session, wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>It suddenly came over me, as I sat looking at this vast assembly of almost three thousand people today, that it has about it an air of artificiality and that the main reason for this is that there is not a single woman in the whole company. Up and down the nave you look and into the transepts, nothing but men. It is an abstracted body, incomplete, a torso of true catholicity, speaking more of an outmoded past than of the living present. Let us hope that the world will see something of Rome’s strong women at Vatican III.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1030570X13487966">9</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the second session of the Council, the wives of Protestant observers were permitted at the opening ceremonies each morning and some celebratory occasions. There were no Catholic women present at all, lay or religious. Thanks to Cardinal Suenens, however, that was about to change. During the discussion on <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic> – the church as the people of God – he pointed out that excluding women from active church participation made no sense. ‘Unless I am mistaken’, he said, ‘they make up half of the human race.’ A number of other bishops as well as Paul VI himself supported Suenens’s push to include women in the third session of the Council.</p>
<p>In her fascinating account of the experiences of the 23women who were invited to attend the two final sessions of the Council as auditors, Sister Carmel McEnroy quotes one of the 10 nuns included as saying they were either ‘ignored or trivialised’ – but the great thing is they were there. They were a sign of the times!</p>
<p>Women’s voices were never heard on the floor of the Council in St Peter’s, nor were they allowed to mix with the men at coffee breaks where much of the crucial lobbying and talking took place. Nor were they invited – with one major exception – to contribute to the preparation of documents, including <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic>, even though they numbered approximately 80 per cent of all Catholic religious. The major exception was in the preparation of the document <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> – the pastoral constitution of the church in the Modern World.</p>
<p>The women’s involvement in <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> came about thanks to the great Bernard Häring, the moral theologian and personal confessor to John XXIII, who famously said, ‘After Auschwitz, we can never look at absolute obedience the same way again.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1030570X13487966">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women and laymen were involved in drafting <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> from the beginning. The final document touched some men and women so deeply that to this day they can recite its opening words by heart. The American nun Sister Luke Tobin was able, in her 90s, to quote another passage from <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic>, one that she stated was influenced by the women, and that she claimed encapsulated the most powerful message she derived from her experience as an auditor:<disp-quote>
<p>With respect to the fundamental rights of the person, every type of discrimination, whether social or cultural, whether based on sex, race, colour, social condition, language or religion, is to be overcome and eradicated as contrary to God’s intent. (<italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic>, para. 29)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> and <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic> held radical implications for all men and women in the church, for women religious it was <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic> that was to revolutionize their lives. It demanded a return to the scriptures, to the spirit and aims of the founder, a proper understanding of and adaptation to ‘the changed conditions of the times’ and an accompanying inner spiritual renewal (para. 2). Furthermore, each congregation was asked to revise its ‘constitutions, directories, books of customs, of prayers, of ceremonies’ and bring them into line with conciliar documents (para. 3).</p>
<p>Any distinction between members was to be abolished and systems of authority reviewed. The religious habit was to be ‘simple and modest’ and ‘suited to the times and place and to the needs of the apostolate’ (para. 17). Appropriate training and support for individuals was deemed essential and it was emphasized that ‘effective renewal and adaptation depended on the co-operation of all’ (para. 4).</p>
<p>This was change on an unprecedented scale and Pope Paul VI acknowledged that the document would cause ‘shock and stress’ to some sisters. Nevertheless, every congregation was instructed to consider all aspects of the renewal programme at a general chapter held within three years of the close of the Council in 1965. The wholehearted and serious manner in which women’s religious orders around the world embarked on the deconstruction and rebuilding of the framework of their lives is one of the most remarkable events in the history of the Catholic church. Undertaken within the context of the wide implications of all the Vatican documents it was to shake the foundations of religious life. The irony is that that when they hurriedly prepared <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic> in the final stages of the Council – the bishops clearly did not anticipate what was to follow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1030570X13487966"><title>Australia post-Vatican II</title>
<p>It is generally accepted here in Australia that within a year, the nuns had far outstripped most of the priests and brothers in their study and implementation of the Council documents. There isn’t time to examine why this was, other than to say the women had so much more to gain. They were on the whole less well educated than the priests and brothers, and had been barred from studying theology and canon law.</p>
<p>The sisters, however, were used to doing what they were asked to do by the church and approached <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic> in that spirit. They did not expect the ground to shake beneath their feet. As Noni Mitchell, one time Mother General of the Loretos, points out: ‘We had been much regulated through the 20s, 30s and 40s and Vatican II took us towards freedom.’</p>
<p>Every major city in Australia had lectures and seminars on Vatican II and 80–90 per cent of those attending were nuns. In Melbourne, Monsignor John Kelly organized a series of talks on Saturday mornings with speakers such as the leading Jesuit reformer Johannes Hofinger and the great scripture scholar Alexander Jones. These Saturday morning gatherings were, for most of the sisters who attended them, their first contact with sisters from other orders. Loreto Sister Yvonne Lamerand remembers the shock one Saturday after a talk on <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>We were presented over and over again with a huge cauldron of ideas and this particular Saturday the impact on the assembled crowd was incredible. We were told ours was not a better way, it was only one vocation among many others. This was so different to what had been taught us. It was a levelling of the call from God, that we are all called to live the life God wants us to live.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1030570X13487966">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Sion Sister Stella O’Donnell remembers walking up Brunswick Street one Saturday morning and hearing two sisters behind her talking about her modified habit. ‘Look – you can see her ankles’, one exclaimed in horror. ‘And it won’t be long before you can see my knees!’ Stella said to herself – smiling!</p>
<p>The religious habit came to be a metaphor for change. These long, all-enveloping garments were cumbersome, impractical and set the nuns apart, but every congregation had women who saw the habit as symbolic of their religious commitment and were reluctant to give it up. Loreto sister Roberta Hakendorf clashed with her fairly conservative superior in Ballarat over her request to wear a secular dress in the classroom. Sister Roberta wrote to the Mother General in Ireland:<disp-quote>
<p>I see diversity in dress as a sign of vitality in the Institute – an affirmation of the individual. I see it, above all, as a sign that each individual is ‘open to the spirit’ and that this basic theology be recognised in theory and practice – especially in the area of dress and apostolate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1030570X13487966">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Loretos proceeded slowly with their changes to the habit. Some orders, like the Sacre Coeur nuns, brought in new habits abruptly to the distress of many but most, like the Loretos, proceeded with care. Sister Maria Casey, Procurator for the cause of Mary MacKillop, recalls:<disp-quote>
<p>We could have gone off into all sorts of habits but our Mother General at the time made us look at what were the values we were trying to hold on to and espouse as far as ministry and mission were concerned. I remember one very young sister who could not bring herself to change from black stockings to flesh-coloured stockings. We used to laugh but she did make the change and never stopped running after that.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1030570X13487966">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Maria still laughs when she talks about the Ajax test. The large tube-like Ajax container was 8 inches high and when placed on the ground was a handy measurement for skirt lengths.</p>
<p>While changing their appearance proved liberating for the sisters, going back to the original vision of their founders was also surprisingly potent. Women such as the Presentations’ Nano Nagle, the Mercy’s Catherine McCauley, the Charity’s Mary Aikenhead and the Josephites’s Mary MacKillop were strong, radical, capable, feisty females. In an age when the women’s movement was gaining momentum, the sisters gained confidence from identifying with their qualities.</p>
<p>For complex historical reasons the Loreto nuns, especially in Australia, knew very little of their own founder’s story until Vatican II. And what a treasure she turned out to be. In early 17th-century Europe, Mary Ward founded an active order, inspired by the Jesuits where women did not wear habits, were not enclosed, governed themselves and met the needs of the time such as educating girls and supporting the sick and poor. Because this model of religious life went against the rules for women at the time, Mary was condemned by a papal bull which stated:<disp-quote>
<p>We totally and completely suppress and extinguish them, subject them to perpetual abolition and remove them entirely from the Holy Church of God: we destroy and annul them and we wish and command all the Christian faithful to regard and repute them as suppressed, extinct, rooted out, destroyed and abolished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1030570X13487966">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Loreto sister Libby Rogerson believes that it was extraordinarily helpful for religious congregations to go back and really examine what they were founded for. ‘I think I saw Mary Ward’s education of girls as a way of freeing up a totally dominated group in society and helping them out of an inequitable structure. It gave me a new way of looking at the Church.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1030570X13487966">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even those women from orders whose founders were men discovered new insights into their charism. Through recent studies on her founder, Carol Hogan, for example, discovered news ways of understanding the Eucharist other than the perpetual adoration that Peter Julian Eymard had initially taught.</p>
<p>Every sister I interviewed for <italic>Loreto in Australia</italic> and every one Heather O’Connor and I have spoken to for our book has emphasized how extraordinary it was to take part in the conversations around Vatican II. Women who were not consulted on anything were suddenly consulted on everything. Robert Hakendorf remembers: ‘It was the first time anything like this had happened. It was a huge thing to be listened to.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1030570X13487966">16</xref></sup> Carol Hogan recalls: ‘We had big discussions and we had never discussed anything before. The superior brought in a psychologist to help us learn to relate to each other, and someone to teach us how to groom ourselves, and a number of priests to teach us liturgical and sacramental theology.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1030570X13487966">17</xref></sup> Brigid Arthur also talks about the endless meetings:<disp-quote>
<p>There was an important one at Harrietvile in 1971. A fair few of us went and we had two priests giving us this renewal stuff. It was very intense. A lot of it was around authority and obedience. For the first time we were being told things that we wanted to hear like your primary obedience is to God, you are primarily obedient to your own conscience. There are constraints on authority. Authority means authorship and therefore it’s got something to do with your own authoring of what you’re going to do inside … we found it really fascinating.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of thick files in the Loreto Province Archives in Ballarat reflect the months of work that preceded the renewal General Chapter in 1968. Other orders would have the same. Nuns all over Australia were talking, reflecting, studying, listening and discerning. The results were life-changing.</p>
<p>Federal funding for schools in the early 1970s meant that orders could afford to pay more lay staff and thus free the sisters for other things. Many took the opportunity for personal, intellectual and spiritual development. As Mercy Sister Anne Forbes wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>As religious women, we always felt the impact of major changes in the Church at large, but it could be argued that no one understood and appreciated the ramifications of Vatican II more than religious Sisters worldwide. Jokes were made about the way that nuns were racing off to lectures, conferences and seminars almost everyday of the week. Studies in scripture, theology, liturgy and psychology were tucked into our weekly program of work and prayer …</p>
<p>In 1969 our first two sisters went overseas to the Philippines to study at the National Pastoral Institute … sisters travelled overseas sometimes for years at a time to study in Jerusalem, America, Canada, England or Ireland in scripture, theology, liturgy, psychology, education, formation, social welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1030570X13487966">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This pattern was replicated in nearly every women’s religious congregation.</p>
<p>That the nuns embraced the changes as they did had a great deal to do with the support and encouragement they gave each other and the quality of leadership in their communities. Paul VI, however, had been right when he warned about the shock and stress. Every order had members who resisted the changes, seeing them as devaluing the old way. Brigid Arthur remembers a number of sisters falling apart because of what they were hearing. Some even cried, which, says Brigid, was ‘dumb’ because the things that worried them were peripheral to what Vatican II was really about. One sister was convinced, for example, that having wine at meals would be the sisters’ ruin.</p>
<p>Carol Hogan describes her own community of 30 women in Armadale dividing into two factions for and against change. She remembers her distress when one of the sisters she most admired told her she was leaving. ‘Carol’, she said, ‘the system is not producing women of charity, maturity and prayer.’ She was right, says Carol, because ‘we were fighting, we weren’t mature and how could we pray?’</p>
<p>Carol’s friend in the community, like so many other nuns, chose to leave. Those who stayed were able, in time, to enjoy the fruits of the Council in ways that they could not have envisaged when they entered. The rules of enclosure were either abandoned or modified, and nuns became part of the wider social community in which they lived, not only in dress but in their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Gradually large convents dispersed and as sisters took up new roles outside schools and hospitals, they moved into smaller houses and units either on their own, like Carol, or in twos or threes, or more. They were given allowances, handled their own money, had a voice in decisions affecting them and became responsible for their own spiritual lives.</p>
<p>The decades since the Council have seen nuns use their energy, dedication and creativity in astonishing ways. They are living <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic>, <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> and <italic>Perfectae Caritatis</italic>.</p>
<p>I could include a litany of dozens and dozens of women religious meeting contemporary needs throughout the world. Here in Australia they work as prison chaplains, fight the sexual trafficking of women, support asylum seekers, run women’s refuges, help the homeless, the dispossessed, the marginalized and are brilliant political lobbyists. They run parishes, create inspirational liturgies, teach in schools and universities, and even work in the Vatican as canon lawyers. They have set up programmes such as Very Special Kids, Transitional Housing and Strong Young Mums. They are spiritual directors, run retreats and are developing new ways of thinking about women in the church and in the world. Australian nuns are also working overseas in Cambodia, Thailand, East Timor, South America, Africa and other places. They have a voice at the United Nations in New York.</p>
<p>Women’s religious orders are very aware that their members are aging and their numbers diminishing. To ensure their work continues they are establishing foundations in which the laity work with them: the Caravan’s sisters John Wallis Foundation, the Loreto’s Mary Ward International, the Josephite Foundation, the Good Sams Foundation, to name a few.</p>
<p>There is no question that the nuns are a source of great richness for the church. Of course with their hard won confidence in who they are and what they do, they are no longer the models of submissiveness that canon law aimed to create. As Denis Dwyer wrote in ‘The Religious Order in the Local Church’, quoting Metz:<disp-quote>
<p>religious orders at the very least have a corrective role: the function of restoring the balance. They are a kind of shock therapy instituted by the Holy Spirit for the Church as a whole. Against the dangerous accommodations, and questionable compromise that the Church as a large-scale institution can always incline to, they press for the uncompromising nature of the Gospel and of the imitation of Christ. In this sense they are the institutionalized form of <italic>dangerous memory</italic> within the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1030570X13487966">19</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
