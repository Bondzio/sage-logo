<p><italic>Objective</italic>. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure in children increases the incidence of upper respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, and chronic otitis media. This study investigated the effects of ex vivo and in vitro smoke exposure on dynamic ciliary beat frequency (CBF) in pediatric adenoid explants.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Blinded and controlled prospective study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary care pediatric hospital.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Fifty-five children undergoing adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnea and adenotonsillar hypertrophy were enrolled in this study. Adenoids were surgically removed using currettage. Hair was collected for nicotine analysis. Tissue was sectioned into 1-mm strips and allowed to equilibrate in DMEM/F12 with 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. Cilia-bearing explant tissues were treated with either DMEM/F12 media, 5% cigarette smoke extract (CSE), or 10% CSE for 24 hours. Cilia were then stimulated using either isoproterenol (10<sup>−9</sup> M) or methacholine (10<sup>−6</sup>M), and CBF was serially recorded using the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis (SAVA) software.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Children with hair nicotine levels ≥1 ng/mg consistent with secondhand smoke exposure display blunted dynamic CBF response ex vivo. Explants incubated with CSE in vitro demonstrate significant impairment of isoproterenol and methacholine-induced CBF.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. CBF of adenoid explants increases when stimulated with isoproterenol and methacholine. Ex vivo and in vitro smoke exposure blunted ciliostimulation of CBF in adenoid explants. Smoke exposure impairs ciliary function in the pediatric airway and could potentially contribute to disorders such as chronic rhinosinusitis and chronic otitis media.</p>

<body>
<p>One of the fundamental mechanisms underlying chronic rhinosinusitis is stunted mucociliary clearance. This process includes 2 concomitantly occurring processes: mucous production and mucous transport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811431414">1</xref></sup> Mucous transport is facilitated by ciliated epithelial cells, which comprise approximately 80% of the mucosal lining of the upper respiratory tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811431414">2</xref></sup> Mucous production is performed by goblet cells, which comprise the remaining 20% of respiratory epithelial cells.</p>
<p>The measurement of CBF is performed using the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811431414">3</xref></sup> This involves digital video capture followed by region of interest analysis to compute CBF. In the basal state, the cilia of the upper respiratory tract beat in a coordinated manner at a frequency of approximately 12 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431414">4</xref></sup> During irritant exposure, the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) increases to accelerate mucociliary clearance. This pathway is mediated by both adrenergic- and cholinergic-mediated pathways. Adrenergic stimulation with terbutaline increases CBF by 16.48%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811431414">5</xref></sup> while methacholine, a β-methyl ester of acetylcholine, induces a temporary acceleration of CBF by as much as 23.03%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811431414">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondhand smoke (SHS), generated by cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, contains greater than 60 known carcinogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811431414">7</xref></sup> It is estimated that approximately 20% of US children are exposed to SHS. Environmental tobacco exposure in children has been associated with increased incidences of middle ear effusion, chronic rhinosinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections, asthma, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811431414">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811431414">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several methods available for the quantification of SHS. Parental questionnaires have low reliability for SHS exposure secondary to low sensitivity and recall bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431414">11</xref></sup> Nicotine has a serum half-life of 2 hours. Cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, has a half-life of 20 hours. One centimeter of hair can be used to quantify nicotine exposure over 1 month. In children aged 3 to 27 months, hair nicotine levels range from 0.19 to 47.82 ng nicotine/mg hair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431414">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Artificial media have been developed for in vitro modeling of secondhand smoke. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is formed by filtering the smoke generated from standardized research cigarettes into basal media. CSE exposure to tracheal epithelium results in neutrophilic infiltration, increased production of protein kinase C, and impaired ciliary function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431414">13</xref></sup> This study intends to investigate the effect of ex vivo and in vitro SHS exposure on the stimulated CBF of explanted pediatric adenoid samples.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Patients undergoing adenoidectomy at a tertiary medical center were recruited for inclusion in this study. Institutional Review Board approval from the Medical University of South Carolina Office of Research Integrity (HR 18863) was granted for patient enrollment. Informed consent was obtained during preoperative planning.</p>
<sec id="section2-0194599811431414">
<title>Tissue preparation and ciliary analysis</title>
<p>Intraoperatively, adenoid explants were harvested using curettage. One centimeter of approximately 10 hairs were collected for hair nicotine analysis. Explants were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to clear bloody and purulent debris (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Adenoid tissue was sectioned into 1-mm strips and incubated for 24 hours in Dulbecco minimum essential media (DMEM/F12) media fortified with fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Following equilibration, baseline CBF is examined using a Leica DM microscope with a 40× water immersible lens (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, Illinois). Digital images are captured using a Basler A602 camera mounted above the microscope stage (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany). Monochromatic images are obtained at 100 frames per second for 2.5 seconds at a resolution on 640 × 480 pixels. Images are transferred and analyzed on a Hewlett Packard server computer (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, California). CBF analysis is performed with the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis Software (Ammons Engineering, Mt Morris, Michigan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599811431414">
<title>In vitro smoke challenge</title>
<p>After 24 hours of equilibration, tissue was incubated in either 0%, 5%, or 10% CSE in DMEM/F12 for an additional 24 hours. CSE is formed by bubbling the cigarette smoke from four 3R4F cigarettes through 50 mL of tissue culture media using a Shapiro cigarette smoke machine, with the media being filtered and used immediately (University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture, Lexington, Kentucky). Following smoke incubation, adenoid explants were stimulated using either isoproterenol (10<sup>−4</sup>M) or methacholine (10<sup>−4</sup>M; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri). For isproterenol trials, measurements were recorded at 1-hour intervals for 4 hours. For methacholine trials, measurements were recorded at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. All samples were executed in duplicate with 5 measurements per sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599811431414">
<title>Ex vivo analysis</title>
<p>Adenoids were harvested and prepared as described above. To determine the impact of SHS exposure on CBF, no CSE was used for this portion of the protocol. Pharmacologic stimulation was performed using isoproterenol and methacholine as described above.</p>
<p>Hair nicotine levels were measured at an independent facility. As such, the authors were blinded to the smoke exposure status of the patient during completion of tissue processing. Mean nicotine levels were generated from duplicate trials. Nicotine quantities were measured in ng nicotine/mg hair. Values greater than 1 ng/mg were considered significant for SHS exposure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599811431414">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California). Disease information and demographic variables such as age, sex, and ethnicity are summarized by means of summary statistics. Stimulated dynamic CBF data are expressed as percentage change over baseline frequency measurement. Preliminary data demonstrated an approximately 5% difference between groups. A power analysis was performed using this assumption, and α = .05 to determine a sample size of 44 patients would be required. Because cilia are identified in approximately 70% of samples, enrollment was increased by 30%. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate analysis with a post hoc <italic>t</italic> test. A <italic>P</italic> value of .05 or less is considered to indicate a statistically significant difference for all statistical tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifty-five patients were included in this study. The mean age was 5.12 ± 2.94 years. Most, 63.6%, of the patients were male. Of the subjects, 67.3% were white and 32.7% were African American. SHS was identified using hair nicotine in 28.1% of children. Adenoidectomy was performed for the following reasons: adenotonsillar hypertrophy resulting in obstructive sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing (80%), chronic otitis media (49%), or chronic rhinosinusitis (16%).</p>

For methacholine stimulation, the stimulated response is mitigated at 20 minutes (<italic>P</italic> = .026). Application of 5% and 10% CSE did not further blunt stimulated responses in children with a chronic history of environmental tobacco smoke exposure (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mucociliary clearance is a coordinated process of mucous production and mucous transportation. This transport is facilitated by CBF and mucous viscosity. Cigarette smoke has been previously demonstrated to impair stimulated ciliary beat frequency in the mouse model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431414">11</xref></sup> The exact mechanism by which this impaired ciliary action occurs remains unknown. Possible mechanisms include cytokine signaling via protein kinase A inhibition and protein kinase C activation with an ultimate alteration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431414">11</xref></sup> Acute insults of smoke exposure result in a downregulation of toll-like receptor 4 surface expression, IL-8 upregulation, extracellular matrix protein destruction, and increased lipid peroxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811431414">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811431414">15</xref></sup> Future studies are warranted to investigate the influence of these immunological effects on this observed physiological response.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated the effect of SHS on CBF in the adult population. In both murine nasal septum epithelium and human sinonasal epithelial cell cultures, exposure to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) resulted in impaired dynamic CBF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811431414">16</xref></sup> CSC is an alternate media available for simulation of SHS. Dynamic ciliary dysfunction has also been demonstrated in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis using both adrenergic and cholinergic agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811431414">17</xref></sup> This study offers the first study of this kind performed with a pediatric population.</p>
<p>In this study, we found 28.1% of children to have &gt;1 ng nicotine/mg hair, consistent with SHS exposure. This is consistent with national data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811431414">9</xref></sup> It is known that children with SHS exposure are more likely to have chronic otitis media with effusion, chronic rhinosinusitis, upper respiratory infections, and low birth weight and to undergo adenotonsillectomy with increased frequency compared with smoke-naïve children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811431414">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, infants with exposure to SHS have increased rates of rhinitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811431414">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparison of children with and without SHS exposure ex vivo demonstrated a negative effect on dynamic CBF. SHS-exposed patients, with greater than 1 ng nicotine/mg hair, exhibit an approximately 25% reduction in peak stimulated CBF with isoproterenol and methacholine. This research supports a physiological component of stimulated ciliary dysfunction within this cohort. Secondary to a limited number of smoke-exposed children, a dose response could not be recognized for ex vivo smoke exposure.</p>
<p>The in vitro component to this study demonstrated that increasing levels of smoke exposure have further deleterious effects on mucociliary clearance. The application of 5% CSE reduces peak isoproterenol and methacholine CBF by approximately 50% and 75%, respectively. Incubation with 10% CSE had an additional inhibitory effect. This in vitro model is useful in ongoing research related to the mechanism of smoke-induced ciliary inhibition and developing therapeutic agents that may allow prevention.</p>
<p>This study used adenoid explants as the source of tissue. In the pediatric population, it is widely available without any additional risk posed to children undergoing adenoidectomy. Adenoids have been used for CBF research in the past. In the era of the unified airway, the generalizability of this tissue to the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and distal airway is unclear. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of ciliary dysfunction throughout the upper airway. In addition, we are fortunate to have a small proportion of children with SHS exposure. However, as a result, we are unable to stratify patients into multiple levels of smoke exposure to develop an ex vivo dose-response relationship to smoke exposure. Finally, additional research is required to correlate CBF dysfunction to mucociliary clearance times and patient symptoms.</p>
<p>This study examined ciliary function in both an in vitro model of acute and ex vivo model of chronic smoke exposure in the pediatric population. Both studies demonstrate that environmental tobacco smoke exposure results in significant inhibition of adrenergic- and cholinergic-induced CBF in children, and it is likely that these exposures play a role in common disorders such as chronic rhinosinusitis and chronic otitis media.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of ex vivo chronic SHS exposure and an in vitro insult via CSE incubation on dynamic CBF response. There is evidence that SHS imparts deleterious effects on both the adrenergic and cholinergic mediated pathways in both in vitro and ex vivo models.</p>
