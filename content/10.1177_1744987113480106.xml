<p>Three years ago the founding editor, Veronica Bishop, reminded readers that the mission of JRN was to articulate, critique and disseminate practice development and improved care (Bishop, 2010). The papers in this issue, clustered around sexual, reproductive and gender-related topics from around the world show how, across this wide field, JRN continues to do this.</p>
<p>Issue 18.3 brings together information and commentary about people’s self-perceptions of their sexual health and identity following illness or accident; young and older women’s perceptions of their pregnancies and births; various influences on sexual activity ranging from drugs and circuit parties for gay men to symptoms of the menopause and perimenopause for women and their partners. Additionally, the papers in this issue detail a variety of techniques that may be used to assess people’s sexual and reproductive health and determine how care from healthcare workers could be evaluated.</p>
<p>For me, the unifying thread of these papers centres on the impact (positive and negative) that healthcare workers can have on people’s sexual and reproductive health. This impact is not only about medicinal interventions but it is also to do with having and using the right ‘soft’ skills to make people feel comfortable, confident and secure in their care. These skills include the ability to listen to intimate and sensitive information without embarrassment to anyone, to hear the voice of the labouring woman and not make her feel as if she’s just another package being processed, to understand how sexual and personal relationships can be altered by illness and disfigurement as well as a person’s natural life-course and to be able to read cultural cues that suggest that although deep-rooted traditions are hard to alter it is worth trying to.</p>
<p>Sex, reproduction and birth are such fundamental activities that we always need to be aware of the possible adverse consequences. A recent survey for a cross party parliamentary inquiry in the United Kingdom (2020<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113480106">health, 2012</xref>) reminds us that over half of unplanned pregnancies are a consequence of people not using sufficient contraception. Their report also draws our attention to our poor knowledge about sex, reproduction and gender and the need for better sex and relationship education in schools as well as improved access to contraception for people aged over 25.</p>
<p>As a former family planning nurse I find myself asking (somewhat rhetorically!) ‘How can something so innate be so irritatingly complicated?’ ‘Why haven’t we worked out yet how to get sexual health messages across effectively?’ Perhaps the simple answer is precisely that sex is complicated and so the sort of care and services that healthcare workers need to provide is therefore also complicated. This is particularly so in places across the world where sexual and reproductive health services are not only hard to access but also hard to deliver. Making this easier is at the root of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113480106">WHO’s (2012)</xref> new recommendations for task shifting in maternal and newborn healthcare. These encourage governments to consider if non-medical and lay healthcare workers could be trained and used to promote the uptake of a greater number of health-related interventions and behaviours in reproductive and sexual health including maternal, HIV, family planning and neonatal care. It may be that extending the numbers of people giving accurate health messages in ways that are heard will make a real change to people’s and the population’s sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p>Sexual, reproductive and gender-related health has, in its many guises, been firmly on the global agenda for many decades. But recently our attention has been diverted from the familiar staples of, for example, sex education, safe sex, safe abortion and contraceptive availability to gender-based violence on men, women and children. These violations take a myriad of forms but rarely are they as overt as the shooting of a teenage girl because she campaigned for the education of girls, and the gang-rape of a woman on a bus in a capital city. These barely believable occurrences reminded me that this aspect of health is not simply a personal or a single gender matter, rather it is one that has far reaching consequences for families, friends and the very fabric of society. The papers in this issue also serve as a reminder, albeit a very different kind of reminder, of this.</p>
