<title>Media Maladies: Desert Island discs for public health</title>
<p>During World War II a freelance broadcaster, Roy Plomley, pitched an idea for a radio programme. Launched in January 1942 in a bomb damaged BBC radio studio as Desert Island Discs, it has run ever since with only a brief post war interruption. UK residents will hardly need reminding that someone is asked to imagine being marooned on a desert island with eight pieces of recorded music or speech, a book in addition to the Bible and works of Shakespeare, and a luxury. Very few of the castaways have come from the field of medicine or specifically from public health, although they have included Professor Hugh Pennington and the late Sir Richard Doll, the latter choosing a sensible down pillow for his luxury. For this final column in the ‘Media Maladies’ series, let’s consider a possible selection from, say, the “Unknown Warrior of Public Health”.</p>
<p>With the continuing uncertainty and upheaval associated with the health service reforms, possibly several public health warriors would apply to be castaways. But what music would they choose? You Tube offers several health care reform ditties on the plight of health services in the United States. Sung to the tune of “<italic>I can’t help falling in love with you</italic>”, there’s a Pandemic flu song (“I can’t help catching a deadly flu”) and a tribute to the 1918 flu pandemic. For those interested in diet and obesity, try a worthy song for young children “<italic>Healthy and Wise</italic>”, with the admonition to “Eat right, sleep right and exercise” I’d prefer “<italic>Food, glorious food</italic>” from the musical Oliver or for a stronger message, “<italic>It’s illegal or immoral or it makes you fat</italic>”. The US Centers for Disease Control reworded ‘The Twelve Days of Christmas” in their ‘12 ways to holiday health’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“The twelfth way to health, said the CDC to me: Eat well and get moving, prepare dinner safely, practice fire safety, monitor the children, get your vaccinations, get exams and screenings, fasten belts while driving, BE SMOKE-FREE, don’t drink and drive, manage stress, bundle up for warmth, and wash hands to be safe and healthy.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Too much like work for castaways? How about some of the old classics: while public health is a team effort, our castaway could enjoy singing along with Sinatra to ‘<italic>My Way</italic>’ and commiserating with far off colleagues to Irving Berlin’s ‘<italic>Let’s face the music and dance</italic>’. This was used in a TV advertisement, which brings to mind a much loved reference to mental health with “<italic>Everyone’s a fruit and nut case</italic>”. “<italic>Chariots of Fire</italic>” (Vangelis) could recall teambuilding events or how it feels to get a public health innovation through a committee. The spectrum of public health is life itself so the selection could include “<italic>What a wonderful world</italic>” (Louis Armstrong), “<italic>The Rhythm of Life</italic>” from Sweet Charity or “<italic>The Circle of Life</italic>” from The Lion King, listening to advice such as “<italic>More to be done than can ever be done</italic>” while sipping on a coconut cocktail; followed possibly by Michael Jackson’s “<italic>Heal the world</italic>”: “There are ways to get there if you care enough.” There are several medical songs to pick, starting with “<italic>Goodness Gracious Me</italic>”, or the “<italic>St James Infirmary Blues</italic>” and working through one of the lists on the web.</p>
<p>There’s not enough space to whittle down these choices or to debate the book (perhaps ‘<italic>Catch-22</italic>’ (Joseph Heller) for a start) but the luxury would be easy – a water pump to remind the castaway of Dr John Snow’s iconic intervention. Or just the handle, if a pump seems too useful. Do send in your own choices: after all, “<italic>There may be trouble ahead</italic>….”</p>
<p>For a list of websites to listen to the songs please contact the editorial office</p>

<p>Dr Lisa Ackerley, co-founder of Hygiene Audit Systems and specialist food safety adviser to the Royal Society of Public Health, has been awarded SOFHT’s prestigious “Most Significant Contribution to the Food Industry” Award for “raising the profile of food hygiene in the best possible way.”</p>
<p>The Society of Food Hygiene and Technology’s Board of Directors chose Dr Ackerley, one of the UK’s leading food safety experts, in recognition of her valuable work within the media and the industry generally, championing a clear, well-informed consumer food safety message.</p>
<p>SOFHT Chairman Simon Houghton-Dodd commented: “She has restored credibility to the word “expert.” A lot of people purport to be experts, but Dr Lisa Ackerley, with her eloquence, factual knowledge and ability to put it across in layman’s terms, truly is. She is a credible, proper expert in every sense of the word and thanks to the work she has done throughout the media - from local radio to <italic>Watchdog</italic>, and within the industry at conferences and presentations, she has helped raise the profile of the food industry and food hygiene in the best possible way. We are delighted to recognize her contribution.</p>
<p>The award was presented at SOFHT’s annual luncheon, attended by 360 guests from all sectors of the food industry at London’s Landmark Hotel on Nov 24.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to have been chosen to receive this award,” said a delighted Dr Ackerley, who is Visiting Professor of Environmental Health at Salford University. My passion has always been to help to get the food safety and public health message across as simply and widely as possible, to help people understand why it’s important for them to do something so that they can act to improve their well-being.</p>
<p>Hygiene Audit Systems, which celebrates its 25th birthday next year, is a leading food safety and health and safety consultancy, which provides advice, training and support to businesses in the food industry, leisure, catering and hospitality sectors.</p>
