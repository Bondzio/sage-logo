<abstract>
<p>In this dialogue, geographer Joel Wainwright interviews the celebrated Marxist philosopher, Kojin Karatani. Their wide-ranging discussion examines key concepts by a series of philosophers – especially Kant, Marx, Hegel and Derrida – through an analysis of several core geographical concerns: the spatial organization of global capitalism, the formation of empires and territorial nation states, the current economic crisis, and more. The interview concludes with a discussion of the conditions of possibility of transcending the dominant social formation (i.e. capital-nation-state).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kojin Karatani, born 1941, is widely regarded as one of Japan’s greatest living intellectuals. He was awarded the Gunzo Literary Prize for an essay on Sōseki in 1969 and subsequently taught literature at several Japanese universities as well as Yale, Columbia, Cornell, and UCLA. A thinker of tremendous originality, Karatani has written over 20 books on a wide range of topics. Among Anglophone geographers, he is best known for his book <italic>Transcritique: On Kant and Marx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612436923">2003</xref>)
</italic>, which Slavoj Žižek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2043820612436923">2004</xref>: 121) describes as ‘one of the most original attempts to recast the philosophical and political bases of opposition to the empire of capital’. Since completing <italic>Transcritique</italic>, Karatani has written five subsequent books and numerous essays on matters central to human geography: the history and spatiality of nation states, the organization of global capitalism, and the prospects for a more just world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612436923">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612436923">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612436923">2004b</xref>, 2006, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820612436923">2010</xref>). Unfortunately only one of these books, <italic>History and Repetition</italic> (2012), has been translated into English. It is comprised of essays written around 1989 on historical repetition and Japanese literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612436923">
1
</xref></sup> Several recent essays have been translated (2008c, 2009a, 2009b), and <italic>Counterpunch</italic> published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2043820612436923">Karatani’s (2011)</xref> provocative response to the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Yet the bulk of Karatani’s writings, both pre- and post-<italic>Transcritique</italic>, remain inaccessible to English readers.</p>
<p>This is not the place for a critical review of Karatani’s oeuvre (for recent commentaries in English, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436923">Boutry-Stadelmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612436923">Cassegard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436923">Fuminobu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820612436923">Lippit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2043820612436923">Žižek, 2006</xref>). Given the breadth and originality of his work, it is impossible to briefly summarize its relevance to contemporary geographic thought. Geographers have drawn on Karatani’s work to examine the political economy of oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612436923">Huber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820612436923">Labban, 2010</xref>), historical materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2043820612436923">Mann, 2009</xref>), and nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820612436923">Wainwright and Kim, 2008</xref>), but this only scratches the surface of our potential dialogue with Karatani. His work yields profound insights into political economy, the philosophy of language, the interpretation of Kant and Marx, the geopolitics of capitalist nation states, the theory of social transformation, and more. While it may be vain to search for a unifying theme to these diverse contributions, Murakami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436923">Fuminobu (2009</xref>) suggests that one of the guiding threads throughout Karatani’s diverse work since the late 1960s has been the analysis of problems of self-referential language, or of problems that cannot be adequately expressed in language. He notes that Karatani has cited the following passage from Kant numerous times:<disp-quote>
<p>Human reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, since they are given to it as problems by the nature of reason itself, but which it also cannot answer, since they transcend every capacity of human reason. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612436923">Kant, 1998</xref> [1791]: A vii–ix)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I believe that Fuminobu is right about this Kantian quality of Karatani’s thought. The dominant theme of Karatani’s writings since <italic>Transcritique</italic> has been the necessary-but-impossible articulation of an alternative to capital-nation-state, an alternative Karatani calls simply ‘X’. Those who wish to conceptualize a world beyond capital, nation, and state must confront the aporetical challenge of grasping X. In this interview – Karatani’s first with a geographer – we examine the geographical dimensions of his thought, and of X.</p>
<p>I first met Karatani in Massachusetts in 2006; we met again in Tokyo in 2010. Yet this text is not a transcription of our discussions. Karatani’s native language is Japanese, which I cannot speak, and while he speaks English fluently, given the theoretical and technical character of our dialogue, we agreed that it would be best to conduct our exchange in writing. Thus I sent Karatani my questions a few weeks before we met in Tokyo, and after our discussion we wrote this text.</p>

<title>Interview</title>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: I’d like to begin by clarifying your conception of Marx’s retrospective presentation in <italic>Capital</italic> and his value form theory. In a 1980 essay, you wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Marx’s so-called ‘dialectics’ in <italic>Capital </italic>exists in its peculiar description that retrospectively reveals the inversion – fabrication of necessity out of contingency – entailed in Hegelian categorizations; it detects this mechanism, case by case, one by one, whenever a becoming of a category occurs, all the while following the line of Hegelian thought. In other words, the dynamic of <italic>Capital </italic>is that it constructs problematics in the mode of Hegel and at the same time deconstructs them, since there is indeed no other possibility of executing a ‘critique’ of Hegel. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612436923">Karatani, 1997</xref>: xxi)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This passage suggests that already in 1980 you were skeptical that it was appropriate to characterize Marx’s analysis in <italic>Capital</italic> as ‘dialectical’. In fact, you described Marx’s critique of Hegel as ‘deconstruction’. By contrast, in <italic>Transcritique</italic> you attribute the retrospective quality of <italic>Capital </italic>not to a critique of Hegel as such, but rather to the deeply Kantian quality of Marx’s analysis. Yet you do not claim that this change came about because Marx formally or explicitly returned to Kant. Rather, you attribute Marx’s radical turn to his introduction of value form after ‘his initiation to skepticism’ via ‘Bailey’s critique of Ricardo’s theory of value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2003</xref>: 5). I agree with you on this. What remains slightly obscure to me, and what I would ask you to clarify, is the relation between Marx’s retrospection, Kant’s triadic analysis, and value theory. More precisely, my confusion stems from the fact that your central illustration of Marx’s Kantian quality in <italic>Capital </italic>is value form, since Bailey’s skepticism and Kant’s parallax are totally different.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: That’s right. Bailey’s only insight is to insist on the relationality of value.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Here is how I understand your argument. Marx’s analysis of capitalism centers on his examination of value. His analysis changes over time in a way that becomes increasingly Kantian, but especially after the encounter with Bailey – not because Marx agrees with Bailey, but because he recognizes after Bailey that value requires a relational framework. Marx recognized that neither Ricardo nor Bailey could account adequately for capital’s transformation into money and the inherent drive for accumulation of surplus value. As you explain: ‘Marx’s Copernican turn in <italic>Capital</italic> is [that,] between object (qua use-value) and value, Marx discovered the form of value which makes them what they are, from which they derive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2003</xref>: 194). It is this relational system that defines the Kantian quality of Marx’s value form theory:<disp-quote>
<p>While Ricardo maintained that every commodity contains value (qua labor time) within, Bailey insisted that the value of a commodity exists only in its relation with other commodities … Marx’s theory of value form was formed transcritically between these poles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2003</xref>: 194)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, to critique both Ricardo and Bailey, Marx needed value form theory, which led him to think in a way that was essentially Kantian.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Your question reminds me of my thought from the 1970s to the 1980s. Let me speak a little about it. In the 1970s I wrote an essay called ‘The genealogy of Marx’. As the title suggests, this was an attempt to bridge Marx’s method and Nietzsche’s ‘genealogy’. I did so by re-examining Marx’s reading of classical political economy.</p>
<p>Adam Smith thought that each commodity contains exchange value which is to be indicated by money. Marx criticizes such a view as mistaking a result for a cause, by pointing out that the cause acts as a ‘vanishing mediator’:<disp-quote>
<p>What appears to happen is not that a particular commodity becomes money because all other commodities express their values in it, but, on the contrary, that all other commodities universally express their values in a particular commodity because it is money. The movement through which this process has been mediated vanishes in its own result, leaving no trace behind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2043820612436923">Marx, 1976</xref> [1867]: 187)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, the mediating process as cause is being effaced in the result. However, isn’t this similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2043820612436923">Nietzsche (2002</xref> [1886]) called ‘perspectival perversion of cause and effect’? The intent of Nietzsche’s ‘genealogy’ is to trace back to the ‘vanishing mediator’, so to speak – to disclose that the cause and effect, as commonly perceived, are reversed. Kant and Marx often did the same. I used the term ‘genealogy’ to write about Marx to criticize those, such as Foucault, who praise Nietzsche while ignoring Kant and Marx.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: In what sense can we say that Marx’s analysis is genealogical?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: In <italic>Capital</italic> Marx points out numerous instances of such ‘perspectival perversion’. So although <italic>Capital</italic> seems to be written based on Hegel’s dialectical system, at the same time the text is continually disclosing the perspectival perversion in Hegelian dialectics. Then it is inappropriate and misleading to call <italic>Capital</italic> ‘dialectical’. For this reason I appealed to Nietzsche’s ‘genealogy’. But later I came to read Kant closely and realized that this genealogical critique of the perspectival perversion started with Kant.</p>
<p>Kant wrote that he initially favored rationalism, or metaphysics, but was woken out of his ‘dogmatic slumber’ by Hume’s skepticism. Dogmatism here means the rationalism of Descartes, Leibniz, and so on. Hume doubted all this. For instance, he doubted the law of physical causality, saying that such is only guesswork from observing the regular succession of events. People imagine that ‘A caused B’, when B-type events follow regularly after A-type events happen. As you know, Kant did not stop at that and criticized Hume, who presumes empirical certainty. Kant’s ‘critique’ was directed at rationalism and at the same time to Hume, or rather empiricist premises.</p>
<p>Rationalists disregard intuition, while empiricists start from sense-data. But according to Kant, this sense-data is the result constituted by the sensible form, that is, through active workings of the subject. But this ‘movement of mediation’ is concealed from consciousness. Empiricists take the sense-data which is the result for the cause. Kantian critique aims to disclose perspectival perversion.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: And you contend that the same is true for Marx.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. Marx was stunned by his belated reading of Bailey’s criticism of Ricardo. This parallels the shock Kant experienced by reading Hume. According to Ricardo, every commodity has intrinsic value, but Bailey insists that the value of a commodity is only relative – there is no absolute, intrinsic value of a commodity, only the relations of exchange-value between commodities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612436923">Bailey (1825</xref>: 8) writes, ‘It is from this circumstance of constant reference to other commodities, or to money, … that the notion of value, as something intrinsic and absolute, has arisen’. This particular passage should remind us of Hume’s skeptical critique of the law of causality as the inference from the constant succession of events.</p>
<p>But Marx did not stop with Bailey’s critique of Ricardo. He criticized Bailey as well. Marx recognized that a commodity has no intrinsic value, but such skepticism cannot explain why people hoard particular commodities, such as gold. He asked, what makes gold special? What explains money? Marx solved this riddle through his conception of the value-form, which consists of relative form of value and equivalent form of value. Gold becomes money not because of its intrinsic value, but because it is placed in the general equivalent form of value. Regardless of what the thing may be, in so far as it is placed in the equivalent form of value, it becomes money. People do not usually think this way; they think that because a thing is money, it indicates the value of other commodities. Thus economists fail to recognize the value form, which is the ‘movement of mediation’ in concealment.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: So concealed that classical political economy failed to see it.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: That’s right. Neither Smith nor Bailey could see the value form which makes a thing a commodity or money. They were not interested in money. But without explaining money, how could it be possible to understand the activity of capital? Why do people want money? Because money gives them the right to obtain other things. The activity of capital is in accumulation of money. This is not the same as accumulation of things. Rather, accumulation of money is accumulation of the right to obtain things any time, instead of consuming. For this reason Marx sees the hoarding of money in the origin of capital. Yet industrial capital no longer remembers this ‘origin’. This is one respect in which capital is essentially a perverted activity, which we take to be natural.</p>
<p>As you remarked, to critique both Ricardo and Bailey, Marx needed value form theory, which led him to think in a way that was essentially Kantian. That is right, but let me add one thing here. To be essentially Kantian also implies a genealogical attempt to disclose the mediated process in concealment.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Do you see Marx’s value form theory as an explicit reiteration of Kant’s triadic structure of thing-in-itself, phenomena, and <italic>Schein</italic>? If so, could we say that thing-in-itself: use value:: phenomena: exchange value:: value form: <italic>Schein</italic>?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Actually, no, I don’t see it that way. It seems difficult to say so. I wrote in <italic>Transcritique</italic> that the Lacanian distinction between the real, the symbolic, and the imaginary could be traced back to Kant’s distinction between thing-in-itself, phenomenon, and <italic>Schein</italic>. So, if I have to, I would say that commodities:: real, value-form:: symbolic, money:: imaginary.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> In your recent work you have extended your claim that Marx thought in a Kantian fashion by reading the <italic>Metaphysics of Morals</italic> as the basis for a communist metaphysics. For instance, you argue that that Kant’s maxim, ‘every rational being exists as an ends in himself and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612436923">Kant, 1990</xref> [1785]: 45), should be taken as a critique of the social relations of capitalism, which are nothing except the reduction of all relations to the commodity, the market nexus, and ultimately, money. It seems to me that Kant’s conception of dignity could be helpful for clarifying the relationship between communist metaphysics and singular in universality. In the second section of the <italic>Metaphysics of Morals</italic> Kant draws the following distinction:<disp-quote>
<p>In the realm of ends everything has either a price or a dignity. Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price and therefore admits of no equivalent, has dignity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612436923">Kant, 1990</xref> [1785]: 51)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Could we say therefore that communism is a metaphysics of dignity? That each person, singular in universality, is above all price and has no equivalent?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes, you put it beautifully. I regret that I did not quote this phrase in the book. It actually points to what I wished to say most accurately. To give another example, in <italic>Transcritique</italic> I differentiated between particularity and singularity (2003: section 3.3). Following Kant, particularity can be said to have a price and singularity can be said to have dignity. Each person’s singularity has no exchange value. This does not come from any special quality or unique individuality of a person. Such qualities have a price and are exchangeable. Singularity, which any ordinary person has, is something un-exchangeable. That is dignity. In other words, dignity is freedom or voluntary subjectivity. Kant found the moral principle in treating others not just as means but also as ends. To treat others as ends is to treat others as voluntary subjects. Kant calls the society where people treat each other as an end the ‘kingdom of ends’ (<italic>Reiche der Zwecke</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820612436923">
2
</xref></sup> Unlike today’s ethicists who refer to Kant, Kant considered this matter from the economic level. For instance, capitalist society relies on treating labor as a commodity, so human beings are routinely treated as mere means. Thus, the kingdom of ends can only be realized by superseding capitalist economy. It was for this reason that Kant proposed cooperatives, which is totally ignored today. By contrast, Marx’s communism is typically conceptualized only on the level of economics, and it is totally forgotten that his communism is nothing but Kant’s ‘kingdom of ends’. What is worth the name of communism has to be something that secures human dignity.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> Your reply reminds me of a passage from your book <italic>Architecture as Metaphor</italic>, where you discuss the conditions of possibility for change in philosophy:<disp-quote>
<p>Changes in philosophy are not prompted only by changed historical circumstances; they also emerge as a result of changes in the very nature of philosophy itself – philosophy is a self-referential system where ultimate determination and closure is impossible. But if this is so, a critique of philosophy results in another dual opposition. The insistence on the superiority of either text or rhetoric over philosophy might become dominant. But is this any different from the previous state of affairs? Is it not, after all, a metaphysics of the text? Derrida addresses this issue as follows: ‘Whoever alleges that philosophical discourse belongs to the closure of a language must still proceed within this language and with the oppositions it furnishes. According to a law that can be formalized, philosophy reappropriates for itself the discourse that de-limits it’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612436923">Karatani, 1997 [1983]</xref>: 103)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>My impression is that, by the time you wrote <italic>Transcritique </italic>in the 1990s,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2043820612436923">
3
</xref></sup> your position had moved away from Derrida’s. In one of the key passages in the Preface, you write: ‘This, to state it outright, is a project to reconstruct the metaphysics called communism’ (2003: xi). I find this project deeply compelling. Yet how do you conceptualize the task of ‘reconstructing metaphysics’? And how would you characterize the relation between your project in <italic>Transcritique </italic>and Derrida’s conception of ‘closure of metaphysics’? Could we say that Derrida also shifted toward the metaphysics called communism in the 1990s, particularly in <italic>Specters of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612436923">Marx (1994)</xref>
</italic> where he calls for the New International?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Let me explain my relationship with Derrida a bit. I read Derrida in the early 1970s. My interest was mostly in his relatively early works, such as his critique of Husserl’s phenomenology from a different viewpoint from Heidegger. His works in the 1960s, such as<italic> Writing and Difference</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612436923">Derrida, 1978 [1967]</xref>), remain masterpieces. But when I came to know him in the United States he was already quite different.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How did you come to know Derrida?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I was introduced to him by Paul de Man while teaching at Yale in 1976. De Man was a professor of comparative literature at Yale and writing literary criticism. Derrida became well known in America almost exclusively in terms of literary criticism. The books he wrote in France too show his affinity to literature. He was trying to become a ‘writer’ (<italic>ecrivain</italic>), so to speak. I am different in this respect. I started off as a literary critic but wished to draw myself out of it. So I was not sympathetic to the Derridian literary style in general. I have never written in that style.</p>
<p>I should say a word here on my view of literature. Not only Derrida but in fact all those who were literature-oriented at that time were motivated by the failure of <italic>Evenements de Mai</italic>. They sought the possibility of revolution in literature, or <italic>Ecriture</italic> and poetic language. The thoughts generally known as poststructuralism should be seen as a type of conversion from politics to literature. The same could be said of Heidegger, who first proposed deconstruction of western metaphysics. For him, poetry was more fundamental than philosophy. This reflects his thinking after his involvement with the Nazis and subsequent disillusionment with it.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Thus Heidegger turned away from politics toward poetical thinking.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: This sort of thinking always comes from political failure. It seems revolutionary, but underneath it lies political impotency. Similarly, during the 1960s there was no possibility to go beyond the cold war. Then people tried to go beyond it by imagination, that is, literature. This was why philosophy or any other thing had to be literature.</p>
<p>But turning to literature by political failure or impotency was nothing new. For instance, modern Japanese literature started with political failure. Knowing this, I was skeptical about turning to literature after a failure of revolution. My book <italic>Origins of Modern Japanese <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612436923">Literature <italic>(1998 [1980</italic>
</xref>
</italic>]) intended to make it clear that modern literature is a product of such inversion, or the internalization of political failure. I began criticizing ‘literature’ in this way in the 1970s. When the English translation of this book was published in 1993, I was already far removed from literature.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How would you characterize this kind of political failure-driven literary revolution?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: It is a revolution by words which relies on the power of ideas. To criticize German idealists and Left Hegelian ideologues, including himself, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820612436923">Marx (1845</xref>) wrote: ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it’. French poststructuralists have spread the idea that we can change the world by changing our interpretation of the world. This was why reading of texts became the initial importance. This generated what Richard Rorty called ‘textual idealism’.</p>
<p>There is a close parallel between this situation and German idealism. Toward the end of the 18th century England had developed industrial capitalism and France had political Bourgeois revolution but Germany did not have anything. The Germans could only carry out revolution of ideas. As you know, this was by no means an achievement of ordinary kind. Actually, German idealism became the model of philosophical revolution. The thought that made a sensation after the 1970s represents a revival of this.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Yet clearly your position is not that of orthodox materialism.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: No, we cannot always praise materialism. But neither can we say that idealism is always wrong. It is the social context that determines what is critical. There is no stance which is constantly correct. For example, you cannot always make yourself right by using the method of deconstruction. It may become evasive, depending upon the actual situation. I shifted my stance after the 1990s, that is to say, the end of metaphysical binary opposition of the cold war. Critique is impossible without moves. Later I started to call these shifts accompanying criticism ‘transcritique’, coining this term by combining transcendental and transversal critique.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Is ‘transcritique’ a spatial practice? Could it happen just anywhere, or does it require a certain geographical translocation? I ask this question because of an ambiguity in <italic>Transcritique</italic>. You imply that Marx’s own achievement of transcritique was the result of his dislocation from Germany, to Paris, and to London. This makes sense to me, because the experience of geographical dislocation is one that I associate with self-reflection and critique. Yet you also write that Kant – who famously never left Königsberg – ‘assumed a kind of transposition’ through his <italic>refusal </italic>to move to Berlin. How is it possible that for Marx transcritique required geographical transposition, but not for Kant? Is it possible that this may have had something to do with the fact that Kant gave so many lectures on geography? Moreover, how do you explain your own achievement of transcritique? Would you say that you are more like Marx or Kant in this sense?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Your points about Kant are absolutely right. What he taught at university was not philosophy, but geography and anthropology. This is worth noting. It will be useful to re-read Kant as a geographer.</p>
<p>As regards translocation, what is important is not physical translocation. As for myself, I started to read Marx’s words in terms of translocation when I traveled to Europe alone at the age of 30. I had never left Japan before then. However, traveling or translocation does not always bring realizations. I know many people who travel all over the world all the time but receive no particular realization from the experience and go on explaining things based on the same old principles. Levi-Straus wrote, ‘I hate explorers’. Explorers enjoy translocations but gain no realizations. In fact, I dislike traveling. I am not interested in sightseeing either. Wherever I visit, my favorite activity is to sit in a café, reading and writing.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Earlier you mentioned that Derrida’s work was influenced by the events of 1968. But you came to know him later.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: That’s right. I became critical of Derrida when we met again during the Gulf War in 1991. His attitude was vague. Of course his language was equivocal even before then. But it was something methodological, which questioned the self-evidence of any positive stance, whether affirmative or negative. Such a position was necessary for a critical thinking during the cold war regime. But during the Gulf War – which in itself was evidence of the collapse of the cold war structure – his language appeared to be self-mystifying escapism. I had already grown weary of Derridean language of self-mystifying undecidability. Although I believed that Derrida himself must be different from his followers, I was disappointed by his attitude at the Gulf War.</p>
<p>Later I learned that Derrida was writing about Marx at that time. I came to realize that Derrida was after all different from Derridians. He too shifted his stance. Despite his adherence to the old style, he was transcritical. One example is his connection of the phrase ‘A specter of communism is haunting Europe’ from the <italic>Communist Manifesto </italic>with the ghost in <italic>Hamlet </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612436923">Derrida, 1994</xref>). This sort of approach provided comfort to literary theorists, indicating that they could still get away without reading <italic>Capital</italic>.</p>
<p>But I suppose I could turn the same criticism toward myself. In Japan people used to know me as a literary critic. Regardless of the contents of my writings or activities, I was connected with literary criticism. It was only when I launched the New Associationist Movement (NAM) that people became aware that what I was doing went beyond literary criticism. While those who liked my previous writings or image objected to my shift, some others took my move as a proof of seriousness and started to like me.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> Before discussing your experiences with NAM, I’d like to ask about your reading of Hegel, capitalism, and civil society. In the foreword to the Turkish translation of <italic>Transcritique</italic>, you write:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]t was Hegel who first grasped the Trinitarian nature of capital-nation-state … Because Hegel’s understanding was idealistic, Marx tried to turn it around materialistically. In so doing, Marx saw civil society (capitalist economy) as infrastructure and the state or nation as super-structure. This leads to the idea that once the capitalist economy is superseded, the latter will automatically be extinguished. Obviously, this is not true. This is why Marxists repeatedly stumbled when it came to matters of the state and nation. This is because Marx himself failed to see that the state or nation has a solid and real basis of existence [in exchange] … If we are to seriously supersede capital, nation, and state, we need to first recognize what they are. To simply deny them leads us nowhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2008a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This passage raises two questions. First: how do you conceptualize the relationship between civil society (in Marx) and capital-nation-state? By my reading, the concept ‘civil society’ is displaced by your analysis; unlike capital-nation-state, what we call ‘civil society’ since Hegel lacks a real basis in exchange, but is rather an expression of the totality of capital-nation-state. It seems to me that your perspective is a fundamental critique of Hegel’s ‘civil society’, since you reject the individualism of liberalism that takes each subject as a free floating atom in a total social cosmos, as well as the capital-nation-state ensemble that give rise to civil society. Could you clarify your thoughts here?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Marx used the term ‘civil society’ (<italic>bürgerliche Gesellschaft</italic>) in his early years, when dealing with Hegel’s <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436923">1996</xref> [1821]). In this period, Marx’s ideas are critical of Hegel yet remain in a Hegelian mindset. According to Hegel civil society is ‘<italic>verstandig</italic>’ and not the ‘<italic>vernünftig</italic>’ (rational) state. The latter is the nation state which rationally regulates the anarchic market economy and actualizes the communality of people. Rational state is a realization of the slogan in the French Revolution: ‘Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity’.</p>
<p>In <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic> Hegel’s analysis was arguably modeled on England, since the state of such kind did not exist in Prussia. The kind of state delineated in <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic> is a kind of welfare state, which then is still valid today as a theory to account for welfare state. This is the reason I start from critique of Hegel. As much as Hegel is idealistic, it seems to me that he captured the totality of the triadic capital-nation-state, without abstracting any of them.</p>
<p>Marx materialistically ‘inverted’ Hegel’s idealistic system. In other words he understood civil society as the infrastructure and the nation or the state as the superstructure, the former determining the latter. This follows his thinking that by superseding civil society, or capitalist economy, the superstructure, or nation and the state, automatically disappears. But this cannot happen. Marxists always stumble on the issues of nation or the state. This was apparent in the Revolutions of 1848. These revolutions generated the state system, which is at once state-capitalist and state-socialist, as Bonaparte of France and Bismarck of Prussia show. That is to say, capital-nation-state was formed as a result of the Revolutions of 1848. Classic revolutionary movements were no longer possible in Europe after this. Paris commune was only a last sparkle. Now that capital-nation-state is established in developed capitalist countries, revolutionary movements which do not accompany this recognition are naturally meaningless. In 1979 Francis Fukuyama declared ‘the end of history’, basing his arguments on Hegel. This means that capital-nation-state is the final system. In a sense, he is right. Many rejected his thesis of the end of history and tried to change society – as the US president Obama advocates – but they actually remain a part of capital-nation-state.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: So your aim was to re-do Marx’s critique of Hegel, so to speak.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. Let me emphasize that Hegel was the first to capture capital, nation, and the state as a mutually relating system, in <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic>. For a revision of Marx’s critique of Hegel, one must on the one hand follow Marx and materialistically invert Hegel’s idealistic comprehension of the modern social formation and the ‘world history’ preceding it, while on the other hand maintaining Hegel’s recognition of the trinitarian nature of capital-nation-state. But to this end, it is indispensable to look at world history from the perspective of mode of exchange.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright: </italic>In contrast to that of mode of production.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. Most people see Marx as a theorist of capitalism as a mode of production, with the emphasis on social relations of production. This is not entirely wrong, of course. Consider Marx’s summary of the conclusions of his research in his famous Preface to his <italic>Critique of Political Economy</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2043820612436923">Marx, 1977</xref> [1859])</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This statement and others like it gave rise to a school of Marxist thought that interprets capitalism as a mode of production, the ‘base’ of all social relations in capitalist society. As I have argued, politically this position has been disastrous.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Because it suggested that revolution simply required the use of state power by a vanguard party to overthrow capitalism.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes, which in fact only contributed more power to the state and nation. And while capitalist social relations were repressed, they were not overcome. Along with the political critique of the base-superstructure metaphor, I would emphasize that we have to consider Marx’s analysis in <italic>Capital</italic>, which does not strictly follow his outline from the earlier Preface. To be sure, Marx continues to discuss capitalism as a ‘mode of production’.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: In the very first sentence of <italic>Capital,</italic> he writes of ‘those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails’.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: True, but the analysis that immediately follows in that chapter – the exposition of value form – is not at all limited to production, and in fact centers on capital in motion.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Marx shows that the essence of capitalism as a social relation lies in commodity exchange.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Precisely. He saw that capitalism’s peculiarity as a way of organizing social life stems from the production and sale of commodities. Both aspects are crucial.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: As well as the <italic>salto mortale</italic> or parallax gap between the production process and the moment of sale.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. Rereading Marx, I came to see that we could interpret his approach based on the analysis of forms of relational exchange. Let me give two illustrations. He often uses the term <italic>Verkehr</italic>, which means ‘intercourse’ or ‘traffic’, to describe exchange relations. In <italic>The German Ideology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2043820612436923">Marx and Engels, 1970 [1845]</xref>) he uses <italic>Verkehr </italic>to describe communication, traffic, trade, and even military exchanges between communities – in other words, ‘exchange’ in an expansive sense. A second illustration follows from Marx’s important writings on the relations between humans and nature. He defines this relationship with the concept <italic>Stoffwechsel</italic>, or ‘metabolism’, the material exchange between human beings and the environment. This concept is central to his very conception of human nature and its natural history. So here too we can see that, for Marx, relations of exchange are fundamental.</p>
<p>After completing <italic>Transcritique, </italic>I wanted to elaborate these ideas on a broader historical canvas. In <italic>World Republic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2006</xref>) I did so based on my conception of four modes of exchange. I argue that all concrete historical social formations are variations and combinations of four fundamental forms of exchange which can be derived from two distinctions: (1) non-reciprocal and reciprocal; (2) unfree and free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2043820612436923">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Form of exchange A, gift and reciprocity, is arguably the ‘oldest’ mode of exchange, rooted in the earlier human communities; it consists in nothing more than the generalized expectation of give-and-take. It is a means of reciprocal exchange, one that creates community, everywhere governed, of course, by traditional norms (religion, patriarchy, gerontocracy), boundaries around the recognizable community (belonging and exclusion, or friend and enemy), and so on.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: So the gift is reciprocal but obligatory, therefore unfree.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: That’s right. This form of reciprocity should not be interpreted as goodwill, but as a means of subordinating others to one’s will. And the gift here can include the simple but fundamental act of recognizing that one is part of a community. But this always entails exclusion, which is unfree from the perspective of the other, the excluded. Turning to plunder (B), this mode of exchange is neither free nor reciprocal, at least for those who are plundered. It is nonetheless a form of exchange insofar as it involves material exchange – the theft of slaves, land, or crops – and the subsequent redistribution of value. Market exchange (C) has existed for a long period of human history. Capitalism did not invent markets. But what is distinctive today is that under capitalism, market exchange is definitive. This is the lesson of <italic>Capital</italic>: capitalism is not unique in centering social relations on exchange – only in the form this takes, which is commodity exchange organized by value form. But note that this does not mean that the other forms of exchange have disappeared – they have not. They are intermixed with market exchange, so to speak. It is simply that today, in contrast to earlier social-historical formations, we live in a world where A and B are subordinate to C.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Quadrant D is the most difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Here we find a mode of exchange defined by free and reciprocal exchange – what Marx calls ‘communism’, or Noam Chomsky calls ‘libertarian socialism’. But because these words carry negative and unintended connotations for many people today, I prefer to use the sign ‘X’. X does not exist in reality. It exists only as an idea (<italic>Idée</italic>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright: </italic>Your comments on mode of exchange X raise the question of the possibility of transcending capital-nation-state. I find the conclusion of <italic>Transcritique </italic>to be profoundly aporetical. On one hand, you offer a powerful analysis of the Borromean ring capital-nation-state and the need to transcend it through the creation of practices that support X, which is social life based upon free and reciprocal exchange relations. Yet then it seems like you argue that we cannot achieve X, that X is impossible. And you contend that associations of associations – Marx’s expression for communism – have not yet existed. Thus, could we say that the ultimate antinomy of <italic>Transcritique </italic>is: ‘X must exist; X cannot exist’? This complexity is further elaborated in your recent remarks at Middlesex:<disp-quote>
<p>Mode D is … a recovery of mode A, or reciprocity in a higher dimension. Mode D does not exist in reality; if it does, it is only temporary … The recovery of reciprocity is ‘the return of the repressed’, so as Freud remarked, it has something compulsive that transcends human will. In short, morality and religiosity do not reside in the superstructure, but rather are deeply rooted in the economic base structure. When seen in this light, we can easily understand Marx’s remark that the conditions of communism result from premises now in existence. Modes of exchange A, B, and C remain persistently. In other words, community (nation), the state, and capital remain persistently. We cannot clear them out. But we need not be pessimistic, because as long as these modes persist, the mode of exchange D will also persist. It will keep coming back no matter how much it is repressed and concealed. Kant’s ‘regulative idea’ is such a thing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2009b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To this point, a friend of mine suggested that you propose no real strategy of resistance to capitalism. My reply was to say, ‘of course, Karatani would concede that his strategy is basically impossible; but I cannot see an alternative to the sort of moral-political critique that Karatani proposes; I think Karatani, like Marx – or Derrida for that matter – would be the first to concede that the grasp for associationism beyond the trinity of capital-state-nation is aporetical’. I wonder if this is a fair estimation of your position. Yet, even if my reply does not misrepresent your view, I wonder how we might explain to people <italic>why</italic> ‘we need not be pessimistic’, as you said in London. It seems to me that faced with such an aporia, most people – including many on the left, however defined – will retreat to religion or liberalism. So when we say ‘we need not be pessimistic’ because D will persist, do we not also need to add ‘so long as there is a drive, or will, to transcend capital-nation-state’?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes, the point you make is very important. Examination of the trinity of capital-nation-state makes you realize how difficult it is to supersede it. Previously people, for instance, thought of overcoming capitalism by the state or nation. This is not so difficult. But those attempts resulted in enforcing the state and nation, which in turn revives capitalism. This was what happened in the 20th century. Such difficulties compel us to recognize the finality of capital-nation-state, leaving us with the idea that the only possible way left for us now is to change society little by little within these confines. This is what was meant by the ‘the end of history’ in 1989.</p>
<p>It was then I started to think about Kant when the postmodern mantra of the idea as a mere appearance was echoing all over. I noticed the difference between Kant’s constitutive idea (<italic>Idée</italic>) and regulative idea. What people called the idea was the constitutive idea. Those who attempted to recreate society to match their ideas and were met with disastrous consequences rejected the idea altogether. For me communism is a regulative idea and not a constitutive idea. This regulative idea, which would never be realized, keeps compelling us to supersede capital-nation-state. This regulative idea is not derived from our wishes, discontent or idealization. It compels us rather against our own will. This will not cease until it is fully realized.</p>
<p>Why? Marx explained communism as a necessary recovery of primitive communism, or common ownership, on a higher dimension. But why should the common ownership need to ‘return’? The conception of the ‘dialectical negation of the negation’ cannot explain this – it only sounds similar to the myth of regaining a lost paradise.</p>
<p>I think that we can explain this from the viewpoint of mode of exchange, not mode of production, in combination with Freud’s concept ‘return of the repressed’: a once repressed drive returns in a different form and with compulsion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2043820612436923">
4
</xref></sup> If mode of exchange A – the principle of reciprocity – is repressed, it should return compulsively, albeit by taking a different form at the stage where the modes B and C are dominant.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: But when you speak of D as a ‘recovery’ of A, this is not a romantic return to a former community life.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Not at all. While every romantic recovery ends in affirming the <italic>status quo</italic> and recovering the traditional order, this ‘return of the repressed’ calls for radically changing the <italic>status quo</italic>. As the return of the repressed D apparently comes from the future rather than the revival of the past. In this regard, Ernst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612436923">Bloch (1986</xref>) was right in his attempt to reconstruct Marxism as ‘philosophy of future’. To critique Freudian ‘unconsciousness’, he put forward the idea ‘the not-yet-consciousness’. But this is actually no different from Freud’s ‘return of the repressed’. When the ancient world-empire appeared, universal religion emerged as the ‘return of the repressed’, as a resistance movement against empire. It emerged not as human wishes but as imperative from God. Social movements ever since were almost always clothed with the form of universal religion. In the late 19th century when the mode of exchange became dominant, D lost its religious aspects and became ‘scientific socialism’. But D is essentially a regulative idea. If this perspective is lost, ‘scientific socialism’ becomes a constructive idea, and will be eventually debased, as in the case of Stalinism. But the regulative idea will never disappear.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> Your discussion of exchange mode A and reciprocity brings us to the question of nationalism. As you know, there is a crucial passage in the <italic>Manifesto</italic> where Marx and Engels discuss nationalism:<disp-quote>
<p>The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612436923">Marx, 1994 [1848]</xref>: 174)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In my interpretation, Marx and Engels thus pose communism contra nationalism, ‘in the bourgeois sense of the word’, as it existed in Europe in the mid-19th century, and they argue for overthrowing capitalism <italic>and</italic> nationalism. But curiously, to accomplish its historical purposes they contend that ‘the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy’, must become the hegemonic class, ‘must constitute itself the nation’. How do you interpret this? By my reading, Marx and Engels claim that the proletariat must somehow transcend the boundaries of nations and reconstitute disparate groups into an encompassing ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820612436923">Wainwright and Kim, 2008</xref>). Thus they affirm a communist ethics of transnationalism or, more precisely, they affirm the struggle of subaltern groups to articulate transnational communism as a counter-power to nationalist capitalism.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I agree. But let me elaborate about nation. Nation corresponds to ‘fraternity’ in the slogan of the French Revolution, ‘liberty, equality, and fraternity’, while capital and the state correspond to liberty and equality. Nation then is something to imaginarily recover ‘the community’ or the exchange mode A, which in some ways conflicts with B or C. This is why nationalism resembles D in certain senses. Nationalism is troublesome in this regard.</p>
<p>Yet of course nationalism is different from D. For instance, nation has exclusive elements, as well as egalitarian elements. In this sense it is the same as a village community. Nation simply aims to return to A and the traditional order. While D is a recovery of A on the higher level, nation is a recovery of A on the lower level, so to speak. Although nation seems critical of B and C, the state and capitalism, it affirms them instead of superseding them. Consequently they form capital-nation-state. Nationalism or romanticism is a recovery of A but not on the higher level like D. It soon subordinates to B and C. Nationalism is troublesome since it resembles D. That is one reason why fascism, or national socialism, attracted people.</p>
<p>In the <italic>Manifesto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612436923">Marx and Engels, 1994 [1848])</xref>, Marx writes, ‘<italic>Die Arbeiter haben kein Vaterland</italic>’. However, this was written to argue against the criticism that communism deprives nation from the proletariats. The proletariats are not treated as citizens, who are equal to the Bourgeois. It means that the proletariats have no nation. Then Marx asks, how could we take away from them what they do not have? Marx was not positively suggesting the necessity of nation for the proletariat, or proletarian nationalism. In reality there is a deep-seated ideology that the proletariat, who are also citizens, have the duty to serve the country. Marx’s words are an ironical objection to this kind of bourgeois ideology. That is to say, Marx said to the bourgeois ideologues – who always emphasize nationalism – that the proletarians are not treated like citizens and thus have no country. To treat the proletarians as citizens would be to supersede the class relationship of capital-wage laborer.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> By your reading, then, Marx’s conception of the proletariat ‘constituting itself the nation’ is synonymous to its superseding of capital and the state.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Precisely. However, we have to consider the <italic>Manifesto</italic> in its time. After the revolutions of 1848, there were movements to treat the proletariats like citizens. That was the case in England first, but was followed by Luis Bonaparte of France, and Bismarck of Prussia who adopted socialist policies. This was a sort of counter revolution to the revolutions of 1848. Thus capital-nation-state was established for the first time. And it continues today.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be wrong to apply Marx’s words before 1848 to the situations after then. Marx and others formed the first International in this situation, at a time when social movements in Europe were divided by nationalism. Some, like the Italians, aimed to achieve national unity. The formation of ‘nation’ is indispensable to such developing capitalist countries. Thus the first International was marked by clashes caused by nationalism. Behind the chasm between Bakunists and Marxists was antagonism between Russia and Prussia. And the Second International was entirely dissolved with the outbreak of the First World War, when socialists from different countries supported the participation of their countries in the war.</p>
<p>Nationalism has always presented intricacies for Marxists. It is a problem because it resembles D. It <italic>seems</italic> very critical of capital and the state. Otherwise there would be no appeal to people. This was why fascism, or national socialism, triumphed in Germany, Italy, and Japan. It seemed to provide a means to transcend capital and the state by recovering the national community. National socialism as such is unlikely to come back in future. What is strong now is religious fundamentalism. This too is something to antagonize capital and the state, and therefore resembles D. But it can only lead to theocracy, never to D.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> I’d like to return to Marx’s analysis of nation in the <italic>Manifesto </italic>here. Marx makes a curious argument about the role of capitalism – what you call mode of exchange C – in reducing national antagonisms:<disp-quote>
<p>National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612436923">Marx and Engels, 1994 [1848]</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Marx and Engels thus claim that some of the conditions for the moment when the proletariat may ‘constitute itself the nation’ are, perhaps ironically, facilitated by what we today call ‘globalization’, as ‘the development of the bourgeoisie, … freedom of commerce’ and ‘the world market’ reduce the distance and antagonisms between peoples. Of course, this does not mean that capitalism has been motivated by some moral or rational principle. As you write in <italic>Transcritique</italic>: ‘the movement of capital, the hoarding drive, that unwittingly has been forming the globalization of ‘humanity’ in the world, does not have a rational motivation’ (2003: 211). Yet, it persists, and transnationalism in this sense of ‘the globalization of humanity’ has indeed advanced as a consequence of the long-term global extension of capitalist social relations. Is this not the essence of what you call ‘world intercourse’?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: That’s right. Thanks to genetic analysis, recent archeology developed dramatically, from which we learn the following: humanity was born in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Around 50,000–60,000 years ago, fewer than one thousand people left Africa and dispersed all over the world via Yemen and India. They formed in each place numerous races, languages, and cultures. What we are experiencing today is the process of these ramified peoples coming to reunite as humanity.</p>
<p>What has been prompting this process was capitalism, or the thorough infiltration of the mode of exchange C in every society. Under the system of world-economy since the 16th century, modern states and nations were formed beyond the tribal ethnic groups. It will not be long before national divisions become of less importance. But this will not happen automatically. The struggles among nations, races, religions, and so on will likely intensify under the modern world-system. Human unity will be possible by realizing the system of world-republic. This is the world-system based on the principle of exchange mode D.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: I’d like to ask about the geography of this world-system, that is, the spatiality of capital-nation-state and its possible transcendence. In recent years many Marxist geographers, myself included, have examined the spatiality of the power of the capitalist nation state. This work typically centers on the concept of territory, since the production of territory – or territorialization, the making of state-space – is fundamental to the organization of capital-nation-state. Yet in <italic>Transcritique</italic> I did not find a clear statement on the spatiality of capital-nation-state. This seems to be something that you have taken up in your more recent work. Could you clarify how the spatiality of capital-nation-state has evolved in your thought?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I did not overlook the issue of spatiality in <italic>Transcritique</italic>. I examined several philosophers through the lens of spatial difference – not only Kant and Marx, but even Descartes. He traveled to different places and through the past by reading books. From the differences he found in his moves, the ‘I doubt’ or <italic>cogito</italic> arose. Unlike mere self-consciousness, this <italic>cogito</italic> is geographical and anthropological. The concept ‘transcritique’ implies being transcendental and transversal at the same time. It means crossing spatial differences and different exchanges.</p>
<p>But, as you say, I did not give enough thought to actual spaces. I came to think about this more after writing <italic>Transcritique</italic> and began thinking about the world-system. This shift is related to what happened around the world after September 2001. Until then I had the tendency of thinking about the state from within. But during this period I acutely felt the impossibility of understanding the state only from within.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How did you attempt to grasp the spatiality of the state?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: By analyzing modes of exchange. A social formation consists of three different modes of exchange. The historical stage of a social formation varies depending on which mode of exchange is dominant: from a society where the mode A is dominant, to a society where the mode B is dominant, and then to a society where the mode C is dominant. In the C dominant society, or capitalist social formation, communities and the state are transformed to constitute a whole which is capital-nation-state.</p>
<p>The assumption here is that social formations exist by themselves. But in reality no social formation exists in isolation. We then need to assume that social formations are placed in relationship with other social formations. This is to think from the ‘world-system’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2043820612436923">Figure 2</xref>). Wallerstein differentiated the world without the state, the world controlled by a single state, and the world where market economy prevails without state control. He called them, respectively, ‘mini-systems’, ‘world-empires’, and ‘world-economies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612436923">Wallerstein, 1976</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>There were two kinds of criticism of Wallerstein. One came from Christopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612436923">Chase-Dunn (1991</xref>). According to him, what defines a given ‘world-system’ is not the matter of scale, and even a ‘mini-system’ is a kind of world-system. It is true that the tribal confederacy of Iroquois was huge in its scale. The other criticism came from Braudel, who argues that the world-economy did not originate in 16th-century Europe, but existed in Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Without elaborating on these debates, I contend that we could think of three types of world-systems by differentiating according to the formative mode of exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2043820612436923">Figure 3</xref>). A mini-system is reciprocal and based on gifting or marriage. World-empire is the mode of exchange B. World-economy is the world-system which is formed by the mode C or trade and markets. </p>

</fig>
<p>With this recognition we could realize how the world-system X, which transcends other world-systems, is possible. This is formed when the mode of exchange A is recovered on the higher level. This can only be formed by the power of gifting, not by military power or money. In my view, what Kant called a ‘world-republic’ was the idea of this kind of world-system.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> This still leaves open the question of the territorial expression of these world-systems. In my book <italic>Decolonizing Development</italic>, I wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Kojin Karatani proposed a similar problematic with the central trinity of his transcritical Marxism: nation-state-capital (2005: 13–16). In my view the key trinity is (nation-state)–capital–territory. It is the spatial, especially territorial relations of power that makes particular nation-state-capital couplings possible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2043820612436923">Wainwright, 2008</xref>: 35)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>My views on this have since evolved, in part by reflecting upon your more recent theorization of modes of exchange. I agree with you that a Marxist analysis should examine capital-nation-state as a triadic structure – a Borromean ring, to use your metaphor. Yet, this still raises the analytical question of the relation of the Borromean ring structure to the world. In other words, what do you feel is the appropriate geographical or spatial concept that links (or articulates) between the Borromean ring capital-nation-state and world? It seems to me that something like the concept of territory is needed here.</p>
<p>Taking your analysis of Borromean ring structure, could we define ‘territory’ as the spatial-ontological condition that binds capital-nation-state in the world? If we accept this, two points are clarified. First, it shows that an attack on capital-nation-state – our attempt at transcending the Borromean ring through transcritical counteractions – must also imply transcending territory, i.e. remaking a world without territory. This is because overcoming capital-nation-state implies, ipso facto, transforming the spatial form of this Borromean ring. Second, it allows us to raise the question of Eurocentrism anew. The historical event of capital-nation-state coupling did not happen just anywhere; it occurred in Europe, which used this ‘achievement’ to attempt to dominate the world. Today we are turning to Kant and Marx because they provide us with powerful ways to understand capital-nation-state, but this is not in order to ‘return to Europe’. On the contrary, it seems to me that transcritique is essentially a postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism: one that must (by its call to overcome capital-nation-state) attempt to make a world that is not spatially organized in the territorial form that has become dominant since the spread of European empire.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I have re-examined those questions from the view of world-system. Wallerstein understood the space of world-economy as core, semi-periphery, and periphery. Following the dependence theory of Frank, Amin, and others, Wallerstein thought that there is a mechanism through which the core exploits the wealth from the periphery. But I think his explanation is insufficient. Allow me to explain my view.</p>
<p>Preceding the emergence of the world capitalist economy, world-empire too had the structure of core and periphery. This, however, is different from world-economy. World-empires extend only as far as their military power extends, as they are based on the mode of exchange B. This explains why world-empires existed in many distinct places. But world-economy, which is based on the mode of exchange C, expands infinitely. Therefore, among the history of distinct world-empires, the world-economy is singular.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Does world-empire have a definitive spatial structure?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Karl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2043820612436923">Wittfogel (1957</xref>) can help us to answer this question with his theory of Asiatic despotic states and irrigation. His reputation is quite negative among Marxists – he has been almost completely ignored – but I think he contributed a lot to elucidating the geopolitical structure of the world-empire: core, periphery, and semi-periphery. The periphery is placed in a tribute-protection relationship with the core. But the relationship between core and periphery is not fixed. The periphery often counterattacks the core and sometimes even replaces it. Core and periphery then come to resemble each other. Meanwhile, the ‘semi-periphery’ is typically more distant from the core than the periphery. There is little direct threat from core. The semi-periphery adopts the core’s civilization, but not in its totality, only selectively. For instance, Greece and Rome were semi-peripheral with respect to Egypt and Mesopotamia as core; likewise Japan was semi-peripheral to China as core. Numerous theorists, from Marx and Weber to Braudel, noticed that Japanese feudalism was similar to that of Europe, but Wittfogel alone explained this through his analysis of the semi-peripheral standing of Japan. I agree with him about this. Incidentally, in peripheral Korea, a Chinese-style bureaucracy – including the Imperial Examination and employment of eunuchs as civil servants – was well developed. By contrast, Japan rejected it altogether, despite Japan’s overall reception of Chinese civilization in other areas. Japan was marked fundamentally by warrior (samurai) culture.</p>
<p>Naturally, when the European world-economy came to envelop the world, the former structure of older world-empires, including its peripheries and semi-peripheries, could no longer persist. The older world-empires, along with their peripheries and semi-peripheries, were pushed to the new peripheries of the world-economy. But this did not happen uniformly. The geographical pattern was shaped by the former standing in the older world-empire. For instance, many tribal societies in the periphery of the former world-empires were colonized by European nations. However, former world-empires were not easily colonized. Toward the 20th century the Ottoman Empire, for instance, was segmented into nation states. Meanwhile, Russia and China escaped from such segmentations by way of Marxist revolutions, which placed class over ethnicity. Consequently they formed a ‘new world-empire’ to break away from world-economy. And semi-peripheries such as Japan successfully industrialized to become part of the core. Likewise the two world-systems called world-empire and world-economy are related. Today there are movements to recover the former world-empires, as represented by the European Union. This is not a matter of religion, but of world capitalism.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How does such an analysis of the geographical structure of world history help to critically assess Eurocentrism?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: To answer, let me return to Marx. In the <italic>Grundrisse </italic>he presents several historical ‘forms which precede capitalist production’, including the Asiatic state, classical antiquity, and the German (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2043820612436923">Marx, 1973 [1857]</xref>). This conception came from Hegel and was Eurocentric in a sense. In my view, these forms did not arise in sequential order but existed simultaneously in one space, albeit with different geographical structures. When Marx speaks of ‘Asiatic state’, he tends to have in mind the state at a rudimentary stage. But Asiatic states in reality were advanced in terms of their standing army and bureaucracy. Asiatic states built world-empires. They were in no way archaic. Seen from the view of mode of exchange, the state is already in its complete form in Asiatic state. For example, it was in modern absolute monarchy that the standing army and bureaucracy were realized in Europe.</p>
<p>Then, why did Greece and Rome not become Asiatic states? It was not because they were more advanced, but because they were relatively backward and maintaining the principle of reciprocity of the tribal society. Marx pointed this out. But the same can be said about European or Japanese feudalism. Feudalism is characterized not by the lord-serf relationship, but by reciprocity among the rulers. This does not allow despotic centralization. Seen from the center of civilization, this is a primitive state. The same is true about the ‘world-economy’. The market developed in Greece or Germany, located in the semi-periphery, where there was no state control of economy.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: You have described the current emerging state form under the rubric of ‘regionalism’. Could you elaborate upon what you see as this regional state form today? Are you thinking of regional economic alliances, such as ASEAN or NAFTA? If so, it seems to me that these are merely new combinations of forms of imperial and welfare states that do not alter the underlying dynamic of capital-nation-state in any fundamental way. In any event, would you agree that the world’s geography today is defined by multiple conflicting regionalisms – what you call ‘multiple regionalities’ in the NAM statement of principles – and not only conflicting regions?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I agree. Nation states appeared as segmented figures on the ground of the preceding world-empires. Because of this there is antagonism among nation states, but when they are threatened by other areas they form a ‘wide area’ based on their common culture and religion which they inherited from the world-empire. However such ‘regions’ are not something that existed there to begin with. It was formed in the current world capitalism. One regionalism triggers others.</p>
<p>Seen from the viewpoint of capitalism, regionalism is the same as what was called ‘block economy’ before the Second World War. Both were formed by the expansion of imperialist states which enclosed other states. Hannah Arendt stated that when a nation state expands it does not become ‘empire’ but becomes ‘imperialism’ because it does not have the principle of empire. In this sense, contemporary regionalism is closer to ‘empire’ than ‘imperialism’: they share a common religious, cultural background. I take this as something positive, but unlike some European ideologues I do not think regionalism can transcend the modern system. It cannot go beyond capital-nation-state.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> In the NAM principles and also in ‘Beyond Capital-Nation-State’, you offer a quadrant to describe the spatial form of the nation, state, capital, association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2043820612436923">Figure 4</xref>). Perhaps I do not understand the purpose of this table, but I feel that this part of your analysis is too simplistic. For one thing, feudal states and cities are dependent upon and interconnected with agrarian communities, and some cities have existed without capital (or market economy).</p>

</fig>
<p>More importantly, this table raises questions about the geographical nature of our political strategy. As I read it, your argument is that we must transcend the forms of exchange that continually give rise to nation, state, and capital. Yet, we do not wish to eliminate agrarian communities and cities. Thus, in my reading, while there may be some geographical relationship between nation-state-capital and community-feudal state-city, it is not so firm. How then should we conceptualize the relationship between association and geographical justice? Perhaps your concept of ‘existing amidst world intercourse’ is an answer to this question?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: What I want to say is something like this. At any stage a social formation is a combination of multiple modes of exchange. A social formation is determined by the mode of exchange that is dominant. In clan society, reciprocity is dominant. In pre-capitalist state society – whether Asiatic, classical antiquity, or feudal – mode B is dominant. Needless to say mode C is developed there, too. Concretely speaking, large cities developed there. Mode A or autonomous agricultural communities are there as well. A pre-modern social formation is a combination of these. Please do not take cities and agricultural communities here too literally. Because, for instance, cities too have communities and reciprocal exchanges, while there is commodity exchange in agricultural villages. Still, in cities commodity exchange is clearly dominant.</p>
<p>In the transition from pre-capitalist social formations to capitalism, mode of exchange C becomes dominant for the first time. But how is it combined to other modes? They are combined to constitute capital-nation-state, in a Borromean ring-like structure. Here nation is an ‘imagined community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612436923">Anderson, 1983</xref>), or an imaginary recovery of the community based on reciprocity (A). Capital-nation-state is not a creation from nothing, but the transformation of city, agricultural community, and feudal state. For this reason we find both continuity and discontinuity between the former and the latter.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How then do you conceptualize the existence of mode of exchange D in pre-capitalist social formations? And how does this relatively ancient phenomenon relate to the movement toward D today?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: In pre-capitalist social formations, the mode of exchange D appears in the form of universal religion. To put it differently, association takes the form of religion. In a capitalist social formation, D appears as associationism (socialism), which is devoid of religious quality. Still, it is related to the D of pre-capitalist stage.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> I’d like to ask you about the current economic crisis and its geographical qualities. Recently you have discussed the current economic crisis by drawing on Kozo Uno’s analysis of the peculiarity of labor as a commodity:<disp-quote>
<p>Most Marxists suppose that crisis is caused by anarchic overproduction or the ‘contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation.’ Yet, this idea explains the possibility of crisis, but not the cause of its periodic occurrence. As far as I know, only Kozo Uno gave a convincing answer to this mystery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2043820612436923">
5
</xref></sup> He explored the problem of crisis and the business cycle in terms of the population law of capitalism. Labor is a peculiar commodity; it is difficult to increase it immediately in a shortage and difficult to decrease it when it is overstocked. Workers dismissed in a recession comprise the ‘reserve army of labor.’ During periods of prosperity employment increases, wages rise, and the rate of profit drops, but since credit is still good, capital continues to produce according to the appearance of demand. Eventually, credit is ruined and a crisis takes place, suddenly revealing that commodities were being overproduced. Every crisis, therefore, emerges as a credit crisis, but the cause of the periodic crisis in industrial capitalism lies in the peculiarity of the labor commodity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2008b</xref>: 136; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820612436923">2009a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I can accept your argument here about the peculiarity of labor and the periodicity of crisis. Yet how would you relate this to the analysis of the uneven geographical quality of crises? Just as crises have a certain temporality and historical predictability, could we not also say that the geography of capital-nation-state is implicated in the current crisis? For instance, in <italic>Adam Smith in Beijing</italic> Giovanni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612436923">Arrighi (2007</xref>) argues that the current crisis is partly the result of an enormous gap that has emerged since the 1970s between the global capacity to produce and the capacity to consume, and that this is fundamentally linked to the entry to Chinese workers into the global labor market. While for several decades, consumers in the core – especially the USA – were able to maintain increasing consumption (through expanding credit), the day of reckoning has come. Such an explanation seems to me consistent with your own argument, but it has the virtue of also bringing in the geographical dimension. Would you accept this type of analysis for explaining the crisis? Or do you feel that Uno’s theory and its temporal dynamic is essentially all we need to theorize crisis?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Concerning the theory of economic crisis, I was influenced by Kozo Uno long ago. Let me explain it a little. In the third volume of <italic>Capital</italic> Marx examines crisis extensively, yet his argument remains vague. One reason is that this volume was a compilation of Marx’s notes by Engels. The causes of crisis which Marx pointed out can be roughly divided into the excess of commodity and the excess of capital. Simply put, the excess of commodity theory explains crisis by anarchic capitalist production. Orthodox Marxists took this view.</p>
<p>But there are two flaws here. First, the disorder or disequilibrium that is caused by the anarchy of capitalist production is always present, and therefore cannot analytically explain the specific causes of particular periodical or cyclical crises, such as the present one. The second problem is political. The kind of socialism that would emerge based on this interpretation of capitalist crises is that of the state-run planned economy. State socialism of this kind has nothing to do with Marx.</p>
<p>To return to today’s crisis: many say that this crisis was caused by deregulation of finance or neoliberalist globalization. They insist that the crisis could have been avoided by state regulation. But this is logically inverted. Capital and state carried out financial deregulation in order to get out of a chronic depression caused by the lowered rate of profit since the 1970s. It makes no sense to find the cause of crisis in deregulation without asking why the average rate of profit had been lowered since 1970.</p>
<p>Kozo Uno took up the theory of excess of capital, which is to say the lowering of the average profit rate. Uno attempted to explain periodical, cyclical crises by re-examining the peculiarity of labor as a special commodity. As a commodity, labor is unique. It is a commodity which capital cannot produce. It cannot be increased when it is in demand. Nor can it be decreased when it is in surplus. Uno maintained that this is the fundamental cause of crisis and business cycles. For instance, during an economic boom, labor power runs short and the wage rises, which causes the drop of the profit rate, but it remains unnoticed because of the overheated credit. The reality of things surfaces in crisis, where ‘commodity overproduction’ is revealed. Capitalist production falls into overproduction not because it is anarchic production, but because it is based upon ‘excess capital’, in turn caused by the peculiarity of labor commodity.</p>
<p>The idea of ‘excess capital’ is important because this undermines the view that state control is necessary to solve the crisis. It leads instead to the view that abolition of capitalism is only possible with the abolition of labor as a commodity. Marx never thought of nationalization of economy. For him, socialism is made possible with associated production, that is, cooperatives, in which there is no distinction between capital and wage-worker.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Hence the significance of Uno’s theory of crisis.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. But here I would like to add two clarifications. The first concerns the peculiarity of labor as a commodity. What differentiates proletariats from slaves or serfs is not just the fact that they are based on free contract or the mode of exchange C, but that those wage-workers, as a totality, buy back what they produce. By hiring proletariats to make them work and also by making them buy back what they produce, industrial capitalism became an autopoietic system. That is also why commodity economy or the mode of exchange C infiltrates into the foundation of the society at the stage of industrial capitalist economy. The point is that industrial capital can multiply itself through the increase of workers-consumers.</p>
<p>The second point is that capital cannot subsist without accumulation or self-multiplication. Capital signifies the total body of the process, M-C-M’. This formula comes from merchant capitalism – but in the case of industrial capitalism, labor commodity becomes important in the ‘C’ (commodity) part. The accumulation of industrial capital, which is based on labor commodity, is made possible in two principal ways. The first is to boost labor productivity, by way of technical innovation and consequently lowering the relative value of labor power. And the second is to inject cheaper labor power from elsewhere, which inherently introduces new consumers into capitalist society. Geographically, cheap laborers qua new consumers need to be supplied to urban areas from rural areas or the periphery. The capitalist economy requires the ‘outside’ in this sense; the ‘outside’ is found in the whole world. To put this otherwise, without constant innovation or creation of new worker-consumers, the accumulation of capital is impossible and would end.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How does your Uno-inspired analysis help us to interpret the current crisis?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: The current crisis of capitalism surfaced in the 1970s. During the cold war, advanced capitalist nations developed rapidly under the hegemony and protection of the USA which, however, was saturated in the 1970s. This brought about the soaring of wages, saturated consumption, the decline of average profit rate, and an excess of capital. Financial panic was avoided but there was perpetual stagnation. World capitalism sought the way out of this in globalization. For instance, the excess of capital brought about speculation and bubble economies throughout the world. But the stagnation of world capitalism was overcome only by introducing the new proletariat-consumers. Concretely speaking, this was to incorporate the developing area – previously protected by the existence of the socialist bloc – into world capitalism. Creating cheaper labor commodity wage worker-consumers this way, world capitalism respired but along with dramatic expansion of market it is reaching its limit. This is at the foundation of today’s ‘crisis’.</p>
<p>To repeat, capitalism’s limits are inscribed in the necessary conditions which make capital’s accumulation possible. The first is the limitation of technological innovation. For instance, Adam Smith foresaw that his contemporary economic growth was a temporary phenomenon and capitalist economy would eventually be stationary. He did not think that technological innovation would continue. This expectation was not fulfilled. World capitalism kept expanding by perpetual technological innovation. As an example, it kept developing from cotton industry to heavy industry and then to durable goods. These phases divide historical stages of industrial capitalism. Today this has nearly reached its peak.</p>
<p>The second condition, namely gaining new worker-consumers, has also reached its limit. They no longer really exist due to worldwide de-ruralization. On top of this, the growth of industrial capitalism is premised on a third condition – namely, the inexhaustible nature that makes industrial production possible. Capital treats natural resources as inexhaustible and the natural world as capable of absorbing all the waste resulting from production. Industrial capitalist economy has kept growing until today because ‘nature’ in these senses – nature as human beings (labor power) and nature as environment – were effectively limitless; but at the current stage of industrial capitalism the limits are all too apparent.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright:</italic> How would you position yourself in relation to the history of Japanese Marxism? I do not know this history well, but it is my impression that one of the great strengths of the tradition is its persistent examination of Marx’s critical method and philosophy of value. (I am thinking of such thinkers as Kozo Uno, Tsunao Inomata, Samezō Kuruma, Tadayuki Tsushima, and Hiroshi Uchida.) Although I recognize that your interpretation of Marx is unique (and that Kant and Marx are your main interlocutors), I wonder to what degree this tradition has shaped your problematic?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: In the mid-1990s at an Association for Asian Studies conference in the USA, I gave a talk entitled ‘Japan is interesting because Japan is not interesting’. I wrote this talk after a friend of mine called Masao Miyoshi – a professor of English literature at the University of California, San Diego, who died in 2009 – gave a talk entitled ‘Japan is not interesting’. It was not that I was opposed to Miyoshi’s view. The kind of Japanese traditions which people in the West praised until then were older ones such as tea ceremony, noh-drama, kabuki, and so on. But in the 1980s, with the background of the growing Japanese economy and bubbly prosperities, contemporary Japanese popular culture, such as anime, attracted people’s interest. As a result, people started to say ‘Japan is interesting’. But this kind of attraction withers with the bursting of the bubble. So Miyoshi said ‘Japan is no longer interesting’.</p>
<p>What I said was that this sort of ‘Japan’ is not interesting, but its collapse will reveal another Japanese tradition: the tradition of Marxism, as represented by Uno Kozo’s studies of <italic>Capital</italic>. Around that time, I was writing drafts of texts which later developed into <italic>Transcritique</italic>. I wanted to say that these works were a product of this tradition. But back then there were no English translations of my books and such a claim would have been meaningless. In this sense, I am grateful for your question.</p>
<p>I say ‘Marxist tradition’, but the Marxists whom I have in mind did not openly call themselves Marxists. I myself have never called myself a Marxist in Japan. This was because, until around 1960, orthodox Marxists (particularly Stalinists) were dominant in Japan. Those who opposed this group were not considered to be Marxists. For this reason they tended to refrain from calling themselves ‘Marxist’, despite their deep respect for Marx. Among them was Kozo Uno. I would also include Masao Maruyama or Takaaki Yoshimoto here. They were not known as Marxists in Japan. Maruyama is a scholar of politics, who considered Japanese fascism from a social psychological point of view, by resorting to Weber, Schmidt, and others. Yoshimoto is a literary critic who attempted to elucidate the superstructure with his theory of ‘Common Illusion’. They are renowned as political scientist and literary critic, but nobody sees their significant contributions to Japanese Marxist ideas. In fact, their works are based on their regret that Japanese Marxist movements succumbed to ‘Emperor fascism’ in the 1930s. Oppression was not the cause. They turned to fascism because there were defects in their thinking. One example is that in Germany the philosophers of Frankfurt school began with examining the defeat of Marxist movements to Nazism. They adopted psychoanalysis to supplement this. What Masao Maruyama and Takaaki Yoshimoto did was similar to this. But unlike the Frankfurt school, they are not regarded as Marxists in Japan.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: How would you characterize their position?</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Essentially, they tried to elucidate why the ancient myths of the ‘emperor system’ functioned in the system of highly developed industrial capitalism. And they questioned why Marxist movements stumble on the state and nation. Consequently, they came to emphasize what they characterized as the ‘relative autonomy of superstructure’. Of course, I am critical of their works. But my work is clearly in the line of people like them and based on Japanese historical experiences. By contrast, I owe almost nothing to Russian Marxism or Western Marxism. My interest is in understanding three things simultaneously: capitalist economy, the state, and nation. It is clear where this interest comes from. It comes from Japanese Marxism, or more precisely from the experience of its failure. This is the background to my theory of mode of exchange.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: When I met you at the Rethinking Marxism conference, I asked you how you would reply to Slavoj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2043820612436923">Žižek’s (2006)</xref> critique of your analysis of money and LETS (local exchange trading systems) (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612436923">Karatani, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612436923">2003</xref>). If I remember correctly, you said that the political situation in Japan with NAM, and its endorsement of LETS, had changed dramatically, and therefore his criticism was already outdated. Could you clarify how the situation with NAM has changed? Is NAM still active, and if so, do you remain involved? It seems to me, too, that regardless of the particular experience of NAM, that it would not change your analysis of LETS.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: I disbanded NAM in 2002. Yet what disbanded was NAM as a proper noun, not the new associationist movement, just as the ‘communist party’ Marx describes in <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic> is not a proper name. After the disbandment many associations – which were closely or loosely connected to NAM – stayed active and matured. I am thinking of remobilizing them in the near future.</p>
<p>You asked me what I think of Žižek’s critique of my ideas on LETS, which was part of his review of <italic>Transcritique</italic> in <italic>New Left Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2043820612436923">2004</xref>)
</italic>. I was not surprised by it, because there were many such criticisms in Japan. I am perfectly aware that we cannot simply counter capitalism by LETS. But later I came to learn that there was an episode behind Žižek’s criticism. When I was invited to give a talk in Slovenia in 2006 – Žižek was outside the country at the time – the intellectuals who invited me told me that after reading <italic>Transcritique</italic> they immediately appealed to the government and started LETS. Yet they failed. Then I realized that Žižek’s comment was not just a criticism for the sake of criticism. I felt happy that they actually carried out my ideas.</p>
<p>The designer of LETS, Michael Linton, is an anarchist who attempted to revive the concept behind Proudhon’s Exchange Bank, or People’s Bank. Marxists have the tendency of ignoring what Proudhon attempted to realize. In the case of Proudhon, countering capitalism is conducted mainly in the process of circulation. One of the reasons for this is that capitalist production was not yet fully developed then. Around the same time, trade unions became quite active in England. This led Marx to think that along with development of industrial capitalism, struggles in the process of production would be pivotal. This proved to be true – yet as industrial capitalism deepened, things changed. Workers’ movements regarding the circulation process came to be foregrounded. This is typically called the ‘consumers’ movement’, but it is conducted by workers themselves.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: Hence the necessity of combined worker-consumer counter-movements.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Yes. Looking at workers’ movements in the production process alone, or through workers’ movement alone, lacks an understanding about capitalist economy. Capital’s accumulation process, M-C-M’, is not completed in the process of production alone. It is completed in the process of circulation, when the workers as totality buy back what they have produced. If so, countering capitalism should be carried out not only in the process of production but also in the process of circulation. Consumers are the proletariats placed in the process of circulation. Thus countering capitalism is made possible by movement of worker-consumers.</p>
<p>With the establishment of labor unions, workers become exclusively engaged with economic struggles. Some older Marxists, or wider circle of some new lefts, have thought that the proletariats do not stand up in the process of circulation because they are confined to their ‘reified’ consciousness, so they need to be awakened and revolutionalized. But in many cases, it stands to reason that workers share interests with capital in their production process, because if a company collapses the workers are in trouble as well.</p>
<p>As the struggles in the production process did not go well, the new left in developed capitalist nations turned to various civic movements of gender, minority, environment, and so on. And they end up as social democrats, who seek the way of reform by grasping state power by winning elections. This is not particularly threatening to capitalism. It is after all just a part of capital-nation-state. And we see no vision to go beyond this. This happened because Marxists have been dwelling almost exclusively on the idea of workers’ struggle at the point of production.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wainwright</italic>: So to counter capitalist accumulation we must transform the entire process of circulation.</p>
<p>
<italic>Karatani</italic>: Not only this. We need to create production-exchange relations which are not connected to capital and wage-labor, such as cooperatives and a local currency/credit system. We should respect that Proudhon was the thinker who first recognized this. Needless to say, as Marx warned, it will not be possible to simply go beyond capitalism by these means. They are destined to lose if they compete with capitalist corporations.</p>
<p>The experiences of non-capitalist market economy systems, which reject labor as a commodity, are valuable no matter how small they might be in scale. I have said that capitalist accumulation will become impossible and the capitalist economy will come to a standstill. But this will not bring the end of human economy or human livelihood. If the capitalist economy collapses, we will be able to survive with the current production force. For that purpose we need to create a non-capitalist system. But you cannot realize it all of a sudden. We need to make a preliminary rehearsal. For even when accumulation of capital becomes impossible, capitalism will not end naturally. The state and capital will resort to any means to survive. To counter this, we need the strength to counter the state and capital and we need to prepare a system where we need not rely on the state and capital.</p>
