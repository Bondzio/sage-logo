<p>Welcome to Volume 35, Issue 1, of <italic>Career Development <bold>and Transition</bold> for Exceptional Individuals</italic>, the official journal of the Division on Career Development and Transition (DCDT) of the Council for Exceptional Children. We hope that 2012 has been a good to you so far and that the content of this issue will make things even better. We also hope that you noticed the new name. While it may seem minor, we as Co-editors, as well as the DCDT Board and the Publications Committee, believe that adding the term “Transition” to the title will clarify the purpose of the journal and tie it more closely to the Division. We would like to thank the current and past DCDT Board members who helped with the change, as well as The Hammill Institute for their assistance with the process. Finally, while the name has changed, the content will continue to reflect the best our field has to offer.</p>
<p>In this issue, you will find five articles that remind us not only of the breadth of topics in the area of secondary transition but also of one of the primary outcomes of our field, preparing youth with disabilities for successful careers. In the first article, Repetto and her colleagues remind us of the importance of considering the health care needs of students in the transition planning process, as well as providing a model that can be used to coordinate health care transitions. In the second article, Washington, Hughes, and Cosgriff provide findings from their study comparing the involvement in educational planning and use of self-determination strategies by students with severe intellectual disabilities and general education seniors attending a high-poverty high school.</p>
<p>The final three articles in this issue focus attention on preparing youth for employment. First, Ju, Zhang, and Pacha provide findings from their survey of employer expectations. Their results will be of interest to anyone involved in helping students with disabilities start careers. Second, Pickney, Murray, and Lind report results from their examination of the relationship between individual student skills, and the school and perceived career-related adjustment of students with disabilities. The results of this study provide additional evidence for predictors of postschool success. Third, Trainor, Carter, Swedeen, and Pickett examine the use of “community conversations” as a way to build capacity and interest in providing employment opportunities for youth with disabilities. Their findings and recommendations will be of interest to job developers everywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, as we start another year as coeditors of CDTEI, we continue to be impressed by the quality of research and depth of commitment of our colleagues in secondary transition. In addition, we are always appreciative of the time and effort our consulting editors take in reviewing manuscripts. We could not do this without you. Thank you and enjoy this issue.</p>
