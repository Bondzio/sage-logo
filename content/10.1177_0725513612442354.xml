<p>The riots stimulated widespread interpretation. This is understandable, given the fear that they symptomatized a deeper malaise in England, and even throughout the West. The sociological tradition warns, on one front, that the modernizing process presses relentlessly towards atomization, weakening community ties, and leaving individuals poorly integrated into any wider society, and with little attachment to any higher ideals. It warns, on a second front, that Western modernity has profoundly disenchanted the world, reducing individual life to a half-hearted and egocentric pursuit of profane pleasures – life caricatured as consumerism.</p>
<p>The pessimistic implication within the sociological reading of modernity is that there may come a tipping point, resulting in some kind of irreversible social breakdown. Thus the English riots may be a harbinger of more pervasive disintegration. I think Keith Tester’s reading of ‘August in England’ belongs here, interpreting the ‘events’ as a symptom of an interregnum, between an old England – a world that has been lost – and something waiting to be born. The suggestion is that what is to come is some kind of J.G. Ballard nihilistic dystopia.</p>
<p>I offer two observations here as an outsider who has visited England regularly over the decades since the late 1960s. I don’t share the pessimistic reading, at least as far as the West at large is concerned. While there is great interpretive force and cogency to both lines of sociological interpretation, put at their most extreme they underestimate the antibodies at work within the social organism as a whole. The West has long-proven resilience, and a capacity for innovation in the face of crisis – and at each of the economic, social, political, and cultural levels. To give one example, the capitalist economy for nigh on two centuries has always managed to recover from bouts of recessionary malfunction, its progress marked by cycles of government over-regulation and under-regulation.</p>
<p>My first comment is that riots as spontaneous and widespread as those in England signal a problem of social legitimacy. Keith Tester describes a breakdown of the ‘social imaginary’. A central task for every culture is to bring up new generations that identify with the social world into which they have been born, feeling at home in it, with some sense of belonging, sharing its habits, customs, and ideals. This is ‘education’ in the grand sense.</p>
<p>The critical period is between roughly the ages of 15 and 25 – what we might call the youth phase of the life-stages. This happens to be the phase in which girls, and especially boys, are least likely to feel any wider social attachment or responsibility, whatever their upbringing. That is normal. And the wider society, if it is sensible, will generally hold a loose rein, tolerating bursts of excess – ‘sowing wild oats’, ‘letting the hair down’ – knowing that most young people grow out of their wayward years. But there are limits.</p>
<p>The two institutions that are overwhelmingly responsible for education in the grand sense are the family and the school. A number of commentators on the riots asked where the parents were as, late at night, teenagers looted and vandalized shops. Looting, vandalizing, and arson is not shop-lifting – that is, petty crime; it is not a petty testing of limits. It signals a grave breakdown of the sense of boundaries over which it should be unthinkable to transgress. In this case, the response from above needs to be stern and inflexible – authority has to be restored and, with it, a sense that there are laws that the wider society will defend.</p>
<p>The major social role that most senior government schools in the West play today is the teaching of self-discipline – termed ‘behaviour management’. Schools socialize teenagers, turning potential hotbeds of vagrant, uncontrolled instinct into calm and balanced law-abiding adults. This requires a slow, painstaking, relentless, and usually thankless slog from teachers. For them, it is a struggle for survival; for the wider society, it is a struggle for the future.</p>
<p>High school teachers discover that out-of-control 15-year-olds, waging tantrum wars against the authority of the classroom, need strict rules and enforced discipline, including punishment, both to settle them down and to maintain order. Tolerance and compassion are not options – they merely indicate to the student that the teacher is weak, and the school does not care.</p>
<p>Thousands of Australian teachers regularly spend time teaching in English schools. For a couple of decades now I have heard reports of them being shocked at the brazen incivility, the shameless rudeness of English teenagers – and not just in London’s tough areas. Now, the average Australian high school is no paradise of decorum, far from it. The reported shock is not that there are odd individuals who are virtually unteachable, nor that classes as a whole were up to a slightly more aggressive version of normal teenage testing of boundaries. It was rather that numbers of 14- to 18-year-olds were sociopathic – that is, coldly, unblinkingly, and callously insensitive to other people, and especially to those in positions of authority, like teachers. The tones of disrespect were harder and colder; the temperature of rebellion was higher.</p>
<p>This is a question of degree, like the riots themselves. If there had been a single riot in 2011 then, as time passed, it might plausibly have been discounted as an aberration – in Sydney in 2005 there were one-off riots at the beach suburb of Cronulla. The fact that, in England, a plague of copycat looting and vandalizing followed in major cities across the country changes the narrative, and with it plausible lines of interpretation. If there is truth to what the Australian teachers report, the implication is that, in parts of English suburbs and towns today, the society – which means essentially families and schools – has given up.</p>
<p>My second observation about the English riots is that they reflect a more widespread mentality that has developed in Britain and parts of Europe. It might be termed the ‘spoilt brat mentality’. Greece is the cautionary tale. There, a malign symbiosis of government and people has plunged the nation into irrecoverable bankruptcy. At the core is an absence of a sense of collective or individual responsibility. Greek governments of all persuasions have borrowed funds cavalierly to fund large deficits, as if there is no such thing as a balance sheet, or the necessary repayment of debt – like a spoilt child for whom parents will satisfy every wish, however outlandish. The European banks, which have funded much of this debt, via Greek bonds, bear some parental responsibility here – at least they are going to suffer from their own profligacy, by losing billions of their shareholders’ Euros.</p>
<p>The Greek people have responded with their own brand of dependency – on government, for jobs and welfare. It is reported that 75 per cent of the population lives off the public purse. The remaining 25 per cent, who belong to the private sector and generate the national wealth, pay minimal tax, with the bribing of tax officials accepted as standard practice. Here is another reflection of the low Greek sense of social responsibility – indeed, the weak sense of ‘citizenship’.</p>
<p>I could go on. Today, Athens and Heraclion (the capital of Crete) are run-down, typified by decaying concrete buildings and municipal squalor. The visitor leaves with the impression that the citizens take no pride in their cities. The all-pervading attitude seems to be that the public world I inhabit is not my affair, it’s the government’s responsibility; it is the government’s fault if things fall apart. Workers striking in Athens against inevitable government cuts never seem to question who is going to pay their salaries, given that the public purse is, in effect, empty, and one day soon the Germans will turn off the charity tap. The lack of a sense of reality on display here is suggestive of civic childishness.</p>
<p>Britain is dividing into two parts. The southeast of England, centred on London, is where most of the productive industry and economic dynamism has become concentrated. The southeast drives the country. Meanwhile, much of the rest, and especially the north, is becoming increasingly dependent on government, with the accompanying risk of the shift into the Greek mentality. Complaint becomes a way of life; passive-aggressive whingeing against government in London becomes reflex.</p>
<p>Welfare is corrosive of the self-respect of the individuals who become dependent on it, as it is of the civic habit of mind that funds it, assuming that if there is a social problem then just throw money at it and it will go away. It has affinities with the attitude in government that builds up nationally-dangerous levels of sovereign debt with, at most perhaps, the passing thought that some future government, or future generation, can deal with the consequences. In the British case, the debt is at least recent, a gift of Tony Blair’s ‘third way’, and of his successor’s attempts to soften the impact of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>Currently in Australia, sections of Aboriginal leadership want to end welfare dependency, stopping what they call ‘sit-down money’. They have realized that living off public money, without obligation in return – being paid simply to sit down – breeds a vicious cycle of low self-esteem, hopelessness, and depression, and feeds addiction to alcohol and other substances, contributing to communal violence, poor health, and the generalized condition of demoralization termed by sociologists ‘anomie’.</p>
<p>The development of the Welfare State after the Second World War is one of the achievements of the modern West. Across the developed world it now provides an economic safety net for the disadvantaged – an unambiguous public good. The Welfare State has, however, brought with it a mentality of dependency, which will prove extraordinarily difficult to overcome. In Greece, it will be remedied by necessity: national bankruptcy leading to a much lower standard of living with, very likely, sections of the population being forced to return to small farming. Britain, and with it much of southern Europe, may face a minor version of the same necessity.</p>
<p>The ‘sit-down money’ example takes me back to sociological first principles. Anomie is caused by cultural decay; welfare dependency follows on as one of a range of potential symptoms. The pathologies that develop from sit-down money have as their primary cause the disintegration of Aboriginal culture – in particular, the erosion of the authority of the elders, making it impossible for the custodians of the culture to carry out their most important traditional role, the transmission to new generations of the ancient tribal stories that interpreted the world, and made sense of it. Welfare dependency, and with it what I have termed the ‘spoilt-brat mentality’, results from disenchantment of the old beliefs. No one is retelling the foundation stories of the culture. The inevitable result is a crisis of meaning.</p>
<p>This is, in effect, the perspective taken by those lamenting the loss of Old England, fearing what new monster may be about to be born in its place. The most eloquent and poignant of those laments with which I am familiar, Roger Scruton’s book <italic>England: An Elegy</italic>, published in 2000, is itself hopelessly bleak. It reads as a loving post mortem written by someone who has given up.</p>
<p>Where do modern individuals who inhabit secular societies like Britain and Australia find their sense of meaning in life? Generally, they do so in their everyday world – at work, in their families, with friends, playing and watching sport, and at leisure in nature. Other additives that may contribute to the communal glue that helps bind individuals to place and time include some mild patriotism; attachment to the local; and the comfort and familiarity of shared ways of speech and doing things. Stories from popular culture – television, radio, and other media – provide forms through which these contemporary individuals may interpret their lives, and give them value.</p>
<p>How fragile is all of this? We simply don’t know – hence the wider anxieties aroused by the English riots. And, when such a patchwork and improvised culture does break down, or fails to gel, restoration is unlikely to come, for most, from some grand overarching framework of belief, Christian or other. The Methodist solution is no more. Consequently, the social ills discussed in this essay will be forbiddingly difficult to remedy.</p>
