<abstract>
<p>In the field of citizen media research, considerably less attention has been paid to countries other than the US and those in Western Europe. This article is a case study that focuses on citizen media in Beijing – specifically, the Dazhalan Project. Combining in-depth interviews and textual analysis, the article demonstrates the uniqueness of citizen media under China’s state-party media system. The article also suggests that it was the collaboration among ordinary citizens, professionals and journalists that made it possible for citizen media to influence the mainstream media frame-building process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2004, the Chinese government proposed its strategic objective of social development to establish a ‘Harmonious Society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742766512444341"><italic>People’s Daily</italic>, 2004</xref>), a conceptual framework that changed China’s focus from economic growth to overall societal balance. ‘Interest expression’ (<italic>Li Yi Biao Da</italic>)’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742766512444341">Li, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742766512444341">Yao, 2010</xref>) was widely indicated as a keystone in achieving this objective. Critics advocated accommodating more ordinary citizens’ voices in the public sphere, thus contributing to social justice and harmony.</p>
<p>With the advancement of new information technology, the development of citizen media suggests one way to boost interest expression among the people of a country. Despite its significance to society, citizen media is rarely discussed in mainland China, though it has been practiced and studied for years in Western countries.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the scarcity of research on China’s citizen media is its complicated relations with the unique party<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512444341">1</xref></sup>-state media system, under which it exists. Although the media reform in 1992 liberated the press from the state to some extent, the licensing system<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1742766512444341">2</xref></sup> still ensures the party’s control of the fundamental press structure. The ‘regulated marketization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742766512444341">Zhao, 2000</xref>), the term used to describe the reform, still restricts individuals from owning media businesses. As a result, the operation and distribution of citizen media is greatly limited by China’s media policy.</p>
<p>To investigate the characteristics of citizen media in China and its influence on mainstream media, the author conducted an exploratory case study on a citizen media project in Beijing, called the Dazhalan Project. The reasons for selecting the Dazhalan Project from among other citizen media projects for this study are various. Firstly, it focuses on a case of demolition and relocation (in the Dazhalan neighborhood) – an issue that is considered to be one of the most significant social justice issues that China faces currently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512444341"><italic>Blue Book of China’s Society</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444341">2007</xref>). By exploring a citizen media project dealing with such a significant social issue, the study is able to investigate the most dynamic interactions among the government, mass media and public as well as other external forces that may influence the practice of the citizen media project. Secondly, the Dazhalan neighborhood was demolished and gentrified mainly because of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The Olympics created unprecedented social change in one of the world’s most rigid systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512444341">Cha, 2008</xref>). As such, the research on the Dazhalan Project could also contribute to the observation of the dramatic social change in terms of communication during this period. In addition, the project represents a type of artist-led citizen media emerging in modern China. Ou Ning, the project’s main organizer, is a well-known Chinese artist who has launched a number of independent exhibitions, film projects and magazines, which successfully introduced diverse and alternative citizen voices to mainstream society. The Dazhalan Project is one of a series of projects that Ou Ning and his team conducted to report the gentrification issues happening in urban China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Compared with other types of citizen media, artist-led citizen media projects could arguably attract more public attention due to such factors as professional organizing and artistic influence. In this case study, the Dazhalan Project has won extensive media coverage both in China and abroad. Therefore, the study could draw upon the experiences from its practice and thus suggest a model for other citizen media practitioners.</p>
<p>Combining in-depth interviews with the project practitioners and textual analysis of the mainstream media coverage of the project, this study aims to speculate and theorize the ways in which citizen media serves as a public arena for ‘interest expression’ in China.</p>

<title>Background: Urbanization, gentrification and the Dazhalan Project</title>
<p>Issues of gentrification have been widely discussed in the US and Western Europe during the process of urban renewal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742766512444341">Jacobs, 1992</xref>). In China, which is witnessing rapid urbanization and industrialization, the gentrification issue epitomizes a variety of social injustices – property and labor rights violations, corruption, governmental maladministration, business misdemeanors and environmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512444341"><italic>Blue Book of China’s Society</italic>, 2005</xref>). Debates about development versus preservation, modernization versus tradition, and governmental decrees versus individual rights are endless.</p>
<p>The case of gentrification and its related social justice problems are compounded by the failure of the mainstream media to act as a ‘watchdog’ checking on wrongdoings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512444341"><italic>Blue Book of China’s Society</italic>, 2005</xref>). In China, mass media either remained silent on such issues or covered the topics in the interests of the government until the Chongqing ‘nail house’ case occurred in 2007, when a woman in Chongqing refused to be relocated. The term, ‘nail house’ (<italic>Ding Zi Hu</italic>), refers to people who refuse to be relocated and are like nails that are stuck in the ground and cannot be pounded down with a hammer. A picture of the ‘nail house’ was taken and widely circulated on the Internet. The picture vividly captured the home as an isolated island in a sea of demolished buildings. The ‘nail house’ story, along with its famous picture, was covered by a great number of major newspapers throughout China and abroad (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512444341">French, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Since then, more reports of demolition and relocation favoring individual rights have appeared in the mass media. A group of experts, activists and ordinary citizens participated in the discussions and even established their own citizen media to report the stories. One such occurrence is the Dazhalan Project (大栅栏计划), a citizen media project that addresses the issue of demolition and relocation in urban Beijing.</p>
<p>In order to erect modern buildings for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a number of old neighborhoods in the city were demolished and its former residents, forcibly relocated. Among these neighborhoods was Dazhalan, an area of historic significance going back to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The construction converting the neighborhood into a modern commercial zone started in 2004 and continued until July 2008. Due to the area’s close proximity to Tiananmen Square<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1742766512444341">3</xref></sup> and its historic value, the demolition and relocation of the area attracted worldwide attention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1742766512444341">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the introduction on the official website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dazhalan-project.org">www.dazhalan-project.org</ext-link>), the Dazhalan Project is ‘about researching and filming the area of Dazhalan’. Organized by two well-known Chinese artists, Ou Ning and Cao Fei, the project adopted a ‘collective working system’ with more than 10 volunteers and several former Dazhalan residents. The project produced a documentary film, a website and a distribution brochure, telling the stories of former Dazhalan residents during the demolition and relocation process.</p>
<sec id="section3-1742766512444341">
<title>Citizen media and alternative media</title>
<p>Although citizen media is frequently discussed in American and Western European literature, its definition remains vague. Nevertheless, there are two main streams of research that theorize and constitute the conceptualization of citizen media.</p>
<p>One stream is from the tradition of alternative or radical media best articulated by Downing as ‘media, generally small-scale and in many different forms, that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, priorities, and perspectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512444341">Downing, 1984</xref>: v). Carrying this tradition forward, Rodriguez refined the term ‘alternative media’ to ‘citizen’s media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742766512444341">Rodriguez, 2001</xref>). A number of empirical studies were conducted on community radio, magazines and other citizen media practices in countries such as the US, the UK and Canada, as well as in Latin America (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444341">Benson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512444341">Brecht, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742766512444341">Rodriguez, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742766512444341">Stein, 2001</xref>). The Dazhalan Project is a participatory video project, which involves a group or community marginalized by economic and political structures.</p>
<p>The focus of this stream of research is on the process in which ordinary citizens are empowered by using their own media to produce media materials. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512444341">Atton (2007</xref>) indicates that the emphasis is more on self-education and community building than on reaching out to audiences. In other words, previous studies in this field failed to consider how citizen media seek their audiences. Since mainstream media coverage is one of the best ways to reach the wider public, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512444341">Atton (2007</xref>: 24) suggested that citizen media studies should not be ‘separate from their dominant counterparts (mainstream media)’.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another stream of citizen media studies addresses closer links with mainstream media. Since the early 1990s, new media technology, especially the Internet, has created an interactive media environment in which ordinary citizens play ‘an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating news and information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444341">Bowman and Willis, 2003</xref>: 10). The new media, in the form of websites, blogs and podcasts, allows the media exchange to become a ‘conversation or seminar’, rather than a ‘lecture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512444341">Gillmor, 2004</xref>). Researchers from this tradition pay more attention to the symbiotic relationship between citizen media and mainstream commercialized media. They point towards an ‘emerging media ecosystem’ to which anyone can contribute content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444341">Bowman and Willis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742766512444341">Oh, 2004</xref>). From this perspective, citizen media is not necessarily independent of mainstream media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742766512444341">Nip, 2006</xref>). Problematically, its operation could still take place ‘within the walls of mainstream and distinctly commercial media organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512444341">Dueze, 2006</xref>: 272; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742766512444341">Sambrook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742766512444341">Tilley and Cokley, 2008</xref>). Another problem with the ‘ecosystem’ is that it is still inaccessible to many people due to lack of economic resources and technological illiteracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742766512444341">Warschauer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some recent studies in which the two streams converge. A frequently discussed case is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Indymedia.org">Indymedia.org</ext-link>, the site of the Independent Media Center, and its interplay with mainstream media during the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444341">Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512444341">Kidd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742766512444341">Owens and Palmer, 2003</xref>). According to these studies, scholars indicated that the Internet overcame the distribution problems in the old alternative media, while creating new problems like the digital divide.</p>
<p>The current study aims to cover discussions related to both streams. In addition, the case study of the Dazhalan Project in China is imbued with new dimensions because of its special context, which will be examined in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1742766512444341">
<title>China context: Government, commercialization and citizen media</title>
<p>China’s news media system is regarded by many as an evolving and transitional media system in which governmental control coexists with ever-increasing commercial incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512444341">Huang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742766512444341">Pan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742766512444341">Winfield and Peng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742766512444341">Zhao, 1998</xref>). The mass media served as a mouthpiece for the central government until 1992 when the State Press and Publications Administration (SPPA) announced that all major newspapers, apart from a few central party organs such as the <italic>People’s Daily</italic>, were to achieve financial independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742766512444341">Zhao, 2000</xref>). Even though the reform provided an opportunity for alternative discourses, the party’s licensing system allows the ‘regime to keep journalists in line’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742766512444341">Pan and Lu, 2003</xref>: 223). On the other hand, commercialization has brought about the institutionalization of new control mechanisms in the form of advertising pressures; its introduction forces journalists to operate by the laws of the consumer market, rather than that of professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742766512444341">Pan and Lu, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Under ‘regulated marketization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742766512444341">Zhao, 2000</xref>), or ‘Party Publicity Inc’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742766512444341">He, 2000</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742766512444341">Winfield and Peng (2005)</xref> suggest a typology that classifies Chinese media organizations into three types: official mainstream media, outer circles and fringe media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1742766512444341">5</xref></sup> Within the latter two, there exist journalists who hit the ‘edge ball’ to cover sensitive societal topics, while still remaining within the official ideological parameters by choosing rhetoric tactically in their reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742766512444341">Pan and Lu, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1742766512444341">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this background, and with the aid of new media technology, citizen media provides an alternative public sphere to the party-state media system. One of the most important and popular types of citizen media in China is Internet-based media. Zhou Shuguang, a young blogger as well as the widely-acclaimed first citizen journalist in China, investigated the aforementioned ‘nail house’ issue and reported it on his personal blog (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742766512444341">Zhou, 2007</xref>). Since then, citizen journalism has begun to flourish on the Internet via online community forums, portals and blog service sites (some featuring video and audio files or digital photographs), as well as more traditional sites associated with mainstream news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742766512444341">Nip, 2009</xref>). Moreover, some new forms of speech such as <italic>E Gao</italic> (an online spoof) recently emerged on the Chinese Internet to further contribute to political expression among ordinary citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742766512444341">Meng, 2011</xref>). As many scholars found out, citizen journalism has a positive impact on the exposure of social injustices and facilitates public discussion of a number of important social issues, such as the ‘nail house’ issue, the Wenchuan earthquake and the San Lu ‘milk scandal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>). Moreover, Internet-based citizen media in China is bringing about a revolution in that millions of ordinary citizen journalists are being empowered in a thousand tiny, everyday ways through online communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742766512444341">Thompson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the web-based citizen journalism discussed in the existing studies works independently without affiliation to any identifiable entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742766512444341">Nip, 2009</xref>). In fact, as civil society began to grow in China during the early 1990s, many civil associations sprang up to provide services and alternative publications that served marginalized groups such as migrant workers and people living with HIV and AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742766512444341">Howell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742766512444341">Yang, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, collective and organized citizen media are rarely studied in the current literature, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444341">Cao’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444341">2009)</xref> study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444341">Cao (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444341">2009)</xref> conducted an empirical case study on a magazine and its website version run by a doctor and a group of homosexual volunteers. The magazine, as a registered hospital publication, claims its goal is to advocate scientific knowledge on how to prevent and control HIV and AIDS. In fact, the publication serves as a communication forum in which homosexual readers share their stories by contributing to the magazine or website. Nevertheless, citizen media – whether on the Internet or not – is subject to government regulation and censorship. Since the issue of homosexuality remains a sensitive topic in public, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444341">Cao (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444341">2009)</xref> suggested that it was strategic for the citizen media under her analysis to claim its goal to be preventing HIV and AIDS in order to circumvent government censorship.</p>
<p>With regard to the interplay between citizen media and mainstream media, scholars agree that the content generated in citizen media has become an important source of news for professional media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742766512444341">Nip, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>). And in most circumstances, citizen media is unable to function alone; it needs the support of mainstream media to carry out investigations and make the public aware of the issues it throws up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>). Moreover, citizen journalism can be an effective check on mainstream journalistic practices and thus assist mainstream media to perform better the fourth estate role that liberal theories expect from the news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742766512444341">Reese and Dai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of citizen media’s unique significance, its discussions in the context of China are still rare and in the experimental phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742766512444341">Xu, 2007</xref>). Empirical studies on collective, organized citizen media projects are especially rare in the existing literature. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512444341">Atton (2007</xref>: 23) contended, there is ‘a bias towards political projects in the USA and Western Europe’ and, therefore, more citizen media studies should be done in non-Western countries. The current study aims to fill this academic gap.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework: Media framing</title>
<p>In order to understand citizen media’s unique perspective on the issue of demolition and relocation in China, and to see the extent to which it influenced the party-state media system, framing theory was utilized to examine how the project framed the issue and how it influenced the mainstream media’s framing process.</p>
<p>Frame is a ‘schematic of interpretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512444341">Goffman, 1974</xref>) – ‘a central organizing idea for news content that supplies a context and suggests what the issue is through the use of selection, emphasis, exclusion, and elaboration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742766512444341">Tankard et al., 1991</xref>: 3). Recent studies on media framing focus more on framing as a process, rather than merely examining a list of frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444341">Carragee and Roefs, 2004</xref>). ‘[T]o frame’ is ‘to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512444341">Entman, 1993</xref>: 55). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742766512444341">Scheufele (1999)</xref> took a further step to conceptualize four specific framing processes: frame building; frame setting; individual-level framing processes; and feedback from individual-level framing to media framing. The study here explores the frame-building process of citizen media and how it affects the frame-building of the issue by mainstream media journalists.</p>
<p>Specifically, the sociological origin of framing theory determines that framing in media texts is greatly concerned with socio-cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742766512444341">Reese, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444341">Carragee and Roefs (2004)</xref> argue that media framing is, to a large extent, related to the broader issues of cultural and social powers. Any frame that contradicts the foundational principles of hegemony within a nation is therefore unlikely to be echoed in the corporate media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512444341">Cunningham and Toft, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>This study’s purpose is to explore the Dazhalan Project as a type of citizen media practice in the context of mainland China, and to investigate how it influenced the mainstream media. Specifically, the research questions address the goal and characteristics of the project in its role as citizen media. Additionally, the study analyzes how the project framed the issue of demolition and relocation in urban China and compares it with the mainstream media coverage of the issue, to determine to what extent, if any, the frames developed by the project influenced the latter’s frame-building process. Finally, the study seeks a model for future citizen media to influence the mainstream media by drawing insights from the project.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The current research is based on a case study of a citizen media project in China – the Dazhalan Project. Using a qualitative approach, this study aims to examine the dynamics and depth of a unique case, rather than to generalize the characteristics of citizen media in China. Specifically, the study combines: (1) in-depth interviews with the key Dazhalan Project participants, as well as textual analysis of (2) the materials the project produced and (3) all the mainstream media stories on the project.</p>
<p>Firstly, in-depth interviews were conducted to discover the goals and characteristics of the project. The author interviewed Ou Ning, the project organizer; Sun Xiaoxi, Tan Tan, and Huang Liguang, all volunteers; and Zhang Jinli, a former Dazhalan resident. These five interviewees were selected because they were the main participants in the project. Ou Ning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1742766512444341">7</xref></sup> was the leader of the project. He is a professional film editor and curator. Sun Xiaoxi, Tan Tan, and Huang Liguang were the three most committed volunteers of the more than 10 recruited in the project. They were a journalist, a university student, and a designer and a video maker. Zhang Jinli is one of the former Dazhalan residents. He filmed 80 percent of the footage used in the film, <italic>Meishi Street</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1742766512444341">8</xref></sup> the main product of the project. All interviews were conducted by telephone and ranged in length from 30 to 120 minutes. Two interviews were noted down in shorthand, the others were taped with the participants’ permission and then transcribed verbatim. The author used open-ended questions and appropriate probes during the in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>To understand the goal of the project, the organizer, Ou Ning, was asked the following questions: (1) Why did you initiate the project? (2) What specific outcomes did you expect to achieve from the project? To determine the characteristics of the project as citizen media, all six participants were asked: (1) What did you do in this project? (2) How do you view the project? (3)What did you learn from the project?</p>
<p>Secondly, the question of how the project framed the issue of demolition and relocation in China was answered by a textual analysis of the materials produced by the project. A qualitative textual analysis of framing was selected because there is limited literature on this topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512444341">Hertog and McLeod (2001</xref>: 154) argue that the qualitative study of frames is in some ways inevitable since ‘human judgment is necessary to approach the essential question about what could have been in the content but was not’. On the other hand, they and quite a few other scholars assert that qualitative framing analysis presents the possibility of ‘idiosyncratic analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512444341">Hertog and McLeod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742766512444341">Tankard, 2001</xref>). To avoid the researcher’s subjective beliefs in interpretation as much as possible, the author interviewed the project participants about their intended frames to help determine critical concepts, relations and metaphors in the framing analysis.</p>
<p>Drawing upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444341">Gamson and Modigliani’s (1989)</xref> ‘media package’ approach, five framing devices were used to develop a matrix to help ensure consistency in analysis: metaphor, exemplars, catchphrases, depictions and icons. This analysis also referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444341">Altheide’s (1996)</xref> work on framing to distinguish frame and theme. Themes are ‘the recurring typical theses that run through a lot of the reports’, which are descriptive; frames are ‘the focus, a parameter or boundary, for discussing a particular event’, which are persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444341">Altheide, 1996</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>As a data-driven analysis, the first step was to repeatedly read/watch all the media products to increase familiarity. The analysis matrix was used to identify possible themes and frames prior to the in-depth interviews. Secondly, transcripts of in-depth interviews were compared with the tentatively developed frames. Finally, the researcher returned to the data to confirm the findings.</p>
<p>The materials analyzed include: (1) an 85-minute documentary film, <italic>Meishi Street</italic>; (2) the project’s website; (3) a distribution brochure, <italic>The Story of Zhang Jinli</italic>; and (4) articles about the project published on Ou Ning’s blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alternativearchive.com/ouning">www.alternativearchive.com/ouning</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In order to investigate the project participants’ intended frames, the interviewees were asked: (1) What were your opinions about the issue? (2) How did you express your opinions in the project?</p>
<p>In addition, to determine the extent to which the project influenced the frames used by the mainstream media, another textual analysis was conducted on mainstream media coverage of the project. The mainstream news reports on the project were collected from its official website, where the ‘Press’ section tracks the news. The author also used the search engines, Google and Baidu, the latter being the largest search engine in China, to search for mainstream media reports neglected by the website. Only articles published in the print media were included. A total of 30 reports in mainland China’s print media were identified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1742766512444341">9</xref></sup> The participants were also asked their opinions on the mainstream media coverage of their project.</p>
<p>Finally, the participants were asked about their understanding of citizen media and what they believed to be the favorable model for citizen media to influence mainstream media frame building in China.</p>

<title>The goal of the project</title>
<p>One individual’s story inspired Ou Ning to initiate the project. According to Ou, SPPA regulations made it difficult for the mainstream media to write about the controversial issues involved in the demolition and relocation process due to the government’s involvement. However, unprecedentedly, Chongqing’s ‘nail house’ story broke through the tacit government regulations and worked its way into the mainstream media (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). In the story, the woman who refused to be relocated bravely faced the government on her own. Ou said that the Chongqing case was very rare and the woman could be regarded as a ‘lonely fighter’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). The majority of people kept silent due to the blockage of public channels for interest expression. Therefore, Ou thought of establishing a media outlet where ordinary citizens could freely engage in discussion about the demolition and relocation issue.</p>
<p>Ou selected Dazhalan because it was the area with the largest scale of demolition and relocation, and the most serious conflict of interests. Ou considered most of the China-based news reports that covered Dazhalan’s transformation to be a ‘mouthpiece’ for the government. These reports depicted the demolition and relocation in the area as a necessary process to make the 2008 Beijing Olympics a huge success. In certain cases, the media included the voices of expert architects, advocating for the preservation of the area (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). Although these experts offered varying opinions, including the dominant voice of the government, Ou criticized them for being elitist and concerning themselves more with the historic value of the neighborhood than its actual residents. He said, ‘[N]o one cares about what those residents say about the issue’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). Thus, Ou launched the Dazhalan Project to allow ordinary citizens to express their interests from grassroots perspectives.</p>
<p>In addition to showcasing the citizens’ voices, Ou intended to further expose the unique old Beijing community lifestyle. He considered the lifestyle ‘the most valuable thing’ because it has remained unchanged since the 1990s (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). In the past 100 years, ‘local poor people, migrant workers, gay and other people in lower socioeconomic status lived here, constituting the slum or alternative cultural space in the city’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). With new media technology, such as portable digital video cameras and sound equipment, Ou planned to collaborate with a group of Dazhalan residents to record their lives, providing ‘an alternative perspective of history’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>

<title>The project as citizen media</title>
<sec id="section11-1742766512444341">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Sponsored by the German Federal Cultural Foundation, the project produced independent and non-profit media content and was operated by a group of volunteers. More than 10 volunteers were recruited through a notice published on the project website. Ou said that some joined the project midway, some quit halfway, and most worked whenever they had free time (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). As Huang said, they worked on a ‘decentralized’ organization basis (Huang Liguang, personal interview, March 2009). Sun Xiaoxi, Tan Tan, Huang Weikai and Huang Liguang were the most committed project members. During the four-month project span, the volunteers took photographs, filmed videos and recorded the sounds of Dazhalan community life.</p>
<p>With the project’s goal being to tell the story from the perspective of the Dazhalan residents, Ou called for a few Dazhalan residents to participate in the project. During the four-month time period, Ou and his team went to the neighborhood almost every day to talk with the residents and observe their daily lives. Many residents were invited to speak before the camera so that their voices – in raw form – could be included in the final media product. Not only did the volunteers interview people, the project team also distributed portable digital video cameras to some of the residents, encouraging them to film their lives during the demolition and relocation process. Zhang Jinli was one of the residents who received a video camera and he filmed his struggle with the government to preserve his house.</p>
<p>Most interviewees talked about the significance of the project in enabling the residents to express their opinions on the issue of demolition and relocation. ‘Those residents were eager to find a place to express their voices. The mainstream media was not available to them but ours was’ said Sun (Sun Xiaoxi, personal interview, February 2009). Tan also said that most of the Dazhalan residents lived in poverty and could not afford a video camera let alone have access to, or knowledge about, the Internet. Their socioeconomic situation explained why citizen media as an expression channel had never occurred to them prior to the project (Tan Tan, personal interview, February 2009). Like many participatory video projects practiced worldwide, the project provided the opportunity to make the residents’ voices heard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1742766512444341">
<title>The process</title>
<p>Ou mentioned ‘citizen media’ several times and insisted that he didn’t want to be ‘the agent’ of the citizens. To accomplish this, he did not give many filming instructions to Zhang: ‘We just told him two things. One was how to technically operate the video camera, and, secondly, to film segments of his daily life’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). Zhang confirmed that he could shoot at his discretion without restriction (Zhang Jinli, personal interview, February 2009). It turned out that his filmed footage became the main body of the documentary film, <italic>Meishi Street</italic>. Zhang thought that 80 percent of the final film represented his perspective, while the remaining 20 percent was edited and filmed by Ou and other volunteers (Zhang Jinli, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
<p>For distribution, Ou posted most of the produced materials on the project website, including pictures, sound and his own research articles about the area and the demolition and relocation issue. Even now that the project is over, Ou and some participants still follow the issue of the demolition and reconstruction in the Dazhalan area. They post related news as well as the mainstream media coverage of the project on their website. Since the 85-minute film was too large a file to be uploaded onto the website, Ou took the film to a variety of independent film festivals and screenings in China and abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1742766512444341">10</xref></sup> In addition, the team packaged all the project-produced media products in an artistic display and exhibited it at a number of museums worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1742766512444341">11</xref></sup> Ou said he did not want to be Zhang’s ‘agent’, so he brought Zhang to some film screenings to ‘let him directly talk with audiences’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
<p>Zhang speculated that his consistent struggle to advocate for his individual right to preserve his house was greatly encouraged by his involvement in the project.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At first, when I put up posters against the government, I felt scared when people from the official department shot me with their video cameras. Later on, I aimed my own video camera at those people who shot me. I felt <italic>empowered</italic>. I felt like I could record history as well. (Zhang Jinli, personal interview, February 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the project, Zhang even initiated his own blog to continue recording his conversation with the government, as well as his opinions on the issue of demolition and relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742766512444341">Zhang, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>On 15 July 2008, the website posted the news that, after three years of struggle, Zhang had finally achieved success and received a reconstructed house of the same value as his former Dazhalan home from the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742766512444341">Ou, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Citizen media in China</title>
<p>Tan indicated that the project could only be regarded as a rudimentary form of citizen media because ‘the Project relied on professionals organizing and editing’ (Tan Tan, personal interview, February 2009). She said that she and other volunteers had distributed video cameras to other residents, too, but the footage filmed by those residents had not been included in the final product (Tan Tan, personal interview, February 2009). Ou gave an example: There was a neighborhood committee<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1742766512444341">12</xref></sup> member who ‘only filmed good pictures’. She focused a lot on ‘good people and good deeds’ in a ‘mainstream TV station’s style’. Ou told her directly that the footage was ‘non-effective’ and thus would not be used in the project (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). However, almost every interviewee emphasized that professionals intervening or assisting was inevitable in the operation of citizen media at this moment in China. They insisted that citizen media required the collaboration of professionals and ordinary citizens because it was difficult for the latter to access economic and cultural resources.</p>

<sec id="section14-1742766512444341">
<title>The project’s frame building: Social justice frame</title>
<p>As mentioned before, the project produced: (1) an 85-minute documentary film called <italic>Meishi Street</italic>; (2) a website displaying reports on the issue of demolition and relocation, an image archive, sound documents and press coverage of the project; and (3) a brochure for distribution called <italic>The Story of Zhang Jinli</italic>. These media materials developed the primary frame of the issue – <italic>social justice</italic>, which comprised three themes: <italic>individual vs government, civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>.</p>
<p>The project suggests that the demolition and relocation in the Dazhalan area is bound up with issues of social justice. It implies that the government should have fully taken the interests of the ordinary citizens into account, in addition to considering urban renewal and economic development. In order to frame the issue from the perspective of social justice, the project focused on individual citizens living in Dazhalan and told the stories of demolition and relocation through the themes of <italic>individual vs government, civic engagement</italic> in the discussion of the issue, and the irrationality of <italic>gentrification</italic> of the area.</p>
<sec id="section15-1742766512444341">
<title>Individual vs government theme</title>
<p>An important aspect of the project’s perspective of social justice is that the government should have guaranteed fair treatment and impartiality when relocating the residents of the Dazhalan neighborhood. In the film, <italic>Meishi Street</italic>, contrasting images are often used to demonstrate the individuals’ dissatisfaction with the government’s failure in ensuring social justice. A scene that frequently appears in the film shows Zhang or his neighbors posting banners or flyers proclaiming the ‘unfair’ treatment they were receiving. The filmmakers have taken several lengthy shots of these banners/flyers, which say, ‘We petition the government to treat the common people with fairness and justice’. In contrast, the film also shows the government banners that read, ‘Relocating people in strict accordance with the law, promoting preservation of neighborhood features’.</p>
<p>Because the video camera was in Zhang’s control, his personal struggle with the government was depicted in detail. He always focused the camera on himself to record his personal actions of protest. The film shows the petition letters he wrote to the government, the banners/flyers he created and hung up outside, and his direct negotiations with government officials. Ou described one scene filmed by Zhang, in which Zhang has taken a lengthy shot of the postal receipts of his petition letters, as ‘genius’. An individual citizen’s consistent struggle with the government was vividly captured and communicated by the rows of receipts pasted on the wall (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
<p>The film didn’t explicitly attribute the responsibility for the problem’s cause or solution to the government. Instead, by depicting the residents’ continual failed efforts to advocate for their private property rights via official channels, the film illustrates the failure of the government in assuming its responsibility to deal with the issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1742766512444341">
<title>Civic engagement theme</title>
<p>According to the project, a public space was needed for civic engagement to discuss the issue. In Ou’s article, ‘City Regeneration and its Opposition’, he communicated the lesson of the Chongqing ‘nail house’ story and said that ‘if media had got involved earlier, opened more ways for residents to express themselves and made dialogues more accessible, then “the isolated island” incident might not have happened at all. (Citizens) might not have been forced to become lone fighters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742766512444341">Ou, 2010</xref>). As the article says, the project placed great emphasis on the expression of citizen voices. The project, as a type of citizen media, served as a forum where residents could express their ideas and opinions on the issue of demolition and relocation. The project’s volunteers interviewed many Dazhalan residents and let them speak freely before the camera and recount their personal stories (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
<p>What is more important, the filming process as conducted by Zhang, in his persona of ordinary citizen, is symbolic of his civic engagement in public discussion. A metaphoric scene occurs when a government department official attempts to shoot Zhang’s protest. In response, Zhang uses his own video camera to film the official’s filming process. In the interview, Zhang said that he felt empowered when the official tried to avoid being filmed (Zhang Jinli, personal interview, February 2009). When the two cameras confront each other in the film, it symbolizes the confrontation between citizen voices and official voices in a public space. Similarly, Ou said in the interview, ‘When we filmed the process of Zhang’s house being demolished, I saw it also being recorded by the Public Security Bureau, notary office, demolition company, and non-governmental history preservation groups as well as Zhang Jinli. I strongly feel that history should have a variety of versions, especially versions from ordinary citizens’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1742766512444341">
<title>Gentrification theme</title>
<p>As Ou illustrated, the goal of the project was to record community life in the Dazhalan area (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). In his article, Ou looked at many gentrification efforts worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742766512444341">Ou, 2010</xref>). Using these cases as a background, the project framed the issue of demolition and relocation in the Dazhalan area from the perspective of gentrification: urban developers have ruined the peaceful lives of residents with low socioeconomic status. In the project, the routine lives of the Dazhalan residents are depicted as poetic and full of vigor and humanism. On the website, 42 sound documents feature the routine day-to-day activities in the community. For instances, there are audio files such as ‘Residents bought apples’, ‘Sweeping fallen leaves’ and ‘The competition among snack stands’. The project attaches great value to these usually negligible and un-noteworthy sound pieces. ‘Dazhalan’s community life’, an article by Ou on the website, says that:
<disp-quote>
<p>slums or low-income communities are integral to a city structure, because poor people could be accommodated in these areas and live with lower costs. In this way, communities like Dazhalan help to buffer the identity crisis and potential conflict in the mainstream society … No matter if a citizen is rich or poor, native or from out-of-town, homosexual or heterosexual, he/she has the right to enjoy the city life. Dazhalan is a slum and houses there are old and shabby. However, its residents are always full of vigor. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742766512444341">Ou, 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The project portrays the beauty of the community life in Dazhalan and points out the rationality for the community’s existence in Chinese society. Thus, gentrification of the area is framed as an act that destroys social justice.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-1742766512444341">
<title>The project’s influence on mainstream media frame building</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742766512444341">Winfield and Peng’s (2005)</xref> typology of Chinese media organizations, all 30 reports covering the project belonged to the outer circles and fringe media organizations. For example, <italic>China Youth</italic> and <italic>The Economic Observer</italic> are two newspapers that boast of critical investigative journalism. Among all the reports, four are from industry magazines. These four were excluded from the analysis because they have narrower readerships. The author examined the remaining 26 news reports to decipher whether they were influenced by the <italic>social justice</italic> frame in terms of three themes – <italic>individual vs government, civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>.</p>
<p>The study found that most news reports focused on the Dazhalan Project, but mainly framed the project as a successful artwork. However, later articles contain discussions of the issue of demolition and relocation in the Dazhalan area from the perspective of <italic>civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>, as the project intended.</p>
<p>For instance, in the article, ‘The Dazhalan Project: Travel through the city’, the news lead presents the article as a description of a successful artwork that will be exhibited in New York. Nevertheless, the report focuses on the discussion of the demolition and relocation issue in its later part. Specifically, it refers to a US documentary, <italic>Hoop Dreams</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1742766512444341">13</xref></sup> and points out the significance of the project as a type of citizen media for disadvantaged people to express their views on the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742766512444341">B Lin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another typical example is ‘London experience: Say what you think’. The news report begins with the introduction of an international urban design forum, where Ou Ning gave a presentation on the project. In this report, the writer uses several paragraphs to introduce London’s case: ordinary citizens actively engaged in the public discussion of demolition and relocation due to the Olympics to be held in London in 2012. Against this backdrop, the news report presents the project as an unusual case in Beijing, which encourages <italic>civic engagement</italic>. In particular, the report ends with a cynical question raised by a Chinese participant in the international forum, ‘London citizens could say what they think, what about Beijing people?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512444341">He and Zen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to adopting the theme of <italic>civic engagement</italic>, some news reports also address the concerns about social justice as regards the area’s <italic>gentrification</italic>. What Ou Ning said is quoted in the article, ‘The Dazhalan Project: Travels through the city’: ‘[T]he valuable thing about the Dazhalan is its community lifestyle … I am not on the side of radical material protectionism in the slums. But social justice should be emphasized in the process of redistributing interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742766512444341">B Lin, 2006</xref>). Along the same lines, other news reports feature Ou Ning as a famous artist, but then discuss the project and the demolition and relocation issue using the theme of <italic>gentrification</italic>.</p>
<p>In other news reports that talked about the issue of demolition and relocation in general, the project is mentioned to add the frame of <italic>social justice</italic>. Because of the project, Ou Ning and his team, including the Dazhalan resident, Zhang Jinli, acquired access to ‘framing contests’ in the mainstream media (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444341">Carragee and Roefs, 2004</xref>). In the two articles, ‘Dazhalan: From life to memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742766512444341">Jiang, 2006</xref>) and ‘Dashilan<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1742766512444341">14</xref></sup> deadline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512444341">S Lin, 2006</xref>), there are several frames mainstream media usually use to cover the issue of demolition and relocation such as <italic>economic consequence</italic> and <italic>historical preservation.</italic> Notably, the mention of the Dazhalan Project contributes the frame of <italic>social justice</italic> to the articles. Zhang’s story and Ou’s comments are presented, which lead to a discussion of <italic>civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>.</p>
<p>However, the theme of <italic>individual vs government</italic> is discussed less as compared to the other two themes. Zhang’s direct resistance to the government as told in the film is seldom depicted in China’s mainstream media. For instance, after illustrating the themes of <italic>civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>, ‘The Dazhalan Project, tomorrow at Toronto’ says, ‘[T]he most successful reconstruction happened in the west of the city. The government not only promised that the area would not be demolished but also invested millions of RMB<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1742766512444341">15</xref></sup> in the infrastructure of the neighborhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512444341">Chen, 2006</xref>). A positive government image was portrayed in this article. In other words, discussions of the problems of the government in maintaining social justice are almost absent in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are other news reports, which portray the project as merely an artistic work, with only a brief mention of the demolition and relocation issue. In summary, the news articles under analysis demonstrate that the <italic>social justice</italic> frame developed by the project has influenced the mainstream media, but only to a limited extent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1742766512444341">
<title>What can citizen media do?</title>
<p>Based on the interview with Ou, a ‘turning point’ is needed for citizen media to influence the frame-building process of the mainstream media. He said the citizen media reports of the Chongqing ‘nail house’ story succeeded in attracting mainstream media attention because of two factors that constituted the turning point. First, the case occurred when the hot topic in media was the enactment of the Real Right Law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1742766512444341">16</xref></sup> which covers many aspects of the demolition and relocation issue. Secondly, the ‘isolated island’ picture mentioned before possessed an extremely strong visual effect. And its wide dissemination on the Internet won the attention of a great number of netizens. At that critical moment, mainstream journalists felt that it was ‘natural to use citizen media’s frame of the issue’, said Ou (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009).</p>
<p>Ou said that the Dazhalan Project helped create such a ‘turning point’. As Zhang recalled, before the project, quite a few mainstream media journalists stopped by the Dazhalan neighborhood and talked with him. ‘They showed interest but they said they could not cover my story’ (Zhang Jinli, personal interview, February 2009). In circumstances like this, journalists are willing to break through the official frame of some issues, while they always fail to do so under the party-state media system. As an artist-led citizen media project, the project’s success in the artistic field – numerous screenings or exhibitions worldwide – served as a news peg for the mainstream media, as Ou and Huang said in the interview. Ou said that they ‘operate the Project like an artwork, which blurs the sensitivity of the demolition and relocation issue’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). Therefore, a few concerned journalists could adopt the frames developed by the citizen media while circumventing the possible censorship. As the textual analysis has demonstrated, mainstream news coverage usually discusses the project’s artistic value first and then follows with an in-depth discussion of the issue of demolition and relocation.</p>
<p>In addition, all the interviewees suggested that it was a gradual and long-term process for citizen media to influence mainstream media frame building. A big turning point could be achieved because of citizens’ voices accumulated over time. In this regard, the project team members didn’t expect to influence the mainstream media frame building overnight. For instance, the theme of <italic>individual vs government</italic> is absent in mainstream media because of its controversial nature. Instead, as Ou mentioned, ‘we just wanted to add a brick to the building’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). The mainstream media attention is essentially a result of the ‘blowout’ of public opinion. And citizen media serves as a forum to gather public opinion.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that the Dazhalan Project as a type of citizen media can be regarded as a public arena for ‘interest expression’, an idea that has been promoted by the Chinese government since 2005. Against the party-state media system, the project provided a channel for the Dazhalan residents to express their opinions on the issue of demolition and relocation in their neighborhood. Moreover, some participant residents were empowered by using media technology to film their own stories of being relocated – a means of recording history through their own perspectives.</p>
<p>The analysis of the project’s media products and the mainstream news stories further suggests that citizen media could influence mainstream media’s frame building, although in a very limited way. In particular, as a typical artist-led citizen media project, the project’s success in the artistic field served as an attractive news peg for many journalists who decided to cover it. Most of the articles adopted the project’s intended social justice frame from the perspectives of <italic>civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>. Moreover, in the news articles that reported the demolition and relocation issue in general, the mention of the project contributed the discussion of social justice to the other frames usually used by the mainstream media. That a number of newspapers were able to cover the Dazhalan Project and analyze the demolition and relocation issue critically might also be due to the liberal atmosphere before the Beijing Olympics, when attention worldwide was focused on Beijing.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, most of the news articles framed the project mainly as an artwork and used its intended frame only much later. Furthermore, another important theme – <italic>individual vs government</italic> – was almost absent from the mainstream news coverage due to its controversial nature. In other words, the impact of citizen media on mainstream media’s frame building is apparent, but far from significant. As scholars in framing studies illuminate, a challenge to official framing of the issue is the challenge to hegemonic social values (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444341">Gitlin, 2003</xref>). Zhao thus insists that the reformers inside the Chinese government will be crucial to any future democratic movement in Chinese media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742766512444341">Zhao, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the study suggests that the operation of the project as a type of citizen media and its influence in society seems to rely on two levels of collaboration in the context of mainland China. The current study presents evidence for the first level of collaboration – the collaboration between professionals and ordinary citizens. It is demonstrated in the study that professionals and ordinary citizens collaborated in framing the demolition and relocation issue in the themes of <italic>individual vs government, civic engagement</italic> and <italic>gentrification</italic>, which constitute the core <italic>social justice</italic> frame of the issue. The project leaders, two professional artists, packaged the project as an artwork and made it known worldwide by putting it out on the Internet and presenting it at various exhibitions and screenings all over the world. One debate in citizen media studies is to what extent it is appropriate for professionals to intervene in citizen media projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444341">Atton, 2002</xref>). One side holds that citizen media should be operated independently of professionals. According to this view, professionals’ involvement would impact the authentic presentation of citizens’ voices. But Ou does not think so. He commented on the project in the interview, ‘[W]e advocate for independent attitude; but we are not opposing against professionalism’ (Ou Ning, personal interview, February 2009). And he suggested that this level of collaboration was necessary for the project’s success. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444341">Carragee and Roefs (2004)</xref> point out, attention should be focused on the unequal resource distribution of different frame sponsors. Without the professionals’ organizing skills, it would have been impossible for the Dazhalan residents to access the news media, let alone influence the frame-building process of the mainstream media journalists. For people in poverty, a video camera is in no way superior to other communication forms since it is still more expensive and less readily available, and the technology cannot guarantee the craft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444341">Garnham, 1990</xref>). In a similar way, Ou argued that cooperation among different social classes was important for citizen voices to reach the public. This is because, under China’s current social conditions, a great number of citizens in the lower socioeconomic class lack the economic and cultural resources to express their interests.</p>
<p>The other possible level of collaboration is between citizen media practitioners and concerned journalists. Due to the limited space of this study, the researcher didn’t have a chance to conduct in-depth interviews with the mainstream media journalists who wrote about the project. As such, evidence to illustrate the second level of collaboration is inadequate. However, as the interviews with the project’s practitioners demonstrated, initially, some concerned journalists were interested in the case, but were not able to report it because they feared possible media censorship. Ou thus thought that the Dazhalan Project provided a ‘turning point’ for a few journalists to cover the issue of demolition and relocation and use some alternative frames. This possible collaboration is unique due to the party-state media system. The autonomy of a journalist is largely questionable within this system and the general social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444341">Gitlin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742766512444341">Luther and Miller, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is possible for some journalists to rely on citizen media, which provides a ‘turning point’ for them to realize their autonomy to an extent. They ‘adopt the strategy of “making circuit” within the system’ to ‘constructively refuse’ the system censorship of controversial topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742766512444341">Lu and Pan, 2002</xref>). In this sense, citizen media appears to be performing a valuable function in aiding mainstream media to perform the ‘watchdog’ role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742766512444341">Xin, 2010</xref>). In other words, some mainstream journalists might ‘cooperate’ with citizen media practitioners in framing the issue in an alternative way.</p>
<p>Future research should combine insights from both citizen media practitioners and mainstream media journalists to explore the second level of collaboration and then further examine in what way citizen media can influence mainstream media frame building.</p>
